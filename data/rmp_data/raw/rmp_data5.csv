0,"people are just being hard on Robert because he teaches hard classes, whenever I have a class with Robert and my friends have the same class with someone else I end up having more fun, learning it better, and better grade (my friends are smarter than me) he is incredibly carrying and is very accessible. overall amazing guy! hard class, amazing guy",5.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
1,The course was difficult but he is always available outside of class time. He truly cares about his students and is extremely helpful. He relates class material to physics which is great for me since I am a physics major. Theres a lot work to put in if you want a good grade but it is attainable. Fair marker and he provides lots of practice.,5.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
2,"Robert's classes can be hard; he covers a lot of stuff and sometimes expects a lot of work. Assignments and midterms can be difficult and he doesn't grade easily. However he is a really good teacher, and extremely helpful and understanding. His classes are far from easy but they'll leave you with good understanding. He is very helpful and friendly.",5.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
3,"He flies through the lectures so it is impossible to watch them live. I spend numerous hours weekly going through the recorded lectures trying to understand, but I swear he explains things knowing he is making no sense and just does not care. I have always loved math but prof Van Den Hoogen is making me question that. His tests are also so hard!!",1.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
4,Robert's teaching method is not good. He can also make you feel kinda stupid if you go to office hours. It almost makes me scared to go to him for help even though I'm doing horrible in the class. Avoid having this teacher it's so hard to be successful. Tests are so so so hard.,1.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
5,Terrible. His tests are very inefficient from the student perspective and every time I send him an email for help he comes back with the super dry response telling me to figure it out. He makes it unreasonably hard to understand everything because of how fast he rips through the content. Avoid this guy at all costs.,1.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
6,"Guy is a joke, tests are unreasonable. Avoid his class!",1.0,5.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
7,"Robert has to be one of the worst professors I have ever had. Linear Algebra is a tough course in general, but his lectures never make any sense. He rarely finishes his examples, so there's nothing to go off of when preparing for tests or assignments. He's terrible at explaining things and makes you feel stupid in class. Avoid him if you can.",2.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
8,"Great guy but teaches so fast that it can be hard to keep up. Weekly quizzes were super hard and the exam was even harder. He definitely knows his stuff, but trying to process it all can be overwhelming.",2.0,5.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
9,"He's definitely enthusiastic about what he's teaching but he makes so many mistakes. Mistakes in the powerpoint, mistakes during class exercises, even made a mistake on an online quiz once making everyone get it wrong. He rushes a lot in class so often students leave feeling confused. He's an alright guy, but overall he was very frustrating.",1.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
10,"Great prof!! made class interesting, was easy to understand and funny too. very enthusiastic about math, definately take him for calculus. do the assignments and the exams wont be hard",4.5,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
11,A good prof for stats. HK students have to take him. Not too hard and weekly quizzes force you to study and keep up. Do the homework.,4.0,3.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
12,"Best class in 4 years of classes at STFX.  Knows his stuff, and tries to make everyone in the class appreciate all aspects of both mathematics and physics.",4.5,5.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
13,He is a nice guy. He taught a lot better than Apaloo I thought. I could understand calc much better with him. I think his quizzes are a lot easier than his exams. Just pay attention and take notes should do fine even though I got a 55 but I passed.,3.0,3.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
14,Do the assignments yourself and you won't even have to study for midterms/exams.  keep up with the homework too.,5.0,1.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
15,"nuts. Gotta love him. The pose he makes when he thinks of a problem, he looks as if hes getting his portrait drawn. you guys will know what i mean. he cracks me up and he's always willing to help out. never ever seen a person with that much enthusiasim for math tho. great",4.0,2.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
16,Great prof!,5.0,4.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
17,"This guy is halarious....but he knows what he's talking about. His enthusiasm also helps you to stay awake during those early 8:15s. He is organized, helpful & motivating...Take him for stats!!!",5.0,2.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
18,"Great Prof! The most enthusiastic person I ever saw teach math! Very easy to talk to, and is always willing to help! Tests are always fair and he is a really good marker. If you can take a course from him you should! Best prof ever!",5.0,2.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
19,"he is a really good teacher, def. my fav. teacher since i've been here he really tries to make everyone understand and is very approachable i enjoy this class it's my highest mark",4.5,2.0,Robert Van Den Hoogen
20,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken, don't waste your time taking this as a gen ed or even in general. The professor is not understanding at all when it comes to grading and attendance. Extremely disorganized.",1.0,4.0,Ventura Perez
21,"He's a little intimidating in knowledge/stature but in reality he's super sweet, just a little braggy. Don't fall behind on the readings- they seem like a lot but just skim them for info. He grades easy on papers and just wants you to show that you know the material. His lectures are awesome, his teaching style is very anti-hand-holding. Loved it!",5.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
22,"He does not usually teach freshmen, so since I had him as one my opinion may be skewed. Nice guy, really knows his stuff about violence and archaeology. Was never rude or condescending in any way, but somewhat intimidating. He tried to promote student discussion most classes over him lecturing which was nice though.",3.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
23,Perez was never available when I needed help and he made a lot of comments during class that were straight up wrong. One of the worst profs I've had at Umass,1.0,4.0,Ventura Perez
24,"Fascinating guy who cares about his students. Our class was mostly reading articles as homework and discussing them in class. No exams/quizzes besides the midterm and final. I'm not an anthro major but he made the class interesting and fun. Fair warning his ancient civ class is more of an archaeology class (leans towards science, not history)",5.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
25,"Perez is a great teacher and an even better person. If anyone is looking for an LGBTQ friendly teacher, this guy is it. He covers a ton of super important info, and it goes way further than just ancient civilizations. However, be ready to read, cause there's a lot of reading for every class. Stay on top of it and you'll do fine!",5.0,4.0,Ventura Perez
26,"everything the reviewer before me said. prof was extremely disorganized and had a terrible attitude, especially towards female students. I'll never take a class with Perez again.",1.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
27,"Abysmal pedagogy, prioritizes insinuations against students' intelligence over rectifying academic misunderstandings. No room for difference in academic opinion. Completely inaccessible outside of class. Has his grad students do all his work for him. Extraordinarily self oriented, considers his own research methods to be the only right way.",1.0,4.0,Ventura Perez
28,"Not many lectures, but the material is very engaging. This class will broaden your perspective of forensic science no matter how much you may already know, & hes extremely knowledgeable about forensics and violence theory in general. Taphonomy Lab trips and engaging group projects are both great. The course was graded fairly, would recommend.",5.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
29,"The class isn't lecture heavy, but the material was way more interesting than expected, and pretty enjoyable. He is extremely knowledgeable on the topic and a great recourse. The class was pretty hands on with trips to lab and such. Grading was always fair. The syllabus changed only in our favor, i.e. pushing back due dates. Overall I learned a lot",5.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
30,"Dr. Perez did a great job at relating the current events unfolding in today's society and applying them in the classroom setting. I found the class very interesting and hands on, which is a plus in my book. The class is not homework heavy, rather it gives a great look into the world of forensics as a whole. I definitely recommend taking this class.",4.0,2.0,Ventura Perez
31,"He may have been a great professor 10 years ago, but has gotten incredibly lazy since. I learned absolutely nothing in this class, there was only 1 lecture the entire semester. Interesting activities promised like trips to the lab never happened. Feedback was minimal if we ever got any. He was my least favorite professor in my entire UMass career.",1.0,2.0,Ventura Perez
32,"For someone who constantly bragged about how important he was, he was an abysmal professor. He constantly changed the coursework and poorly explained the class. He always showed up late, left early, was rarely prepared for class, his lectures were full of falsehoods, and he was completely inaccessible outside of class. His apathy was ridiculous.",1.0,3.0,Ventura Perez
33,Professor Perez cares only about himself and his research. Throughout the semester  he has lectured a total of ONE time. He expects us to teach ourselves and does not give us feedback. His grad students give us minimal feedback a month and a half after the assignment was due. He shows up 10 to 15 minutes late to every lecture and is inaccessible.,1.0,2.0,Ventura Perez
34,"want a professor with experience in violence? He's the guy. BUT very difficult to reach after class. Makes you read a lot but mostly to discuss in class. Very discussion heavy. No homework other than final 15 pg paper, but don't worry he makes it seem more serious than it actually is. He's a great reference, if you can reach him.",3.0,2.0,Ventura Perez
35,"This class is a lot of work for a Gen Ed, but very worth it. I'm not an anthro major, and I don't know much about Anthro, but I learned a lot in this class. You have to do 30 hours of community service and write a 20-25 page paper applying violence theory to your experience, but with all the material you cover in class, it's not to difficult to do.",4.5,4.0,Ventura Perez
36,"Great guy, but the amount of papers he had us do was not worth a 200 level class and doesn't realize students are taking other classes. half way through the semester I stopped looking at the syllabus because he kept changing things. he also has you write a 8-10 page research paper at the end worth 35% of your grade using 15 sources ",3.0,5.0,Ventura Perez
37,"This was by far the best class I have ever taken. It was incredibly difficult, but I have never wanted to work so hard for a good grade. He is a great guy, very helpful if you are willing to ask and put in the effort. If you are dedicated to this class you absolutely won't regret the work!",4.5,4.0,Ventura Perez
38,"Ventura's awesome.  He can be a hard ass, but he can also be a big softy.  He very intelligent and knows what he's talking about.  He can be your friend as well as your professor.",5.0,4.0,Ventura Perez
39,Ventura is a real pain in the -. I don't know why I like him so much.,4.5,5.0,Ventura Perez
40,"EDUC 613 is the MTEL prep course EVERY history major who wants to become a teacher should take because Bob makes sure you're ready.

64,"He doesn't teach his classes, he tells stories. And he tells the same stories over and over again. The actual course content is usually interesting - good books, etc, but he doesn't teach on it very often. It's a shame because he's not such a bad professor when he does.",2.0,2.0,Mark Amstutz

68,"Although I enjoyed the course & curriculum, Dr. Amstutz is not a kind or helpful professor. He had clear favorites in the class/dept (those who interned for CIA, etc.) and despite the fact that I was a high performer in his class, I did not feel respected or valued as a learner, & he was not personable or approachable when I visited office hours.",1.5,3.0,Mark Amstutz

71,"Amstutz is an interesting prof who takes some getting used to. He tells stories A LOT, some of them more applicable than others. I wish he used the readings more in class, since they ARE on the test. He is extremely caring, and realizes that his subject isn't the only important thing in life, which is nice. He was worth taking for a class.",3.5,3.0,Mark Amstutz
72,"Dr. Amstuz' classes require work, but they are manigible.  Like others have said, he teaches through stories.  And reading the text is mandatory. He's a great guy and offers great advice and cares for students. Do a dine with a mind with him.",4.0,4.0,Mark Amstutz

81,"Dr. Walters was an awesome professor, and he made a gen-ed class really fun!

You can tell he wants all his students to succeed, and he cares about the well-being of his students deeply.",4.0,3.0,Peter Walters
82,"This prof's curriculum, philosophy of fitness, and understanding of appropriate cultural norms are dated at best.

He is a very entertaining and knowledgeable man who clearly cares about his students.",5.0,2.0,Peter Walters
100,He posted the PowerPoints and 1-2 readings online before class to take notes off. A lot of videos to watch. In class the lectures were more conversational than teaching. He wants people to talk and participate. Tests were open note and internet. Super easy if you take notes in class and on the PowerPoints. He's really nice and funny though.,5.0,2.0,Kevin Reynolds
101,"Reynolds is a sweet guy and the content was interesting. Tests were not bad if you showed up to the review sessions and went through the material. We had 2 written tests, 1 MC, 6 quizzes.

102,This class was great because there wasn't a lot of work and everything was open notes but my biggest complaint is that this class was supposed to be 100% asynchronous but he would pick random times every 3 three weeks to lecture and then not record them for people who couldn't be there. Could not tell you what this class was about but it worked out,3.0,2.0,Kevin Reynolds

The content for the class is really bland, you spend most classes looking at pictures and analyzes short movie clips/ads in how it relates to the class.

Make sure you read the online readings for the test.  ",3.5,3.0,Kevin Reynolds

116,"The broadness of the 301 curriculum could have been pretty boring, but Reynolds is a good lecturer and a cool guy. Attendance isn't taken but it'll make your life a lot easier to go to class. It's not an easy A, but study and skim the readings, and you'll do fine.",4.0,4.0,Kevin Reynolds

118,"Class was boring, teacher was fun. We would go through one another's screenplays-in-process and give feedback, so he would focus all attention on that, leaving you to watch videos on mute or do homework on your laptop. Very easy work. You can get into it if you're interested. DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK! We never used it. Reynolds is a fun, nice guy.",4.5,1.0,Kevin Reynolds
119,SMAD 251 AND 301. Let's just say I have a crush on him and I wouldn't be ashamed if he knew it. SMAD 251 is cool and a fun class but if you have written/read a script before then you don't really learn too much. 301 is late but only one day a week. Turner is deathly boring so take Reynolds. He really facilitates discussion and we look at clips,5.0,3.0,Kevin Reynolds
120,"This mans is retiring so I doubt anyone will be looking at this, but hoping him the best. Hated the class because I'm not a good film director at ALL, but he was very good at explaining stuff. Knows his cameras. Wishing him the best",5.0,1.0,Tom McHardy
121,I did not like this Professor McHardy. He always was looking for one specific answer to open-ended questions and would cut people off if it wasn't what he wanted. His lectures were not intellectually challenging at all and I was bored in most lectures. Wasn't that hard of a class and I think he has good intentions but not my favorite class for sure,3.0,3.0,Tom McHardy
122,"The amount of work you have to put in outside of class is absolutely absurd. He expects everyone to be professional videographers even though this is an intro class. He is flexible with meeting outside of class in order to receive feedback, however, his feedback on all of the projects is quite condescending. Do NOT take him!",2.0,4.0,Tom McHardy
123,This was his first semester teaching 202 which is why I think he went easy on grading. Keep up with readings because he doesn't always announce quizzes. Drops lowest quiz grade. Had to work with a partner for 3/4 projects and you get maybe 2 weeks to do each of them. Tests aren't that bad. The projects and homework are the stressful part.,3.0,3.0,Tom McHardy
124,The actual class simple but the projects are difficult. Mchardy is caring and helpful if you are respectful and put in effort. He gives tough feedback but you learn from it. I recommend him for this class.,4.0,4.0,Tom McHardy

127,I was really disappointed by this class. For a 300 level SMAD class it was an extreme disappointment we only learned imovie and wordpress. I feel I gained absolutely nothing from this class. The assignments were petty af and we had a lot of stuff we had to do for no credit. It was a major waste of time and he grades you down for really petty stuff.,2.0,1.0,Tom McHardy
128,He's really knowledgeable about what he teaches and is firmly rooted in teaching through experiences. Your grade is basically a LOT of out of class work with some reading quizzes but he offers extra credit and is open to helping if you ask for it. He's pretty chill and I would definitely take this class again if I could!,3.5,4.0,Tom McHardy
129,"He's a professor that you need to have like you in order of you to like him, otherwise, he'll grade you even harder than he already does.  His tests can be confusing somethings, but to me, he's a nice guy and I enjoy his classes.  I don't seem to do as well in them as I feel like I should be, but I don't hate going to class.

131,"One of my least favorite professors I've had at JMU. Not very respectful to students, very boring, and you leave with memorized knowledge, not improved ability in the field.

133,"I haven't learned a single thing yet, requires attendance but teaches nothing, class is a huge waste of time.  Made us buy book, it was confusing and useless.

136,"Excellent professor. Knows what he's doing and explains it very well. He offers many bonus points. He does criticize at times, but it's only to make you a better videographer in a professional world. Nice, funny, and down-to-Earth. You do several projects, tests, and readings, but it's worth every bit in the end.",5.0,2.0,Tom McHardy
137,"He's a pain in the ass but you will learn from him, whether you want to or not. He believes in the ""learning hurts"" motto. He knows his stuff and he's willing to help but not too much.",2.5,3.0,Tom McHardy

141,You only have 3 projects & 2 tests that make up your grade & due dates were often pushed back by a week.

Not getting grades back for weeks would be my biggest draw back (we only have 35% of our final grade in during finals),4.0,2.0,Steven Anderson

143,"Anderson's 407 class honestly wasn't too hard, but it was very boring most of the time. His voice can lull you to sleep, but he did have some good things to say if you decided to pay attention.

144,"This guy is very particular about the stuff he covers and how the student executes the material taught. Also the reasoning behind deducting points on website projects are often interesting...

146,Great teacher. Super flexible with due dates and helpful with problems.,4.5,2.0,Steven Anderson
147,We only had 3 website projects the entire semester and really spent time doing nothing. We had 1 test and and 1 final. Most of the people got D's on the 1st test bc we didn't take it seriously bc it was random stuff from lyndacom that he assigned and the random 2 lectures he gave. He is very understanding of time constraints & will work with you. ,2.5,3.0,Steven Anderson
148,"Dr. Anderson is my experience with SMAD Converged Media encapsulated in a person. He's very kind-hearted and has great intentions on getting you up to speed on web/app development, but you'll honestly learn more doing projects on your own than being in class. It also appears like he hasn't updated the curriculum in 10 years, which is bothersome.",1.5,2.0,Steven Anderson
149,"He shouldn't be teaching any courses. Surprisingly as a Dr., he has a poor sense of managing his work between head director and a professor -let alone just trying to direct the dept.

168,Definitely need to do the homeworks in order to understand the material. Very nice person and a helpful professor but not always clear.

Pretty easy class,3.0,2.0,Boris Goldfarb
169,Nice guy. Make sure that you do the homework because the quizzes are worth 60%.  Problems are discussed in class. He also drops the lowest 2 of the first 14 quizzes.

227,"Dr. Haghshenas is an admirable professor that truly cares for his students. There is A LOT of reading and some of them can be difficult to understand.. His lectures are great and he and the TAs are more than happy to clarify concepts. Tests can be specific so make sure you read everything, go to lectures, watch documentaries and group presentations",4.0,3.0,Medhi Haghshenas
228,"His lectures were interesting and I learned a lot about societal issues. Tests were short answers and multiple choice; to do well, you have to read a lot of material and he would also ask questions about videos he showed in class. He offered one extra credit but other professors are definitely easier than him because his class is not an easy A.",3.0,4.0,Medhi Haghshenas
229,"I took SOC302 with Medhi... He is such a wonderful and caring individual. As for the course content, most of it is pretty intuitive, so if you go to class/discussion and skim/get the main idea from the readings, you'll be good! There is one required group presentation but it was really chill. Not much commitment for this class but you learn a lot!",5.0,2.0,Medhi Haghshenas

231,"Prof. Haghshenas was an absolutely amazing professor. He is obviously passionate about his subject matter and for his students.

233,Professor Haghshenas isn't a bad professor. His lectures are very entertaining. He is very accessible after class. The test questions on the other hand can be very tricky especially if you don't know the material. I recommend to always see the TA's and make sure that you are understanding the material and you should receive an easy A,4.0,3.0,Medhi Haghshenas
234,"Medhi is clearly passionate about teaching, but his grading style is a bit harsh and he is a bit odd. Very personal and touchy with everyone.

235,Haghshenas is the best!! His lectures are awesome and the TA's do a great job of teaching in discussion sections.

Bonus: lots of cool documentaries shown in class!,5.0,2.0,Medhi Haghshenas

I LOVE PROF KELLY!",5.0,2.0,William Kelly
239,"Took Kelly for a Plan II Seminar on Criminal Justice Reform and he was amazing. Such a knowledgeable, funny guy who really cares about his subject.

Highly recommend!",5.0,2.0,William Kelly
240,"This was my favorite class of freshman year. Kelly is insanely knowledgeable about criminal justice and each class was just a discussion, but I learned so much in the class.

245,"Prof Kelly's course is great to take. I found it fairly easy. Many of the questions on the test are common sense if you listen to him or read the book. He assigns a textbook and his own book. I did find his own book hard to get through at times. He is also very fair- he missed classes and as a result, made the fourth test optional to take!",5.0,2.0,William Kelly
246,"Hi, first of all... TAKE THIS CLASS. If you either show up to lectures or read Dr. Kelly's book (HIS book is our textbook), you will get an A.

249,"Kelly is really into criminal justice but this class is just SO BORING. He reads off of a sheet of paper that you get to copy down before he starts talking so you can just goof off while he talks.

250,"I liked this class. I feel like I learned a LOT of very practical knowledge about the criminal justice system. As others have said, he can get repetitive, but honestly, it actually helps because then you'll really know stuff for exams. Also, the TAs write the exams, not him. I felt our exams were fair and not bad at all if you just went to class.",4.0,3.0,William Kelly
251,"Dr. Kelly definitely gets repetitive sometimes and the lectures can be a bit boring. Overall the class is pretty easy and the tests are fair.

He really cares about the content that he is presenting and it is interesting overall.",4.0,2.0,William Kelly

257,Professor Hartung is a good teacher but she speaks only Spanish throughout the class so you really need to pay attention to understand what she is saying and if you've never had any kind of Spanish class before it could be difficult to catch on.

Very liberal on his testing methods, but the tests are inclusive ",4.5,4.0,Daniel White
487,"Orgo I is a hard class no matter what, but this prof makes it harder by solely grading based off tests. No homework or EC.

Best way to pass is READ THE BOOK!!",2.0,4.0,Seth Elsheimer
488,"I heard this guy wasnt great but I can easily say that he wasnt a very helpful teacher.

496,Dr. Elsheimer is a great guy! I got an A because I worked hard + consistently from day 1. His PowerPoints do not go as in-depth as his exams are which I disliked. So I studied using the textbook.

498,Dr. Elsheimer is a great professor. He emphasizes understanding the concepts over memorization. If you read the book and listen to his lectures you will get a decent grade.

654,"Smart guy, he's been teaching this course for ages so he knows it inside out. Very willing to answer questions and he drops dry humor every now and then during lectures to keep everyone entertained. Make sure you go to the lectures as he explains some difficult concepts in the course very well",5.0,3.0,Patrice Belleville
655,Patrice is obviously very knowledgable on the topics taught in CPSC 121 but the lectures are quite slow paced and the course timeframe is way longer than it needs to be. He will give almost too much time for clicker questions or to think about problems. This course could easily be completed in 2-3 months. Lectures do help to clarify concepts though,4.0,3.0,Patrice Belleville
656,Maybe good for CPSC 121 but not for 320. He basically spends class time on useless worksheets that are either too easy or too vague compared to the tough exams they give. Doesn't teach ANYTHING in the class. Then you have to spend hours on YT and with a huge textbook to learn some basic stuff. No coding which should have had. Nothing like 221,1.0,5.0,Patrice Belleville

Very helpful during office hours, he knows what he is doing.",5.0,4.0,Patrice Belleville
659,His lectures are dry and confusing. I went to another prof's review and regretted not attending another section all term.

He can be very lenient. Don't bother asking him ""do you even lift?"" The answer is yes.",4.0,2.0,George Tsiknis
680,"Overall very nice guy. Test heavy and quizzes every 1-2 weeks, gives HW but its optional, drops the lowest quiz grade, and is not that bad when it comes to partial credit.

No class interactions whatsoever. Released the instructions for the essay way to late.,1.0,4.0,Hilliard Aronovitch
1204,The prof is extremely knowledgeable but unfortunately not everything is as easy to grasp. You need to take additional notes in addition to the notes on the slide and he goes really fast. Also does not post lectures on brightspace,3.0,4.0,Hilliard Aronovitch
1205,"Professor Hilliard is very knowledgeable and wants his students to understand. He however, will lecture very intensely and his grading scheme is quite difficult.

Assignments are clear, and evaluations fair and generous.",5.0,2.0,Hilliard Aronovitch

1337,Ramirez is overall tough (but somewhat reasonable) but I really solidified my foundational knowledge of Java in this class. I know I wouldn't be doing as well right now had I chose a different professor for data structures. It was my hardest class up to that point but in the long run it benefitted me w/o a doubt. I like his flipped class approach.,4.0,3.0,John Ramirez
1338,"As a non-CS major, this class was very hard for me. He has two exams where it is VERY easy to lose points and it's based on little things he mentioned in his PowerPoint slides. The projects were difficult but doable, definitely took a lot of time. I wouldn't take him if your goal is to get a good grade, but if you want a deep understanding hes good",2.0,4.0,John Ramirez
1339,"The projects feel unnecessarily tough with methods that go into far greater detail of a specific topic than in lecture.

1342,"Since we are online due to covid, he actually uses more time than what would be in person giving less time to work on HW. Tests require you to know how methods he never teaches, exactly work.

1343,"His lectures were very clear and his projects were realistic and fun.

1355,"Ramirez is an all around excellent prof, but he has higher expectations and the later projects and labs can be difficult.

Just do the homework and you'll be fine.",3.0,3.0,George Novacky

Turn in anything late and he takes off all the points.,2.5,5.0,Doug Ziegenfuss

1469,He is a good teacher with a nice sense of humor. He gives study guides and lots of extra credit opportunities.  Tests are mc & essays.

1799,Mary Pashley is in the top 3 of my worst professors of all time. Her lectures are very example heavy yet they never relate to the material on an exam.

Homeworks are optional, but they help.",5.0,2.0,Tram Neill

Do not take if it's online.",1.0,3.0,Bruce Seifert
2254,"First and foremost, do NOT take this class online. This subject is far too difficult for an online course.

Sadly he is the only one for this class.",2.0,5.0,Bruce Seifert

He grades the test problems toughly but if you understand the material you will be fine.",4.5,3.0,Bruce Seifert

2826,Ann Somers is the best. Take this class if your not a BIO major. She connects the material to non-science people. Clear expectations but you have to pay attention. Comes off as stubborn (and she is) and a little rude at first - but she is very compassionate and caring and passionate and funny and kind. Go to SIP sessions. Take good notes. Just try.,5.0,3.0,Ann Somers
2827,"I was kind of worried by reading past reviews but, she's a really good teacher! She loves questions and explains things thoroughly.

I definitely learned a lot from her.",5.0,3.0,Ann Somers
2828,"BIO105 is tough, but if you turn up to all the lectures and study you should be fine.

2830,"I'm not sure why everyone hates Ms. Somers. She really is a solid choice, if you pay attention in class and use the resources she provided the class is a breeze.

2930,"Dr. Goods class is very boring, and his quizzes are focused on the smallest details. His tests are somewhat better. You have to come to class to even be able to pass and show that you care about the class. Homework assignments are super long and hard to understand. However, he has great office hours, and really helps if you have any questions.",2.0,3.0,Robert Good
2931,His class is deadly boring but the papers and tests are easy if you listen to his detailed lectures. He's a nice guy but his class is SO BORING! Also you read a ton but you can finesse your way out of it most times. Easy A as long as you do your work.,4.0,3.0,Robert Good

2934,"Dr. Robert Good is a very friendly teacher! His classes are not difficult, however, his lectures are incredibly dry and boring.

But again, he's nice and easy.",2.5,3.0,Robert Good

2938,"This is a very difficult class. I managed to get an A, however, it was NOT easy. You must know the material like the back of your hand, or you're doomed.

Stick with it though, and you will leave knowing a LOT more than when you came in.",3.5,5.0,Robert Good

Never gives student's a page with project expectations, just rambles about them during class and changes them every other day. Extremely unprofessional, waste of time.",1.0,4.0,Joel Knocke
2971,"Professor Knocke can use improvement on getting his point across on his assignments. There should be more structure on the days when he teaches, checks work, and his overall use of time. He will go over the same steps for two days, and most of the students are moving on while he talks, or skipping his class because they are already ahead.",1.0,4.0,Joel Knocke

You won't need the textbook but if you are disabled or new to graphic design I would recommend taking notes.,5.0,3.0,Joel Knocke
2975,He doesn't hand out a syllabus and expects you to go on concourse to look it up. I honestly did not enjoy his class very much and he talks in a very low voice and it's hard to hear if you're not sitting in front of the room. He is also bland and hasn't answer my phone calls and I told him it's the best way to reach me not to email me which he did.,1.5,4.0,Joel Knocke

2998,She is a very great professor. She will help you if you message you. Great class if you like to give your opinion for discussion topics. Several essays not too harsh.

Of you are late she takes off many points and absent, even more. Had all As before this class",4.5,5.0,George Ann Simpson

I would definitely recommend her!",5.0,2.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3054,"Dr. Blandino made me love Spanish even more when I had her. She's always engaging with her students and truly cares about them.

I recommend her to everyone.",3.0,2.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3055,Dr. Blandino was a fantastic professor! Her lectures are awesome because she's so funny during them. If you know some French then this class will not be too hard at all. The exams are honestly fairly easy and the homework is too!,5.0,2.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3056,"Dr. Blandino's class is quick paced, so make sure you pay attention! It's all memorization, but not too hard. The most difficult part of the class is knowing when your next test is because Dr. Blandino is scatterbrained and can be a bit unclear.",4.0,2.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3057,"I had Dr. Blandino for review Spanish, Spanish I and Spanish II. She is a great teacher and is very nice. One thing I do not like is how test happy she is. Expect a test or quiz once a week. She can be hard to follow at times because she tries to get everything covered in time but as long as you stay on top of studying you'll be fine.",4.0,3.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3058,What can I say about Blandino? She is the sweetest most caring professor on campus. She is always trying to help her students pass the class. She recognizes when students are putting in genuine effort and has a good relationship with all students. Her grading is very fair and pushes her students to study like no other. She is basically mom!!!,4.5,2.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3059,Love this woman! Took parts 1 and 2 of Spanish over the 6 week summer course and loved every minute.

If she sees you putting in the effort she will take note even if she doesn't say anything. ,5.0,4.0,Dr. Doreen Blandino
3060,"Blandino can be a wild card. She has always been helpful when I needed it but I have also seen her give other students a hard time.

3100,Funny guy. He likes to make class fun. Covers a lot of chapters for each test so it's hard to know what's going to be on them. They are short so if you miss too many you get a low grade. Study the powerpoints. He passes around attendance sheet. Gives pop quizzes but usually gives you a hint the day before. No homework but there is a paper. ,3.0,3.0,John Keeling
3101,I walked out of his class the first day. I was in my 40''s and new to ODU and was about 60 seconds late for class so he mocked my watch-reading abilities and then found several other reasons to zero in on me during the class.

Learned a lot and would recommend.,4.0,3.0,Peter McCormick

Study questions are short answer on exams",2.0,3.0,Peter McCormick

I would recommend the course and recommend McCormick. Well done.",3.0,3.0,Peter McCormick

You will get the toughest ones.,2.5,5.0,James Wang

4252,"Wang is very egotistical. No matter which class you have, you get to hear about his 10-year-old pet project ALIPR. In fact, most of the class will be based on image recognition only.

4259,Honestly a great professor. Make sure you take good notes (you can afford to miss a few classes but still) since they way she phrases some stuff on the tests can be slightly different from how they are explained in class.

4260,"Missing this class is not a good idea. She springs these small little assignments during class that you can only do if you attended.

4463,"Like many have already stated here, Jim Rexius is the best teacher Ive ever had. I still share some of the stories he told us (Mt. St. Helens����). Ive had a love of rocks & fossils since I was a child, but this class fueled my passion for geology & I still share facts I learned in this class with my family every time we happen across a landform.",5.0,2.0,James Rexius
4464,"THE best professor I've ever had. I took Geology as a general education requirement and he made it the best class I've taken at SC. Graded by hands-on rock labs and 3 lengthy tests with no outside homework. Not an easy A, but it'd be hard to fail. Rexius is a legend & gives insight on the origin of all the rocks we see. He has been to 49/50 states.",5.0,3.0,James Rexius

Real easy going guy.",5.0,2.0,Alec Thomson
4486,He respects others opinions. He was an easy grader and the amount of work per week was very manageable. The assignments were easy and interesting because they were related to current issues.

I'm lucky to have had him as a teacher.",5.0,3.0,James Tabor

4671,He is a very nice guy. If you go to class he will bump up your grade at the end of the semester if you are close to the next grade. 3 map quizzes that have a lot to memorize and 3 tests (one is the final) that cover a lot of information.

4805,I didn't have the book but the all Multiple choice tests weren't too hard if you looked at the slides he posted.

5628,this class is awful. I only took professor Choi's class as it was given to me as a freshman at the University. His tests are extremely difficult and hard todo well on. I took AP Macro and Ap Micro and high school and I'm still struggling to even do well on his assignments. Luckily he curved the first midterm by 20 points.,1.0,5.0,Young Back Choi
5629,"Only gives you three tests a semester and if you fail the first you might as well drop.

Extensive writing and presentation assignment. Test is hard and 60% o. So hard. there's typos in the questions. If he says exam will cover only 1 textbooks , you'll find textbook 2 questions.",1.0,5.0,Young Back Choi

5636,You really need to work for an A in this class. You have to teach yourself literally everything for the 2 tests. He was nice enough to curve the midterm since everyone did poorly. He does offer some extra credit such as writing essays on guest lectures. 1 group project. Midterm and final add up to 85% of your course grade. Find study guides online.,2.0,4.0,Young Back Choi

Boring class but he is fair",1.0,4.0,Young Back Choi
5639,"Smart man. In my experience with taking Micro-econ with him, I decided to listen what he was saying instead of how he was saying it, and I learned much more.

5641,"The whole lecture he talks and doesnt try to engage the class, and barely teaches. You're better off teaching yourself.

You can find the textbook online, the discussion answers online, quiz answers online, and his final is just previous quiz questions. EASY A.

5738,"He's an ok professor. This class has TAs. Quiz every week on the readings. I felt like this class had too much reading to do every single week. He doesn't respect students time.

5741,Hands down the most confusing course I have ever taken. The professor did a poor job at explaining the course material and to make matters worse the syllabus was disorganized and riddled with spelling mistakes. The final project is a joke and you will get minimal help from her. She also does not grade work untill the end of the semester.��,1.0,4.0,Martha Broderick
5742,Worst teacher ive ever had. Doesnt communicate whatsoever. Almost feels as though she is going out of her way for me to do poorly in her class. Has no empathy and takes no responsibility for her own mistakes. Makes me want to transfer schools because how awful she is. So unhealthy for mental health and she has no sympathy/flexibility with covid.,1.0,3.0,Martha Broderick

5747,"If you're given a choice, never take a class with her. Certainly not this one. The material really isn't that difficult, but she is so demanding and even so intimidating that it's possible to get overwhelmed and do very poorly.

5749,"Martha expects us to do way more work than a full 5 course class load student can handle. Hundreds of pages of reading per week on top of a different book used for writing a book report. At least 4 worksheets due every week, and expects us to finish the long, dry chapters in a few days. She calls on random kids in class, so read the material.",1.0,4.0,Martha Broderick
5750,"Easily the worst class I have taken here so far. The class is college level difficulty, but it's structured like a high school course. You're left completely in the dark about what your grade is the whole way through. Acts like her class is the only class worth worrying about. Group project is long and somewhat hard. Strange attendance system. Bad!",1.0,4.0,Martha Broderick
5751,"disgrace to UMaine's MBS. takes forever to return graded work, never returns any writing assignments except for the idiotic business plan. blabbers during lecture with stories rarely relevant to course material. mandatory highschool-like assigned seating. its been past two weeks since the last project, FINAL GRADE HAS YET TO BE POSTED.",1.0,4.0,Martha Broderick

5753,"Okay professor, pretty nice. Lecture is necessary, but is mostly made up of personal experience stories and supplementary information. You need to read the textbook if you want to do well on the exams. She does offer some extra credit material. The Business Plan is time consuming, but relatively easy, will get a good grade if you put in effort.",3.0,4.0,Martha Broderick

I'm not some ""bad student"" complaining either; I have a 3.7 GPA.",1.0,3.0,Martha Broderick
5757,"By far the worst professor and class experience I have had at UMaine. Had an honest interest in the subject matter but her lectures were unbearable, nothing but irritating rambling.

If you can, take BUA 220 with another professor.",1.5,4.0,Martha Broderick
5759,"Classes are rarely worth attending, she just touches upon the major points in the reading, not really clarifying or expanding on the ideas.

5761,"While Cody is nice, his lecturing leaves much to be desired. He is older and still teaches his classes with little to no interactivity.

My own biased opinion.",2.5,3.0,Howard Cody

5763,"Worst professor I have had the misfortunate of listening to. Completely unneeded to suffer through his lectures, they were simply long-winded regurgitations of the material from book. Entire grade was based on 3 exams, if you have a rudimentary understanding of material you can BS the whole thing.",2.0,3.0,Howard Cody
5764,"You must buy the book and attend every class and take good notes. There is no participation in this class, it is simply him speaking for an hour about Canada.

He doesn't give a study guide, so you just need to know it all",2.5,4.0,Howard Cody

5774,"He's a cute guy, and a pretty decent professor. But I'll be honest. If you're taking a class with him, great, but try to avoid a TR class with him. They're WAY to long to sit though, especially if it's first thing in the morning. His monotone voice makes you have the aweful tendency to doze off.",3.5,3.0,Howard Cody

6410,Wrote the textbook. Makes you buy the $99 software based on his own textbook to take assignments. The assignments are basically impossible to complete without quizlet since they take from specific numbers and species from the text.,2.0,2.0,Micheal Moulton
6411,"The class was easy. Grade is determined by 2 Open-Note/Open-Word Doc Proctored Exams, 4 Course Software ""Exercises"", and 1 Quiz based on a short audio file.

6415,This class was really easy but enjoyable! It is all on the software that you have to buy for $100. Practice work will help you learn the material and it is extra credit so it's a good idea. 4 exercises based on the lectures and readings but everything is on quizlet. The 2 exams are very straight forward based on material from the exercises.,5.0,1.0,Micheal Moulton
6416,"I don't know if she's off this semester or if it's normal for her, but this instructor turned out to be wishy-washy and unorganized. CONSTANTLY changing things, deletes instructions, discussion boards, announcements so you cannot reference what she said when she marks you down WRONGFULLY. Expects citations but does not understand them herself. Mess",2.0,4.0,Pandy Warner
6417,"I took this course online and am SO glad I had Pandy as a professor. She genuinely cares about her students and takes the time to explain and respond to all questions in a timely manner.

6418,She is extremely difficult to figure out.  She was also very flippant in her comments regarding assignments.

The material is simple but figuring out what she wants is almost impossible.,1.0,5.0,Pandy Warner

6424,I found this class unrealistic for an online course. So many projects.

I did not feel like I learned that much from this class. ,1.0,5.0,Pandy Warner

It's a pretty time consuming class, to say the least.",3.5,3.0,Pandy Warner

6431,"Her online class was pretty basic; read a chapter, take a quiz answer a question. but it seems like she asks you trick questions on the quizzes.

6434,"Not the best CD teacher. Everything has to be EXTREMELY detailed for every assign, which she only made clear during 1 assign. Shes also very unprofessional with making her test.

6435,"So I liked this class. Wasnt super easy but I was able to keep up. I ended up with a C in the class. Which I was kinda okay with.

Thanks a whole lot. DONT TAKE HER!!!!",2.0,5.0,Pandy Warner
6436,"She's such a gem. I arrived late to an exam once because I didn't know it was that day, and asked if she could maybe weigh my later exams heavier because of that.

Love her",5.0,4.0,Barb Welker

Im so glad I had her.",5.0,4.0,Barb Welker

6440,"Welker is an amazing professor who is really kind and very approachable during office hours. Her classes are fun and she brought in her dog a couple times.

6442,This is a challenging class especially for an intro level but if you take good notes and start studying a week in advance you'll ace the exam.

Study enough to be confident on test day.,5.0,4.0,Barb Welker

However, her class is WAY too difficult for an intro class. She goes through her lecture slides very fast and tests are very specific and difficult.",3.0,5.0,Barb Welker
6445,This class kind of blows. Its 90 percent three exams. You have to study a lot because it is strictly memorization. If you have a good memory you can get an A. If you dont you will get a 47. Start studying days in advance for her exams and do so a lot more than you think you have to.,2.0,4.0,Barb Welker
6446,"She's a really interesting person with awesome stories that make the lectures pretty enjoyable.

6447,"At first, very engaging but after a few weeks of class, lectures can feel long and drawn out. Very approachable. There are lots of reading and in-class participation, so be prepared for group talks. Tests are hard and power points are stuffed with information. I advise that you study for the test at least four days in advance to get the material.  ",3.0,4.0,Barb Welker
6448,She is such an amazing teacher but is so hard. She's not really clear on what she specifically wants from you on tests. The way I studied was by studying everything but that was not enough. You just need to study in advance like crazy. Every little detail matters. ,3.0,5.0,Barb Welker
6449,"Welker, is a great person. Very up beat and loves what she does. Her class on the other hand is not that easy. She  uses powerpoint to teach, she talks a lot and sometimes is gets super confusing. Its a class you have to work for and study to get in the b range.",2.5,4.0,Barb Welker
6450,"This class was the most difficult class I have ever taken as a college student. If you plan to take Human Evolution, take ANTH 105 first. I didn't, and suffered horribly.

6451,"Barb is wonderful, even if this class is a little too in depth for an intro class.

6452,Do not take physical anthro with welker. She will only talk about her primatology studies and expect you to know highly specific information on various primates. Very long articles read before every class with highly specific test questions. Way too demanding for an intro class.,3.0,4.0,Barb Welker
6453,"Professor Welker is very passionate about her research topic (primatology), so a very large portion of the time is spent talking about monkeys.

6816,"Dr. Killen has been by far my favorite psych prof at Drexel. She's very kind, thorough, and no BS. If you need help just ask, she's all about giving her students the time they need to complete assignments. She has an interesting testing model but it works in your favor as long as you try. Read the material she provides cause they do appear on tests",5.0,4.0,Marlin Killen

6818,"Actually took her for PSY125-Child Psychopathology She had health issues and allowed us to take the first exam at home and then we convinced her to let us do at home exams for the last two. If we had had the tests in class, I would have done horrid. There wouldn't have been enough time. Ask for take home, can't hurt. Other assignemtns aren't hard",3.0,3.0,Marlin Killen
6819,attendance isn't mandatory but she doesn't post a powerpoint/notes so go to lecture. gives u extra work if class is cancelled (three times more than we would ever do in class). u take the test three times (individual/group/class) and it's always open note but she'll give like a 20 page essay to read for the test. she does curve grades at the end.,3.0,3.0,Marlin Killen

6829,"Best psychology teacher I've ever had. She has great stories and she's a great teacher. Her testing method is awesome, you use your class notes and the textbook and then you take it as a group and then as a class. It may sound easy but you actually learn a lot. She's awesome!! A little cooky but it makes the class more fun",4.0,1.0,Marlin Killen

6831,"Excellent professor. She's actually interested in helping her students learn. It might not seem 'hard' but you actually learn in her classes. She's fun, helpful and encouraging, and teaches!

6839,"I've always been passionate for art & history but the way this professor grades DO NOT represent your knowledge of the material. She has no mercy for mistakes. No late work & no extra credit.

6841,"Professor shows a real passion for the Arts.  With this in mind she will make you work in class, as in there will be a good amount of reading, writing, and definitely studying. Not an easy  A, but if you show up to class and take good notes you should be fine. Material itself is not too difficult, you just need to put in the time!",5.0,4.0,Marion De Koning
6842,"okay so basically what you do in this class is you do a lot of home works and for each hw she grade it out of 3, 5, or 6.

She also expect you to know everything. she want you to write all the details in the HW.",1.0,5.0,Marion De Koning
6843,"She will mark you off for just about any mistake you make, but she allows for corrections on the homework. You have to do the homework, but it isn't difficult. 3 tests.

We received the same grade.",3.0,2.0,Marion De Koning
6844,If you are NOT an art major DO NOT take her class. She expects you to know some stuff already just because you are in that field. She also expects everything to be perfect.,2.0,4.0,Marion De Koning
6845,"Took this class thinking it was gonna be easy but it was the complete opposite. Homework everyday and lectures are long. Make sure you're very specific when it comes to tests, spelling and grammar is important! One big project that includes going to the museum and either doing a hands on project or a report on it. ",3.0,4.0,Marion De Koning
6846,"The work is NOT hard. She gives you literally everything you need to pass the 4 tests. I mean she LITERALLY has you write down everything she wants you to write on the test. The semester length project does take a lot of time but really, this class is an A if you are a good student and will put in a little effort. You will seriously learn a ton.",4.0,2.0,Marion De Koning
6847,"This is the easiest class i have taken. you can easily get an A on every exam, All you have to do is show up to class. She basically gives you the answers to the tests in her lectures so definitely take notes. She is not the friendliest person but as long as you do your work you will be on her good side. textbook used for hw and classwork",4.0,1.0,Marion De Koning
6848,"Dr. de Koning is very straightforward with her lectures. I cannot stress how much attendance matters. The questions she has on her exams are come right from her lectures, so make sure you organize your notes.  If you would like to survive her class, it is necessary that you: MAKE FLASHCARDS! FORM A STUDY GROUP! ASK QUESTIONS! And, Good-luck!",4.0,4.0,Marion De Koning
6849,"It's an intro to art class, you'd think it'd be easy but it's not.  Semester project requires a lot of time, a lot. 4 grades given in the entire class. Better be prepared.",3.5,4.0,Marion De Koning
6850,Don't take her class unless you are an art major andor have taken her class before. If you skip more than two classes she will dropfail you. She expects you to have taken her class before so her test guidelines are not clear unless you have.,1.0,4.0,Marion De Koning
6851,"The best art history teacher I've had! Very clear in her expectations of her students. Work hard, score high! She also offers a great opportunity to either write a research paper or go to a museum and then create something based on the piece you saw. Text isn't really used.

6852,"Marion De Koning is a wonderful Art History professor. She is passionate about the subject and gives fantastic lectures. There is a lot to remember, but she makes her expectations very clear.

6854,"This is NOT an easy A class. People who aren't interested in art or art history better stay away and take some easier classes for your GE. You're expected to take really good notes in class, and none of the questions on the exams will surprise you because they're exactely related to her lectures. There's no reason to fail if you attend every class.",5.0,3.0,Marion De Koning
6855,"First off, dont take an Art history class unless you're an art major.  If you're doing it for a credit req, skip this one. She is a great teacher, but goodness is she a hard grader.  She expects you to regurgitate EXACTLY word for word what she has taught.  Ex: ""It's a history painting, not historical painting, if you wrote that, zero credit."" ",4.0,4.0,Marion De Koning
6856,"He was a fantastic teacher earlier on, but he got too old and confused. Left out beats, was very bad at explaining anything and would just use terrible singing. He retired way too late but I'm glad he did because in reality he is good, just got very confused the last five years.",5.0,2.0,Jack Williamson
6857,Very very very difficult. He knows his stuff but he isn't the best at teaching it. He is more akin to an excellent performer but maybe a not so great a teacher.,2.0,5.0,Jack Williamson
6858,"He is a great person, but not a great conductor. He doesnt know what words to use so he just kind of sings in gestures instead of saying ""phrasing goes to here"" or something like that. I have never gotten a comment other than balance issues, nor have I learned anything from his teaching.  He is slowly leaving out beats more often because hes old.",1.0,1.0,Jack Williamson
6859,Amazing teacher,5.0,4.0,Jack Williamson
6860,"He is by far my favorite conductor.  Through his conducting, it is so clear what he wants from the music. He demands your best and runs rehearsals efficently. He was one of the reasons I wanted to study here.  Great teacher!!!",4.5,5.0,Jack Williamson
6861,"The man is barely 5 feet tall and he controls the band with an iron fist.  That's true genius my friends.  Get into any class you can with this guy so maybe some of it will rub off on you.  And he's very cynical, funny, and politically incorrect.",5.0,3.0,Jack Williamson
6862,I don't know about all these godly comments but he was always very polite to me. I learned a great deal from him and found him to be very patient with me while I was trying to improve on my instrument.,4.0,5.0,Jack Williamson
6863,"OK.  He's a good conductor.  But, he is very stuck up and really condescending.  If that's up your alley, then he's the one for you.  I had a hard time dealing with his love for himself.",4.5,4.0,Jack Williamson
6864,"This man is a gift from God.  He is probably the greatest conductor that I'll ever work with.  He is very helpful if you have trouble learning the music, he's there.  Take any class you can from this man!!",5.0,4.0,Jack Williamson

6871,"Runs his class like a high school band class, and expects the rules of high school to apply as well. College isn't the same as high school and his inability to adapt to that makes him an arrogant teacher. Didn't learn anything from his class and expected the same results from non-music majors as from music majors.",1.0,2.0,Doug Bianchi
6872,"He is a good band director, but keep in mind I am not a music major. For someone just taking the class for fun, he's great - gives a lot of anecdotes and examples relating to kissing, not sure if that's a flavor of the year thing or not. He talks to the music ed majors a lot, telling them things that will be helpful to them. Fun class.",4.0,1.0,Doug Bianchi
6873,He is a fantastic Director and he is hilarious too i love him.,5.0,1.0,Doug Bianchi
6874,"He's a decent enough conductor, and he gets the music sounding excellent, but he's a little unreasonable sometimes. He needs to understand sometimes that his rehearsal is not always the most important thing in the world. Sometimes he's in the right, but most of the time it just seems like he's being a jerk.",3.0,3.0,Doug Bianchi
6875,"In terms of actually teaching the class, he's a good teacher. However, his personality is what puts this class out of balance. Just go to class, play, then leave.

But if you're just looking to play, just stay on his good side and don't worry about anything else",2.0,1.0,Doug Bianchi

This is something that I value greatly!",4.0,4.0,Doug Bianchi
6883,Bianchi is a brilliant conductor. He is by far the best conductor I have ever had. When he conducts you can really feel the energy he gives off. His conducting makes me a better player.,4.5,3.0,Doug Bianchi
6884,This prof. is only helpful if he can get something in return.  He charms his way in and out of everything expecting no problems from others.  He's vague when speaking or communicating and often leaves students very confused.  Not to mention he's notorious for crossing the line with students.  He's an embarrassment to WSU.,3.0,3.0,Doug Bianchi
6885,WSU obviously was desperate for a director of bands when they hired a high school band director.

Every week we were to read a chapter (20-30 pages), post three times on the discussion board, and have a quiz every other week. Straight forward class; do the readings, you pass.

6895,This is by far one of the best professors I have ever had.

It was mainly just discussion boards a few easy quizzes and a very flexible term paper.,5.0,1.0,Johnnie Terry

Class consists of weekly responses( easy 100%), four quizzes (get online textbook to command F it), and one paper (got 100%).

6919,"Professor Taylor is nice, but I hated her teaching style. Doesnt lecture so you HAVE to take your own notes at home. Going to class felt pointless but attendance is graded. Notes can be used on the test, but you will not pass the tests with only the notes from class. You need notes from the book as well. Just take this class online and avoid her.",3.0,5.0,Kathleen Taylor
6920,"Absolutely loved her and the class. Super funny and loves her subject very much. This class is very reading/notes/lecture heavy.

7273,"Professor eves just lectures for the whole class period and half the time it just long boring tangents. He posts the power points so you literally dont have to go to class.

7274,He is a slow grader and I honestly think he just writes a random grade at the top of the paper. He doesn't leave comments or give feedback on what questions you got wrong and ways to improve your grade. Attendance isn't mandatory but I suggest showing up to get a good grade.,2.0,3.0,Jamie Eves
7275,"The class is mostly lectures but he is very passionate about what he does which makes it interesting even if you don't like history.

7282,He was a good person while in class but the worst person to ever stumble upon EVER. Be sure to not email him or have any contact with him. He is rude and full of himself (for what reason i dont know) i feel he gave me a grade not based on what I did but how he felt about me.,1.0,2.0,Jamie Eves
7283,He's a really nice guy and makes a lot of jokes and he's easy to understand. He mostly reads powerpoints every class though.

7284,"If you enjoy having Powerpoints read to you for 3 hours a week, he's your guy. Hard to read his tone/expressions at times. Takes FOREVER to return exams and papers.

I don't discourage taking him, but know going in what you're facing.",3.0,3.0,Jamie Eves

I recommend this class!",4.0,3.0,Sarah Jones

8020,"I would not recommend taking Benevento for creative writing if you want a blowoff class. He expects his students to participate and learn how to write more effectively.

8021,"Benevento is a good choice. There really aren't lectures, but there are classroom discussions of the books that you've read. His grading system is simple: contribute to the discussion each day, and 40% of your grade is an A. The rest of your grade comes from three papers (6-10 pages), and if you read the books, then you'll do fine.",4.0,3.0,Joe Benevento
8022,"I think Professor Benevento really is a good guy and cares about what he's talking about. Read your books, talk in class and write a few decent papers and there's no reason you shouldn't get an A. He can be rather intense during discussion in class, but it's worth 60% of your grade. Don't be upset if he challenges your opinion during discussion.",3.0,3.0,Joe Benevento
8023,"He asks challenging questions but doesn't act like a know-it-all. Class is based around discussing the readings.

8025,"Awesome teacher,  but you will need to ask for clarification about his feedback, because you won't be able to read it. Always feel free to email him, he answers promptly, even on weekends.

Would take her again if needed.",3.0,3.0,Bridget Thomas

Make sure you always prepare the work before class.",5.0,5.0,Bridget Thomas

Assignments are under a page long and are handwritten. 1 final exam and 2-8 min film or paper.,5.0,3.0,Michael Rydman
8566,"Boring as can be. Monotone with very little personality. Off topic waaay too much. Often goes off topic and rambles.

8773,"He's an English professor, so yes: there will be papers. I really like Dr. Parkes, and I think he's very interesting and smart. Our class is discussion based and our grades were only papers. Some people don't like the way the class is set up, but it's just preference if you like discussions or lectures better. The books we read were all interesting",5.0,4.0,Adam Parkes
8774,Had him for my FYOS. Was very nice and talked a lot considering it was a discussion based class. We just had to do 1 page papers on our readings; never got less than an A. I liked him and he has a lovely accent but I've heard his standard English classes are tough.,3.0,3.0,Adam Parkes
8775,"He is one of those, ""I will make you a better writer"" profs, which I personally don't like. He is a very harsh grader, and the comments he makes on essays are kind of shallow.

PLEASE do not take any class from this man.,1.0,5.0,Adam Parkes
8777,"*Beware* James Joyce is not an easy class, but I would absolutely recommend it. The reading material is very challenging, but Dr. Parkes knows this  and uses the entire lecture to explain and give background info. He is uber smart and his accent is just so fun. He expects a serious student and your paper grades with reflect that. 9/10 class.",5.0,5.0,Adam Parkes
8778,"He does a pretty decent job presenting the material, but the amount of reading alone can be overwhelming.

8779,"Dr. Parkes clearly knows a ton about literature, and most of the time he is pretty good in lecture. Sometimes he gets too fancy with his descriptions and it gets incredibly confusing, though.

8780,A very difficult class. Very smart teacher and knowledgeable about the literature but extremely dull as well as unclear. He gives very little instruction on writing assignments and grades very harshly. Hard to determine what he looks for. Final paper is worth 50% of your grade. Overall would not recommend this course.,2.0,4.0,Adam Parkes
8781,This class is the first class I have not received an A in. He has extremely high expectations and is very critical. He even made one girl in my class cry. The class is mainly discussion based but the way he responds to people's opinions make it so very few people want to talk. He even kicked out over half the class for not reading one day.,2.0,5.0,Adam Parkes

On that note, if you can avoid him, do it!",2.5,4.0,Adam Parkes
8783,"However 'brilliant' Parkes may be, I never saw an inkling of it. I felt the class was pretty easy, just a pain in the ass and completely useless.

8790,"DiBella's class was a very difficult class for me, mainly because I do not like history. His lectures are like 2 and a half hours long, and very material heavy. There is a lot of memorization, and his tests are difficult. However, I did learn a lot! You just need to put a lot of time aside for this class, but he is very hilarious!",3.0,4.0,Edward Dibella
8791,such a great teacher and great class! All his lecutures are done by memory and shows pictures to go along. I took the class at night and he kept all of the class very awake and interested.

8792,"I went to class everyday, payed attention, took good notes, hardly studied and got an A. Not easy but incredibly rewarding.

He's a very nice guy but he lectures for 3 hours straight with no ppts. he talks fast and if you miss class you're gunna miss a lot of info and get way behind.

8796,"Very long class, but DiBella is very passionate about history so he makes lectures interesting. He talks super fast but try to take notes on everything he says and ask for clarification if you need it. Super willing to help. Watch a movie almost every class. Exams are multiple choice, short-answer, and 2 essays. Extra credit will save your grade. ",4.5,2.0,Edward Dibella
8797,Di bella is a very fair teacher. He is very passionate about what he teaches and makes history interesting. The class is 3 tests. I struggled to get an A on the first two but the final one I went to his office hours a lot and was able to get an A in the class. You have to put the work in but overall a great class. There are 40 points extra credit. ,5.0,2.0,Edward Dibella

8800,"He's been one of my favorite teachers so far at state, he manages to make history interesting. He does talk very fast and does not use slides, but he is more than willing to repeat what he says if you ask. Attendance is basically mandatory since he plays videos that go along with work sheets that are graded. Do the extra credit and its an easy A.",4.5,1.0,Edward Dibella
8801,"Professor Di Bella was very difficult to understand in his lectures. He speaks very quickly and never stops for the entire 3 hours, it is IMPOSSIBLE to take notes in his class.

I learned so much in his class and recommend taking him!",5.0,2.0,Edward Dibella
8804,"He is a very intelligent and informative teacher, but beware because an abundance of information is given quickly and in a short amount of class time.

Awesome teacher but beware that you do need to study for the tests and put in some time!",3.5,3.0,Edward Dibella

I want you to know how great he is.",5.0,2.0,Edward Dibella
8807,"Definitely one of the best. Don't get the wrong idea from these comments, he is not an easy teacher, that's bull. He grades with enthusiasm. The plus is that he offers 60 EC points! Its hard not to get an A if you actually put some intellectual thought into what you write. He says ""EH"" a lot and is a very intense teacher, which equals excitement.",4.0,3.0,Edward Dibella
8808,VERY EASY PROFESSOR BUT BE PREPARED TO WRITE AN ABUNDANCE OF NOTES WHILE HE TALKS AT AN EXTREMELY FAST PACE. HE TELLS YOU THE QUESTIONS ON THE EXAMS AND OFFERS A LOT OF EXTRA CREDIT.

His exams are all short answer and he can be vague about what to expect on the exams.",4.0,4.0,Dave Fastovsky
8810,"Blended class because of COVID. Most of the grade is group discussions, but what he looks for is unclear.

Very confusing with where the in-person classes end and continues online. Take detailed notes!!!",1.0,5.0,Dave Fastovsky
8811,"He's such a good professor and really interesting, one of the best professor's I've ever had. He's also really understanding and wants you to do well.

8825,"His first time teaching it in a long time and it was obvious.  In a class where pictures are critical, you think he would give printouts, but everything was drawn on the board in marker.

8990,"Buy the book, he isn't great at explaining things and the extra info is needed for tests. Read the readings assigned, use the clicker, get a tutor, don't skip class or you will miss a lot. There wasn't any homework, projects or papers. Just 4 tests. He makes a study guide for them. Bring a laptop for notes. He talks really fast.",3.0,3.0,William Donner
8991,The lectures are interesting but can get very boring very fast. Attendance is not mandatory but he goes over everything that will be on the tests in class.

8992,"There are 4 tests & a participation grade. He gives an optional final to replace your lowest grade. He gives two extra credit opportunities worth 10 pts each.

He's okay.",3.0,3.0,William Donner
8993,Knowledgeable guy but it is hard to pay attention to him. He says Um or uh about every other word. Does not care if he offends anyone and he will tell you that. He will call you out for using your phone or coming late and wont let down.,3.0,1.0,William Donner
8994,"He doesn't give out homework, but he gives 4 tests and they have about 100 questions maybe a little more on it. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you aren't doing well then he won't help you.

Pay attention (which is hard not to do) and take notes and you're golden!",5.0,3.0,Dave Weinandy

9069,Professor Lee thinks everyone is an expert. The reading in the class is insane. I eventually began skimming and my grades showed it. They seem useless until the test hits.

Honestly, I don't know how I passed his class.",5.0,5.0,Won Lee

9132,"She can be fun and frustrating. She LOVES the idea of the workbooks, but for the majority of students they are useless and busy work.

That said, her tests are crazy hard and difficult to complete in 50 minutes.",5.0,4.0,Christie McDermott
9149,Lovely person and great professor. She would be great for higher level courses as she tends to over complicate things when teaching introductory courses.

9763,Professor Gonda is a fair grader and very good at telling the REAL story of American history. I learned so much and can honestly say I feel like my views and opinions on social matters are changed because of her class. She's extremely passionate about history and it shows in her modules. 10/10 would recommend Sue Gonda.,5.0,3.0,Susan Gonda
9764,"Gonda is great! She is super sweet and her modules are super organized and quite easy. Just read, view the powerpoints and occasionally write a discussion during her quizzes. Tons of extra credit, only two papers on events you get to choose. Online was only 8 weeks so it moves fast, two modules a week, but totally doable.",5.0,2.0,Susan Gonda
9765,"Prof Gonda is so incredibly nice. She offered many different EC opportunities, I took her 8 week course and I loved the material she covered. She is one tough grader though, details are so important to her. There were a couple of times when she didn't post something on time and gave us extra time to complete the assignments. I would take her again.",5.0,5.0,Susan Gonda
9766,"I don't get why some people had a problem with her. I took her both semesters last year, and she explained anything anyone ever asked. She RESPONDS TO EMAILS and gives you a chance to do something again if you failed and go and talk to her. She's smart and nice. She relates history to what's going on today-not just memorizing dates and stuff",5.0,3.0,Susan Gonda
9767,"She might be the one with the best rate in here, but I bet any of those professors are billion time better than this woman. SHE IS RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I had an A until the last couple weeks of class, so if you fall behind, it's difficult to catch up.",5.0,3.0,Susan Gonda
9770,This is the terrible professor I ever had. I don't recommend to take her at all I passed her class with C. But she gives to much discussions and quizzes and writing. She's really bad on grading and she focus on every single word you turn in. Often she gives you chance to redo the assignment but most of the times just give zero if its incorrect.,1.0,4.0,Susan Gonda
9771,She has a PHD in history but has a hard time applying lectures online and making them easy to follow - everything is scattered.

Her quizzes aren't clear and some questions have her opinion so it's confusing.,2.0,3.0,Susan Gonda

This course is amazing, take it.",5.0,2.0,Susan Gonda

I am currently clueless and have no idea what I am doing wrong. Worst class EVER.",1.0,5.0,Susan Gonda
9774,"It's a History class, you have to read to understand what is going on. She gives amazing lectures.

9780,She is highly knowledgeable in her field. Scantrons for this class NOT needed as all her quizzes and tests are write-in/essay style and that is why many students have a problem with her.

9783,Prof O. is probably the best prof. I have had. She has done so much in her life and truely values the oppinions and thoughts of her students. Class is discussion bases with many papers.

9790,Professor Corrigan is the sweetest man I have ever met in my entire life and cares so much about his students. His class is really easy if you do the reading and take notes when he lectures.

9793,Corrigan is awesome. He gives pop quizzes but they are only three questions and as long as you do the reading you are fine. He loves when people asks questions because he loves making sure everyone is understanding. Definitely the best philosophy professor at Assumption.,4.5,2.0,Patrick Corrigan
9794,He's really a great guy. I had him for the Tagaste program so I was taking two classes with him over my freshman year so I really got to know him. You only write 4 papers and you have a total of 7 pop quizzes over the semester. He is a little confusing as he goes off on tangents and barely covers all the previous reading,4.0,4.0,Patrick Corrigan
9795,"There were about 8 pop quizzes.  Some of the readers could get very lengthyconfusing.  He does a good job explaining them in class, though.

Major problem for me was that the whole grade consisted of just 3 essays (25% each) and 7 pop quizzes (together 25% - MUST READ MATERIAL BEFORE CLASS :(  )... Key to good grade is to go see him to ask if your essay ideas are accurate... Grade: A-",4.0,5.0,Patrick Corrigan

Can't wait till I finish the major requirements.",1.0,1.0,Anthony Zielonka
9813,He cares a lot about his students. HE speaks mostly in English and as long as you half pay attention and speak sometimes you will pass.

9814,He really tries. He cares a lot about his class and his students so I really wanted this class to be a lot of fun. It's simply not fun. But it can be rewarding if you put in the work and practice. He is all for giving extra credit or having class outside. You just have to interact with him.,3.0,3.0,Anthony Zielonka
9815,Def. take Professor Howe over Zielonka if you have the choice. He assigns readings but you never have to do them because he just goes over them during class.

9821,"He is a nice person; however, he is a terrible professor. He sits at his desk and reads straight from the book in English.

He gives a lot of A (-)s.",2.0,1.0,Anthony Zielonka

10002,If you have the option of taking Haq take her. This professor's Spanish skills aren't even up to par to be teaching a grammar class. He barely teaches! In class we go over the assigned short films or readings. We barely go over grammar which makes exams so hard. He speaks in English often which is frustrating if you really want to learn Spanish,2.0,4.0,Hans-Jorge Busch
10003,"I hated Hans. worst professor I've ever had, he doesn't even know Spanish, he constantly asked the class what certain words meant. he just teaches from the textbook that he wrote and there are sooo many things wrong with it.

Show up and talk to get a good grade.",3.0,3.0,Hans-Jorge Busch

10012,"Honestly, he's good for 200. My native speaking friends always say, after looking at our tests, that he uses too many fillers.

I would take him again for that class but not for any conversation classes. ",4.0,2.0,Hans-Jorge Busch
10013,Busch was a good teacher. Never did the homework but it didn't matter because we went over it in class. Quizzes actually count more as tests but they are fair as long as you review.

10119,"This is overall one of my favorite classes. She's very clear about what she expects of her students, and she's hilarious in class (lots of references to things college kids think are funny). My only complaint is she doesn't give her students any room to argue over answers bc even if she messes up grading on a quiz, she won't give you points back.",4.0,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10120,"Toughest Spanish class i've ever taken and I have been taking classes for 9 years. She expects a lot from students, so if you're looking for an easy A - look elsewhere. If you show up and study for quizzes, you will be just fine. She reminds us that she is also teaching us to be successful - which is so true. Great person and wonderful prof!",5.0,5.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10121,"Profe Stommes expects a lot from her students. A LOT. This class is VERY difficult. Spanish is a class where you learn from your mistakes, but Profe Stommes grades everything with no exceptions, and your grade may evidently suffer. However, she is a great person and I hope I got more out of this class than I think, but my grade did not reflect that",3.0,5.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10122,Hands down the best Spanish teacher I've had in over 5 years of taking the language. She's a hoot and she doesn't take things too seriously but genuinely wants her students to improve. She uses English sometimes but you'll still learn a ton of Español and get lots of practice from reading and speaking.,5.0,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10123,Profe is super nice and hilarious. She talks mostly in a mixture of Spanish and English but her accent is easy to understand. Lots of reading for the class and her tests are very challenging. Need to study a lot to do well. She teaches the language really well and I really feel like my Spanish improved a lot. Take her if you want to learn.,4.0,4.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10124,"Profe is the best! She really wants you to take much more than just Spanish out of the class. She's a wonderful and vibrant woman who expects a lot out of you, but in the end it will all pay off.",4.0,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10125,"This professor has been one of my favorites here at Creighton. She teaches well and will do anything to help her students. Also, she is hilarious! Fun fact: she is from Puerto Rico. She is also great to talk with outside of class. If you get the chance, TAKE HER.",5.0,2.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10126,She is an amazing person and an amazing professor. She makes class enjoyable to attend and easy to understand. It is so fun to speak with her in class and outside of class. Be sure to take her sometime during your four years at Creighton!,5.0,2.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10127,funny and has personality. she does well with motivating you to stretch your spanish boundaries. quizzes are extremely easy. tests are not easy but not hard just study and you will do fine,5.0,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10128,"I took Ivé for 311, 312, and 425. She can be tough on tests, but she is really entertaining in class and definitely worth taking.",4.0,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10129,"She definitely has spunk, and you will get a lot out of any class you take with her.  Her grading can be sporadic and the classes are not easy.  I'd definitely recommend taking her for any Spanish class, but don't expect to get a good grade w/o working hard.",4.0,4.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10130,"Such a great teacher! It's not an easy class, but she is very clear about what material will be on the tests. I loved going to this class because she speaks in ""Spanglish"" and tells great stories. Very knowledgeable and will help you outside of class. Take her!",4.0,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10131,"Shes a good teacher, and so much fun to have in class. Very high energy and really cares about her students. Overall the class is pretty hard. No freebees with grammar, and vocab on tests is pretty challenging. Overall a really fun teacher.",4.5,3.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10132,"Pretty good teacher overall.  She is hilarious in class.  If you're looking for a breeze through class this isn't it, but if you do homework and study for tests you should be fine",4.0,4.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
10133,Amazing teacher. I learned more in one semester with her than I did in 4 years of high school Spanish!! She is a bit sassy sometimes but she tells really interesting relating to Hispanic culture. Definitely take her class!!,5.0,4.0,Ivelisse Santiago-Stommes
