0,"Tests are way too hard for a course that should be straight forward. Ive taken exams in the past that were worth 300 points, but thats the entire class grade. 3 exams, 100 points each, thats it. Mainly based on Essay Questions and 25 multiple choice. Avoid if you can. If you have to take this class just make sure you dont take it lightly.",1.0,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
1,"Professor Kobak is very passionate about developmental psychology and it is evident in his lectures. His lectures are insanely boring. They seriously seem eternal, but he does not put his full slides online so it is good to go. Also he has clicker questions he uses for extra credit. If you don't read you will not get an A.",3.0,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
2,"The classes were boring, the exams were impossible, and I struggled for my C.",2.5,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
3,"This class shouldn't be as hard as it is made. Exams are confusing and a few questions were incomprehensible on each one. To make it worse, no specifics are given as to what will be on the exam, just how many questions from each chapter will be on it.  If you have the time to do every single reading you can do well, but you won't be able to cruise.",2.5,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
4,"Dull, confusing, and vague. You will never know where the exam material is coming from. AVOID this professor...has no idea how a good psych class is taught. Easy B nothing more",3.5,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
5,"AWFUL, BORING, puts you to sleep, tests are confusing",1.5,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
6,"nice professor but the class gets really boring. uses powerpoints in class and there are 3 tests which constitute your whole grade. tests are pretty tricky, you need to study at least a couple nights in advance for them and even then you might still just get a B",3.5,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
7,"Grade based off of 3 Multiple Choice tests (50 questions on each). No rounding or extra credit but its an interesting class. Dr. Kobak is a cool dude. If you're a psyc or human services major the tests will be obvious. Regardless, it's a totally fair class. Take it!",5.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak
8,Kobak is a really nice guy! Classes seem pointless but his test questions come directly form the powerpoint! Don't need the textbook at all but you have to study for the tests. Go to class and study the material and you will definitely get at least a B.,3.5,2.0,R. Rogers Kobak
9,"This professor is adorable, and really funny. There was a lot of reading for each class, and he uses slides and would put them online before class. He shows a lot of good movie clips. Only 3 tests all semester and they were all multiple choice. There was a lot of material to cover, but it was an interesting class.",5.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak
10,"Very nice guy. Very helpful during office hours. It wasn't totally necessary to read the book, but I would at least read the summaries. Some MC questions are directly from readings. The most difficult part of the tests were the essays, and he was usually quite explicit about his expectations for them when reviewing the material prior to the test.",4.5,2.0,R. Rogers Kobak
11,"Nice guy, fine teacher. Got bored and distracted every once in a while, but I still got an A. If you are good at Psych, you will do fine.",4.0,2.0,R. Rogers Kobak
12,"This class overall was a good experience. However your grade is based on 3 tests (all multiple choice). Even though he does posts power points he DOES NOT include all the slides given in class.  So it's smart to attend class.  Plus he gives questions that appear on the test and he doesn't post those either.  Overall, a good professor.",4.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak
13,"I thought that this was a good class. Helps if you have some interest in child development. No extra assignments or papers, just three exams. Fantastic if you don't want to have to do much work throughout the semester, bad if you don't take tests well. Essays count for a lot on the test so if you can write clearly, you'll probably do well.",4.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak
14,"Enjoyable class! Posts powerpoints, Attending class helps on exams.",4.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak
15,great guy. he means well. slides are great and he posts them online after classes. if you do go to classes he'll give you sample mutliple choice questions that actually appear on the exams. sometimes questions on exams are hard to understand though. definitely do the extra credit!,3.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak
16,Slides are all over the place. to study you need to read which is a pain because his notes jump from chapter 1 to 14 without even clarifying. doesnt help at all when asked. dont recommend taking him,2.5,4.0,R. Rogers Kobak
17,"Extremely long powerpoints but will e-mail slides to class after presentation. Nice man, however seems somewhat aloof as most of his slides are disorganized and directly from the text. Class is important for learning exam material, but can do well just by reading the book. Do the extra credit and read the material- it would be hard not to pass.",3.0,2.0,R. Rogers Kobak
18,"Kobak is a very friendly, light-hearted guy who knows his stuff. Plenty of short films to make class enjoyable. 3 tests plus 10 possible pt. extra credit. Do the extra credit, you're almost guarenteed perfect credit. A ""B"" is definitely attainable if you put in some effort. I recommend him.",4.0,3.0,R. Rogers Kobak

20,"Dr. Park is wonderful. He will use his prepared notes for teaching and after class he updates them too, so dont worry if you miss some parts in class. If you spend time reviewing all the homework and notes, its easy to get 90+ in his exams because problems are nearly the same. He also considers for partial credits in some exams. TAKE HIS CLASS!",5.0,2.0,Efton Park
21,He is one of the best professors I have had at TCU. Lectures are easy to understand. The materials definitely helps you a lot in practicing. He's hilarious and makes classes very relaxing. Just take him.,5.0,1.0,Efton Park
22,"Dr. Park explains the material very thoroughly and does plenty of example problems. If you show up to class and take notes, you shouldn't have a problem passing the class. His quizzes and tests are directly based off of in class example problems and homework. Do the work and show up and you'll get an A.",5.0,4.0,Efton Park
23,Park is the worst math teacher I have had a TCU. Made me feel discouraged and was arrogant when asking for help. Also forget about partial credit because you will get none.,1.0,4.0,Efton Park
24,"Park's tests are mostly from his notes but changes the problems a little. However, he is a INCREDIBLY tough grader. It is ridiculous how harsh he is when giving partial credit. Also his humor gets old quick. Rude in office hours too. AVOID HIM.",2.0,4.0,Efton Park
25,"Dr. Park is the best professor I have ever had for a class. He is very straight to the point and teaches things in a way that is easy to understand. He does give pop quizzes once a week, so study before each class a bit. But the pop quizzes are helpful because they are exactly like the tests.",5.0,3.0,Efton Park
26,"I love Efton Park! I took him for Discrete Math I and Graph Theory... Incredibly caring, funny, and smart guy. He's the reason I became a math major, went and got my masters in math, and now a college level instructor. Go to class (pop quizzes), you will learn some math and get a good laugh.",5.0,3.0,Efton Park
27,Great professor. Class is mainly him giving examples of problems exactly like test. He gives a lot of pop quizzes so you can't really miss class. His lectures are easy to understand and all homework is online. Tests are only 6-8 problems,5.0,2.0,Efton Park
28,One of the best professors I have had. Very fair and prepares you for the exams. Study over all hw and quizzes and you'll do fine on the exams.   He made the class so much more enjoyable,5.0,4.0,Efton Park
29,"Dr. Park is one of the best math professors I have had. His class is challenging but he is very helpful in office hours (holds a lot, too). Lectures are really funny too and you aren't bored in class. Exams are hard so make sure to study a lot for those and beware of random pop quizzes",5.0,4.0,Efton Park
30,"As long as you take notes and review you'll rock this class. He does give quizzes but there expected, the quizzes are the exact same as the test. Awesome class he's super funny, very clear and overall it was a good class. It does take some work but it's good!",4.5,3.0,Efton Park
31,Dr. Park was one of my favorite math teachers. I had to retake this class and did it over the summer. It was really simple as long as you study and do your homework. Expect daily quizzes if not weekly quizzes. But overall a great class. ,4.5,2.0,Efton Park
32,"Dr. Park is my favorite professor I've taken at TCU. His teaching style is very clear, and is always so helpful at his office hours! (Highly recommend going). If you do a lot of practice problems from the homework before the exams, you will do very well. He gives pop quizzes so study every day! (which will help come exam time!) Hilarious, too.",5.0,3.0,Efton Park
33,"I never thought that the funniest professor I would ever have would be a calculus professor, but Dr. Park proved me wrong.  He is an absolute riot.  As for the class, do the homework and make sure you do it right, that alone will prepare you for pop quizzes.  When studying for exams, go above and beyond lecture notes and homework- exams are hard.",5.0,4.0,Efton Park
34,dr. park is an amazing professor. his lectures are engaging. hw problems are very helpful. you can get them done in 30 minutes. you know the hw problems. you know the exam. very good teacher. not a hard A.,5.0,2.0,Efton Park
35,"Dr. Park is a great teacher. He explains all new concepts step-by-step. He might jump a few steps once you have moved beyond a basic understanding of the underlying concept he is teaching, but is always willing to explain all the bits and pieces if you ask. And his method is clear and I love his class! Calc 1...",5.0,3.0,Efton Park
36,he is so corny! I love this guy. He was such a nice teacher. he bumped my grade up to an A even though i had about an 88 but bc i was in class and did the work he gave me some extra credit for trying. He is really helpful and always tells silly jokes. Hes just weird but in a good way. A is very possible,5.0,2.0,Efton Park
37,"Super nice guy, but not the easiest class. The tests are disproportionately harder than the homework, which he fails to realize. Hes always willing to help, and has a odd since of humor that will keep the class from every dragging too bad. Not a bad class, just be mindful of the tests.",4.0,4.0,Efton Park
38,"Nice guy. However, if you take no other warning take this one. When he says that ""if you are able to do the homework, you will do fine on the test."" -- Just know that is a complete and utter lie. The tests are 50x harder than anything he gives for homework or does in class. If you have not had calc before I would recomend another prof.",1.0,4.0,Efton Park
39,"This teacher incredibly evil. I took this guy based upon what I read from the other comments and it led me to a lot of pain. Hard tests, and doesn't know how to teach well. HUGE EGO PROBLEM!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. I HAVE TO RETAKE CALC B/C OF HIM!!!",1.0,5.0,Efton Park
40,It is truly amazing how this professor receives a paycheck. She chooses to meet via zoom with her students once a month and expects her students to read chapter after chapter in preparation for her exams. Her meetings are completely worthless and is very rude. I can't believe I spent my own money taking this course. Worthless.,1.0,5.0,Rhonda Mack
41,I loved Professor Mack! She is entertaining and really cares for her students. Semester long group project and discussions every week so don't skip class. Tests are not too difficult if you study the information from each chapter. Definitely one of my favorite teachers at CofC.,5.0,4.0,Rhonda Mack
42,"At first, after reading some mixed reviews, I was nervous to take Rhonda's class. However, I'm almost at the end of my semester with her and she is great! She's an all around great professor! This means something coming from me because I hardly ever liked any of my professors. Tests are hard but only if you don't study!",5.0,4.0,Rhonda Mack
43,Marketing research is the most difficult class in the marketing track. You should take this class when your fresh out of stats because it will come in handy. The tests are a bear not. Whole lot of people get as on them. Dr Mack comes off very intense but she lightens up toward the end of the semester so don't let her scare you. The book is like reading a dictionary which makes studying for the tests difficult. Overall I learned a lot.,4.0,4.0,Rhonda Mack
44,"tests are extremely hard-the average on test 1 was about a 50. study like crazy, because she picks the most random and picky stuff to include on the tests. doesn't use any visuals during lecture, so it's hard to pay attention. however, nice teacher & helpful if you ask questions. final project sucks-it's a 10-15 pg paper, but it's in groups.",3.0,4.0,Rhonda Mack
45,"Poorly prepared, makes exams unneccesarily hard with picky/tricky questions",2.0,3.0,Rhonda Mack
46,"Class was fairly interesting.  Yet, she makes test very difficult.  Most questions are okay, but she pulls out a few picky things like random stats never mentioned in class.  You will not get an A unless you can nearly memorize the book.  But she is a very good teacher and understands marketing well",5.0,3.0,Rhonda Mack
47,Great professor. Very intelligent and easy to understand. The best advice is to READ THE BOOK!! All of her tests come straight out of the book and not from lecture. Tests are very difficult but the class is fun overall.,4.5,4.0,Rhonda Mack
48,"If you have an 89 in the class, you will get a B instead of a B+.  I don't think that is very fair",3.5,2.0,Rhonda Mack
49,good professor. easy class. you do have to read and participate though. if the class participates she excludes the final. I would highly recommend her.,4.5,2.0,Rhonda Mack
50,"Awsome professor! Very helpful. Yes, she has attendance policy, but that is what you are paying for - a class.  Just study the definitions from the book, and you will get at least a B.  On the tests, ask her, and she will almost give you the answer.",5.0,2.0,Rhonda Mack
51,This class was hard only 3 tests which count for 90% of your grade. My advice for any students interested in majoring in business stay away from buiness adminstration if you are not good in certain class,2.0,5.0,Rhonda Mack
52,I enjoyed the class the class a lot. Learned a lot of new things. She is a pretty good prefessor. Highly recommend her.,5.0,2.0,Rhonda Mack
53,Possibly the worst class.  She has the most strict attendance policy so that you can sit in class and have her read you the book.  I have other ways of WASTING an hour and 15 min.  I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a mktg prof.  Take Turner instead,1.0,2.0,Rhonda Mack

62,she scared me honestly lmao. I can count on one hand how many times we did anything else besides take a quiz or listen to her talk.

63,"Really really easy class. All you need to do is show up and listen and not be a jerk. She gives you quiz reviews which is basically the quiz, she's kind of quirky but really easy going. Should have been a lawyer, she tells you what she expects straight off the bat and just lectures for an hour and fifteen minutes. Nice class for an A.",5.0,1.0,Irene Byrnes
64,The class is so dry that its impossible to pay attention. However she is a super knowledgeable woman who knows her stuff. Do exactly what she wants and you'll get an A. A quiz after each module.

65,"Her lectures feel like they last forever because they are really boring. But, her class is so easy if you show up. Her quizzes are easy, and she lets you use the study guide during them.

She is very nice, and provides great feedback to help you with future assignments.",5.0,4.0,Irene Byrnes
69,"Loved her class. She is open to suggestion and arguments in class (provided their productive), her power points were great.

113,"I took ICS45c during COVID-19 when we shifted to online learning and it was a lot easier because exams were replaced by weekly exercise sets. You still learn though!

115,Took him during COVID so my take might be different. What makes Thornton much different from other ICS profs is that he is really good at teaching. We had weekly exercises that were easy and then 4 projects with 1 being optional. The only bad thing Id say is that the projects can take much longer than you think. But unforgettable experience it was,5.0,3.0,Alex Thornton

119,"He rambles a lot and it's hard to tell where you stand in the class due to the massive curve, but he's overall pretty good. His notes are good, if a bit wordy.

Would not recommend.",2.0,4.0,Bruce Ford
223,"Very nice prof, enjoyed his class but very detail-oriented! Also theres a lot of uncertainty in this course with a 30% lab final and 40% lecture final both scheduled in the final period so basically 70% of your mark is decided in the end..

230,"His class is deceptively hard. You don't realize it until you start preparing for the exams. He likes comparative long answer questions, with some multiple choice questions.

231,"He made trees and ferns interesting. I found the course was weighted too much towards the lab final, but if you know your stuff you will be fine.

Plus he answers questions almost immediately!,5.0,2.0,Michael Boyes

449,"Professor Henigman is a very smart individual and pushes for participation in class lectures, so don't be the majority that says nothing when the professor is trying to engage the class. There are a decent amount of assignments, but it's not unreasonable by any means. You get about up to five skips before it affects your grade directly.",4.0,4.0,Laura Henigman
450,"Incredibly dry lectures. Literally like watching hung paint dry. The woman is kind but very boring. The lectures are long and miserable, the quizzes mean nothing to your grade but are important in preparing you for the final and the papers are graded very harshly. Also the grading standards are very unclear. Take her if you must, shes not awful.",3.0,4.0,Laura Henigman
451,"Great gen ed to take. It was an easy class, but I learned a lot and it shaped my world view dramatically (and helped me choose my minor).

Also, the prof. is sooo sweet and structures the class really well.",5.0,2.0,Laura Henigman
452,"This class taught me a lot, but a lot of it was useless. It requires a lot of work outside of class, including several papers.

453,"Such a nice woman!! She's very passionate about what she teaches and it shows. Definitely asks for you to read a ton, but it's not necessary if you're engaged during the discussion, which is a must.

454,"There are a good amount of readings but most of it you can learn from the discussions. Every topic is so interesting and she is amazingly knowledgeable on what she teaches. Morning lectures, unless there is a film on Monday and then you won't have morning class. I would definitely take it again, do it if you want an easy Gen Ed.",5.0,2.0,Laura Henigman
455,She is a sweet woman but a terrible professor she expects you to remember every word she says in lecture or you will get points taken off of the quizzes. There is 4 papers one is in class and she expects it to be just as good as the ones you do at home. She also is all over the place in lecture. Again she is a sweet woman but not understanding!,1.0,4.0,Laura Henigman
456,"This class was both very enjoyable and enlightening, despite it being my earliest class all semester! Professor Henigman is smart, encouraging, and accessible.

457,"I really enjoyed this class. It is an easy A but its also inspiring. She changed my outlook on a lot of things. Class is only discussions, a few papers, and quizzes (drops 2). Talk a lot in class and stop by her office hours and she'll love you. A lot of reading but totally doable. Best gened for this cluster!",5.0,1.0,Laura Henigman
458,Expect to read about 30 pages of textbook before each class. Nice person but her lectures are really boring. She will talk about the readings for the entire hour and half while you sit quietly and try not to fall asleep. Probably should pay attention tho because the passages/sentences she talks about will appear on the quizzes every Thursday.,1.0,4.0,Laura Henigman
459,Absolutely wonderful teacher.  Just skim over the readings before class and have some things to say and you'll be golden. She's a techer that actually makes you think about life and have interesting conversations rather than just memorizing facts. It's conversation based and is definitely an easy A gen-ed if you're okay with talking. Easy grader.,5.0,1.0,Laura Henigman
460,The AMST 200 course is an awesome course! Six times a semester you meet up to watch a movie about the topic you are studying and they are really interesting movies!

461,"This was the easiest class I've ever taken, but still extremely interesting. Prof. Henigman is also very awesome. You don have to buy a textbook, instead you print off reading each night. I never print them off/ read them because you go over everything in class. The quizzes are just over what you discuss in class. Highly recommend!!! TAKE HER!!",5.0,1.0,Laura Henigman
462,He was one of my favorite professors at SFA. He made class that enjoyable and really wanted to teach all his students. I was devastated to hear of his passing a few months ago. It's hard for me to think of a teacher I would have recommend more to anybody going to SFA. Having him this spring during covid helped keep me sane. Thank you Dr. Collier.,5.0,3.0,Ken Collier
463,Dr. Collier is an excellent professor. He makes sure that everyone has their voice heard in class discussion and that no one feels excluded because of how you sway politically. He's very focused on ensuring that his students are prepared for what comes after colleges and does all he can to guide students to future jobs.,5.0,3.0,Ken Collier
464,"Had Dr. Collier for PSC 141 & 142. Very laid back teaching style. Grading criteria is simple and fair to everyone. Only 3 tests for the semester (4th optional), so take good notes during lectures. Most test questions (mult. choice) come from lecture notes and power points, but READ chapters. FANTASTIC TEACHER! Definitely recommend this class!",5.0,4.0,Ken Collier
465,"This class consists of 3 tests and two writing assignments, the final is optional. Attendance is a part of your grade and its pretty lecture heavy but Professor Collier really cares about your success. He goes out of his way to provide review sessions before tests and will help you as much as you need.",4.0,2.0,Ken Collier

467,"Best professor I have ever had. He is super excited about the subject matter and knowledgeable enough to explain the information simply. He is super involved in his students outside of class. He has two textbooks to read, but most test material come from lecture. Three tests and final, drops lowest test. Definitely recommend.",5.0,2.0,Ken Collier
468,"Dr. Collier is, by far, the best teacher I have had at SFA so far. He cares about his students, is super funny, and teaches in a laid-back sort of way that I really enjoyed.

469,Professor Collier is one of the best Political Science professors here at SFA! As long as you show up to class and take very well detailed notes you should pass the class with no problem.

473,"Gives great lectures. I enjoyed the time in the beginning of class when we talked about current events/issues. The class is easy if you review the key terms, topics, and big concepts in the books. You don't need to read all of the textbook/s to do well, just know the definitions from the book. Some of the things he says in class are on the exams.",5.0,2.0,Ken Collier
474,"He makes the class interesting and does not present his personal biases, which was refreshing. He is kind of goofy and fun. The only con is that he docks a point off of your attendance grade every time you are late or absent. I was always 5 min. late, so my final grade was a B even though I got A's on all the tests.",4.0,2.0,Ken Collier
475,"Two books, one of which is partially written by him. An overall amazing professor. If you happen to miss class, or in my case, a whole paper, he's sympathetic and will still give you a chance. Easy to follow powerpoints. Two papers (very short) and Exams are fairly easy so long as you follow the study guides. He posts all his powerpoints on D2L.",5.0,1.0,Ken Collier
476,"His lectures are interesting and his exams relate to the lecture with the exception of a few questions about the chapter readings. He requires the same book for both 141 and 142, which is helpful in making what student pay for the textbook worth the buy.",5.0,3.0,Ken Collier
477,"Professor Collier is a great teacher. He gives great lectures that are easy to follow. His tests arent hard, if you study the review and read the book youll do great.

Also, takes the time to ask for announcements before beginning class, including sports, fine arts, or anything relevant to SFA.",5.0,1.0,Ken Collier
480,"Professor Collier is a really great teacher. His lectures are interesting and he makes them relative to his students. He always opens up the floor for anyone who wants to talk about whatever.  His tests aren't too hard, just make sure you read the textbook and stay up to date on current events. I highly recommend taking his class.",5.0,2.0,Ken Collier
481,"Should buy the books, they're relatively cheap as well.  Everything that will be on the test is in the power points that he will post online.  Gives a study guide for each test and is available for office hours which really helped me clarify things. Final is optional!!",5.0,1.0,Ken Collier
482,"I just finished 243 with Lalonde and he was for sure one of my favourite professors this term.

485,"Chris may be my favourite prof. I looked forward to every lecture because of the stories he would tell. He is absolutely hilarious, but in the way where he doesn't even know he's that funny. Study the lecture slides and read the textbook and you'll be set. The 3 exams are worth 30% each and take up most of your mark but there is 10% in bonus too",5.0,3.0,Chris Lalonde
486,"I really enjoyed Lalondes class and he makes it really fun to attend because he finds interesting videos or clips that help you understand the content better. This class was ALL tests and maybe a few other assignments, but the tests were also fair and had no surprises. He told you exactly what would be on the exam beforehand too",3.0,3.0,Chris Lalonde

Overall, if you try and will do well in his class.",5.0,2.0,Chris Lalonde
489,"Fantastic lecturer as someone who is a visual learner, his use of videos for many topics made me remember the material. He has funny stories in class to tie things together and answers questions as well as he can after class. He does truly care but you gotta show up to class. FYI the first exam is the hardest but it gets better, promise!",5.0,3.0,Chris Lalonde
490,"You are graded ONLY on tests, but it isn't clear what he will be testing (if it is mostly on the lectures or the textbook readings). The lectures are long and jam-packed with information, and he goes fast in lectures. He shows lots of videos to show clear examples and cracks jokes often, but I would rather him be more clear of his testing methods.",3.0,2.0,Chris Lalonde
491,"His lectures were organized, he was easy to follow and clear. Broke up the lectures with videos. Funny guy too. Lecture slides are in-depth, so if you mainly focus on knowing and understanding lecture slides and go over textbook readings you will do well! Lectures a little boring to follow along at times. His tests are very reasonable.",4.0,2.0,Chris Lalonde
492,"Love this man. This class was incredibly easy and so interesting. Three exams and a 5% bonus participation mark. Getting an A+ is easy! I didnt read the textbook once, rather just looked up quizlets of other peoples cue cards from the text! Lalonde tells dark jokes and is so monotone but actually hilarious if you give him a chance!",4.0,1.0,Chris Lalonde
493,"A really nice guy, but the course is weird. You're only graded by 2 midterms and a final, and half of the stuff he includes in his lectures are irrelevant or anecdotal. He spends too much time telling his own life stories and showing useless videos instead of focusing on explaining core concepts of the course.",3.0,2.0,Chris Lalonde
494,"At first, I did not like the class. However, Dr Lalonde's sense of humor and his eclectic methods of teaching have won me over by the end. I found his first midterm quite difficult but, after realizing what his exact expectations were, the other two exams were much easier. Read the textbook carefully, watch the videos, attend lectures and listen.",5.0,3.0,Chris Lalonde
495,Dr. Lalonde is super nice and comical. You can really learn a lot from his experience but his classes can be extremely dull. It was rough to try and pull your grade up when the only thing you are graded on is the exams which are 35% every time. You don't need to go to class at all and will still pass. READ THE TEXTBOOK and lectures for exams.,3.0,4.0,Chris Lalonde
496,What I like about Lalonde Challenging but fair Cares about his students and does respectfully get back to them most of the time We had a good rapport I cared so he cared Care about your education and you'll do fine You do need to read the textbook make sure to summarize and study key terms,4.0,4.0,Chris Lalonde
497,"I am an upper level student and I found the exam unnecessarily hard. He went over the lecture notes but failed to mention that there would be many questions that weren't in the lecture. Also, he had too many answers to multiple choice that were ALL TRUE, and you had to pick the ""most"" true. His lectures aren't worth attending if you read the book.",2.0,4.0,Chris Lalonde
498,He had some interesting political views. He was passionate about what he taught which was good. He is kind of a stubborn guy regarding how he teaches. I found I just could not keep up with what he was saying in the lecture so I mostly studied the book but I still earned from his lectures.,3.0,4.0,Chris Lalonde
499,"Lalonde seems really interested in his researvh areas, and is very engaging when he speaks to these. Unfortunately, most of the time this is not the case; he seemed as bored reading off of a website as the students did. Study hard for exams; much different from lectures.",3.0,3.0,Chris Lalonde
500,Lalonde is a really good professor. His exams are extremely fair - if you don't do well it's because you didn't study. The exams test on the information directly from his notes - no surprises - just study the material well. He uses relevant examples to make concepts clear so it is a good idea to attend lectures but not a big deal if you miss a few.,5.0,3.0,Chris Lalonde
501,Reads directly off of his slides in class and speaks very quietly-lectures are dull. Hands tests back fairly fast. Gives 6 written questions to prepare for before the test then 3 on the test which is nice. Few opportunity for bonus marks. Gives specific textbook pages although they are somewhat unrelated to his notes. Notes are kind of confusing.,3.0,4.0,Chris Lalonde
502,"Overall he is a great professor and his energy is sky rocket high that it literally just gets hilarious listening to his lecture videos. He answers emails quite momentarily and he explains very thoroughly. On the contrary, when providing feedback to the students he is quite critical, but he wants to ensure students learn from their mistakes.",4.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
503,"Really good professor who takes his time to explain anything youre struggling with. He tries to make time for group work, and is available outside of class times for additional help if needed. Can be pretty picky about notation on turned in assignments but nothing that cant be fixed. Gave worksheets before tests which were very helpful as well.",4.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
504,"I really enjoyed Haberman's classes! It sounds like he's really hit his groove with the distance learning, and he has several really good videos of his lectures prerecorded. He is pretty picky on his assignments, and will take small deductions off for little things, but never enough to change the overall grade, just enough to make you think.",5.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
505,"He overexplains simple concepts to the point of confusion, and is so high energy it gets tedious. Everything he says starts to blur together, and I found myself nodding off in almost every class. Math is hardly ever difficult for me, and I already knew the concepts from this class from high school, but I struggled with this teacher.",1.0,3.0,Peter Haberman

507,"Taking this class online is a little bit more of a struggle. Peter doesn't seem to have the hang of D2L so coursework is listed under discussions. That said, he is a good professor if you complete the homework and follow test reviews you'll pass. He does give borderline degrading feedback but I think he means well and still gives partial credit.",4.0,3.0,Peter Haberman
508,"I think Peter is a probably a good teacher, just not one that's cut out for distance learning. I regret taking this class online, but don't completely blame him for how confused I was. You will definitely be doing most of the learning on your own. Trig is an intense subject, but it will follow you around forever. Make sure you actually understand!",3.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
509,"I dont understand people on here saying he responds to questions rudely or insufficiently. I probably annoyed the hell out of him from sending long emails asking questions about math, and he always gave me long and thorough answers. He made me actually like math, too. I didn't do great in his class but thats my own fault. His notes are bomb, too.",5.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
510,Worst math professor/strictest grader that I've ever had. He is distracted by everything and he bunny trails every single class period. Takes an hour to teach a topic that should take 10 mins. Google taught me more in two hours than he has taught me this entire term. Homework feedback is degrading VERY unhelpful.,1.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
511,"He breaks concepts down in a way that helps a student like me (who has trouble) understand things. He constantly reiterates things so students understand thoroughly. He is super eccentric and talks about strange things at times, like a stereotypical higher level math teacher. But I honestly thought this was funny and made the class less boring.",4.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
512,"I took his online class, If you want to teach yourself an entire math course this is the class for you. Very little homework, Very little instruction, tests are huge! So if that's how you work great! Also I found he took points off of problems for very small things even when I would get the answer right.",2.0,3.0,Peter Haberman
513,"Maybe he's better in person, but his online course is awful. There are no lecture videos, no outside materials, nothing other than the textbook and a supplemental packet that contradicts the book, you're just teaching yourself. Leaves constant condescending remarks on turned in work. YouTube is better, take this with a different teacher!",1.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
514,"Took his online class. The material was barely covered and discussed, and the comments he'd leave on worksheets were rude and patronizing. I learned more from searching on Google than I did from his class. Sometimes the way of solving or formatting a problem that he'd explain would get me docked points as being wrong. Avoid this teacher.",1.0,4.0,Peter Haberman
515,"Haberman is a good professor. You don't need to show up in class often and No quizzes in class. Only graded worksheet and finish it at home. He'll always be there when you have any questions. But, you have to prepare pretty well for 3 exams in a whole term.",5.0,3.0,Peter Haberman
516,Professor Haberman is a great teacher! He truly cares about his students. I took his class online and felt that it was really difficult.

It is tempting to skip lectures but don't.,5.0,1.0,Robert Morgan

1644,I do NOT recommend you take this class. He is a pretty chill sweet guy however his teaching is awful. He is also not easy to understand.

His passing rate is very low and refuses to make study guides.,1.0,5.0,Honqi Li
1645,Dr. Li was hard to understand at first but you get used to it. Every class you do a lecture and then have a pop quiz and online quiz. I suggest printing the slides every lecture.

1646,"Dr. Li is very nice. He enjoys getting to know students. I didn't like how he taught the class. It was a lot of information (especially on cells) and he wouldn't explain a lot of things.

1652,Plant Evolution and Diversity. I have nothing good to say about this class or the professor. Grading is almost arbitrary. Impossible to get full credit on ANYTHING besides online quizzes unless he loses your assignment. Took points off a lab I completed for not having a parallel line pointing to 1 plant structure. This class will test your resolve.,1.5,4.0,Honqi Li

1654,"I had Dr. Li for bio 150 lab and you cant understand what he says, he  doesnt teach very well. Also for the lab assignments he doesnt actually grade his own students work. A grad student does and that same student also gets all other lab teachers assignments to grade. He hurts you because he doesnt teach you what you need to know for the papers.",1.5,4.0,Honqi Li
1655,"Such a terrible class. Never learned a thing. Memorized his study guides and did OK on his tests. He will not help you and will tell you to ask other studnets in the class.

Quizzes are a lot like exams.",3.5,5.0,Robert Brooks

2270,I really loved the class the only thing i disliked is that our final counts for so much of the grade (30%). If you don't do the homework in depth you won't know the material for class.

She asked short answer questions that we talked about for like 10 minutes instead of the stuff she talked about in great detail. SO much memorization was needed.,3.0,4.0,Neelima Sinha
2314,"She is not as bad as people make her sound, but she is indeed disorganized and does not test on material she emphasizes in class. You have to know tiny details hidden in the power points to do well on her exams. Make sure to listen to her podcasts and start studying early.",3.0,4.0,Neelima Sinha
2315,"I really loved Sinha's lectures. She's incredibly knowledgeable, but also a super nice person in OH. My advice: take VERY detailed notes + revise them with the lecture videos, and give yourself ample time to study for the tests, because there is a ton of information in Bis2c to learn. Lots of extra credit.",5.0,4.0,Neelima Sinha
2316,I took a course that was taught by professor Sinha and two other professors and her part of the course was the most confusing and least informative. I can see her efforts but I honestly did not think it worked out in the end and a lot of people I know struggled through the course because of her.,2.0,4.0,Neelima Sinha
2317,"Sinha is not a well-organized professor and does not express care for her students. Not helpful during office hours at all and makes you feel dumb when asking questions:( study guides do not match test at all so don't base studying off of it. Work with TAs to learn the plant material. Try to avoid taking her, wasted studying time on class.",1.0,4.0,Neelima Sinha
2318,If you want a decent professor that will actually teach you something about plants avoid this professor. The only thing she will do is confuse you with her disorganized PowerPoint slides and drop your grade with her tests that don't test anything we cover in class. whatever she teaches you is not tested. study guides are USELESS,1.0,5.0,Neelima Sinha
2319,"Out of the three profs I had for bis 2c, she was the worst. She taught the plant section and made me hate plants. Her study guides are useless trash and she will test you on a detail that was not even emphasized during lectures. Her slides are often disorganized and makes things very confusing by using her stylus and writing on her tablet. AVOID.",1.0,5.0,Neelima Sinha

2321,"Dr. SInha is a very nice lady, but her lectures are poorly organized. Not just her, but the prof she co-lectures with.

I don't recommend taking her class.",2.5,5.0,Neelima Sinha

2326,It was a fun class but the whole observing a child in their home thing was no easy task. I had to go 5 times to someone's home and it felt kind of intrusive.

2327,"Professor Corona was a very sweet teacher. She has very clear grading criteria, and as long as you participate and show effort you should pass with an A.

Awesome class.",5.0,2.0,Augustine McDaniel-Smith
2345,She is a very poor professor. Gives very little feedback; if any. She does not clearly outline what is expected from your work. Does not respond to any messages.

2347,If you're a lazy student looking for an easy A I suggest taking this class over the summer for she caters heavily towards those students.

Hysterical and has a lot of good life experience to share.,3.0,2.0,Augustine McDaniel-Smith

I do not recall having homework, if so not often.",4.0,2.0,Augustine McDaniel-Smith

Tests aren't hard but they can be tricky. Overall an ok class.",3.0,3.0,Augustine McDaniel-Smith

Just read the BOOK and take NOTES!",1.0,3.0,Augustine McDaniel-Smith
2363,"She's halarious! With a bunch of stories. Your grade is based off of about 10 take home (20 question) ""tests"". And 2 exams which are probably take home also if you are on her good side. The tests aren't common sense but they're TAKE HOME. Don't stress out when the it looks like the class is unorganized. It took me until the third test to figure out how get an A in the class.

You won't regret taking her class.,5.0,1.0,Rosmarie Elizondo

2766,"Jonathan was good.  Best teacher I had at MATC.  Just write papers and you will be fine.  I got a B and didn't put in that much effort. Just remember, history is writing.  This is not highschool!  If you can't write and can't speak and can't read, don't take the class. Duh!  Nice guy too.  Very helpful.  Lots of rewrites! I took as a freshman.  ",4.5,3.0,Jonathan Pollack
2767,"This guy does NOT grade fairly. I took two of his classes, writing 3 papers each for my entire grade. He expects you to write 10 pages on a subject that can be adequately covered in 5. He will not be clear on what makes a ""proposal"" different from an outline. He goes off on boring tangents. I could easily write 10 pages on how much of a joke he is.",3.0,4.0,Jonathan Pollack

2769,Worst class EVER. I'm a straight A student and I failed this class. His expectations are waaaaaaaay too high and he won't stop talking about his glory days at the UW and their expectations. He's the only teacher that has made me cry.,2.5,5.0,Jonathan Pollack
2770,He is by far the worst History teacher I have ever had. His grading scale makes no sense at all. He will grade your assignments on literature and grammatical errors instead of the history. I felt like I was in English 101. Never taking him again.,2.5,4.0,Jonathan Pollack
2771,"He would be better as a guidance counselor then anything. He was willing to help students on rewrites if they didn't do a good job on their paper. However, he was very strict on grading.

3185,"He provides lecture notes, but they are very unorganized and involve a lot of unnecessary detail, and he doesn't tell us what is important for us to know.

3187,"Would not recommend taking this class summer quarter with him. Study by reading his notes. He covers what's needed during lectures but spends time talking about topics ""we don't need to know."" He talks a lot about A&P and what you need to know for that. Brings up politics a lot. The lab portion is very fun! Very kind man, not rude at all.",3.0,4.0,Jamey Marsh
3188,"Probably one of the best if not the best instructor Ive even taken. Sets you up to be successful as the course outline, notes and study guide is CLEARLY laid out. Class is really interesting and the instructor cares. Make sure you print his notes, read and Do the study guide it totally pays off!",5.0,3.0,Jamey Marsh
3189,Professor Marsh is one of those people that REALLY enjoys his job. He is lecture heavy so read beforehand so you can keep up with him in class. He does a good job at explaining the material in different ways so that the class can understand it as easily as possible. He will also review the chapters before the quiz as a refresher! Don't skip class!,4.0,3.0,Jamey Marsh
3190,"Amazing teacher, sets his students up for success! Follow his study guides and lecture notes and you can easily get a good grade (book helps but his notes cover about 95% of what you have to learn). He curves his class which can easily bump you up a full letter great! I highly recommend him!!!!!!",5.0,3.0,Jamey Marsh
3191,"Marsh is great. I thought that Micro would be almost impossible after getting a B in Bio 160, but I was wrong. Half-way through our quarter, there were 11 students out of 30 with over 100% and the bulk of us had over 90% because of his steep curve. Marsh really cares about students. Grade is a final, a group project, a lab project, and six quizzes.",5.0,4.0,Jamey Marsh
3192,"I really enjoyed my microbiology class, hes not overbearing, allows you to make mistakes & learn but is always there to address and concerns.  Clear testing and expectations. One test is rather difficult but he grades based off the highest test so it always improves your grade.",5.0,4.0,Jamey Marsh

3194,"Favorite class at Clark. Super interesting, but there is a lot of reading and you need to study. If you're good with that, then you will be just fine. He curves his exams (or quizzes? can't remember) at the end. This helps your grade a lot. I had a B- the whole quarter and when he curved quizzes/tests & put in our presentation & final, I got an A.",5.0,4.0,Jamey Marsh
3195,P. Marsh is very clear in communicating the information in his lectures. In a 200 level science class the lecture and information presented is challenging so efforts important. In group project he graded me down for my information being to detailed and presenting too quiet. To me we should be graded for the precise info not how well we present.,3.0,3.0,Jamey Marsh
3196,"I had Marsh for my micro lab. The lab is so much fun, modules aren't graded but you do get points for following lab protocol. He is super clear and helpful with the labs. There is one group project and pretty much all the work for it is outside of class.",5.0,2.0,Jamey Marsh
3197,"Pretty typical science class, lecture and weekly tests.  He grades on the curve, so don't stress if you don't get excellent test scores, most students will still get an A.  All of the microbiology classes have interchangeable curriculum that includes an unknowns project and a group research/presentation project. He is friendly and helpful.",4.0,3.0,Jamey Marsh
3198,"Mr. Marsh is very excited about teaching anything science related.  He is helpful with researching answers to questions, but does not like having his views discussed beyond what he offers.

He was very helpful and made sure we were ready to perform our own lab experiments. ",5.0,3.0,Jamey Marsh
3201,"I loved Mr. Marsh, these classes were very hard, a lot of studying and an amazing amount of homework, but these classes are hard in general.

I had fun during labs, lectures are a bit tough, but it was very worth it in the end. ",4.5,4.0,Jamey Marsh
3202,"Prof Marsh is great in the aspect that he is very kind and has a vast amount of knowledge in Bio. His testing style killed me. Only 4 tests for a whole book sounds great right? Yeah, no. That means every test is 3-5 chapters of info. Even if you do reading, hit lectures, use his notes and study questions. Half or more of the class dropped. ",4.0,4.0,Jamey Marsh
3203,"Early on he's critical of grammar mistakes. As the semester progressed he seemed more concerned with content as opposed to grammar.

3212,"Chris's class is pretty laid back. The grading revolves around four easy essays, a research paper, and a written midtermfinal.

It's overall relaxed and easy.",3.5,2.0,Chris Paquette

3217,"One of my favorite teachers ever. I took his night class, and he loved it. it was a 7-10pm class and never got bored or tired He was always excited to be there, and was very helpful.

3223,He seems to have stuck with the same processes for years and has never innovated his teaching style or class format. The homework is incredibly straight forward and actually allows you to learn. The exams are a different story. He has no questions from either the homework or workbook that prepare you for the tests. 75 percent of the grade is exams.,2.0,5.0,Mark McLeod

He also expects you to understand everything the first time you learn it no exceptions.",3.0,4.0,Mark McLeod
3227,"I honestly don't understand how he got good reviews. He is a very tough grader who can be very rude and mean depending on his mood.

Even I take the same class again, I don't think I'll be able to do better",2.0,5.0,Mark McLeod
3228,"The class is very easy in hindsight. The homework is relatively simple and the tests are mainly just rewritten examples in class or homework.

Getting one question wrong could cost you 16%.",4.0,4.0,Mark McLeod

I wish there were another prof to retake it with.",2.0,5.0,Mark McLeod
3234,Professor McLeod seems like a great person and is a good teacher but the homework does very little to prepare you for the exam and he does not create practice exams.

3390,Worst professor for this class. Love the class material but she assigned way too much work for a gen ed class. Not to mention she basically completely ignored her students when classes became online.,1.0,5.0,Jill Hersh
3391,"Prof Hersh was pretty nice and somewhat laid back. Some days she was stricter than others, but overall her class wasn't too bad. She does talk A LOT, and her class is basically just all reading articles and writing papers. It's a decent amount of work, so if you're looking for a simple class, I probably wouldn't take her. Overall, the work is easy.",3.0,3.0,Jill Hersh

3394,Very structured an organized class. Great teacher. Straight forward with what she expects from you. As long as you complete the work and put in effort this can be an easy A. Took this class as a summer course- was a bit tiering having to write a paper every day but it was manageable.,5.0,2.0,Jill Hersh
3395,"As many women's studies courses, this class is mainly discussion based. There are a total of 10 short papers and then two projects, a mid term and a final. Over all she is a solid choice, she is an easy grader and as long as you try you can get an A. She is a nice woman who just wants to teach and loves what she does.",4.0,2.0,Jill Hersh
3396,Professor Hersh is very unorganized and doesn't respond to emails on time or forgets to open your emails. She was funny at times and I really enjoyed the readings from the book.

3397,"Dr. Hersh is a great professor. The papers may seem like a lot, but realistically, they're easy A's.

I could not respect this woman more.",5.0,1.0,Jill Hersh
3398,Professor Hersh was great. Very easy to talk to and an easy grader. I would definitely take her again. She's unorganized but that benefited me. You need to put in very little effort. If you do the papers you will pass. I wish I can take her again.,5.0,1.0,Jill Hersh
3399,"Easy grader, but it's an interesting course. I went into it thinking it would be a men-bashing feminism course, but I actually learned a lot.

3400,"There is a TON of reading and just as much writing to go along with the reading. It's not a class to take when you have a heavy course load, but it was one of the best classes I took.

3403,Professor Hersh makes things extremely unclear. It is impossible to know exactly what she wants from you unless you ask (the syllabus is impossible to comprehend) and even then the guidelines are hard to understand. Several essays and three assignments in which you must watch movies at home and answer study guide questions. Nothing is on canvas. The syllabus is more strict than she is. I've never done more unnecessary reading in my life.,2.0,4.0,Jill Hersh
3404,"She is very unclear and disorganized. She assigns videos to watch for homework and then questions to answer,but she does not give trigger warnings for them.

3406,"Pretty leanient grader- even if you hand in things late. Class was mostly discussion based with a few papers, we got behind on the syllabus a few weeks in, and instructions on assignments aren't always clear, but if you do the papers you can get an A or B pretty easily, the class itself was pretty informational and enjoyable.

I will be avoiding her for the rest of of my time here at HSU.",1.0,5.0,Anne Paulet
3410,"This class was easy until we got to resumes. She told me to take off all my non-history related job experiences on mine.

Not accommodating at all given COVID going on.",1.0,2.0,Anne Paulet
3411,"She told us in her exact words to suck it up and buy Microsoft Word, even though many students (including me) dont have the money.

Those are the words that Anne told us at the start of the semester, and I didn't think she was serious till I was crying every other day near the middle of the semester. Simply put, there's a lot of unnecessary work and assignments are designed to trick you. I gained nothing from this class except stress.",2.0,5.0,Anne Paulet
3413,"The lack of empathy and understanding of learning styles really makes her teaching detrimental to others. There was a lot of lack of communication on what she wanted one to get out of the information and even the work itself. Nothing sticks out more than her saying in one lecture to ""suck it up and buy microsoft word."" ignoring others circumstance",1.0,3.0,Anne Paulet
3414,Anne is an amazing professor and truly goes above and beyond for her students. She does assign a lot of homework and readings but they all come together to help you become a better student and a better historian. She does not get the credit she deserves in the history department and is very easy to approach outside of class.,5.0,4.0,Anne Paulet
3415,"Anne Paulet pretty much just reads from her slide notes the entire period, rarely taking a break to answer questions or have a class discussion. She assigns WAY too many group projects that require a LOT of time at home to complete. I feel like I could get the same education by just reading her power points at home. AWFUL TEACHER.",1.0,4.0,Anne Paulet
3416,"A waste of my time. So many assignments that feel as though they belong in a 3rd grade class. Attendance is worth a huge portion of the grade and its almost impossible to sit though one of her lectures. She will spend whole class periods talking about organization and time management, and stuff the majority of us already know. Not a college class!!",2.0,1.0,Anne Paulet
3417,"Anne's lectures were very long and dense. There were a lot of papers to write that had a lot of weight on your grade.

3418,"Anne is an amazing professor. She sets high expectations and is very tough, but you'll learn a lot. A former student of hers correctly advised me ""you'll feel like you're failing the entire time, but if you do all the work you'll get an A."" Make friends, you'll need them. PS going to class is worth it just to see her shoes. Best dressed hands down.",5.0,5.0,Anne Paulet
3419,I hated this class. I didn't like the professor. I love History and Paulette genuinely made me dislike it. I did my homework but for some reason she failed me.

Intimidating but a wealth of information.",4.5,4.0,Anne Paulet
3423,"Anne Paulet is a great teacher. She tends to grade hard but if you do what she wants you'll get a good grade.

3622,Absolutely a great professor. Tests are taken directly from the notes and maybe a few from the readings. Classes are VERY interesting.

3719,"Terry blows the trumpet so well. Unfortunately, he also blows on all else: his teaching, committee work, and advising. His insecurities make him a stubborn, narrow-minded, defensive type.

I feel like he grades better than the TAs",3.0,4.0,Patrick Finelli
4739,"I took this class to boost my gpa. Way too much work for a class that should be simple. Yes, you watch movies, but you also have to do a lot of reading.

4743,"He takes this course way too seriously, the TA's are super strict on grading.

I got a better grade in Managerial Accounting, rather than this course.",1.0,3.0,Patrick Finelli
4744,Mr. Finelli was a very mediocre professor who let peers instead of him determine the grade a student gets.

The class was okay but this professor definitely does not need to be teaching.,1.0,4.0,Patrick Finelli
4745,"I took this as a winter semester course and it was so easy. You barely write anything, and what you do write is simple to write about. If you have done a sport and/or performed, you could easily pass this class with an A with minimal effort. Easy class and fun class.",5.0,1.0,Patrick Finelli
4746,Way to tough on the grading of papers. You are graded by TA's and not the teacher. Lots of papers to do. No book is needed for the course.

However, I definitely learned a lot and it was beneficial!",3.0,3.0,Jason Zimmer

4837,"Mr. Jason is seriously a great Professor! If you have him for Draw100, its much easier to go in with a drawing background, but he made it very clear for those that didnt that drawing is a learned skill and they improved dramatically. He didnt grade anything until midterms to actually develop our skills & you dont get many projects, but its ok.",5.0,2.0,Jason Zimmer
4838,"Professor Zimmer is a pretty laid back person. But it can be really hard to get an A if you are not good at drawing.

I wish I had the opportunity to take him for a painting class too. 10/10",5.0,3.0,Jason Zimmer

Very understanding of outside circumstances, but can be a little strict when it comes to deadlines.",4.0,4.0,Jason Zimmer
4843,"Zimmer's life drawing class is super chill and easy going, mostly just graphite work but some projects have room for different media exploration.

4848,"Had him for DRAW100 and he was a friendly guy. I would've preferred tougher grading, but I still improved a lot and so did the rest of the class.

4849,He is a good teacher and the self portraits from first vs last week of class showed a lot of improvement however the quiz of the names of the muscles and bones I found pointless and I feel like he definetly favored the people that were already good at drawing bodies. Hes a nice guy though,3.0,3.0,Jason Zimmer
4850,"Zimmer is a wonderful professor. I didnt realize how much Id learned till the last day and it was A LOT. He is a tough grader though, and can be vague as to why he gave you the grade he did.

5385,Professor Cohen is honestly the best. i learned so much and she explains everything in detail. She also reviews before the test and the tests and quizzes are based on the exact questions that she says. I love her i got an A,5.0,3.0,L Cohen
5386,Cohen is a wonderful professor. She is so smart and knows everything there is to sociology. There is a lot of reading involved towards the beginning of the semester but do not let that scare you away because you would be missing out on one of the best classes this college has to offer.

5393,"Overall, she knows her stuff.  You have to work for a good grade, but she's not a hard grader most of the time. Most of the weight rests on journals, and one of her exams is take-home. Reading is a must in her class, as is participation. Talk and do the assignments on time and you'll be fine (she even allows rewrites).",4.0,2.0,L Cohen
5394,You try so hard to do well but she just never fully explains the material. You have to write 2 papers in her class the first one is 10 pages and if you don't do it she says to drop her class because you won't pass. The second paper is min.5 pgs long and its on an interview. You HAVE to read the readings or else don't to class.,2.0,4.0,L Cohen

5402,"Don't take her. Anatomy is a hard class already. You don't need to be burdened by a teacher who doesn't know anything about what she is teaching. If you ask her questions about the material, she will tell you to ""Google it"" (Even if it is on material she just went over). Also watch your grades as she won't give you all of yours.",1.0,5.0,Jade Bost
5403,"Dr. Bost is rather scattered. If you take any class from her, make sure you track your points very carefully as math does not appear to be her strong point.  Asking questions and getting an answer was often not possible. She talks very fast and goes the the material rapidly-Good notes are key! Overall I was not impressed with her at all",2.0,4.0,Jade Bost
5404,"talks extremely fast, and won't slow down. Lab quizzes every lab day, based on previous lab. 5 exams on top of the final. Best advice if you get her- study everything, read her lectures and slides before class. Take notes off those and not her verbal lecture. She plagiarizes all her tests so Google helps. Not an easy class by any means.",2.0,5.0,Jade Bost
5405,"Jade is intelligent, she defentialy knows her stuff. When it comes to lecture I felt as she just read word for word what the power point says giving no examples, no explanation, so there was really no complete understanding. Basically felt like I had to teach myself alot, to get through. Lots of extra credit, and can fix your tests for extra points",3.0,4.0,Jade Bost
5406,"The course work IS hard and there IS a lot to learn. However, she dose give extra credit options and gives chances to better your over all grade with what is called a bonus week.

5407,"I highly recommend if you can take another professor, do it. Every lab you will have a quiz on the previous lab section done, there's about five assessments not including the final, and a research paper.

5408,"If you would like to learn anything, don't take this class.  She is rude and tries to make students look dumb. She plagiarizes test and won't be able to answer your questions without Google.

5409,"Jade is a great professor! She cares about the success of her students and wants them to do well. Quizzes are much easier than her tests. One downfall is her multiple choice tests.

5412,"she cant even answer questions off her own study guides, that she creates without googling it, and you still can't guarantee the answer that she gives you will be correct one. 90% of all her lab test will be on powerpoint slides, and 90% of the pictures she uses on her test will be terrible quality, and you're never quite sure what your looking at.",1.0,5.0,Jade Bost
5413,"Pros:  She does seem to know the material, gives opportunities for extra credit, and in my opinion genuinely tries to help students understand the material.  Cons:  She is a bit quirky, as a lot of professors tend to be.  She can come across as rude/arrogant, but I think that is mostly a result of her quirks.  Tests are hard; she makes you think.",3.5,4.0,Jade Bost

5420,"Without a doubt, the absolute worst instructor I have ever had. She speaks super fast (and won't slow down when asked), she is rude and arrogant. Your lucky if you get a 70% on her tests.

Although the required text for this class was the 3rd (e) of Berk's Lifespan Development, some of the questions on the test were direct phrases out of the 2nd edition or from a chapter other than the one we were being tested on.

6182,"This was a great online class! There is a quiz and a discussion every week (usually). And you must raise a virtual child. The weekly quizzes are open book and extremely easy. A 15 min scan before the quiz and good use of the glossary should suffice. Discussions take no more than an hour to complete per week. The virtual child was intriguing and very simple to do. There is a great amount of extra credit available! I got a 96%, easy! Prof. Orme really cares about the students and was flexible!",5.0,1.0,Denise Orme

Goes above and beyond,5.0,3.0,James Denison

6380,"His class was always interesting although he sometimes struggled with technical things, it was confusing to keep up with what assignments you had to do bc he always changed the requirements so basically just go to class to be able to keep up w constant changes. The class is overall easy and fun he is a very fun professor.",5.0,1.0,David Parsons
6381,David was really cool. I took this class online due to COVID and I really enjoyed it. The class itself is not a hard class. I missed several classes and he was able to work with me in order to make sure I catch up on missing assignments. He gives good feedback on how to improve your drawing skills. Really sweet professor.,5.0,1.0,David Parsons

6384,Very easy A class the thing is he isnt clear in the beginning of what he wants in the sketch book. So if u take this class take notes & draw whatever he does since day 1  because he grades it out of nowhere. Attendance is required & he is a very funny caring professor. Youll need colored pencils & a sketch book he provides the rest,5.0,4.0,David Parsons
6385,I took arts 301 for non-majors in the summer. I attended every class except on my birthday and I completed all assignments to the best of my ability and he gave me a C+. So annoying because he doesn't really give you a clear direction of what he's asking for. He also doesn't tell you what he's going to grade or how many points each assignment is.,3.0,3.0,David Parsons
6386,Prof. Parsons was a pretty cool teacher. I took his arts and crafts course and it is mostly drawing and painting. One of the biggest assignment of the class is a book that you draw/paint and then bind it yourself.  It's a cool class because you work with lots of new mediums. but be ready to spend around 80$ on supplies. but there is no textbook,4.0,2.0,David Parsons
6387,"This class was probably one of the hardest classes I've taken. It's a lot of work! Do not miss class because you will be very behind. Do as much extra credit as you possibly can, at the end of the semester it will pay off. Work on the sketchbook he assigns. Do not wait wait to the last minute on your final project!! Work on your book way in advance",3.0,4.0,David Parsons
6388,"This professor is definitely one of my faves so far at CSUDH. He is very clear in his instructions and helps you when asked. He gives a step to step demonstration on the different art assignments which makes it easier. There is a lot of work! And I mean ALOT. So don't expect this just to be an easy A. Overall, I loved this class!",5.0,3.0,David Parsons

6390,Amazing teacher and class! It's a lot of work and requires focus but the assignments are interesting and allows for you to be creative. He walks you through every step and then turns on music and allows you to be creative. He is helpful and is enthusiastic about helping you. Fun class,5.0,1.0,David Parsons
6391,"He seemed really uptight at first, but prove to be a very kind and helpful professor. He does not do arts and crafts but challenges students to harder assignments. Teaches transferrable art skills you can use later on. His class is a lot of work, but he is a benevolent grader.",5.0,1.0,David Parsons
6392,"This professor is AWESOME! By far one of my favorite classes in all 4 years as a college student. He is mellow but strict. He has great conversations with the students and is very helpful and passionate for ART. If you cant draw, nobody is judging but you. There are a lot of projects, but once he turns on the music he lets your creativity flow.",5.0,4.0,David Parsons
6393,"i loved this class. you cannot take this class thinking its easy because if you do not like art, it wont be. i had him for saturdays and we did a lot but of course we only saw him once a week so we had to get a lot done. I guarantee you will find a great improvement in your drawing and painting skills. do not leave things for last minute. trust me.",5.0,2.0,David Parsons
6394,Professor does not teach the course guideline.  Feels that arts and craft is too beneath him and only teaches fine arts.  This class is not for fine arts.,1.0,5.0,David Parsons
6395,"Of all the classes I have taken at CSUDH, this class was by far the hardest one ever.  I took a Saturday class thinking it would be an ""easy A"" but I never worked so hard!  So many assignments and the book at the end was such a chore to make.  He is very nice and very mellow and yes his slow way of speaking can put you to sleep but overall it was a",3.5,4.0,David Parsons
6396,The professor made us buy a lot of material on our own or we could get it from him for about $150. I suggest you share supplies with a classmate. I had a baby weeks before the semester was over. He let me turn in my work a week after everyone else thank God. We had to make a book and turned in a portfolio. Easy teacher just a lot of work.,4.0,2.0,David Parsons
6397,"He is so disappointing. I used to love this class, and I was among the best students in his class; but now I have the worst memory in my mind. I don't want to say more about the bad points you will encounter if he would be your teacher, but you will be disappointed.",3.5,5.0,David Parsons
6398,He is so so boring..do not take on saturdays he will have you make a book for the final which sounds easy but its not because you have to use all the techniques he showed you which by the way were excruciating to listen...i say stay away unless you can handle someone talking about art in a very slooooow manner...BORING,4.0,1.0,David Parsons
6399,I wish didn't have to take this class. I felt like I drew the same trees for most of the semester and it bored me to tears. I suck at art & I still wished we did something more challenging. Most of the projects are geared toward 3-d for 1/2 of the semester(??) He's nice but you do not leave feeling you learned anything.,1.5,1.0,David Parsons
6400,"Breaks up the lecture into mini videos which made it more appealing to watch. Class consists of weekly discussion posts, small writing assignment, midterm, and final. No need for textbook.

Two essay style tests (5-6 questions), lots of quizzes on 2 hours movies that you have to watch, and tons of reading (from two books and a few articles).

6697,"She has a passion for the art field, and she wants you to pass the class. There are 2-3 papers which are pretty simple, and a group project on whoever is relevant to the class. The book is only required for the papers, however there are some minor group discussions.",5.0,1.0,Kristin Moss

6699,You don't attend Thurs and have DBs about movies instead those days. Proceeded to look around at what people said the movie was about then pretend I watched it too.

6701,Professor Moss is my favorite teacher at CSUSM. She always communicates the subject matter in an interesting way so I am never bored or confused.

It was a fun class!,5.0,1.0,Kristin Moss
6702,"Super easy and enjoyable class. Two tests, one group project and a paper (which we didn't have to do).

6717,Quite simply one of my favorite professors. He has a vast wealth of real world experience and shares it all with you. If you show up and pay attention you will do well on the midterm and final. He gives one  short paper too that he grades very easily. Overall he does an excellent job of making a very complex and important topic easier to understand,5.0,3.0,Alan Robinson
6718,Classes seem long and he often goes on unrelated tangents. There's only a midterm and final so if you do bad on the midterm be careful. Curves about 10% or so each time. Used the book for two weeks for homework and then never assigned homework ever again.,3.5,2.0,Alan Robinson
6719,Participation is really curves your grade its 25% of your grade. I studied like crazy for the two exams you get throughout the semester and managed to get a B.

6723,He is one of the greatest profs in the school of business!! The class is not the easiest but you def learn alot.

6726,"Definitely teaches from experience. The book is unnecessary to buy, read his slides and you'll skate through. Interesting man and has a great sense of humor.

6729,Excellent Professor! Unfortunately he goes thru the material a little slow in the begining then rushes thru it towards the end. Over all he is a great teacher and uses his experience to relay information. The book is not mandetory but it helps.,4.5,2.0,Alan Robinson
6730,"He's great! Talks about real-world scenarios, makes law interesting and teaches it the way you would understand it, not the way the book teaches it. Tests are a little hard, but he curves! 2 exams and 1 take-home quiz. I would recommend him!",5.0,2.0,Alan Robinson
6731,"Great class. He uses powerpoints that follow the book, but pay attention because he explains well. You can use files stored on your M-drive during exams. He's a tough grader, but fair. Be sure to double-check your work before handing it in because he WILL penalize you for minor mistakes. Responds to emails promptly. Overall a great prof.",5.0,4.0,Antonio Costa
6732,"He is a good teacher. He does PowerPoint slides almost exclusively, but the tests are pretty close to what's covered. Tests make you think a quite bit and are in general a good challenge, his only real problem is that he's an unforgiving grader. Make sure everything is absolutely perfect before handing it in or your grade will be punished.",4.5,4.0,Antonio Costa
6733,"A lot of people will tell you that Costa's 384 is the hardest class you'll take in ECE, and they may be right. Homeworks are long and harshly graded. Exams are very intimidating, but doable.

6734,"Dr. Costa is an excellent professor and extremely fair with what he expects from his students. His exams are much based off the homework and class lectures but he always throws in a fair twist into a problem to see if you understand the material, which he cares very much about that you do. He really wants his students to learn and succeed. ",4.5,3.0,Antonio Costa
6735,"He's a decent professor but reads off slides almost exclusively. There are weekly homework assignments that are time demanding. He grades FAIR but hard. He's a very ""by the book"" type of professor. So don't expect him to bend too much for your sake. Overall though he's okay to recommend unless you have no other options (happens often).",3.0,4.0,Antonio Costa
6736,"Costa ended up being a better professor than I thought. He's incredible at explaining, and ensures that you understand everything he is trying to tell you and he's also very open for questions.

6737,"This class wasn't actually taught by Professor Costa, but his teaching assistant for the course. The book is very important, homework every week from the book and it's an easy read.

6738,"Very hard professor. He wants you to learn and will help you by answering questions in class. Labs are very hard and he will not give strieght forward answers during lab.

6739,"Uses powerpoint way too much, theres a reason viall hates them, they make the students lose interest in 5 minutes. Gives ample examples in the powerpoints, except they are all the same. Tests are stupid hard because he writes them last minute and has a stupid train of thought, asks for the most roundabout way of doing a problem. Chose viall instead",3.0,3.0,Antonio Costa

6742,"Costa was Dean for a reason. He's on the ball, knows his stuff, and gives 110% when teaching.

7021,"I used to be a music major before I switched to Physics. Even with my background this class is dull and uninteresting. Had I known before, I would not have taken the class; not because it was difficult but because it was tedious.",2.0,4.0,William Neely
7022,His lectures were pretty easy to follow and was very interesting. He helped me pass the class by giving a higher score than deserved on an assignment,4.0,4.0,William Neely
7023,"It states that you don't need to know some music to take this class, yet I'd recommend you should. The reading was heavy and the homework the teacher gave was not clear, nor did he offer any correction for them. Tests were heavily weighted compared to homework.  I do not wish to take another music class for an extremely long time.",2.0,4.0,William Neely
7024,He spent the first six weeks culling the class with nearly impossible exams and grading the weekly homework with an iron fist. Things got easier the second half but by no means easy. He offers extra credit which meant me spending $70 to see a live performance so I could do even more work in this work heavy class. Extremely serious and passionate.,2.0,5.0,William Neely
7025,Neely is monotone and his class is done through video lecture. That is a terrible combination. A 100-500 word response on what you learned that week is due every week and he is not clear on what should be included AT ALL! Don't bother emailing him because he will be defensive and rude if you do not understand the requirements. Don't waste your time,2.0,4.0,William Neely
7026,"If you take this class be prepared to drop it in the time allowed before the W. William  is arrogant and rude. He wishes he was at teaching at Harvard but apparently he's not THAT GOOD . His lectures were a waste of time and had nothing to do with the tests. How he still teaches at SRJC is beyond me, I guess no one else wants the job.",1.0,4.0,William Neely
7027,Neely has an arrogant and condescending tone on the message board (it's an online class).His tone has an impatient edge much of the time. The description of the class states that you don't need knowledge of music but it's ridiculously advanced material and the tests illustrate that. It seems he teaches to elevate himself rather than his students.,1.0,5.0,William Neely
7028,took the online class. Lectures were LONG. I studied lectures thoroughly at first but didnt find the first study guide which killed me on the first test. then i stopped watching his lectures and just studied the final study guide and aced the final. could have gotten a B but didnt know there were listening assignments. Dropped me down two grades.,2.5,3.0,William Neely
7029,"Although professor Neely's online lectures were well organized and informative, he was very unhelpful and rude to students. Many of his responses to questions were very condescending. He was defensive of his lectures, and would condemn students for not paying close enough attention, rather than try to help them to understand the subject matter.",2.0,3.0,William Neely
7030,"The instructor is passionate regarding the subject,but a little overboard in expectations for a basic class. His attitude that knowing what may be on an exam might cause one to focus on those points, rather than focus on the entire presentation suggests that the exams are based upon what he considers important,rather than on what one has learned.",2.0,4.0,William Neely
7031,"I absolutely hated this class and the professor.  His tests are horrible and super hard.  The fact that he does not give detailed study guides doesn't help study for his tests.  If you are the type of person who does not test well, but makes up for your grade by extra credit and homework, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Hated this class.",1.0,5.0,William Neely
7032,This class is very very challenging. I would NOT RECOMMEND it unless you are a music major or enthusiast with some prior knowledge of music theory or art history because those themes are much more relevant than the appreciation portion. Professor Neely is very knowledgeable and passionate and offers extra credit which saved me.,2.0,5.0,William Neely
7033,"I took this class online and loved it! Mr. Neely is wonderfully passionate and knowledgeable about the subject, which makes it even more fun to learn. I found the tests challenging but the coursework rewarding.  He also provides well laid out lectures, extra credit, and truely wants his students to  succeed, that's an A+ plus in my books.",5.0,4.0,William Neely
7034,I took this course online. The instructor was always helpful and offered two extra credit assignments. A previous poster lamented having to study--of course you will have to study. This instructor is passionate about music and I find that refreshing. This instrutor is engaging and cares about the success of his students.,5.0,4.0,William Neely
7035,"Not recommended for online courses. Answers emails quickly but doesn't read them carefully to answer your question. Relies heavily on the textbook and the included online homework, but doesn't answer questions using those concepts. The final has less than 20 questions, all absolute mastery level.",3.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7036,"As with most math classes, the hardest part was just ZONING IN. Once you do, you see that he actually does a great job of covering everything thoroughly and engaging the class via feedback. The Cons: His test-specific grading system is very obscure. He doesn't offer many chances for extra credit. Sometimes he can be a bit clumsy with work!",4.0,3.0,Justin Dunham
7037,Professor Dunham assigns weekly homework on MyMathLab that tend to go beyond his lectures in class. 5 tests make or break your grade and if you miss one you must rely on your final test score to make it up. HW is over 150 (5pt) Mastery quizzes you must get 66% or above to get credit. Started with almost a full Class and only seven or eight remain.,1.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7038,Professor Dunham as a person is great. Very accessible and nice. The summer semester College Algebra course was A LOT of work. 150 modules of homework that can take a significant amount of time to complete worth 225 points. Two tests worth 71% of your grade. Started the class with 28 and we ended with 10.,3.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7039,"He does the bare minimum to teach, breezes through material & does not like to explain concepts. Also, we used a book that was mainly online & this was not communicated well. I did not know how to use the book until 3 weeks into the semester. Do not take if you have not had a math course in a while.",2.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7040,I recently failed Intermediate Algebra in the fall but and had to retake it in the spring. Mr. Duham is amazing! His teaching is great and makes it easy to learn and understand. His grading is not harsh and he wants his students to succeed. I would recommend him to anyone who struggles with math. He is funny and cares about what he does.,5.0,3.0,Justin Dunham
7041,"He uses MyMathLab for all homework assignments. If you dont get a certain score on homework, you have to do it over and over again until you get his desired score. Sometimes its 10 questions sometimes its 50. Would not recommend If you struggle with math because he is no help.",2.0,3.0,Justin Dunham
7042,"He is a great teacher. He explains and details steps very thoroughly. Take good notes and you will do well. Do the assigned homework suggested problems and you will pass. He has a quiz with 2-3 problems each day and you can use your notes. The quizzes are graded with your top ten out of almost 25. His tests are tough, but grading is flexible.",4.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7043,"Professor Dunham is by far my favorite professor. He teaches everything you need to know in class, is available for students if they need help. There is no homework but online quizzes. I had to take this class again and the change in professor made such a difference!",5.0,3.0,Justin Dunham
7044,"I took this class because my aunt (who is younger than me and much smarter) took it and recommended this professor. When I took the class the teacher never had time to talk outside of class and would always tell me to go to the mathlab. He gives tons of tests, 1-2 per week and goes EXTREMELY fast! Math isn't my thing and he did not help!",1.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7045,"Professor Dunham is one of the best professors I've had at JCCC so far! I took him for MATH 116 during Fall 2016 and I took him for MATH 171 this past semester after failing it this past Spring. There is a lot of note taking, however, the notes are what contributes the most to your success in his class. He also offers several extra credit options!",5.0,2.0,Justin Dunham
7046,"Professor Dunham makes College Algebra easy to understand. He works out problems step by step on the board for you to see; sometimes he goes through the problems very quickly. He puts extra credit on exams, and this allows you to earn extra points if you do really well on the tests. The homework can be overwhelming at times.",4.0,3.0,Justin Dunham
7047,"Took Intermediate Algebra from him this fall. He is hands down awesome. Very clear explanation of problems, does everything on the board and welcomes questions. Super chill guy. He grades promptly. We are using ConnectMath and get LOTS of homework, though none of it is for credit, only practice. Quizzes every Mon. Easy A if you give the effort.",4.0,2.0,Justin Dunham
7048,"To me, professor Dunham was great. I have always struggled with math and for the first time in my life I have had an A all semester. He explains every problem in detail, gives plenty of tips on how to figure things out. I highly recommend going and seeing him outside of class for he is very genuine and wants you to succeed more than anything.",5.0,3.0,Justin Dunham
7049,"He is nice guy, teaching style is not bad but you would not believe amount of homework you going to get. I am naturally good at math but about 50-80 problems for homework it's too much was even for me, and all HW on myMathLab, which makes even worse. Don't take it over the summer if you bad at math you going to fail. Good luck if you taking him now",5.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7050,"Great teacher! Took his online course. You are going to have to work to succeed but he will tell you how and is available.  I spent a lot of time on this course, but for the first time understand algebra.  He gives extra credit to help you. Devote the time and you can get an A. Taking him again next semester.",5.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7051,"I took the online summer course and I knew it would be challenging. But I didn't think it would feel impossible. There is an extreme amount of homework given. I'd say take this course from this professor only if math comes easily to you, and if you can devote 25-30 hours a week to work on it.",1.0,5.0,Justin Dunham
7052,"Don't take this class, especially online. Can't learn anything, I've gone to the resource center and still get none of it. I've spent at least 50 hours on homework and have spent more than that trying to learn the material with no success. Homework only accounts for 25 percent of grades rest are on his impossible tests.",1.0,5.0,Justin Dunham
7053,"I try to have a open mind, and there are very few teachers I dislike. I don't think this man likes his job, or at least not this coarse. The large amount of home work that count for barley any points. The test are worth so much. He goes really fast, just tells you what in the text book, and doesn't show all his work. He is condescending and rude.",2.0,4.0,Justin Dunham
7054,Very clear and precise when explaining problems. Every unit is explained on the board and he writes out every step for you. For someone who is very strong in math this is definitely the professor to take.  If you miss a problem on the exam he still gives you partial credit instead of marking off the entire problem.,4.0,2.0,Justin Dunham
7055,I took Dr. Sharif for physics. He is an amazing professor. Give good examples and notes that help with the homework/ tests. I don't really have anything about the class to complain about. I signed up to take 2 more classes with him next semester.,5.0,3.0,Khalil Sharif
7056,"His homeworks and his tests are just brutal... but here is the catch, you get to do corrections on the exams for partial credit back. He is funny, nice, and cares about his students. He will probably curve, and will likely not fail you if you show up and do his homeworks and labs. Many students at the university opt to drive to NWACC for him.",5.0,4.0,Khalil Sharif
7057,"I took Physics before Calculus I and it was the worst mistake ever. The professor has a really thick accent, which it will make you understand him after the first 3 weeks. He knows what is he talking about but it doesn't help much. In classes, he invents the exercises and then he tells you to go and do by yourself those in the book. Really hard.",3.0,5.0,Khalil Sharif
7058,"I enjoyed the Advanced Physics class with Dr. Sharif.  He is a great lecturer and keeps it interesting with plenty of examples.  Tests are challenging, but he does allow a cheat sheet and you can make corrections for 1/2 credit.  The homework assignments are long but they are easy points.  Also easy points for labs and attendance.",4.0,4.0,Khalil Sharif
7059,Best college teacher I've ever had and probably the best Physics teacher and class you could take in the area. His tests are hard but fair with questions pulled from the homework. The material is not easy but he makes sure to explain it so that you will learn. I loved whenever he would explain real life uses for the material in the book.,5.0,3.0,Khalil Sharif
7060,"I LOVED HIS CLASS. He gives more than enough examples, and cuts out a lot of whats not needed for most of his students (engineers). Sorry physics majors.",4.0,1.0,Khalil Sharif

7062,"He gets down on your level so you can easily understand things. His test are very hard, but aren't heavily weighted. You can make test correction for half credit and he grades your final grade on a curve. Good teacher, nice guy. I recommend taking Algebra first or some of the math might lose you.",5.0,2.0,Khalil Sharif
7063,"Good: free points for attendance, labs, hw. Notes are short and sweet. Bad:  since I can only type 350 characters I'll just mention the main topics. Thick accent, purposely makes tests tricky, grades harshly. No partial credit on a test problem when I left out a number, just ""-10""! In my opinion, a little arrogant and likes to make you feel dumb.",2.0,5.0,Khalil Sharif
7064,"His accent is heavy, but his grammar is better than most Americans' English. Test questions trick you. He allows a cheat sheet, though. Interesting lectures are easily relatable. The lab grades are ""give-me's"". He assigns questions from the book every chapter for a grade. Math questions are difficult, even if you understand the theory.",5.0,5.0,Khalil Sharif
7065,"ATP was a great professor. Funny and engaging. Definitely have to work for your grade.

Highly recommend this class. Don't buy the textbook but DO buy lecture notebook.",5.0,3.0,Amelia Taylor-Perry
7066,"Very knowledgeable and helpful, I could immediately tell she was a good professor from her reputation among upperclassmen, her tests only have 20 questions so you will have to do lots of practice problems to do well on them since the homework is usually easier than tests. Definitely recommend ATP for Chem 111.",5.0,3.0,Amelia Taylor-Perry
7067,She taught straight from the slides so if you have the lecture manual you could basically teach yourself everything and still pass.

She is very clear when teaching  along with a wonderful sense of humor, so I was completely at ease.  Making sure the homework is done is most important.  She is easy to talk to and very fair with each student.  Amazing teacher!",5.0,3.0,Lisa Johnston
7124,awesome teacher. She is great at explaining and making sure you understand the concept. Do not give her attitude she will not tolerate it. We had hw listed for us it's a lot she doesn't look at it you'll get a check mark if it's done. My class convinced her for all test to be taken home it worked. Do your work study the content&youll pass,4.0,2.0,Lisa Johnston
7125,"I have not had math for a long, long time and Lisa made this refresher course interesting and easy to understand.  She takes the time to go over exactly what will be on each exam and will review again and again if needed.  Attendance was not mandatory but it's probably hard to pass without attending.  Her explanations were helpful.",4.5,3.0,Lisa Johnston

7132,Very personable and friendly. Willing to help and makes sure we understand. I was in the accelerated summer term. Had to cover a lot of information in shorter time. Her lectures and classwork made the difference but you have to ask questions and be there to pass. I made sure I have her for my next math class. Love her teaching style.,5.0,2.0,Lisa Johnston
7133,At first she was ok but as time went on she became less nice. A few times I went to her for help about things  and she acted as if I was dumb.She was extremely over the top about the final exam to a point where it made you nervous. Students had legitimate questions on the test because the ink ran out on some of the questions and she refused to help,2.5,3.0,Lisa Johnston
7134,Great teacher awesome personality! If you take her and do your work like she says to do then your sure to be successful! Yes I failed her class but by all means it was my fault not hers because I just copied the work out of the back of the book and didn't really do my homework like she said to therefore I didn't understand things on quiz and tests.,5.0,2.0,Lisa Johnston
7135,She is great as long as you do what she asks. Homework is a must in this class to keep up. she does not use the book for anything else because it is confusing the way it explains problems. this is a teacher that is willing to help you but you must ask for it! dont take the class if you cant ask questions or you will get lost!!!,4.5,2.0,Lisa Johnston

I'd recommend her to anyone struggling with math.",5.0,3.0,Lisa Johnston

In addition, the amount of homework & quizzes for her class is ridiculous.",1.5,5.0,Lisa Johnston
7142,Professor Goldner is a gem and was one of the best courses that I took this semester. There were about 4-5 writing assignments but all of them were thoroughly explained and were only 2 pgs. If you needed help with anything he always had office hours. The books he assigned made you look and see the world in a different view. 10/10 would take again.,5.0,3.0,Erik Goldner

Studied religiously the study guide for the midterm, did not help at all. 5 books and 5 papers. AVOID!",2.0,4.0,Erik Goldner
7147,prof. goldner is very unorganized during lectures. good luck taking notes because he jumps around from topic to topic without making anything cohesive. his study guides are useless as nothing listed on them correlate to the exams. he's very rude and patronizing to his students and his classroom etiquette is ridiculous. history majors avoid him.,1.0,5.0,Erik Goldner
7148,"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading.

NO",1.0,5.0,Erik Goldner
7149,"Goldner is by far one of the best professors I've taken so far in the History department. He clearly know his subject and adds a great personality to lectures which keep you engaged which is important for a history course. He's somewhat strict about classroom etiquette, but I can respect that since it feels like he puts his energy into his lectures",5.0,3.0,Erik Goldner
7150,"The class was fun. Prof. Goldner a bit of an awkward lecturer, but he clearly knows his stuff. He assigned 4 (pretty interesting) books to read, and you need to write a short essay for each of them, but he drops the lowest grade and grades pretty nicely, so you can get away with skipping one if need be. Tests are mostly multiple choice. Easy A.",4.0,2.0,Erik Goldner
7151,Very passionate during lectures and entertaining throughout. I always left the class wanting to know more. Very clear expectations on assignments/exams. Don't fall behind on reading or read just enough to answer the assignments. Has a really strict no bathroom/water rule. Overall fun class to take to learn more about why the world is the way it is.,5.0,3.0,Erik Goldner
7152,"This guy knows so much about his topics. No book, just lecture. Show up and take notes on slides he doesn't post and get those attendance points. Take the class if you care about history. It's hard to get into the content (and the 4 or 5 books) if you don't. A bit harsh on the book response essays but it's clear what he wants answered.",5.0,4.0,Erik Goldner
7153,I loved this class and Im not even a History major. He is super nice and understanding and I thought his lectures were very interesting. Only Midterm and Final with four 1-2 page responses on books we read. (super easy) I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a fun class and very little homework.,5.0,3.0,Erik Goldner
7154,I would never in my life take this class again.. If you don't write your papers in his writing style then you can best believe you're not going to get a good grade in this class.

7155,"I'm no history major, but this class was very enjoyable He knows and loves the material and it really shows in his lectures. Great lectures. Is there for students and gives great feedback.  You will have to actively read most of the material and pay attention, but the material is actually really good. I found a lot of joy in learning in this class.",5.0,3.0,Erik Goldner
7156,As somebody who is not a history major this class was very difficult because I did not have a lot of prior knowledge about  other than what I learned from high school.  I learned so much about European history in this class and really enjoyed the professor's lectures.  HE IS A VERY TOUGH GRADER. Do not expect an easy A or an easy B,4.0,4.0,Erik Goldner
7157,"Great professor! His lectures are super interesting, you will never be bored. He delivered the lectures in a way that keeps you engaged in the material. Also he is more than happy to meet w/ you if you are falling behind. This class does require a lot of reading (5/6 books). But all the reading is worth it, i learned so much in this class.",5.0,3.0,Erik Goldner
7158,"Great professor, awesome lecturer, some various things he lectures about will stick with you forever(good reasons).

Take down every single note of the PowerPoints(will regret it if you don't since he doesn't post it online)",5.0,4.0,Erik Goldner
7159,"Easily my favorite professor so far. His lectures are well organized, he speaks in a way that keeps you engaged and awake. I would love to take another one of his classes. He does not post lectures online so you have to show up and take notes. His test questions are analytical and challenging but study and read. 2 tests and 3 quizzes",5.0,4.0,Erik Goldner
7160,"Attendance isn't mandatory but he doesn't upload any of the powerpoints. A LOT of reading, he assigned 5 books for one semester and we read them all. He grades on a curve but he's really rude. You're not allowed to eat in class, use the restroom or leave early. I would never recommend his class to anyone. Only took it because it was available.",2.0,4.0,Erik Goldner
7161,I had him for history. it only consists of 3 pop quizzes a midterm and final. it was pretty challenging. honeslty I only passed because I copied the guy next to me.

Great guy, witty essay grading",3.0,1.0,David Tamm
7166,"I agree with the other two posts. He is very approachable and easygoing. Sometimes it seems like he doesn't know where he is, but he definitely knows what he is teaching about. If you have the option to take his class, I would recommend it. He's not the kind of professor you have to 'agree with' to make the grade. :)",4.5,2.0,David Tamm
7167,"I miss Mr.Tamm! He's a great teacher, and class was fun because his adorable and endearingly dorky personality is so entertaining. We had to write 5 papers and take 2 tests in each class I took. The tests are easy, and taking notes wasn't necessary since they're available on the class website. Just read through them once and you should get an A. :)",5.0,1.0,David Tamm
7168,I loved Mr. Tamm's class.  He was a great teacher and a very smart person. He is young so it almost as though he is one of the guys.

In fact I'm currently looking for another class he teaches to take next semester.,5.0,2.0,David Tamm
7169,"I definitely recommend this class and professor. Everything we learned was super interesting, and Prof. Haldane did not overwhelm you with information.

7229,Dr. Ferguson was a good professor. Just watch the lectures and take detailed notes. His lectures were very heavy and took a while to watch. You were able to use your notes on the exams and they were not proctored. All his exams were straight from lectures. I did not even buy the textbook. Chill guy.,4.0,2.0,Christopher Ferguson
7230,Ferguson talks fast in his lectures and there's a LOT of material in the 1.5 hour lectures given. Your notes will provide you with the questions on the tests but not the answers.

You have 3 assignments a week. 1 is a short response that he said was suppose to be pass or fail and ""2 sentences"" yet he gave most everyone 50s claiming we didnt write enough.

7426,"This was a capstone class online. No test given as majority of your grade is based from the business simulation program. You will work in groups/teams for the simulation and had members that did absolutely nothing, and he will not hold them accountable for getting a free grade from the rest of the group participating which was extremely frustrating",2.0,1.0,James Ariail
7427,Some homework is confusing because of all the explanations but quickly replies to help you understand it. Cares about students and wants you to succeed in class and after. I highly recommend taking him for this class. Going to a city council meeting was pointless though since there was no networking and should be business related in my opinion.,5.0,2.0,James Ariail
7428,"Team business simulation was fun, but we had members who did not pull weight. Points system he uses does not fairly reflect that. Possible 575, and only 20 reflect team support. Two of us worked tirelessly, and other two got gifted 117 points for our work. Unfair system. Directions on assignments left much to be desired as well.",2.0,4.0,James Ariail
7429,"This class was tough but I'm so grateful that I chose Mr. Ariail's Capstone course. If you want an A in this class you will have to earn it.

Best instructor I had at TCC.",5.0,4.0,James Ariail
7430,"Grading was unclear and inconsistent for detailed reports  for the simulation. He assigned a lot of busy work and some that does not seem to have any value or take away for the purpose of the class, wasted time.

During finals week he still held a meeting to learn material or present, and wile he did his final the week before, he had two tests due during finals.",1.0,5.0,Marty Wood
7447,This is the most difficult class I have ever taken. I spent well over twelve hours a week studying for this class to only get fifty per cent on homework. His instructions were incredibly confusing and I felt like I had to teach myself most of thee material. Didnt seem to care that I had difficulty accessing software due to Covid.,3.0,5.0,Marty Wood
7448,I've had Dr. Wood for several classes now. He is by far one of the hardest professors in my major but he is also one of my favourites!

7450,Dr Wood is a great professor. Some people will say he is terrible but he is not that bad at all. Yes you must go to class but honestly if you wouldnt you would be lost. His notes are a lifesaver. You get a cheat sheet for every test. If you have questions he will clear them up. The only thing that sucked was the group project. Dont be afraid.,4.0,3.0,Marty Wood
7451,Dr. Wood is a great guy! He's a really tough grader and doesn't take anyone's bs. Give a few extra credit points here and there. But don't underestimate the attendance points for class and lab!

7452,"The class was very interesting but other than a paper and a couple of news article homework assignments, the only grades are tests. The tests are hard and a fourth of the questions don't relate to what's on the study guide. It is a fun class however, I just wish you got more than 1 point for attending class.",4.0,4.0,Marty Wood

7455,Awful. Took him a whole semester to grade one paper. Tests are confusing because his lectures contain no actual information and his study guides are also pointless. Also very long winded so sitting in class is wildly boring.,2.5,2.0,Marty Wood
7456,"This class is not for those looking for an easy A, you have to work hard in this class.

7457,"He's horrible, he pretends to want to help you, but at the end of the day he kills your grade with ridiculously harsh grading on  everything. Worst part is hes the only one who teaches the class. HSC department can condemn you to this class but can't help you with anything, no tutor for SPSS, no tutor for this course. Horrible",2.0,5.0,Marty Wood
7458,"I wouldn't advise taking this course online unless you're taking few credit hours or are very dedicated. I had a little too much on my plate and found it difficult to keep up with the assignments due each week. You have to do a lot of discussion board posts, and none of them can be on the same day. I was expecting end of course due dates.",3.0,2.0,Marty Wood
7459,Dr. Wood is an amazing instructor! Not sure what the other person was thinking below. He challenges you to do your best. He is very helpful if you make the time to meet with him.

7475,"He is extremely old fashioned but also very thorough with presentations and papers. You'll learn a lot. However, if I were to take this class again I'd 100% take it from someone else.

7476,"I feel like this class is rigorous, but Miller makes it easier than others do: he is a solid choice. Only 3 students can get a solid A since it's a class of about 25 so that blows chunks. However, he is willing to work with you if it's during his office hours. That is the key to getting a decent grade in the class;meet with him and ask for feedback",4.0,4.0,Duane Miller
7477,"Professor Miller is very old-fashioned. He is very willing to help students outside of class if they need it.

7891,Best online class for history.  His tests are not easy so keeping up with work is important.  Sometimes he opened assignments on Wednesday instead of Monday or Tuesday like he said he would.  Dr. Bachoffer also answered my emails and questions fast.  Fair guy overall.,5.0,3.0,Aaron Bachoffer
7892,Euro history to present online. He is very forgetful and would not open the units til late in the week. Test were very hard you must read and listen to online lectures. Essays must be at least 2 pages but he is lenient in grading and is consistent. I think he switched two of my grades by accident. Not bad if you read and do the assignments.,3.0,4.0,Aaron Bachoffer
7893,"I took Dr. B's class at rose state. He is very funny, but his test are way to hard.

Papers are easy but outline is very long.",2.5,4.0,Aaron Bachoffer
7896,"Took Dr. B online. It may be better to take him in class. Also, if you stress when you take tests, his class is not for you. He will do a 60 question test and give you 60 min.

I definitely don't regret it.",4.0,3.0,Simon Fitzpatrick
7902,"Dr Fitzpatrick goes over the material for way longer than he needs to, which can make his class boring sometimes. He is a good professor overall, and is very helpful outside of class.

7903,Lectures were really dull. Had only a few assignments but daily readings. You have to pay attention in class and take notes in order to write said papers.

7905,"Nice guy who is clearly passionate about the subject. Midterm, final, reading journal, participation, paper (2000 words), and group presentation.

7908,"Very nice guy, he understands that philosophy is hard so he tries hard to make sure you understand it. Super helpful and an easy grader. Not many assignments, just papers. If you come to class and put in a bit of effort you should get an A. Also- He's British.",5.0,3.0,Simon Fitzpatrick

7914,He's not a bad teacher but I didn't really learn anything from him that a couldn't have from the book. If you ask questions he knows his stuff but just make sure you ask them! Overall not a bad class. A little boring just do the homework assignments and have your papers read by someone who has taken philosophy before.,4.0,1.0,Simon Fitzpatrick
7915,"Great teacher, great guy! He is always willing to help. Some of his lectures got pretty boring but you'll have that with any class.

I would recommend him for any AJ majors that want a somewhat easy elective.,5.0,2.0,Anothony Lopez
7996,Took his Gangs class and it was a breeze! I sware anyone could pass this class with flying colors.  This is the most easiest class EVER!!

DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!,1.0,5.0,Robert Smith

9181,She is a good teacher but isn't as helpful as people say. I asked for help all semester and she kept emailing me to go to the math lab or come 30 minutes before class but that wasn't enough time. She is rude and doesn't care about your concerns. Would've passed with a B but she wouldn't give me the help I needed.,1.5,3.0,Jeanne Hunsche

DO NOT recommend,1.0,4.0,Raquel Polanco

I would not recommend, there are definitely better options at Creighton.",2.5,5.0,James Wingender

9392,"Wingender has a strong opinion and it could scare some people. His class is easy if you go to lectures and take notes.

9486,"He's awesome! Would definitely take again. Super nice, gives clear criteria. Cornell notes are really annoying, but you can use notes on the weekly group quizzes (which are easy too). I learned a lot in this course, even thought I'm not a computer science major or anything. Focus is on Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint.",5.0,2.0,Brandon Jones
9487,Jones is a great professor and is available to students for help but the blended learning environment means that he won't be teaching you any material.

9488,He really makes your one class a week fun! There are lots of jeopardy games and his wife will bake prizes. The class has a lot of reading and Cornell Notes but he trys to break it up as best as he can. Good professor!,5.0,3.0,Brandon Jones

9503,"Dr. Lane has his moments where he rushes through certain topics. However, getting one on one helps a lot. He knows and loves physics and he is simply trying to spread his love around.

9510,"He is very rude and has no consideration for student success. If a student does not do something the exact way he vaguely tells them to do it, he will become very upset and refuse to help them.

9513,Great teacher! Extremely knowledgeable on American Foreign Policy. I liked that he was willing to give feedback on any assignment (both before and after the due date.)

9517,Enjoyed lectures. Be prepared to know how to write.,4.0,2.0,Benjamin Carter
9518,"Without a doubt, the worst professor I've ever had the privilege of being ""taught"" by. Graded our single paper for the class harshly,  taking off points for my ""poor grammar"" (note: I'm an English major on the Dean's List) and advising grammatical rules that haven't been acceptable to use since 5th grade. Save yourself and don't take this class. ",1.0,3.0,Benjamin Carter
9519,"Did not enjoy this class. I thought the subject was interesting, but his presentation was so boring and uninteresting. We only had one paper that was not clear on instruction, and then he graded our rough draft extremely harshly, saying I did not follow the (non-existent) guidelines. Upon asking to meet, he never answers emails and is not helpful. ",2.0,3.0,Benjamin Carter
9520,"His lectures are boring. He never gives back any grades until the very end, so you don't know how to improve lab write ups. The semester long paper is really important to him only after he give back the rough draft. He kills your writing. Readings are really boring and long.",2.5,4.0,Benjamin Carter
9521,He will rip your writing apart and then smile to your face. Nice guy but a tough grader and a stickler. Didn't tell the class in the syllabus that we had two of the same annoying assignments. So glad to be out of there,2.0,5.0,Benjamin Carter
9522,Probably the worst teacher I have ever had.  He is incredibly boring (he only uses powerpoint) during class and the readings he picks are painful.  He is also a very unfair grader and grades based on favoritism.  He also assigns an insane amount of work for an intro class.  He is also very unclear and unwilling to help students.,1.0,5.0,Benjamin Carter

9528,"Easy A. The guy does not go over anything that isn't on his tests. If you do bad in his class its because you failed to take any notes, which he usually instructs you to do so anyway. Meaning its not optional. Being a lazy student myself, this actually means he's pretty easy.",5.0,1.0,Adon Clark
9529,"Very good professor. Lecture was clear and concise. His test were very straight forward, not necessarily easy, but if you studied his lecture notes you should do well.",5.0,3.0,Adon Clark
9530,Not a very good instructor. He makes things more difficult than they have to be.His tests include material not covered in class and he hardly ever shows up for class to begin with.

Available in Spring (probably Autumn) semester.",5.0,1.0,Sasha Anawalt
9534,Sasha is a great professor and you're going to LOVE her and the class from the first day. It's a really easy class and getting an A is a joke if you do everything she asks of you.

9535,"Super easy GESM with Sasha and she is so nice and fairly oblivious to most stuff. 70% of grade is showing up to events and 2 short articles, other 30% is C/NC easy assignments.

9536,"One of the most fun GSEMs! Instead of structuring class around papers and readings, the class is structured around performances.

And you publish for Annenberg!",5.0,1.0,Sasha Anawalt

9546,She WILL help you become a better speaker and her assignments will challenge you to think outside the box. She doesn't critique too hard but you will have to work for that A.

Easy to get done, learned a lot, enjoyed this class.",5.0,1.0,Clifford Todd

9618,Prof. Rico's class is an excellent intro to economics. He spent time explaining the concepts and was willing to repeat concepts that people struggled with.

About 2-4 things due per week in a summer class.",4.0,2.0,Bryce Rico
9623,"He is pretty average for a professor. His lectures tend to be boring and overexplained.

10144,"All throughout the semester the class I thought was going fine until halfway through the semester no grades were posted trying to get ahold of him was impossible. If you wanted to know your grade you had to ask wasn't readily available, just a total disaster.",1.0,4.0,Tracy Grant

I got marked for a word he doesn't consider real, but is in the dictionary. Offers extra credit",4.0,2.0,Tracy Grant
10150,"Grant was very fair and unbiased when he talked about some sensitive issues that went with the literature.

If you're serious about art history she's a great professor but If you're just taking this class for the requirement it may be a lot of work.,5.0,4.0,Kirsten Lee
12250,"She goes through art periods too quickly, there are too many images, and she speaks too fast. The lectures require you to take a ton of notes, your hands will ache by the end. There are quizzes almost every week, so studying the pictures constantly are a must! Too much work required for a 3 credit class. She's not a great professor either.",2.0,4.0,Kirsten Lee
12251,"Professor Lee was my favorite teacher this year at Fordham. Her class assigns a lot of reading, but all you have to do is take intense notes during the hour and fifteen minute lecture, and you will not have to open the book. She grades essays based on a points system, so a B to A range can be expected if you try. Exams are a TON of studying!",4.5,3.0,Kirsten Lee
12252,"Amira is the sweetest professor. She really cares about her students and wants them to do well. Even if you don't know what's going on, she still encourages you to try and helps you when you make mistakes. She is very, very lenient and understanding.",5.0,4.0,Amira Rammah
12253,Amira is hands down one of the most caring teachers at the university and I would take her again for Arabic.

12254,"Amira is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had! She did an excellent job introducing a difficult language to us.

Amira really DOES care about her students though, so absolutely go to office hours to talk about anything!",5.0,2.0,Amira Rammah
12255,"I have loved this class. I took it completely online due to COVID-19 restrictions and I watched most of his lectures after the fact, but I learned so much! He made concepts I had never found interesting seem relevant and really interesting. I learned so much from this class!",5.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12256,Prof Dynes was an amazing professor and I would recommend taking a class with him to anyone. He genuinely cares about his students (i.e. cancelled our last essay bc he got a sense that students were too stressed). He does a great job relating to students and teaches in a very beginner-friendly way.,5.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12257,"Prof Dynes is an incredible human. Very empathetic, and willing to be flexible with your deadlines. The lectures were boring, as he would go over basic things like how to write an essay for half of the class. There are little nuggets of joy with social theory, but most of it is anecdotal and opinion. Felt like a lame high school class.",3.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12258,"This class started out hard, got easier as it went along. 3 essays to write, 3 tests, and about 15-20 quizzes throughout (on inquisitive which makes them easy and informative). He's unique and funny (sometimes scattered) which make for an engaging class. Takes awhile for grades to be put in, but overall an interesting class with a great instructor.",4.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12259,This class has a million TAs but it takes forever for assignments to be graded. The tests are very difficult and the reviews aren't recorded. High expectations for a GE class. Lectures are very very long and boring. Not a lot of talk about current events. Could have been much better and had a lot of potential but just fell flat b/c of COVID maybe??,2.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12260,"Not to fault Prof Dynes, but this class was painful to get thru. Very long lectures covering boring material. Very hard to make it thru a full lecture while actually paying attention. GO TO THE TA EXAM Q&A SESSIONS. If you go to those and take good notes, you should pass no problem. Open notes, open internet tests which was also helpful.",2.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12261,"Prof. Dynes is a great teacher and I really enjoyed taking his Poli110 class. The class is very lecture heavy and the only assignments you'll have is 3 essays and a lot of textbook readings w/reading quizzes. By attending class, taking good notes, and with some studying, then you'll get a desirable grade. He wants you to pass the class.",5.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12262,Tests are difficult even if you study. TAs grade essays and don't do a good job. He is not clear on how assignments are graded. It feels like a poi sci major class and not a GE class.

12265,"Some political science concepts can be difficult to understand, but Professor Dynes does a great job at breaking them down and explaining them. He genuinely cares about his students' success and gives great feedback. His exams are more about understanding and applying concepts than memorizing random facts and I really loved that about his class.",5.0,3.0,Adam Dynes

12267,"Professor Dynes has been one of my favorite professors at BYU.

The reading and lectures are imperative to succeeding in the course, but dont let that dissuade you!",5.0,2.0,Adam Dynes
12268,"*disclaimer:class taken online during covid* Clear and simple format to lectures, easy reading and simple writing assignments, tests are fair.

Really applicable to real life, changed the way i see politics.",4.0,3.0,Adam Dynes
12269,"He is the most caring professor I have. I at first didn't like him because he seemed a bit scattered, but he honestly cares about you and your progress. He is super knowledgeable and is easy to work with. You just have to be patient with him. He treats the class like you are sacrificing your time to be there, instead of him sacrificing his time.",4.0,4.0,Adam Dynes
12270,Lectures are boring and it is a waste of time to take this class. Very boring and he teaches us concepts that are beyond introductory course levels. Do not take this class if you want to save your GPA.,1.0,4.0,Adam Dynes
12271,Impossible to get good grades with how he has his TAs grade our work. He does not make clear how papers are graded. I also never understood the logic behind TAs grading student essays cuz they are not even an expert in the field yet.,1.0,5.0,Adam Dynes
12272,"Although it is just a GE course, he teaches us like we are all political sci majors. So I really had no idea what he is talking about. Extremely boring lectures. Not worth it even if you're just taking for credit. Terrible overall. Do not take his class. You will regret taking his class. Probably the worst class.",1.0,5.0,Adam Dynes
12273,Tons of readings that were only useful half of the time. The lectures didn't include that much participation from the students and he had a tendency to trail off on tangents and lull you to sleep with his voice. He is a great guy and if you're somewhat engaged as a student you'll pass. But not as enjoyable as it could have been.,2.0,4.0,Adam Dynes

12300,He is a great teacher who really cares about his students.

12301,"Dr. Mata is  a great person who really knows his stuff. The problem is, he is not at all tech-savvy. So the class was very disorganized and due dates were unclear (although he did not deduct points for late work). D2L was very confusing as there were readings mixed in with course material. Easy A, but it is so confusing that it is almost stressful.",3.5,1.0,Alberto Mata

12303,"Prof. Evans has great lectures but is not clear at all in his expectations.

12780,"Oh man, where do I start? Thibaud Tallemfumier is without a doubt the worst teacher/professor I have ever had in a math-related subject. His lectures are bland, useless, and often extremely confusing. Homework assignments are unnecessarily long and do not accurately represent content tested on exams. Seriously, don't take him.",2.0,4.0,Thibaud Taillefumier
12781,"Thibaud could have been better, could have been worse. He was new when I took him in the fall and I think that had a lot to do with him being not very good.

He ended up curving my class in the end which was really great, and he'll help if you go to office hours.",3.0,3.0,Thibaud Taillefumier
12782,"He is a very intelligent man and I think that made it difficult for him to explain concepts in a more understandable way. He used a lot of abstract examples to explain problems, which personally made it difficult for me to grasp some problems. He got frustrated with some people but usually it was students who were very rude.",3.0,4.0,Thibaud Taillefumier
12783,"He is a great teacher. However, sometimes his explanations can be overly complicated for the easy things. But for the hard things, he explains them very well. He did everything he could to help the students out (might I say even during a test)",5.0,5.0,Thibaud Taillefumier
12784,"This professor in my opinion had to be one of the nicest and caring people I have met. He continued to be helpful throughout the year and made it his duty to teach important math concepts instead of just the test. I have taken calculus before, but I gained a much greater knowledge than I could have imagined. He is also very helpful in office hours.",5.0,2.0,Thibaud Taillefumier
12785,"It was evident that Thibaud actually cared about us learning, and I appreciated that. I imagine teaching calculus can be difficult, seeing as how many students struggle with the subject. Though I am not a huge fan of the subject myself, I found Thibaud's enthusiasm for the subject refreshing.",5.0,4.0,Thibaud Taillefumier

12788,"I am fairly conflicted from her class. i found it very hard to understand what she was saying, but she is very willing to answer questions at the end of class and during office hours. She can sometimes fly through some really hard material in 20 minutes, and then spend 30 minutes demonstrating tangential velocity in the classroom.",3.0,4.0,He Wang
12789,"Her lectures are very helpful and understandable. Makes the subject very easy to understand.

If there is a concept you don't understand, she will help you as long as you need during her office hours, and will be incredibly patient the whole time.

Do not bother taking the practice exams that she posts, you'll see at best 2 similar ones on the exam. Avoid her",1.0,5.0,He Wang
12796,"Dr. Wang has a very confusing way of teaching, then when students ask her to explain an example she makes it even more difficult to understand.

Avoid this prof if possible.",1.0,5.0,He Wang
12797,"Well organized lectures, all you need to do is write down exactly what she does on the board. Tests/quizzes are easy + mirror examples given in class.

Pretty easy grader compared to other physics profs.",5.0,2.0,He Wang

She goes beyond what a lot of other teachers do but I assume is given little leeway from the department.",4.0,5.0,He Wang
12800,"She's a really sweet person but not very clear when teaching. I have nothing against her because she did try, but I think she needs to change the way she teaches.

The HW and quizzes will barely help you to raise your grade if you bombed the midterm. :/",2.0,5.0,Casey Machen
12803,"Same weekly workload, so you know what to expect. He's eager to help if you ask him questions. Midterm is 30%, final is 40%, but if you do better on your final than midterm, then the final replaces your midterm grade. This seriously helped me bring my B to an A+. Definitely hard work and time consuming, but for sure my favorite math class taken.",4.0,4.0,Casey Machen
12804,"This semester has been rough, it is all online and he has not been good at teaching or helping students. There are lectures he puts up, but if you do not understand it, he will not help you.

12806,Do not take Casey! Hardest class I have taken. He wastes times by making you do worthless video notes before each class which don't even effect your grade. Theres to many bad things to say about him then good so I'm stopping here. DO NOT TAKE!!,1.0,5.0,Casey Machen
12807,"His lecture was heavy and did not help my goal to earn from what I've learned in his class. His office hours were a time conflicting with my other class.

I will do it better this summer school.",1.0,5.0,Casey Machen
12808,"The online homework was easier to understand than the lectures. As caring as he seems to be, there was no belief in me to pass the class after failing the first exam. Great person, awful instructor. Doing the tutoring, extra help during office hours, and testing accommodations did nothing to help understand.",1.0,5.0,Casey Machen
12809,"Caseys main problem is that he is not helpful at all. His practice tests and the homework are nothing like the tests.

You don't get any help on exams but a calculator, not even the normal note card for equations, & too many questions for the time given unless you're a math whiz.

12814,"I really liked Casey and his class. Instead of just teaching us how to do the problems, he taught us to understand what we were actually doing. Not too much homework.

12820,"Casey lectures make sense & makes math look easy. However, you have to know the material inside and out cause he'll ask you questions on not only to apply concepts but why they work in the first place. He's also very picky when you submit an answer even if it's correct. Not everyone is made for this class. Study guides guarantee 50% of the test.",2.0,5.0,Casey Machen
12821,It seemed like he was a good professor in the beginning of the semester but to me it felt like the quality of his explanations went down as we progressed through the class.

Stay on top of things & you're fine.",2.0,3.0,Melissa Benton

12978,Professor Mitchell is very text-heavy and makes sure you know the material. He has trouble expressing his ideas during lectures but he is very funny. He is a laid-back Lab grader and will always give you feedback on tests. Many people are going to be put off by his personality but he is at heart very caring. Forget about ALEKS. You will not finish,3.0,4.0,John Mitchell

12981,Don't waste your time with ALEKS homework. Focus on labs and studying for exams. Learn everything taught in class. Seek help with tutors early in the course. Majority of students drop the course. He brags exams are intentionally tricky. Each exam includes 34 extra credit points if you're lucky enough to earn it. He doesn't curve. Syllabus is final.,2.0,5.0,John Mitchell
12982,"65% of class dropped before exam 4. Chem 1 & 2 material is presented throughout. Organic chem is at end of course. It CHM 2045 text, homework, and labs.

12983,"Professor Mitchell is hilarious which was great for paying attention during lectures. He is retired military, so at times, his humor can be mistaken for being rude.

12985,"He seems mean, constantly yelling at kids, but he does care and is really fun (in my opinion, some don't like him). 4 tests, drops 1; 9 labs, drops 3; ALEKS worth 10% then final is 20%. Overall fairly easy class, he tells you exactly whats on the exam. If you want easy A go to his office hours before each test and go through each topic on test list",4.0,2.0,John Mitchell

12987,"Professor Mitchell is a pretty funny guy and definitely knows a lot about chemistry. However, he isn't too great at teaching the subject.

MUST study!!!!",3.0,4.0,John Mitchell
12988,"This was my second time taking Mitchell, as I had him for CHM1025. He's a hilarious professor, making lectures fun. He does an okay job of explaining topics, but they can be pretty convincing, as he uses the same slides from previous classes. His tests don't always match the lecture, but he does release topic lists for the exams.",3.0,3.0,John Mitchell
12989,"I took this professor a year ago, but felt the urge to inform incoming students because of how terrible this professor is. I ended up dropping his course after 2 exams because I was failing and he would not help me if I had questions. I ended up taking Chem 1 and passed with an A, yet intro is supposed to introduce you to chem. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!",1.0,5.0,John Mitchell
12990,"He seems intimidating at first but when you truly need help, he is there to help. He makes his class very clear and simple. His second test is the only hard test but the rest are easy (IF you study). If you put work in I dont see why you wouldnt make an A. Chemistry isnt for lazy people. Its not the teacher thats bad, you just to put work in",4.0,4.0,John Mitchell
12991,"He ran his CHM1025 class off of ""big kid rules."" No homework required. Tests are challenging. Memorization required in the beginning.

Only complaint is that power points are a combination of Intro and Chem 1 so if you dont attend class you wont know what pertains to you.",4.0,4.0,John Mitchell
12992,"Mitchell is very loud and sometimes entertaining, which keeps you awake and interested in lecture. He's not fond of questions. His slides can be confusing as he uses the same set for CHM2045.

12993,"Dr. Mitchell was very loud, funny, and outspoken (can be seen as rude). No homework, 4 exams, and 10 labs. Labs are worth 200 points, since he drops the 2 lowest.

Hard but passable class.",2.0,4.0,John Mitchell
12994,"There are four tests, of which he will drop one. The class of 70 students averaged 61% on the final three tests. The professor is loud, and sometimes inappropriate. While it is apparent he knows the material well, he does a poor job conveying that knowledge to his students. An obstacle to overcome, not an introduction to the subject. Avoid!",1.0,4.0,John Mitchell
12995,"Tests are difficult. Labs are graded leniently. The material is tough regardless of professor. 4 exams in total one gets dropped. 10 labs in total two get dropped. He wants students to succeed but expects effort. Comes off as gruff initially due to his 20 years of military service, but makes up for it with his sense of humor.",4.0,4.0,John Mitchell
12996,"The professor clearly understands the material, but is not the best at conveying it. He uses the same powerpoints for his 2045 class, which made it really confusing during lectures or studying at home. He would often extensively cover a topic only to mention that we do not need to know it. No homework, which made it hard to practice new concepts.",3.0,3.0,John Mitchell
12997,"Not a great professor. Pretty sure most of the class failed since the class average for every test was way below a 60%.

13077,Very interactive class. Grading style isn't heavy and allows for students to be brave and participate. Lectures involved application. Reading text before class didn't create much value other than as a heads up on material. Showing your growth in the class through the writing assignments and participation is the best way to earn an A.,4.0,3.0,John Lynch

13091,"One of the worst at GV. She's very smart and knowledgeable, but she has no clue how to teach. She goes over everything once and expects you to master it.

We'll see.",2.0,3.0,David LeBlanc

13604,I REALLY enjoyed Dr. Schulhoff. Class is easy with weekly online quizzes. Attendance is not mandatory but is counted toward your participation/in-class activities grade. Only two tests (midterm and final). This professor really does care about getting to know her students and tries to make the class material enjoyable and relevant for everyone.,5.0,4.0,Anastacia Schulhoff
13605,"Dr. Schulhoff is a goof professor. She takes attendance and randomly gives little assignments in class that you can't make up, so definitely go to class. Her lectures can be a little dry at times, but she shows a lot of videos and movies that make it more interesting.",3.0,2.0,Anastacia Schulhoff
13606,Dr. Schulhoff was a wonderful teacher. She clearly cared about her subject but more importantly clearly cared about her students.

13608,"Dr. Schulhoff is nice, and seems to be knowledgeable about the field. Her teaching did not reflect that, however. I feel like she didn't teach the class anything. I am all for student-led learning, but this was something different. Powerpoints straight from book, and she reads straight off the slides. Tests and quizzes come straight offline. Avoid.",2.0,3.0,Anastacia Schulhoff
13609,"She was a very passionate professor, you can tell she loves teaching race and ethnicity. You have to go into the class willing to let go of things you've known as true your whole life, especially about Native Americans.",5.0,4.0,Anastacia Schulhoff
13610,"Dr. S is one of the best in the business. I changed my major to Sociology after taking her class and most of my electives were from this field. She is very fair.

13614,"This teacher is a nice guy, but teaches at a more advanced level. He gives out plenty of homework and is not the most forgiving grader. He rarely, if ever, will give a student 100% on a paper. If your heart is set on getting an ""A"" in this class, be ready to work for it. There are definitely easier teachers out there.",2.0,4.0,Kyle Henrichs
13615,He isn't very clear on how he wants you to write your notices and be prepared to read non-stop. I do not recommend this teacher. Taught the class closer to a masters program than a gen ed for a bachelors.,1.0,4.0,Kyle Henrichs

13626,"He is great. Attendance isn't mandatory but there are a lot of in class activities that are used for grading. Besides that there are 2 midterms, 1 final, and a project. All are easy, you make your own exam and then he adds like 10 questions( out of 50). Great Class.",5.0,2.0,Alan Moss

No homework except studying and one essay with a presentation. Great teacher, I really enjoyed his class.",4.0,2.0,Alan Moss
13629,"Prof. Moss is a funny guy & the class is easy. Only three tests are taken during the year and he drops the lowest score @ the end of the quarter. MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS.

Its obvious shes truly passionate about the information she teaches which makes the class even more fun.,5.0,3.0,Tara Strauch
13633,She is awesome and understanding. you can tell she loves to teach. She rarely uses powerpoints and lectures by talking so it is important to ask questions. she brings tea every class in case students want any and all the exams with the exception of the final exam are take homes. only had one quiz this semester but it was nothing too crazy,4.0,4.0,Tara Strauch
13634,Dr. Strauch is the biggest history nerd I've ever met and that's a complement. She's super passionate about the subject and really just expects you to go along for the ride and laugh at some corny jokes. Participate in class and do most of the readings so you can do well on the take home exams. She knows it's a gen-ed and tries to make it kinda fun,5.0,3.0,Tara Strauch
13635,"Really enjoyed the course overall. Had to come to class prepared for group discussions, but discussions end up being her talking a lot (which never bothered me). She is very nice, funny, and caring. Exams were take home and were easy to do well on if you put the time in. If you can, take her at some point while at Centre, you will not regret it!",5.0,3.0,Tara Strauch
13636,Dr. Strauch is great. Scary smart and super interesting. She taught the class from a Native American and African American perspective as well.

Make sure you keep up with reading and participate in class- -that's really all she expects. 10/10 would recommend.,5.0,2.0,Tara Strauch
13637,Dr. Strauch is the best.

She makes great connection to larger social and political issues. 10/10 would recommend!,5.0,2.0,Tara Strauch
13638,Professor Keralis is a caring man who will always advocate for his students. Very helpful and certainly passionate. Just because his class is hard does not mean you shouldn't take him. He is a smart man from whom you can learn a lot.,5.0,3.0,Spencer Keralis
13639,"Dr. Keralis seemed like a nice guy, though he grades really harshly. It's online so you can't hear how he is writing something, so I tried not to take his comments personally. You have to be on top of your work in his class because he doesn't post assignments until the week before they are due. The work load can be intense at times. Don't take..",3.0,4.0,Spencer Keralis
13640,"Dr. Keralis has a very laid back personality, & seems easy going. His weekly quizzes however are a joke, never stating the quiz questions could have more than one answer until a student pointed it out in class (halfway thru the semester), which he shrugged off. If you don't read & beat the material into your skull, you won't pass. DO NO TAKE!",2.0,4.0,Spencer Keralis
13641,"The content's interesting, and she can be quite a good story teller, but she does tend to ramble at points, spending quite a while on a few ideas but very little on others. I get the sense she would be great at giving a general talk about statistics, but not so much teaching a specific concept. She is quite a generous marker, though.",3.0,2.0,Marian Scott
13642,"I fall asleep on her lectures, because she is talking about examples and her work and not useful things how to compute that and that. But when we changed our theme she started to userecord presentations. Yeeah.",3.0,4.0,Marian Scott
13643,"The topic she's covering is cool and all, but her lectures are really boring. By the half of her course, I haven't found a single person around me who were able to keep up with her lectures. This is just a warning, make sure you know your shizzle the dizzle right before taking this course.",1.0,4.0,Marian Scott
13644,I took Professor Fink's course for the Understanding Historical Change requirement and she was a fantastic teacher. I'm not a History person so I was nervous about taking this course but her assignments were super straight forward and her passion for the material really motivated me to put in the work. One of the best Professors I've ever had!,5.0,3.0,Liz Fink
13645,Prof. Fink is one of the best professors I've had Fordham so far. She really cares about her students and wants everyone to do well.

13648,Dr. Fink really knows her stuff and finds a way to make history interesting. She's not tough if you pay attention to the lectures.

13649,"I took him last semester and although Micro was fairly tough for me, he makes it impossible to fail if you actually do the work. The slides are directly from the book and so boring, the tests are tough but he lets us take home and make up each exam for the extra points! He has a very dry sense of humor but I would totally take the class again!",4.0,2.0,Frank Sauer

13655,"I like Dr. Che, but his teaching style leaves much to be desired. This was a networking class. Everything is done in the Packet Tracer software. Che did not once open up Packet Tracer during the semester and actually DEMONSTRATE how to do basic configurations. Instead, he just scribbled some unintelligible drawings on the board. Nothing was learned",2.0,3.0,Xiangdong Sean Che
13656,"If you are to question this professor about knowledge surrounding a newer topic, be prepared for him to walk around the question. All of the labs are spelled out word-for-word. Do not expect a challenge The way this class is taught, it should be a 200 level class. This class is a disservice for all students that may want to do offensive security.",1.0,1.0,Xiangdong Sean Che
13657,This class should be a 200 level or below class just based on the curriculum and how every assignment in this class is a step by step walk through. It was very apparent that he had no real world experience on this topic and there were quite a few things taught that were false. An example: apparently a web application firewall can stop 0-day attacks,1.0,1.0,Xiangdong Sean Che
13658,Had him for multiple classes. Does not care about his students. Does not care about his course material. More focussed on his own career at the expense of others. He taught one class (Malware) completely from a power point without actually doing any labs like we are supposed to. His test questions are pulled directly textbooks.

Tests have nothing to do with the material he covered.",1.0,4.0,Xiangdong Sean Che
13663,Dr. Che really knows his stuff. He can help in everything related to hacking and is even willing to help students with projects outside of class.

14215,"Unlike most, I really enjoy this professor. Sure he may not give out a lot of 100s, but that is because he looks for quality over quantity and expects only the best from his students.

14369,"An example of why teachers should go to teacher-school before trying to teach. The department should place more oversight over how she organizes/writes lectures and how she grades.

14504,I felt like the labs actually were useful for the class (rare). She was nice and friendly. I didn't enjoy how she would basically yell student answers out loud when they would ask for help correcting or verifying their work. Activities in the class were often difficult but I appreciated how she went through them thoroughly with us.,3.0,3.0,Helene Balcaen
14505,"David Freed was one of my favorite professors I've ever taken.

14516,"Professor Martin is genuinely very nice and laid back. The class consists of only 3 test, one major speech, connect activities and lots of extra credit opportunities.

A very easy class!",5.0,2.0,Lizabeth Martin
14518,she is a nice lady but her directions are often unclear. Her tests are all online but have a short time limit and sometimes the material on the tests is not what was covered in class.

14519,"She tries to be helpful, but sometimes fails. It's pretty easy, but don't skip because it does count against you. You do have a textbook which is either online or if i remember a hard copy as well. You have much reading to do to complete the assignments. Her tests are very short in time so i recommend studying and knowing info before you start.",2.0,3.0,Lizabeth Martin
14520,She was absolutely one of the worst professors Ive had at GSU. The only positive thing I can say about her is that she gives extra credit yet she didnt grade some of my classmates extra credit and classwork until the grades have been finalized. Grades would have been better if she had graded the assignments before the final date for grades.,1.0,5.0,Lizabeth Martin
14521,"Ms. Pilcher was one of the best English teachers I have had! She is charismatic and a person that you can go to with any questions and try her best to answer them.

I thought she had a nice and caring demeanor Free textbook and lots of online resources to help.",4.0,4.0,Papiya Bhattacharjee
14527,"Dr. B was an amazing professor. She showed she really cared about her students and took time to explain everything. She gave us exam reviews that were really helpful.

14528,"This professor is awful. Her lectures vs. her homeworks/worksheets vs. her textbooks are completely off.

The only good thing about this class is that it's a ""free class"" meaning you don't have to buy a textbook.",1.0,3.0,Papiya Bhattacharjee
14529,Don't take this professor. TERRIBLE. If you're not strong in math you will fail. Expects you to know how to do everything and moves way too fast when doing example problems.

14530,This professor gives a lot of homework and is not easy on grading.

She's not understanding and refused to do more than 1 exam review.",2.0,5.0,Papiya Bhattacharjee
14534,"Those who complain about this professor are right out of high school or are way too entitled. Its calc online youve gotta work to pass.

14536,"First meeting she gave all the students attitude. Only did 1 review for the first exam and for the rest (including final) decided not to.

She doesnt teach at all",1.0,4.0,Papiya Bhattacharjee
14537,Honestly Im not sure if its due to the class having to be online due to covid19 but this professor is the worst Ive had.

We have families too ya know.,1.0,4.0,Papiya Bhattacharjee

14542,"Dr. B is a great math professor. Her lectures are clear and she is always willing to help out if you are confused.

Make sure you go to class, she wrote the book and curriculum",5.0,4.0,Papiya Bhattacharjee
14544,Im not sure if her class is vastly different in person but I did not have a good experience online.

14547,Professor Rreze very well organized and neat. If you ever need to look over notes on a lesson or what assignments are due when you can easily access them through files on canvas.

14553,"I am so happy I took her. She is so organized in her online class.

She also posts her own lectures, gives you powerpoint slides, and gives you additional material if you want to go over it.",5.0,3.0,Rreze Zejnullahi
14554,"She is a wonderful professor. I wish I had her for all my classes because she really does explain the material very well. She could be better at grading faster this semester but considering the situation, she gave much more than most of my professors. Her leniency in accepting late work this semester gave me the courage to continue with class.",5.0,3.0,Rreze Zejnullahi
14555,"She taught at RU in Spring 2020. Her class is easy and she dumbs down the material, but she's unorganized.

I can only imagine how many ppl would fail if the class was difficult",1.0,2.0,Rreze Zejnullahi
14556,Professor Zejnullahi was a very great teacher.

Required to see both of the plays they're performing at COC",5.0,2.0,Maureen Husky
14570,"The professor is nice. Quick writes are used everyday, book is mandatory but expensive. Her notes are only available in class but if you get the book they'll be there.

14629,Professor Barach is a real stand up guy. Best way I can put it. Sometimes his lectures can be a bit dry but he is incredibly fascinating to listen to and makes all of his examples engaging.

14699,if you are looking to take this class in the spring or any time in your life please dont. heres why This professor at first might appear nice and warm and funny but she is far from it. the aleks program she uses has no mercy when it comes to grading. take another professor. i spent 24+ hours on one hw which is far too much when u have others,1.0,5.0,Mary Wright
14700,"She's really good. She does give a lot of homework, but if you pay attention in class it's not too bad. Her slides are straightforward and not complicated.

She explains things pretty well and once in a while she's humorous",5.0,4.0,Mary Wright
14701,"I took her in the summer and although she has way too many iClicker questions, she is actually a good professor- Her exams were difficult but I was lucky and got a really helpful TA but overall I would recommend her- She usually tries her best to make the class enjoyable but I will warn you the tests consist of too many questions in little time-",4.0,3.0,Mary Wright
14702,She is super aggressive. She has an annoying iclicker. The people that say she is nice there lying. Take someone else because she is too much.

14706,"Virtual class: follow her videos, slides, and ALEKS (most important). In-person class: go over her videos, slides, and worksheets.

She had a hard time adjusting to virtual learning hence the drop from a 4 to 2 in rating.",4.0,4.0,Mary Wright
14707,"Prof Wright was alright. Definitely better than the alternative option for this class. The only thing I didn't like about her was her lack of empathy for her students and their grades.

14708,"I would say she knows her material. When switched to online class she did start giving us more tests because she thought people were cheating. ALEKS is very helpful though and is what helped me get an A in this class. If you do those and practice, the tests shouldnt be that hard. She's a decent choice. It's distance learning that was tough on her",4.0,4.0,Mary Wright
14709,"I took the same professor for Chem 103, and I liked her course better then. She switched to ""flip learning"" and would rush through slides in-lecture.

Just make sure you pay attention and stay respectful!",5.0,4.0,Sweetha Selvarajan
14800,Sweetha is a great TA for Bio100 lab. The prelab quizzes are easy. Everyone gets at least an 8/10. She also helps out a lot when doing experiments. She genuinely cares about the class.,4.0,3.0,Sweetha Selvarajan
14801,"She is the best TA that you could ever have. Her hilarious comments and lightening out mood by playing baby sharks was a real highlight of this class.

14805,I only had Professor Sweet for an online class so I don't know too much about her. There were 2 discussion board posts each week & a quiz. If you read the powerpoints and watch the videos you'll do fine; textbook is only needed a few times. Final is a pretty lengthy paper but you reflect on everything you learned during the semester. Good class!,5.0,2.0,Sequetta Sweet
14806,"Professor Sweet cares a lot about her students. She doesn't like when students aren't paying attention during her class. There were 13 quizzes and 4 exams all take home. There was a group project a lot of work goes into it, but its an easy A.",5.0,2.0,Sequetta Sweet

14814,Professor Riewe is super sweet and very very helpful when you don't understand something. He is great at teaching and wants you to pass. The only downside to his courses is that 70% of your grade are the exams. Other than that I would highly recommend him. Hes also lecture heavy but they are super detailed and helpful so its not an issue.,5.0,4.0,Samuel Riewe
14815,He's difficult but you WILL walk out of this class having learned A LOT. Two midterms and a cumulative final. This sounds like a lot but you will get used to the flow of it. I took him for both micro and macro principles and do not regret anything. He's very patient and kind and very respected. Minoring in econ because of him.,5.0,4.0,Samuel Riewe
14816,"One of my favorite professors at Sonoma. He is so passionate about Econ that it makes the class so interesting. He made me consider majoring in Econ. Homework every week, but its doable in about an hours time. He talks very fast in lecture so prepare to take very detailed notes, but there are no surprises on the test if your notes are good.",5.0,3.0,Samuel Riewe
14817,This was my least favorite college class and one that I got the lowest grade in. Professor Guerrero is a nice guy who wants to help his students but misses the mark by so much. This class was so hard. You end up teaching yourself if you want to pass with this professor.,1.0,5.0,Rafael Guerrero
14818,"I disliked this class for multiple reasons. He takes roll at the beginning of class and at the end. It's additional 5% extra of your grade and believe me you need it. My class was Tuesday's and Thursday's from 5:30pm-8:10pm. We stayed their one time until 8:20, just so he could finish his lecture and to take roll. Focus on concepts!",2.0,4.0,Rafael Guerrero
14819,"You'll work your tail off, but overall, I did better in this class than I did in Micro. He's not the type of professor that just teaches you useless facts and has you regurgitate them on the test. He expects that you learn the theories behind the information and then be able to apply it. Don't take him if you're a ""c's-get-degrees"" type.",5.0,5.0,Rafael Guerrero
14820,Very difficult class. Lectures do not help you on tests or homework but attendance is taken. Be ready to teach yourself.,1.0,5.0,Rafael Guerrero
14821,"If u must take this class best advice I can give is to study the book hard bc u will be frustrated trying to understand anything he teaches. He expects his students 2 put more effort in the class w/out anyeffort on his part to improve his teaching methods which is a frustrating attitude ina professor. If u must take this class, dont take itfrom him",1.0,4.0,Rafael Guerrero
14822,"He tries but not enough. His study guides are useless. Most of this class i taught myself. It was really harsh exams, you can pass it if you get good grades in hw and quizzes but even there you will need at least 50 in the two midterms. Advice if you have to take it from him, do not even try to fight with him. No extra credit so dont even ask.",1.0,4.0,Rafael Guerrero
14823,Don't take this class from him. You will have a very hard time understanding him. He doesn't explain good to questions. We doesn't review the examples on the book and most of his reviews for the test didn't help me it all. He does have a heavy accent. I'm not racist but he needs to improve his teaching skills.,2.0,5.0,Rafael Guerrero
14824,"Welcome to frustrating guess class, you will not understand about macro and he doesn't care, also he can not explain, however, he is a good person but not a good teacher. He should be working on his accent as well. As Economic major student I am not referring this class in any circumstances if you registered to thisbe prepared for suffering",1.0,5.0,Rafael Guerrero
14825,Hes not good at teaching. He doesnt work with his students AT ALL. So dont expect to talk to him about where your grade is at and him help you succeed or do better. I wish I didnt waste my time and money in this class. In the 6 years of going to college Ive never been more frustrated with a class. Dont waste your time with this one.,2.0,4.0,Rafael Guerrero
14826,"This professor is knowledgable and very smart but lacks teaching skills. Provided study guides for exam 1 and 2 and average class grades was in the 80s. For the final, he skipped chapters, did not offer a study guide, and the class average was 60%. Content from the chapters we skipped was in the final! 3 out of 13 lectures were useful.",1.0,5.0,Rafael Guerrero
14827,"Overall, I had a tough time with Professor Guerreros course. His accent was sometimes tough to get through, to the point that he would ask a question and no one would answer him because they couldnt understand him. He really understands the Macroeconomic theories he is teaching though and presents current news to show how they are applied.",3.0,4.0,Rafael Guerrero
14828,"Sends weekly emails that helped keep the class on track and was a nice reminder of assignments. Since it is an online class, these emails were a nice way to interact with her without meeting. Easy A as long as you follow directions and do the assignments. Lots of extra credit opportunities also.",4.0,2.0,Katherine Irwin
14829,I really liked her. The class itself is really not that hard. She reminds you of the fact that you have assignments coming up. I would work ahead though. It helps at the end of the semester if you already have things done. Overall if you need help she is there and she does give really good feedback.,5.0,3.0,Katherine Irwin
