"Doesn't pull any punches. He is honest in his review of speeches. He airs some of his opinions, and though I disagree, he made me laugh. I've become a MUCH better speaker thanks to this class. Easy at the beginning, gets progressively harder. Gave a take home test the first day of class, to turn in at the end. Doesn't talk about the book in class.",1
"If you want to be successful in her class, you get to do good on homework and tests. She does give a lot of homework, but compare to my old professor that I already dropped is nothing. You get to do good on homework because she'll take point off if you get the wrong answers. Extra credits on test review sheet. I 100% will take her class again.",1
"Prof. Lang made our 8 pm Earth Science class interesting. He tells a lot of jokes to keep the class woke, alert, and entertained. This ""boring"" class was actually great. He's a great professor. He does everything to help his students earn an A in his class. If you didn't get at least an A- you didn't utilize all the opportunities he made available.",1
Don is an absolute beauty. Goes over lots of practice problems in class which is very helpful for the exams.,1
Easy A. Enough said.,1
"I took him for sociology 1301 and 1306. His class is extremely easy. I took one for summer and the only complaint is his syllabus layout. He organized his due dates by a day to day basis and not weekly which made things confusing. He's a little picky about grammar in papers, but not too bad. This was also an online course.",1
"You have to submit a thoughtful response on 3 pieces of literature each week. That was a lot of work. She posts a video lecture each week (usually a few days early) - watch them and take notes. Read the Essay Writing for Students text to help write essays. The essays were short, but you have to earn your mark. She always responds to emails promptly",1
Participation is the key to your success in this class.,1
"Dr. Keeling is by far my favorite professor at CNU. I was really nervous to to take this class, as it was based around LOTR and I had never read it, but she made it very enjoyable. She is very sweet and cares about her students, and makes an effort to make class easy on them (extra credit on every quiz!). I highly recommend her!",1
One of my favorite professors. Loves his job and his students.,1
"Fabulous prof, not sure why people didn't like her. Pretty easy A if you read the material.",1
"She was the worst teacher I have ever had, she is cruel and vindictive. Also now she is in charge of the entire theater department. So now I have no choice but to leave Laguardia, because she is unbearable.",0
LOVED him!  Class was interesting and he is a GREAT teacher!,1
"She is honestly one of the sweetest people and is always willing to help. This course can get a little heavy at times, but she really helps to make it do-able and will always help you if you need feedback on papers. Awesome lady and I would highly recommend a class with her if you're interested in English and literature",1
Dr. Albertson is a great professor. Her class is not an Easy A but you have a really good chance to get it. I would recommend taking her classes to anyone.,1
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
"She is the best Accounting teacher ever! I took her for accounting 1 & 2. I received A's in both courses. If you do the study plan she will give you up to 10 point to your total grade (up to 5 points each half of the class). Attend class she explains thing well, practice exams Are the same as the mid term and final just different number. #easyA",1
"she seems a little spaced out sometimes, or shes very forgetful about things.  shes a nice person but that wont help you learn anything!",0
Pretty good prof.,1
"Dr. Osborne is a great teacher. The class has A LOT of reading, but other than that it is mainly just open discussion. It's honestly like a book club with an occasional test. He gives a few extra credit opportunities, but the rest of your grade depends on only three tests and one paper. Very interesting viewpoints on a lot of issues and a cool guy.",1
"She is a great teacher, her class is very interesting and there is a lot of customization to what you want. Asks and cares what you have to say. Lots of group work which is nice and she is very understanding",1
"inaccessible, disorganized, avoid at all cost. you will not learn anything from her class anything.",0
"Nice guy, makes every discussion really fun and interesting.",1
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
"Professor Mancinis syllabus is clear and she follows it to the tea. Assignments, small projects & quizzes are super easy, fun at times to do as well. Communication is key, make sure to communicate if issues arise, she truly wants all of her students to succeed.",1
"Dr. Goodyear was definitely a challenging professor. If you differ from his view he will try to belittle you in front of the class. When his beliefs do not align with scripture he does not engage in meaningful conversation but instead shuts you down. In addition, two tests dictate 50% of your overall grade and 11 essays decide the other 50%.",0
"Disagree with 162015. My experience was he gave daily feedback in class discussions. He often would answer questions there so everyone would hear the answer not just the person who asked the question. You don't really need to do the reading but participating in the discussion is a must. If you skipped that, you'd be lost. There are no tests. ",1
"Such a nice guy. Doesn't pressure you or get under your skin about anything, just reminds you a couple times about things only for the best. Straight-forward with instructions and always willing to help.",1
"Dr. Walling is a genius! I, honestly, do not know how CCP has been so lucky to keep him all these years. His knowledge on the world, through archeology and anthropology is astonishing! Every class I would go in like a sponge, ready to absorb everything he says! The man his so much to tell! Remarkable professor!",1
He gives way too much work for a introductory English course at a COMMUNITY COLLEGE. Don't take this professor unless you want unnecessary work that won't ever benefit you in your career and overall life.,1
"I had Herring for Math 15 and she was pretty good. She assigned a lot of hw, which really helped with lectures and doing workbook problems. She lectures a lot, but always made sure to make it fun. Practice tests are very similar to the real tests. Nice professor.",1
"I had dawn for GH 125 and thought she was amazing, a lot of our class loved her. It's not hard at all if you show up and do the work. Im amazed with everyone posting how horrible she is. Yes she allowed for a lot of stories from others which drove me nuts but she is very straightforward. Again-PUT THE EFFORT IN and you'll do fine!",1
"Dr. Ayers is one of the best professors UAB has.  Great sense of humor, and has loads of practical experience.  He's likes fast cars, and anything BBQ or beer.  Oh and he's really great at breaking down how marketing works.  Fantastic class!",1
"Well rounded and great professor. Hard marker, but fair. Very informative and has a wonderful sense of humor mixed into her lectures. She is clear and to the point, and always willing to provide extra feedback when asked as well as good feedback on assignments. Very approachable.",1
"Professor Blake is a great Spanish professor! Turn in your work on time. Bring your textbook because that is where the notes are and we do activities from it. There is a test for every chapter, two quizzes, and an oral presentation.",1
"LOVED Prof. Juarez. He makes his grading criteria and assignment instructions clear. His lectures are great. You don't meet up, lectures are uploaded for you to watch at your convenience, but he quizzes you on the lectures for attendance credit. 2 Essays on topics of your choice pertaining to the material in class. Finals are easy. Replies quickly.",1
"Dr. Fein is a knowledgeable professor who really wants his students to learn. However, he has very high expectations, and he can be too demanding sometimes.",1
"I would stay away from her by all means. She is intelligent but is a terrible professor. Be ready to read between 100-200 pages each week with her. She has made her political views well known. While she has asked subjective questions she is not open to opposing views, she will tell you what to think.",0
"Very good Calc 1 teacher.  You truly have to earn the A, but you learn so much in the process.  If you are a hardworking student, take this class because she is very rewarding to someone like yourself.   I would definitely take her again. ",1
"I would definitely take other classes with her and strongly recommend this class/subject! She is very helpful, understanding, and challenges you!",1
"he's hard-core knowledgeable but forgiving grade-wise; and no class attendance policy, which is nice",1
He is a good person but doesn't teach well. He never clearly explains things and our book was horrible. I've had to teach myself everything and go into tests having no clue what will be on them. He randomly jumps between books and nothing really came together.,1
"I would recommend taking somebody else if possible.  She has a split personality.  One day she will be cool and other days she goes into full-blown psycho mode.  I am not kidding.    She doesn't allow students to use laptops or cellphones to take notes or look up stuff to help out.  If you take her, good luck.  You are entering a nightmare.",0
Prof. Carter does a great job of using humor to make everyone relaxed and comfortable. By the end of the semester the entire class had improved as speakers and Prof. Carter is the reason why.,1
Fabulous instructor! She was so understanding and even prayed for her students daily. Very encouraging and unbelievably accessible outside of class. She knew the information and was excited to share it with students.,1
"VERY RUDE, Does not speak clear (very heavy Russian accent). She always follows her OLD EDITION book. Book is EXPENSIVE!!!",0
Amazing professor! Very nice. Don't expect to be spoon-fed the content  his lectures appear unorganized but in the long term they make so much sense  you just have to use some of that big noggin to put it together,1
Great class that gave me a better sense of self and provided more clarity in my life on what is important. What I have learned in this class I will use for the rest of my life.,1
"This class was easy for me as I had prior experience in the engineering field going into this program. A couple of group projects and some pretty hard homework and tests. If you are weak in math or engineering is not for you, don't expect to pass. I put in about 10 hours per week. Creativity and precision is key in this course.",1
"I am confident in my belief that those who wrote negative reviews for Mrs. Liu did not apply themselves or pay attention in her class and then blamed her for their bad grades. Calculus is tough sometimes, but Mrs. Liu only tests you on the concepts that you should be an expert on, as long as you go to class.",1
"As others have said, Justin is excellent at delivering complex material, like Hegel. The format of the class is always student-based, so it's essential to do the readings and come in with questions to make the most of it all. Meeting with him outside of class is always very helpful as well. VERY understanding and helpful. VERY.",1
"She depended a lot on power points, which at times made the lecture feel like it dragged on--fortunately even she admitted to this and attempted to stray away from them from time to time. Overall if you find the material interesting, there's no reason not to take her.",1
"McConkey is a great man, with a fun sense of humor.  He's extremely helpful and willing to work with you.  His tests weren't too bad, even if you never open the book.  The exams are multiple choice and essay questions are optional.",1
"Pre Calc is the second most dropped class on campus. Here's why, You do not get any of your tests back so you can't learn from your mistakes, you don't get taught concepts, you only go over a few hw problems in class that have very little to do with the hw. Mrs. Ryburn is a very nice lady but the way the class is taught is not well results> fail",1
Don't take class with her. She was the worst professor that I had at foothill college.,0
"For an online class , you have to understand that learning the material is entirely up to the student and how much time is committed to the class! With that being said, Stevens does EVERYTHING she needs to do for a student to pass! She has weekly discussion forums, weekly quizzes , she puts up many helpful videos. YOU MUST COMMIT LOTS OF HOURS !!",1
"The worst professor ever in NC state. He doesn't teach, and he's not organized at all. Try to avoid him whatever costs you!!!!",0
Such an awesome guy and he knows his material very well.,1
"Great guy and great class, helpful and funny!  One of the only classes I actually got something out of",1
"Professor Lamkin is a tough teacher.  Pros: She gives a lot of extra credit, she goes over some questions for midterm, answers all questions Cons: She teaches as if she is just reviewing which makes it hard to learn, test do not really correlate with her notes. Overall, she makes it easy to pass with a C, as you only need 700 out of 1220 points.",1
"Professor Elliot is really great to have in class. She sets very clear expectations. If you do the work, it's likely that you'll do well.",1
Very lecture intense class and do not leave once you've shown up - a girl did once and he stopped class to rant about students leaving. Somewhat hard to know what might go onto a test as he talks about so much during his lectures.,1
"Mrs. Johnson did voice her opinion, but she has said from the beginning you dont have to agree with her and was always opened to hear other students views. I wouldnt take this class if you get easily offended, but in my opinion it was a great class, easy assignments, and she was a sweet lady.",1
"She is very nice and helpful. Once you follow her instructions, you will get a good mark on your paper. She explains her instructions very well, so don't worry.",1
"SUPER EASY class! Test are just like the study guide. He's so nice and funny. Lectures are boring, but I would still go because of extra credit. He really loves Texas History, and it shows. He's a very passionate teacher. Very smart and intelligent man. Wish I could take him for all my classes! Love Professor Galan!",1
If some of these people who rated Dr. A low would show up to class consistently they would not have problems.  Her class presentations and lectures are spot on and well thought out.  Show up and you will pass. ,1
"Wonderful professor! I had him for ceramics, and I loved this class. He gives really helpful feedback and really cares about the outcome of our pieces. If you put time and effort into his class, he will make sure that you are happy with your artwork.",1
"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",0
"I did not like his teaching style. He reads directly from slides, which he posts after class. His quizzes and tests are all multiple choice, and he offers extra credit. However, many of his questions are poorly worded and some confusing.",0
"Try not to take this class if possible. Her lectures are so irrelevant and she often isn't prepared. She canceled class 3x in 3 weeks & we were expected to learn everything on our own. I honestly don't know why I showed up to class. If you are a self teacher and don't want to show up to class, this might be for you. She's very nice but can't teach.",0
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
"Professor Freed is an eloquent speaker. Everything that comes out of her mouth is valuable and inspirational. I would highly recommend her for someone who is seeking a quality education. My only complaint about her was that her expectations were hard to gauge. Coupled with her tough grading style, this made for a sometimes disappointing experience.",1
"Ken is the man. All his classes are the same, there's no HW just 4 or 5 papers to do throughout the semester. He's an easy grader, just meet the criteria and have some minor knowledge behind what you're writing and you'll be good. Wish he taught more REC classes!",1
tough marker! but loves to help. get ready to read and buy all the text books,1
"she is ver helpful, very nice and made the course easier than what I thought. I took the class on saturday morning..... It was not that bad..... I recommend her if you are afraid of speech classes.",1
"I thought she did a good job.  The class was tough, no doubt. But I'm using this stuff with my work and it's making a whole lotta sense now that I had her class.",1
"Honestly, the fact that he taught w/ Shinkle made him look better. But make no mistake, his modules were extremely difficult. The fact that he doesn't post his slides makes it hard to take notes. I got the sense that he & Shinkle were kinda just making it up as they went along. Generally it's an awful experience, but at least he has jokes I guess?",1
"Prof Seymour is absolutely hilarious. Participation is key in this class & he creates an atmosphere which allows students to engage with each other about what we've learned. His lectures however, are not always clear & do not provide enough info to prepare for exams, googled info not allowed. He's wonderful, but his professionalism needs work.",1
"Doctor Evans is very smart but not as smart as he thinks, and he is very strong. He picks up heavy objects in class. If your looking to celebrate a birthday ask him to sing for you because he can really sing, but not A plus quality more like A minus singing.",1
"Mi-Sook is by far the best professor I have ever had. It takes a while to get used to her strict grading, but she will go above and beyond to help you when you ask. She cares about students on a personal level and truly wants each person to do their best. Her high expectations are a reflection of her interest in student's learning.",1
"So awful. Worst professor you will have at UCONN. Her class should be for philosophy majors only, and philosophy IV or something. She grades everything so tough and if you complain to her via email she basically doesnt do anything to fix it. Take this class and youll want to die! If you have this class in your cart delete it before it is too late",0
"I had to drop this class. I don't know Spanish, so it was even harder. The tests were impossible (completely in Spanish, even the instructions). Even people who do know Spanish failed his tests. He doesn't give any extra credit, even if you beg. *DO NOT TAKE*",0
"Took him Spring 2020 (pre/during Covid). Very hard to rate him as he was a great lecturer but would go off the rails about things like going to the bathroom during class, or one time where he got mad at a student for trying to leave for a family emergency during class. Seemed very understanding during the transition.",1
"I had to take this specific class twice, and I think if I had her the first time I would have finished on time. She was very nice and explained everything in a  way that everyone could understand especially because she didn't like math either. She gave the class her math cell phone number to answer any questions we might have outside of class",1
"Worst class I have ever taken. I wrote a paper that followed ALL the guidelines, but it was failed because my ""views"" were different than what he wanted. Also, the final is four exam essays, 350 words each and 2 hours to do all of it. Mess up? Automatic 0%. Never take this class. Worst teacher I have ever worked with. Save yourself the time.",0
"I've found a technique to deal with prof like these: JUST REMEMBER YOU ARE AT A STATE COLLEGE. Enough said? You get what you pay for, even if cheap college isn't necessarily cheap. It's clear when a prof doesn't know the material they are teaching, but what isn't clear is why they expect you to know it. Input is Output so TEACH YOURSELF in upperdiv",0
"The best teacher I have had at western so far. She is nice, helpful and easy to talk to. You can be yourself in her class with out a problem. Hope she doesn't leave western:)The work is simple but its really good to learn and helpful for the next english class.",1
"She was so awesome! NO homework but class assignments and the group project is so freaking simple! I got an A and oh yeah, shes really nice and cool.",1
"This class was VERY easy and Prof. McNamara was entertaining. Not much as far as actual coursework. One very small paper on any business movie of your choice (mine was Wolf on Wall Street), one group project and one group assignment. There were a few tests but all the multiple choice questions were true which he'll tell you first day of class.   ",1
"This course was the best by far I've ever taken. I got great help from Dr Tone, and was deeply after each class. She is happy if you are a good speller, so for future students, use proper grammar!",1
"Okay, now THIS is Epic.",1
"I took professor Aguilar my spring semester for 1302 and I would not reccomend to take her. She gets distracted very easily and gives assignments that are six pages long, sometimes more. She does set the boundaries straight from the beggining of the course and she will not take late work.",0
I took this class over a summer and the information was presented very clearly. She posts the excel worksheets online so you can click and see the formulas and don't have to waste all of your time writing and can focus on what shes saying. You can also stop by her office for additional help and she doesn't hesitate to work with you. Great Prof!,1
"Correa is a great guy. Extremely helpful especially if you ask for it. Although his test are very difficult with no partial credit, however he is willing to give you a lot of hints and explanation throughout the test. Lots of material to cover without enough time to do so means crammed chapters and lessons. Great teacher, hard class.",1
"I have nothing but positive things to say about Professor Hohing. He is one of the few professors that actually care about his students and will help you in anyway to pass and succeed in his class. The assignments are all fairly graded and if they are completed, you should have no problem.  Had him for a winter online class and I really enjoyed it.",1
"This guy is great. He is kind and willing to help. His accent is pretty strong, but it's okay because it's funny when he says ""disks."" The class is really easy but it's also interesting. Lenient with lab work and homework is online.",1
"The most caring and approachable prof I've had. She can be biased at times and less knowledgeable about certain topics but the way she teaches her classes is very hands-on and enjoyable. Grading criteria for essays is sometimes unclear, but she's willing to help in office hours. An A is tricky (cutoff was 95). Highly recommend for pre-law students.",1
"Great professor. She is outstanding and very helpful. Unless your a freshman who isn't use to the real world and how college works and what professor expect of you then there is no downside to her. She is the ideal engineering professor who goes above and beyond to ensure her students understand via projects, tests, and hands on experience.",1
"The lectures are good, but the exams are ridiculously detail-oriented. The labs are bs, have no overlap with the course, and the TAs are very poorly organized. Half the class bombed a lab exam, if that says anything to you. Avoid her (and her class) if you're looking to maintain your GPA.",1
Very understanding!! Actually tries to help his students,1
"this is the worst class i have taken in my three years at hamilton; i advise you to avoid it like the plague unless you like unnecessary requirements and more work than you've ever gotten in your life.  while nice enough, werner expects everyone to have a significant background in world politics.",0
By far without a doubt the worse professor I've ever had. She changes her grading rubric weekly. I am convinced she comes up with her own rules of the English language and grades your papers based on that. Avoid her at all costs.,0
Great Teacher!!!!!!! however you will have to read outside of class.  The quizzes are not hard but they are also not the same. She does know what she is talking about. Her teaching just was not for me. I am more visual and hands on.,1
"It's true that she is a tough grader, but tough in a good way. She is clear about what she expects and gives you the tools to do well. The movies were actually interesting and I learned a lot about how to analyze them. She can be a little intimidating because she talks in French all the time and wants you to participate but my French got better.",1
"Dr. Vutha is a professor that genuinely cares about each and every one of his students, and wants everyone to succeed. His lectures are very easy to understand, and he is a very clever and witty person. I would absolutely recommend him for this class.",1
He's a really funny guy and a great teacher. The homework (only 4) is directly related to the tests (also only 4) so its easy to get a good grade. Plus he's the only one who teaches Econ at night so I appreciated that. Thanks Daley!,1
"Run in the opposite direction. He's Satan when he writes those exams from hell. His lectures are awesome, but those exams are hard!!!!",0
"she is so kind and helpful, her class is easy and no textbook to use. i love her, i will continue take her class ENG107. TKE HER CLASS!!!!!!",1
"Mrs. Bolt is very knowledgeable about her field of study, that being said i would have to say she doesn't enjoy to teach. She grades extremely hard for a class that is suppose to be simple and it doesn't help that she is unorganized. Mrs. Bolt expects the world of her students but doesn't put in effort into the class",0
One of the best teachers I have ever had.  He makes the material understandable and does not talk down to his students.  He could have easily been a prick and made the tests hard but seemed to be more concerned with the students actually learning the information.,1
"Amazing amazing. I took my first philosophy class, and first college class with him - life changing. His method will definitely get you to think - and make you realize you need to think. Tough grader, but man is it worth it. Everything you go through seems brilliant and flawless at first, then he tears it up - till you master that same art yourself",1
"One of the BEST Instructors I've ever had. She speaks definitely, absolutely and with much enthusiasm about her expertise! ",1
"He is very good at explaining everything  and answering questions during his lectures. He is willing to help during his office hours. He does assign a lot of hw, but I think that's why I actually learned something.",1
PEX 160 is Latin Nightclub Dance and was very entertaining. I have no rhythm whatsoever but still managed to learn a thing or two and receive a good grade. You learn classic styles of dance like chacha and salsa. Show up to class everyday and put in effort and you'll get a good grade.,1
"Easily one of the best ECE professors at Purdue. I dropped his class the first time because it was so tough for me but my second time around I was able to pass with flying colors and learned so much. He truly is a one of a kind professor and even if you think his class is hard, let him show you the way.",1
"Very clear & fair professor, no surprises. He does repeat a lot of ideas, but if you jot down notes of what he repeats you'll notice that its the answers to the short answer exams, you just have to expand on it using book/lecture material. Hes got a monotone voice, but his humor will definitely get you to enjoy most lectures with some laughs!",1
The professor was pretty tough but fair. He was quite nice and very knowledgeable in his field.,1
Excellent professor who layers carefully structured readings with informative and enriching in-class discussions.,1
Alot of busy work but extremely helpful when you have questions! Must study hard and always use to the study guide  for tests if you can!,1
He is the best math teacher I ever had. he goes through the questions with you and he grades paper well,1
"Very confusing about the projects, looks for specific she never mentionned.",0
"Avoid this guy..Worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of taking a course from. Like the others have said, BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF! He hardly ever lectures and when he does they hard to follow and boring. He has the students do the homework prior to class and then has the students provide the answers. This guy is in it for the paycheck.",0
"Of all the horror stories I heard from everyone who took this class from other instructors, Sheila definitely went out of her way to make this class an interactive fun learning experience. Attendance is mandatory, exam questions are straight from lecture, and labs are time consuming but doable. Definitely take her, she makes this class worth it. ",1
"I took Chaloupka for Exercise Physiology LectureLab.  The lectures are necessary in order to pass the course.  Taking notes on the PowerPoint is really helpful because the lectures cover a lot of material.  He is willing to help with any questions, and will go over any topic that you do not understand. Great professo",1
"elizondo is by far THE BEST microbiology/anatomy instructor on campus. Do not be afraid to take her course based on what other students have said. YOU WILL LEARN THE MATERIAL. The class is tough, there is a lot of work, and studying is essential to passing. If your major is biology, your best bet is taking this course with her. don't slack off",1
"EASY A, but he did pick on me alot through out the semester. He seems unhappy in his marriage and belittles you when your proud of your happy marriage. Like I said, EASY A, and gives extra credit as well as extra redit for attendence. Also, no need for book..",1
Best professor!! Nothing bad to say about her,1
"Professor Tulin is great and understanding Professor. For this humanities class we had a good amount of reading but he would have discussions about the readings during class. The assignments of the class were discussion board posts, two tests that were ""essays"" and some group projects. Professor Tulin will listen to students if they are struggling.",1
Worst professor ever. He uses slides in his lecture that are dated 1999 and do not match up with his book which the homework and test questions come from.  He is arrogant and shoots down all questions asked.  Also keeps referring to taking Econ classes which I didn't and was not required.  He does not teach this as an Introduction to Finance.,0
"She was really caring and thoughtful about our well being. Make sure you devote some time to do the projects, and everything will go great in this class. The class may seem daunting based on the syllabus, but it is actually really easy. It may take time to give the necessary instructions on projects, though. Overall, she is a wonderful teacher.",1
"Very poor grader - She doesn't have a real rubric to go by. She takes off many points for miniscule things. There are four assignments in the whole class with one discussion each week. You have 3-4 days to post, not the typical full week. She takes weeks to a month to answer emails and grade assignments. She is very unhelpful.",0
"One of two profs who do not zone me out! Post notes online please and class problem set solutions. Other than that, GREAT!",1
"Really enjoyed the content of the course, the readings, the movies, and the discussions were pretty engaging. However she doesnt give good expectations for assignments. If theres no clear instructions for the midterm/final make sure u ask her or it probably wont be up to her standard. Do the readings and answer the weekly assignments thoughtfully",1
Over complicates simple concepts. Takes months to post his lecture notes on the online platform. Unorganized.,0
"I had Xandy Gilmore for A&P 1 & 2 during the summer, I had no interest in science, but I needed this class to transfer. Xandy was by far one of my favorite instructors at Vernon she made A&P fun and interesting I would find myself eager to go back into her class. She also taught me new was to study and memorize things that were important.",1
Awesome professor and one of the  best experiences I have had so far at a Math class in UT. His lectures are really helpful and fun and most of the questions on the quizzes and tests are the ones that he has solved in class. Make sure to take notes as it helps a ton during tests and quizzes.,1
"Amazing professor, would highly recommend.",1
"This is not an easy class.  Having schellhorn as a teacher makes it even worse.  She is hard to understand, boring, and would rather go to prison than ever curve a test or your grade.",0
His class is very interesting. He is very knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches.,1
very good.,1
"Dr. Mueller bases all lecture off relying on students to read from a workbook in which instructions are unclear. The workbook itself is often criticized by Mueller for being inaccurate as well. Taking notes is only somewhat helpful, and lectures are often detached from the students' understanding and difficult to retain.",0
"Kanetis is one of the most lively, energetic teachers I've ever had. He made PHI111 (Critical Thinking) a BLAST to come to every day. Knows how to create a fun environment.   The material is very repetitive, but if you can move past that, the class is very open ended and fun, especially for debates and discussions about topical issues. ",1
"The content of this class is fine but his grading system is simply awful. It's far too easy to pass but far too difficult to get an A. With surprise test questions, sporadically dispersed (yet heavily weighted)  iclicker questions, and no extra credit I was the only one to actually achieve the score for an A (95) in nearly 250 students. Ridiculous.",0
"Took Fact or Fiction over the summer. I was hesitant to take J213 based on what I had heard about the workload! This was not bad. 4 small papers based on each unit (PR, Ad, Journalism, Doc) and a final project. The readings looked overwhelming, but they are short and really interesting. Overall it really fun class. Just be prepared for pop quizzes.",1
I had him for at least 5 or 6 classes and he really does know what he is talking about so listen....and if you have questions....he will answer them.  Wonderful professor....just listen and learn.,1
"The best nurse I have EVER met. NOT mean just HONEST!! AND a caring sweetheart! The first comment is TOTTALLY WRONG about her! She has the intelligence, experience, and dedication!! She may be at times serious in what she does because, HELLO NURSING IS SERIOUS! I have learned so much from her. YOU ARE THE BEST MS. S!! YOU WILL LEARN FROM HER!",1
"A very caring, intelligent, and worthwhile professor. Yes, he rambles. Yes, he talks about large ideas and his lectures get off track at times. But Professor Shine is an amazing professor. For Intro to Lit. Int. - his book selections were well-rounded and introduced me to many great writers. One of Buffalo State's best - and most respected.",1
"Had her for Spring semester. She's easy but not very clear, she's also very confusing says one thing then says another the next day. She loves doing free writes. That's all you do and hand them in for a letter grade. I disliked her way of teaching.",0
"Dr. Brown was interesting as a person and passionate about Ecology. However, he does not know why the class is required for biology majors going into health professions.  His exams are extremely tough and he refuses to curve the class as of now due to lack of students that show up. No help to the ones that show up every day. Fast talker, no notes.",1
Awsome experience.,1
Awesome Prof! He makes the class very interesting!! i really enjoy his class! He grades very generously!! He is awesome!,1
"While I didn't think perception was interesting, Dr. Kunz is a great professor. His tests are fair and he seems like an overall good guy. You can tell he is extremely intelligent, but he is still approachable. He doesn't take attendance (in case that's something you're concerned about).",1
"I recommend you know some basic math before enrolling. I was paired with another student that didn't know anything. As for the instructor, I learned a lot from his class. You need the book for homework, but I used google for the answers. There are group quizzes and a group book report.",1
"Very knowledgable, enthusiastic and current.  Obviously works hard preparing the lectures and demonstrates interest in her students work.",1
No Comments,1
What an ego! I aced this class but the structure was awful and he only seemed concerned with all the work he was going to have with the grading and editing the final product. Not really what the students could do.   He doesn't respond to emails. Rarely gives anybody besides other tenured professors the time of day. ,0
She usually answers emails immediately but is kinda rude with her responses. DONT GO TO CLASS! she just reads word for word from the exercises in the text book and attendance doesn't count. just make sure to do the work at home. Tests are very time pressured. She's very unforgiving when you run out of time. MAKE SURE TO DO THE PRACTICE EXAMS!!!,0
I love Dr. Cochrane. She's a great professor. She demands respect but she also returns it equally unlike many professors I've encountered.,1
stay away!! he is a really nice guy but he doesn't teach AT ALL. Unless you are in his group (there are 3) you get taught by the TA or LA's and they suck. He doesn't give a straight answer so you're basically teaching yourself or learning from the mistakes of other people which only makes everything more confusing.,0
At first it might be a little hard to understand her but as you go to more classes it is easier to understand. Very knowledgeable in what she is doing and very helpful if you ask. Takes her time on lectures so you will fully understand. Even if that means she will have to redo assignments ans syllabus schedule. Would definitively take her classes!!,1
"I never missed a class because I loved them so much. If you do miss a class, you miss a lot of info though. He is wonderful at carefully going over the readings. He grades unpredictably at times, but he allows rewrites. He's very smart and totally nuts. If you don't mind a little disorganization, you will have some laughs and learn a lot.",1
"Hersha's responses and commentary were well thought out, ubiquitous and always made me smile. ",1
"Although you learn some cool technology uses, the environment in the classroom was awful. He'll constantly go off topic on things unrelated to class making the class feel longer than it already is. He constantly yells, get frustrated and impatient to any student wanting to ask questions or clarification and overall an unpleasant person. STAY AWAY!",0
Great teacher. Very passionate about what she teaches. Makes sure that the students are involved with the discussion,1
"People complain that he's hard, but this class is so much easier than chem111L/110L.  Just do what he tells you with regards to your writing, and you'll be fine.  Ask him questions when you're confused.  He's definitely more relaxed in this lab, since he knows most of us, so get to know him; he's a nice guy.",1
"He is simply one of the best professors in this school if not the best. He hardly ever use the book. He talks a lot about the real world application of accounting. By paying close attention to his class,you'll easily understand account and there is no need for those extra readings after class. He is very straight-forward on final. TAKE HIS CLASS.",1
GREAT educator and most importantly good person. You will learn immensely. I recommend him for your divisionals.,1
Most boring teacher. He does  not know anything. He keeps teaching and students don't get anything.,0
Take CHE 118A with Schore if you can! He has a really generous curve. I did ok on the midterms and even worse on the final but I managed to get an A-.,1
"Micheal is a decent professor. His online class requires you to teach yourself, although he does provide a slideshow for each chapter. This class is all exams, but you get two attempts on all exams. No midterm, just a final. All exams are open from day 1 of the semester, but all of them have a deadline, you mostly get a week for each chapter exam.",1
"Dr. Solano is a great professor. Honestly, If you show up to class and follow along with him you should have a good idea on whats going on in the class, regardless of your intelligence. On top of that, the homework can be time-consuming, however if you sit down and do it, the exams are extremely similar to the homework. Highly recommend!",1
"Shes a really really good prof if you dont get an a in this class its either because you didnt study for the tests, or read the textbook! Btw make sure you read the research study because alot of those come on the test",1
"Dr. Jones is extremely knowledgeable in his field. I started off by reading the assigned books/text, but every lecture was a repeat of the material, so I stopped reading ahead of class and maintained high As on the in-class essays. Most classes have an aspect of talking to your small group, or as a class as a whole.",1
good,1
"Nice guy. In this class pay very close attention to his opinions, that will be how you are graded. He talks A LOT about his own education so it doesn't hurt to seem impressed. Overall, I'm glad this class is over.",1
The best teacher I have ever had!  So caring and helpful to all of her students.  Wish she taught more nursing classes because I would sign up for all of her classes!,1
One of my favorite classes if you have a hard time with history or find it boring this is the guy that will change your view on everything makes history really enjoyable and fun.,1
I love Dr. Grapenthin. She is such a sweetheart and will take the time to help you if you don't understand what is going on. Come to class and you will pass.,1
Best teach Ive ever had! Made me want to be a tax accountant,1
Professor McLeod seems like a great person and is a good teacher but the homework does very little to prepare you for the exam and he does not create practice exams. I completed all homework and the practice workbook but still struggled on the exams which make up 85% of your grade.,1
This professor is very passionate. The material itself is hard and he goes through it relatively quickly. I wish he provided more practice. He explains things clearly. He has a slight accent.,1
"Professor Zeoli is a great math teacher overall. She conveys the subject matter very clearly when teaching so that the student understands it. Also, the way her Foundations of mathematics class is set up sets up the student for success according to me getting an A in her class. I'm very satisfied with her MA103 class and teaching ability.",1
"She gives a lot of homework, but it's easy to keep your grade up as long as you try! She's also very creative and always makes efforts to keep the class interesting. Khan has her grumpy days like all of us, but really is a nice teacher if you need help. I'd definitely like to take another class with her.",1
"Saralina is pretty great. Very bubbly and energetic and makes a speech class a little more exciting. She is a tough grader and if you don't complete assignments or show up to class then you might have difficulty. Overall, she was pretty fun and I enjoyed how she brought the discussion of art related things into what we were learning.",1
Mr. Drummond was extremely knowledgable. He made sure there was available extra credit. I Liked that he gave time to finish the workbook if you got behind. Take his advice and use the websites he provides as translation tools. Be sure to start early when thinking about your final oral presentation. Good luck. I'd definatly recommend him. Nice too!,1
Dr. Vanderzalm was a great Prof who loves answering questions and was able to explain the material throughly but only gave you the information you needed to know which was great. She gives study guides before exams. Exams were very similar to the study guidies. If you know the study guides inside out you'll get an A on every exam!,1
"oH mY gOd! One of the worst pro. ever ever known. If I have to describe about Chef Haze' class: boring, boring, and super boring. Does he know how to teach? Do homework at home and take quiz online. No choice for hospitality students to have a wonderful chair who is super un-organize and lazy. Dont take this ""hero"" otherwise you gonna cry out loud.",0
"Great guy, super helpful and very easy to get a good grade by just showing up. Always there to help even outside office hours, fair grader, and was really committed to students understanding. Would take another class with him in a heartbeat. Don't have anything negative to say other than he was a slow grader.",1
Suhaan is an excellent professor who cares about his students. You have to put in the work though!,1
"R. Lichtman has good intentions, provides intense informative-over extended lectures. If you have a full-time job plus other obligations do not take him. However, if you primarily identify as an unemployed college student with disposable time and, interest in learning multiple concepts and, perspectives then take his courses.",1
"I have taken 4 classes with this guy so far and let me tell you---it is easier than middle school.  He practicall gives grades away--no work at all is involved.  In fact , you don't even have to attend and will still get an A",1
"Dr. Altimirano's class was sooooo easy, especially if you STUDY and READ the books/readings she gives. It is not that difficult to get a good grade if you pay attention and study for the tests. A+ for Dr. Altimirano!!!",1
"One of the best profs I had in my 4 years.Funny guy with British humor,but more importantly knows his stuff in and out.He writes his own book and it only costs like $7.Don't have to take notes,it's all in his book,just listen.Test are kinda tricky,just study his book he wrote and you'll be ok.Wish he taught the whole year.Was great in 709:481 too.",1
Dr. Lorton is an amazing professor. I took him for Calc III and he explained the math in ways that were easy to understand. He goes through every step thoroughly so if you are paying attention then you will be able to understand everything pretty easily. Do your homework and study for the tests and you'll be fine.,1
"Lectures are long, must read, read and do research. One paper, 4 quizzes and 3 tests. Not a practical class if you are a full-time working adult and have family and home responsibilities. Must attend and read, otherwise you may fail. Only reason I passed is because I read, read, and re-read.",1
"Gary is a great hands-on teacher. I took 370 with him and it was a great, very unique. This class, on the other hand, is nothing like 370. It's all about reading the textbooks, and picking out the important info. Except, he tries to teach it like it's 370, which doesn't work. He doesn't tell you what he will test you on, you just have to guess.",1
"Best of all PGCC teachers, kind, lovely.",1
This class really helped improve my coding design thinking. Challenging but you will truly learn a lot as long as you stay engaged! He's a fair grader -- he does reiterate what he looks for on exams and homework; you just need to keep your ears open and take note of them. Assignments are interesting/fun! Super helpful during OH. Would take again.,1
very unprepared  and doesnot no how to teach he maybe very knowledgeable on the subject but doesn't know how to give us knowledge on the subject,0
"He's so great!! Very helpful. He gives quizzes, midterm and a final exam. But honestly if you pay attention you should be fine. Love him!! Wish he was teaching all the spanish classes",1
"I loved her. She often had different opinions, and this helped me alot in my interpretation for the papers we had to write. She did not grade as harshly as I thought. Tests are easy, and so are the papers if you put time into them. Great class, learned alot.",1
"Professor Bordowitz is a great teacher, he can be boring but if you stick with it he's worth it.  pretty easy. makes everyone participate everyday with a word of the day and is a very fair grader.  long as you follow the rubric he gives you for each essay you'll get an A.  wish i was taking him again. ",1
Dr. Amey is very helpful and responsive to emails from his students. Answers all questions I've asked of him and walked us through the Wiley plus program disaster!  Work is on the easier side if you actually read the chapters assigned and use the practice quizzes before taking the real quiz which counts. Only one trail of each quiz or the final.,1
"Best professor ever! you have to do a lot of work but if you do it you will get an A, he does not grade hard; he just look at it and that is it! TAKE HIM!!!",1
"She is a great professor. Get ready to read, do your works on time and pay attention in class you will get A. she cares about her students and helps them to do well and provides feedback to improve.",1
This WS class is on Men's health. It was such an interesting topic & the professors brought in guest lectures almost every week. They both work together well and provide really great information and you learn a lot. They don't try and trick you so the midterm and final are easy if you study your notes. There are 2 papers and they're easy! Take it!,1
Awesome professor. Class is super manageable if you are willing to do the work weekly. Always accessible by email or phone call!!,1
"This course was very heavy and I wouldn't recommend taking it over a short summer semester.  Otherwise, if you do the work as instructed you'll do fine.",1
"WORST TEACHER EVER IN RAMAPO HISTORY! this lady is a nut! shes unorganized, unintelligent, and plain old irritating. she makes you make tedious and useless crap! we had to make a puppet costume as the final and at the end of all the work we did we never got to keep the costumes!! dont ever TAKE HER! TOO MUCH WORK and shes too picky!!!",0
"fair teacher, but she's hard to understand with her accent, and her study guides are poorly done. In class her slides are barely done and she often talks about other things. The course in general didn't make much sense. we had a sub (dr. day) for two classes and learned more with him than I ever did with her",0
"doesn't answer emails and her rubrics are very vague, pointless, and don't make sense",0
"Worst teacher I've ever had, homework is worth the most in her class and she grades it extremely hard, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR HER CLASS,  I showed up for every class, did every homework, and passed every test with a B- or higher. I'm a honor student and she failed me",0
"He is an amazing professor. He is tough, but if you put in the effort and he sees that you are actually trying, he will go above and beyond to help you. Hes a really nice person and truly wants his students to understand what he is teaching. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
"He is clearly very bright and loves sharing his knowledge, but his class is really hard for an intro level course. Papers are due constantly, with heavy reading due each class. Quizzes on the reading are nearly impossible, and while Creed gives good feedback, expect a long turn around time.",1
"One of my favorite professors! Super interested in what he is teaching and really wants students to learn and do well. Exams are 95% short answer, YOU HAVE TO STUDY TO PASS, quizzes every Friday- they are mostly short answer as well. Gives extra credit for participation. Need to go to class to get notes. Uses book every now and then.",1
"It's true that you may take it for an easy A, which it is, but b/c she cares, you will care as well. You will ACTUALLY become friends with the people in class because it is all discussion based, so be ready to talk. There is a lot of reading, but it can be skimmed easily. Assignments involve going out into DC to experience culture & write about it.",1
"Everyone said the teacher was horrible and terrible, but I feel the teacher was great. He was really knowledgable on all topics and very easy to approach. You have to write three essays in the class and he provides a rubric before every essay letting you exactly what he wants. If you cover all of the things on the rubric you'll be fine.",1
"Professor Nakaji was an amazing professor! You could tell she really does care about her students. Her methods of teaching ASL are really interactive and extremely helpful with learning the material. If I were to take ASL 2, I will definitely be following her to whichever college she goes to! Such a fun class, would highly recommend.",1
It was an easy A and only had 2 tests and research paper that I got a 100 on because I do not think she even read it. She does take attendance every class. I did not learn that much and was able to do my other work during that class. Do not take her class if you actually want to learn about child and adolescent development.,0
Took him during Summer Session. Grade is 50% midterm & 50% final 7 essay questions in class no notes. He expects you to attend class. If you didn't do well in an exam he offers other opportunities for you won't fail. Just read your notes and memorize all the key terms w/examples. He curves the class & tries not to hand out anything below a C.,1
"Most of the assignments are out of 95 points. When the grades are put in canvas it is out of 100, so the highest you can get is 95/100. Super long lectures but the exam is not that hard as long as you study. Almost 90% of the grades for the semester were not posted to canvas until the week before finals.",0
"Dr. McCullough is very nice, and her class was a breeze. There are small assignments due at pretty much every class, but they are easy. You are allowed a 3x5 double sided notecard on the exams; she offers a ton of extra credit.",1
"Susan sets you up to succeed! Go to class and take notes and do as much of the homework as you can and you will do well. She also gives practice exams before the tests and they're super helpful. She's a very fair grader, has clear lectures, and she's obviously passionate about stats, which makes it more enjoyable.",1
"This professor was horrible as a professor, as a person he is rally great. He listens gives great advice and is there for you. However, in class all he does is goes over videos that he gets offline, It sounds like he doesn't know the material he teaches and his test are not what we discuss in class. Horrible class did not learn a thing.",0
"I'll be honest here, I have never put in as much effort as I did with 116. I went to tutors, I went to the east wing, and numerous other places. I failed this class. Ontop of the confusing subject matter, he tends to ramble in class about barely related topics, such as the history of math. He is a nice guy, and is intelligen, but not a good teacher",0
She is such a great professor. She literally explains every detail in her class. She is very energetic and confident and she gives people a feeling that she knows what she is saying to her students. She is also helpful and you can meet her during office hours and she is happy to answer your questions.,1
Best instructor I've had at RRC. His lectures are interesting and you engage in what hes teaching you. He'll help you with anything you need. Easy to contact. Useful content. I would take his class again in a heartbeat. ,1
Great teacher! Do not miss the class before the test. He goes over the review and gives you the answers. Test is made up directly from review. Very nice guy and laid back. I will definitely take him again!,1
"Tough grader, Little feedback, and has no filter",0
"Oh Sheryl, where do I begin? If you've had her, you're ready for what this class entails. However, if you haven't, get ready to be open to criticism. Papers turned into her will come back with tons of ink marks and suggestions. However, her suggestions often reflect old AP style teachings. She changes her mind and criteria a lot as well so listen.",0
"Tough class but Professor Staples makes it very interesting and is encouraging. You have to put the work in and study, study, study! Review sessions are life savers, make sure you manage your time in lab, ask questions, keep a detailed lab notebook. Weekly experiment write ups, weekly objectives, 4 tests and a lab final.",1
"Professor Sonntag is consistently late in all of the meetings. I do concur that she grades with her eyes closed, and she does not fix grades, not a professor that you want to take.",0
"I disagree with all of the negative comments. I am in no way smart enough to take philosophy, and I found his class dead-on. His class is relaxed, and there is no pressure to participate if you don't want to. The TTh classes are a little long but he always gives a break.",1
I wish I could take him every semester :),1
"Professor Hanley is more than a professor, but someone I genuinely admire. He goes above & beyond to actually make you learn in such a positive way. He is very encouraging. He lessons are always meaningful. I have taken him for 3 different classes, all were excellent! Wonderful professor, the BEST at CSUEB for sure!!!",1
He is so nice and so smart. I feel really lucky to have been able to take this class with him. His books are really good too...read them,1
she gives lots of homework which is good if you are not a test taker but they are only worth 15% and the test are worth 50% so you have a higher chance of failing if you dont pass any of your test due to them weighing more than anything else. She is nice and helpful but what really matters is passing lab worksheets an chapter quiz,1
"This class ran off of connect with 3 assignments plus a quiz each but ALSO a ""project"" (busy work) to go along with each week. The directions for these project were never clear and you basically had to guess on the internet and hope and pray you received a decent grade from the TA and even then the professor may come and change it !",0
"BEWARE. IF you kind of show up, kind of do the work, give excuses for extra time or a better grades, Gilmore will destroy you. She holds education in science to a high standard, as she should. She Will Not Baby You, this is college. She's only for the students who truly want to learn & further themselves. Im very proud to be her student.   ",1
"Very good professor. He will work with you and he will not drop you if he sees that you are trying. Tests are easy, not too much class work. A lot of not take taking and lectures.",1
"Whoops, accidently submitted a review for the wrong prof. (Its the one below for ACCT2302 - disregard it) For Prof. Papapavlou,her grade book consist of: LearnSmart (45%); HW (25%); Exams (5% ea. & 10% for the highest one); common assignment (5%). Drops the lowest 3 HW. Her class was SUPER EASY. Finished it in 1 wk cuz I aint trynna pay 4 Connect.",1
"Attendance to the lectures is not required, but his lectures are not recorded. Discussion attendance is mandatory and participation counts. Very good professor and he definitely knew his stuff.",1
"If you put the time in to work through the homework problems, it will really help you on the exam.  She's one of the best ECE professors at UIC.",1
No Comments,1
Lectures were fun and she definitely made the material interesting. Great teaching style and was obviously very knowledgable about the subject. She was very understanding when it came to grading work. Would definitely recommend taking.,1
"Lectures became really dry and boring a few weeks in. He also is hard to hear sometimes because he doesnt like to use the mic in class. writing assignments can seem lengthy for those that dont like to write, ranging from 10-15 paragraphs",0
He is very smart and will not give you the answer right out. He wants you to really learn!,1
Amazing Professor! He really cares about you and your future. A great person to discuss your future with and he really explains the key accounting concepts well! Take him for corp 1 and any other classes if possible.,1
"Best chem professor I've had in davis so far, arguably even better than enderle. Lectures and office hours were so clear and helpful, there's a reason he wrote the book... Amazing and respected, too bad he won't teach 118b",1
Take a course with this guy. He's very fair with the amount of work he hands out (maybe five written assignments all term). He only gives a mid-term and final which are hard because their long. Overall an awsome teacher and I would definitely recommend him.,1
Amazing professor. Easy to fellow modules. All assignments are clear. Highly recommended.,1
amazing man! totally recommend!!,1
A very organized and fair teacher. She is reasonable and interesting and I highly recommend taking French with her.,1
"Cool guy, would recommend him. Would also take him again.",1
"The class is hard but the professor is very helpful. If you are taking an online class, there are video lectures provided each week. The explanation is quite clear. Two tests and the final exam will decide your grade. Other things like homework, weekly quizzes, and forum posts are graded too but the portion is insignificant, about 17% of the grade.",1
This class is fairly easy but the professor doesn't make the topic as interesting. I came in thinking that it would be an interesting class but no.  Don't have to read because he will lecture the reading in class and the whole class is based off the reading.  He is a very nice professor though.  Group members are assigned to you for final project.,1
"Hes really funny and despite teaching about politics, he rarely expresses his personal political beliefs, with the exception of hating all politicians and Wall Street (as we all should). One time, he said The only thing politicians know how to read is checks. Anyways, he simply teaches you the philosophers claims and he makes it understandable.",1
Great Teacher! Make sure to read and understand lectures. If you need help before a test she will clarify. All slides are online and grade is straight forward. Tests are not easy but as long as you know the study guide and pay attention you WILL PASS!! She knows how to teach and she knows about anthro. I highly recommend her class !!!!!!!!!!!,1
"He is a very unexciting teacher, and it was sometimes hard to stay awake.  I had no trouble getting an A, though, and if you're willing to put in the time, you can easily get a good grade.  All the info you need is in the notes, and the practice problems are similar to the test.  Master those problems (not just memorize), and you will be fine.",1
"Easy enough class, take notes do the readings (CRUCIAL). Drops the lowest quiz grade, will throw a curve if he thinks it's necessary, is available for office hours. Passionate about his field. Also did study abroad with Walling in Belize. AMAZING. He's very well respected for his knowledge on the ancient Maya. ",1
He is the best math teacher I could ever get. He knows we have life outside and always helps with assignments. He is quick at replying emails. Very funny and helpful professor. I will highly recommend this class.,1
"I took her online class.
 One annoying thing is the old assignments that junk up the pages and sometimes the tests don't work.  There are also brief reports due with each chapter. 
 She is very unorganized. Not reccomended",1
"GREAT professor. Definitely cares about students and gives every opportunity to improve ones grade. This class is not easy, but its not supposed to be, If you put in the effort and READ the textbook you will get an A. 4 tests each with 25 questions which can be a little tricky. Study hard for them, overall good class with an amazing professor",1
Sandra is a tough but fair marker. You need to do the work to get the grade. She is clearly passionate about the material and does her best to make it engaging even if it's not your thing. Class time can be an issue if students go on off-topic tangents because she doesn't stop them to bring the conversation back which can waste time.,1
"Honestly, class with him was stressful. He loves calling people out in front of the entire class. EXTREMELY strict cell phone policy, always walking around the classroom during tests which makes a tense environment. 2 papers due the day of the midterm and final. The good thing is he does an in depth review of the test the day before. Pretty easy A-",1
"She is literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Her unprofessional and hostile attitude are sort of shocking level. In my opinion, this program, especially in the clinical part, does not constitute and organized well.",0
He is a good professor with MAJOR anger issues. He got really mad at certain times almost scary. I would take him again but I wouldn't want to piss him off. He's helpful and VERY sarcastic. He thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread and talks himself up all the time but it's more amusing than annoying.,1
"Jorgen is an amazing professor he bring a whole new view to philosophy. I loved his class, and would definitely take it again!",1
"DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASSES SHE TEACHES. She should not be an instructor. Her classes do not make any sense, she asks students to explain problems even if we've never covered the material before. I had to hire a private tutor to get through her class because she did not teach and would not meet me during her office hours. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Dr. Searfoss was my favorite English prof. She does a lot with the textbook and she got me to appreciate writing a bit more. She can be really sassy especially if you tell her you didn't know something was due. She really wants you to pass, so she'll help you when she can, but she does make you work for your grade.",1
"Dr. Venus is  of my favorite professors at Gordon. Super nice guy, very understanding and agreeable. He has a good sense of humor which kind of keeps you alert during his lectures, you never know what he will say next. His 1101 class was easy. As long as you put in the effort, you'll do well. Also, his final is only 5%, which I though was nice.",1
"Show up to class, He will literally tell you whats on the tests/quizzes so take notes, lectures are actually pretty good as well",1
I absolutely loved Mr. Tyson!! He is hilarious and will go to extremes to explain anything to make sure you understand. Super nice and very respectful. Treats everyone like adults instead of children. Wish he was my professor for every class I take.,1
"Dude is a legend at PSU. He is super caring and lays everything out for you in Canvas. It takes work to get an A in the class, but it's super easy to pass as long as you do what he tells you. He makes some really funny offhanded comments in class, so watch out for those.",1
Professor Wellborn is very passionate about history and he wants you to understand it. His lectures are amazing and entertaining. I highly recommend taking his class as he is a very passionate professor and cares for his students.,1
Prof Justice does everything a professor should do for his students. He explains how to do problems and gives exercises to do on (do them and ask questions on the discussion board) Utilize him and his knowledge because he will respond and explain in depth how to do things. His office hours are also very helpful but come with questions. 10/10 prof!!,1
Great guy -- he cares.  Good class,1
"Rude and unhelpful. After I did poorly on the first test, I asked for help with coursework and all he said was ""so are you going to drop the class or not.?"" Obviously  I should've as I failed the course and had to change majors anyways.",0
"The best professor you could ever ask for. This man will change your life. He is brilliant, beyond brilliant, and expands your thinking to realms you didn't even know existed. He changed my life, plain and simple. Go into his course with an open mind and be prepared to transform into a better person. He is the best. Thank you!",1
Absolutely awful. 10/10 would not recommend.,0
Awful,0
Definitely take this course with her if you like for people to be condescending to you. Heavy workload. Assumes everyone wants to be a Pollution Manager...This course and instructor were so not worth my time. The material could be interesting if you didn't have to WASTE so much time being an English major for an Environmental Studies course.,0
"Dara was great! She made the intense 6 wk summer semester interesting and tolerable.  Quizzes everyday, but helped you stay ontop of the info. Weekly exams. Sometimes difficult.  Expect to put in many many hours, and still question/second guess yourself when taking the tests!",1
You will learn so much in this class. She is a very caring and understanding professor. I took her for two classes and I had a blast. She really knows her work and teaches very well love her,1
"Peggy was recommended to me and i am glad i took her easy A. She enjoys discussion with her classes, enjoys talking about current events, in the business world and in world news. The homework is extremely easy. she has lots of career experience. Class discussions are great and are just about every class.",1
"You are a fool if you are reading this and do not take a class with her. She covers so many topics that you're never bored with what you're learning. And she is a very fair grader. Her french is great and she improves your spoken and written french immensely. Amazing class, amazing professor. Such a wonderful woman.",1
He's clear and fair and very willing to help. He knows his stuff and is willing to teach so long as you are willing to learn.,1
Very helpful and informative.,1
Just read from power point slides. Tests were really unfair as many questions weren't even discussed in class. Extremely vague study guide for Final exam. Would not take another class from this instructor.,0
"Dr. Wydner is extremely helpful and very sweet.  She is a great teacher, very down to earth.  She is very sweet and is highly recommended.. for both lab AND lecture!",1
"Omg! There are not enough words to say how amazing this woman is! Especially in logic! She is the best! I would not have been able to make an A if it was not for her helpfulness, patience, and the open door she always gave me. I took her for logic and old testament and she is just the best professor ever! If you want a professor that cares and is always there to help, Dr. Childs is the best in this whole world. She taught me so many things!",1
Excellent professor. Really understands you and actually wants you to do well. ,1
"Prof is very passionate about the material. Willing to give hints on how to treat assignment questions if you are stuck. Very positive energy. Get the books though, he can be hard to follow.",1
"Mr. Daigle is very confusing while lecturing. His lectures do not match with the information in the textbook. His tests are not consistent with lectures. He has a bad attitude towards students, he cusses, and disrespects students. He shouldn't be teaching at all. Do not waste your money on a class that he teaches.",0
"Good Professor, work is easy, however be prepare to do a lot of assignments.",1
"All of his tests are short answer, but if you take good notes and study you will pass. Gets off topic a lot too.",1
"Clear and concise on what is expected. Easy to get help if needed; if you show that you care then he will do everything he can to help you. I took him for OS theory and decided to take him again for Software Engineering since I knew what to expect. If you come to class and participate from time to time, there's no reason you won't get a B or higher",1
"Heavy grader, not specific to the point of what should be done.",0
"Prof. Elliott is super.  She has interesting and engaging discussions and keeps them moving, mostly (occasionally they drag but rarely).  She is a hard grader, but you will have ample opportunities to discuss your paper with her.  Her office always seems to be open.  She's great.  Take a class from her!",1
"She is a great teacher, just have to give her a chance. She gives a lot of homework and the class is very independent, however she is always there for questions if needed. I would definitely choose her again!",1
She is so hott and has a very interesting class. You can't beat that! She is kind of difficult but overall not bad. She will let you know exactly what she wants and if you don't complete your assignment then it's tough luck! I recommend this class to anyone that wants a fun Composition class.,1
"Extremely smart, lots of work, but he's willing to work with you.",1
"OK professor. This class was very easy, but his attempt to teach/help was never sufficient enough. My classmates always seemed frustrated to follow and he'll mock you if you didn't understand. I didn't need to attend his class to pass his tests b/c I felt like the textbook was much more helpful! I'd say it's only mandatory to turn in hw/for tests.",0
Hes an okay teacher. He's passionate about the topics and lectures are pretty interesting.  However nothing is ever graded on time. He will grade everything on the last day of class so you have no idea how you're doing throughout the semester. Also grading is VERY inconsistent.,1
"She is energetic about her subject and very helpful & accommodating. Besides this, I did have a few things that bothered me a bit. Going into this class I think it is nice to know before-hand (I didn't), she is not a native Spanish speaker and has a STRONG English accent. I prefer to learn from a native. Also a negative- class is very reading heavy",1
"I took Math 1000 online with Danny Dyer and he literally did NOTHING. The TA's marked assignments in their own language and they offered no clarification nor did he. He used someone else's lectures for the entire course and always took at least a week to answer emails, which isn't helpful when the assignments are released 4 days before they're due.",0
She ROCKS!,1
"Professor Stoner is a brilliant man who is very passionate and knowledgeable about political theory. There is plenty of reading involved. Plenty. A quiz every class which can make or break your grade. One essay, one speech, a midterm, and a final. Put in the effort and you'll get an A. He's super caring; reach out with any problem and he will help.",1
One of the main things I remember from his class is that he would always stop after every concept and ask if he needed to rephrase something. He begged for people to ask questions but no one would. His lectures aren't confusing if you participate & ask questions. He made study guides for tests because someone asked if he would. He cares a lot.,1
No.,0
She is a good teacher who really cares about her students. She is not hard on grading papers or homework. She does want all of her students to participate. She is not tech-savvy (It was an online/zoom class). But over-all she is great.,1
"I will never take a class by this professor again, nor anyone associated with him. He entered grades once two weeks in and hasn't since, you have to guess your current grade. If you're sick and in the hospital doesn't matter, you have to turn in his weekly essay (approx 5 pages minimum) does the absolute bare minimum, he shouldn't be a teacher.",0
Very nice!! Was funny and quirky! Didnt have to go to class which rocked but it was still fun to go to it !,1
"I took this fall 2015 as a required FED course for chemical engineering. It was AWFUL. Its 3 hours of pure torture. Monotone, gives no direction, and cant control his class. Its a water-air pipe system, AKA a boring project. Do your work first, then goof off. Oh, and the entire course is a group project (no, you dont pick your group). Good luck -_-",0
"Good teacher, lectures are disorganized but make sense. Spends a lot of time going through problems and examples. Test every other week. Will take 1 point off for specific things, tells you what they are. Not a harsh grader though. Gives tricks to remember things. Homework everyday, but not many problems. Will replace lowest test with attendance.",1
"He's very easy-going and approachable, however, he wasn't well organized with the material and didn't really stick to the syllabus. If you pay attention and jot down what he says during and the songs he plays, you'll get an A.",1
You can tell that she really cares for her students. She spends some time going over the material in class much not as much as she showed. The tests are kind of hard especially if you don't study.,1
the average class grade on his exams is ALWAYS failing and he advertises a 20 point curve in his syllabus. The fact that he HAS to give a 20 point curve should tell MTSU that he can't teach and no one learns anything. Avoid this professor.,0
"Professor Mantell is sweet, but there is too much information on the powerpoints. Grading for Lab is super easy. She does provide a study for each test. I highly recommend takin BIO before taking this class.",1
"Dr. Fischer is a very nice professor. He's very monotone and the seminar tends to drag, but the topics we read about were very interesting. He's kind and approachable, so don't be afraid to ask him if you get stuck. Only one paper due at the end, don't procrastinate.",1
"Probably the smartest man in the world when it comes to music history.  This class is soo much fun, tests are tough but the class is interesting, goes by quickly, and work for each class is minimal.  Has a tendency to call on people randomly in class.",1
"The best professor at Valley College. Infact, she is the best teacher I ever had since grade school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"I don't know what the bad comments are talking about. Ms. Druffel is awesome! Her class is super easy and if you attend discussion, you should be good for the midterm and final. She DOES curve the test and she drops the lowest homework and quiz score. To top that off, she gives extra credit! How can you say ANYTHING bad about this class?? It is so ",1
The best professor,1
Shes cool. She makes things easy to understand.,1
Going to Think Tank for help on her WebAssign homework is essential to passing (sometimes there will be things on there she doesn't cover in class). Her classnotes are helpful- always review materials from the unit before the test because she usually uses problems from notes. Beware of missing homework that she posts the night before it's due.,1
Took Prof. Casada's 8 week online class over the summer and passed with an A. The expectations are clearly laid out. Be prepared to read the textbook and the class is fast paced. He's a great teacher,1
"I know Ms. Gershuni teaches many classes at the same time, yet she's very helpful, very nice, and very professional in teaching. She's definitely a wonder woman of TIM School. Basically, she has all the qualities that a college instructor should have.",1
"I would for sure recommend Hartman and his his136 class. he's funny and fair. I enjoyed listening to him lecture and his take on social issues are very interesting. he is a very obvious democrat, and he makes you buy his book which is also completely left sided. besides that, he's pretty cool and a great history professor. 4 sure show up to class!",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Three tests and a final. THAT'S IT. No quizzes so you don't know how you are doing before the tests, and the tests are only 3 questions. Barely any partial credit, so one question wrong and you have a bad grade. Very smart guy, but cannot get on the students level to teach properly. Flies through the material.",0
he is annoying and doesn't care about anyone opinions,0
"He is an amazing person, very friendly and makes it a point to get to know you as a student and individual. But the lectures don't connect with the books, and neither of those connect with the tests. I payed close attention to what he was saying in class and did poor on the tests.",1
"avoid this lab instructor...She has a serial killer look to her. Very hard marker and I know this because I took my work to the other two lab instructors and they both agree the mark should be higher. Maybe she means well but honestly, it is stupid the deductions she give...just avoid, go to Melissa's section",0
"I had Ryan for a portfolio class last semester. While he's blunt and opinionated, his feedback is always immensely helpful and thorough. He's always available over email and really does want the best for his students. Be prepared to get roasted if you don't put in work, but if you do, he'll spend lots of time and effort helping you grow your book.",1
"Professor Birch is a well respected and knowledgeable instructor. He does have a clear grading criteria that most of his classes follow. His exams do hold a lot of grade weight. However, if you study the quizzes and show up to class there should be no reason not to do well. I was a little skeptical, but he turned out to be my favorite professor.",1
"straight forward professor, he tells u what will be on test and what will not be covered, during lecture. Allows cheatsheet but class is purely based off 3 exams (non-cumulative). Feels like AP stats all over again; Easy to get a B , definitely would've tried harder to get an A. Didn't pay attention during lecture since stats is a review",1
"Everything that you need to know to succeed she will tell you. The exams are exactly what she said/posted in class. Tips to succeed: do not pester her and make sure your responses are as concise as possible, if you do all of this you are golden.",1
"By far the best teacher I've had. Amazing personality and is beyond competent. Study guides for exams are a must. Sometimes exam material was not covered in lectures. If you do the homework, exams are passable. Material is covered quickly.",1
Tonya Warden is very rude! She doesn't help you with anything she assigns. She's never understanding! She will give out big papers but won't let you work on it in class to help you prepare for the paper by the time it's due. She's close minded and one of the most disrespect professors on this campus! I recommend no one to take her class!! ,0
Very nice and understood that there is a life outside college.,1
Great professor for ENG 102 highly recommend. Assignments are easy because she tells you exactly what to change to get a high grade.,1
A ridiculous amount of work each week. No communication with instructor whatsoever. Missed One deadline because it is a class where teacher doesnt email you for months and failed. I got an F whereas I had gotten an A on 2301 with a different professor.,0
Pat has a lot of experience in the journalism field and it shows in the way he teaches his class. He is a kind and patient man and is always willing to help. He is lenient when it comes to grading...you will do fine as long as you do your work and meet the deadlines!,1
"Dr. Steadman is a little on the hard arse side but as long as you speak up when talking to him and show respect, he'll like you. He seems cold but loves to joke with students!! DO NOT BE LATE. I'm sure he's harder in other courses but he's a great EG101 instructor & a good person to get in good with because he's the dean of the college of eng.",1
"If you read the text book you will pass easily. She goes off topic every single lecture. She gives out A LOT of pointless assignments such as crosswords, fill in the blanks, etc. but because she gives out a lot most of them are extra credit. Only negative is her personality, she treats people like children and talks down a lot.",1
"I took Dr. Crumpler back in summer and fall of 2019. The class is made of him doing 50% of the work, teaching you the concepts in a simplistic, sarcastic manner, and the other 50% is the work you put into the class. If you don't read, do the work, and go to class, you will fail. He truly does care, but you need to put in the effort and the work.",1
"I have never left a rating, but this dude is something else. Anything that isn't auto-graded in mindtap is graded like sh*t. Group projects are a nightmare, attendance is a grade and I was marked absent for a no-class holiday and wasn't given credit. Emails take years to be responded to. Basically do not take unless there is no other option. BIG NO",0
Couldn't ask for a better instructor. Wish she could find time to teach more classes like micro;),1
"Lovely person, okay teacher. She assigns a LOT of homework usually short papers and exercises and you're expected to pair up and speak French with someone every class. Nonetheless, she's fair if you put in the work, you get a good grade, and if you slack off, she notices.",1
"By far the funniest teacher I've had at DigiPen, and the best at keeping classes relevant on the topic as well as interesting. Some people dislike that he's a comedic teacher, but I believe it helped me as a student pay attention to the subject matter more. I only had him for a third of the semester, but I'd definitely take him again.",1
I took her online class. They layout was very unorganized and confusing. the dates are wrong in the weekly assignment folder so I got a few zeros cause she never changed the dates from her previous classes. ALOT of reading. expects you to know everything already and if you dont expects you to learn it on your own. if never taken anat before dont,0
"100 slides copy-pasted from Wikipedia and elsewhere. there's time for about half, but who cares: there's no apparent structure, he produces nothing but truisms and mainstream opinions, no critical approach at all. In international politics! Don't email with criticism, he won't respond. I grant, it's an easy A. Hardest part is to stay awake",0
"If you are looking for an easy grade and a simple class, you have come to the right place. If you are here to learn, pass this one up.",1
I was intimidated by this class as I'm not familiar with HTML coding but this was an easy A! She has step by step instructional videos. Tests were easy too,1
You have to work for an A but Dave provides you with everything you need. He is incredibly helpful and makes learning financial accounting fun. ,1
"Tabea is a brilliant instructor. She can be quite intimidating and her syllabus is daunting, but as the term goes along you will  realize that she is super kind and her assignments are manageable. If you show up to class and do what you're responsible for, you'll have a great experience in her class. Dont go on your phone when shes lecturing. Ever.",1
"I took Dr. Warner for Intro to Pop Culture. It was a 2hr 45min class and very boring. I personally did not like the content, was not what I was expecting. He does not use PowerPoint so it's just him talking. Grades on consist of one paper, midterm, and final. Bad at responding to emails. He's a wonderful person, but a boring class.",1
"She is very nice and really knowledgeable about science. I like her passion for her job. However the tests are way too hard, and you have to learn some of the material outside of class.",1
"Good professor and kind to her students. Lectures are directly from the PowerPoints that are posted on blackboard. Reading is a must as the tests consist of the terms and anything that is italic. She gives study guides & extra-credit that helps boost your grade. Overall just read, study terms, and study PowerPoints you will get an A.",1
"Very respectful, inspirational, gives helpful feedbacks and very thorough. Tabea is not generous with grades. She is very passionate about her students leadership growth, how they impact their communities and the world at large. Tebea is awesome!",1
Professor Tulin is excellent. I took his Ancient Law and Rhetoric course. He truly makes you think critically and encourages you to become open-minded. The only warning is that after taking this class you will think differently. The reading material is also interesting.,1
"This class was one of the funnest classes I have ever taken. Learning how to make different videos and editing them is amazing and it is no pressure, everyone gets a chance to do it. The teacher is very nice and accessible outside of the classroom. One thing is that you have to TRIPLE check deadlines because they are not always 100% clear.",1
the most awesomest Acct Prof:D,1
"Good Proff ... always checking to see if every1 is ""comfortable with the material so far""",1
"He didn't do the best explaining projects or understanding students' questions. The grading wasn't too harsh though. Everything taught can be easily learned through the textbook or looking it up online. When there were technical issues for the class or individuals, he was very understanding and helpful.",1
"We use DataDesk, a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program",0
"She is the most amazing professor, I ever met. If you guys like to pass with good grade then, She is the best professor.",1
Best professor I've ever had at UT !!! Highly recommend him. Makes Calc 2 so easy!,1
"She's very nice, and extremely helpful. Just do your work, show up to class, and talk to her about your paper, and you'll do well.",1
i love this guy. he is always there to help student,1
best professor in my whole college lifetime. very help and understanding. test are straight to the point and gives great reviews. i hate reading and the text is a book that is just awsome. very funny professor and gives hands n learning with the class. great discussions and is very open minded. Dr lyall makes you feel very confident in pasessing.,1
"He had a way of taking long pauses between statements -- whether it was to emphasize his ""genius"", or if he was just waiting for one of the half-asleep students to ask a question, I'll never know. However, he seemed genuinely interested in how everyone was finding the material.",1
"I think he was by far one of my favorite professors. I learned French I well, and I always never realized I was learning. He has a great teaching style, he's very friendly, kinda goofy/nerdy, but he really cares for his students. I wish the university had kept him, but wherever he goes next I hope his new students appreciate him.",1
"The major group project was easy, but the marking rubric was not firm.  If one group met with the client three times, you were expected to meet three times, or you will lose marks, so try to do what other teams won't think of.  Ray does keep track of who is on their phone and not paying attention in class and he will dock you participation marks.",1
He is really funny! Dr. Cogan demonstrated very good points about culture and made class reasonable.,1
If you try you will pass.,1
"This is the most disappointing class you can take. The assignment requirement was not clearly stated. He is a very subjective marker, and you'd better write something which can fit his political opinions. Unapproachable outside the class, he refused to talk to students in person unless you have something he thinks time-worthy.",0
"I took ASPN 201 with Prof. Correa and it was by far my favorite class. He is very easy to understand and he is thorough in the lectures. He grades quizzes pretty heavily but as long as you come to class, and study your notes, you will get an A. He is very strict about in classroom rules but as long as you respect him, he'll respect you.",1
"Two things wrong.  1) Her lectures are confusing. They are not well connected and the slides are not made available to students. 2) She is very rude. She asks questions of students in class and then cuts off their answers. She occasionally commands students to stand up and move about the classroom, as if to show she is in charge.",0
"Phil 101 was super easy with Stockton. He doesn't take attendance, and other that the 3 tests, the only work you have to turn in is notes when he calls for it, and it's extra credit. He has a learning assistant that holds review sessions right before the tests that are almost verbatim of the tests which are super easy anyway. Super easy class",1
"Professor Lopez was a pleasure to have teaching material that can at times be intimidating. His lectures on Shakespeare was based heavily on visuals, and he challenged the class to do a visual reading of a play at the end of the year, which he was really very open about! Highly appreciates creativity as a means of teaching and learning!",1
Easy A.,1
"I CANNOT say enough good things about her! She is very knowledgeable and intelligent. She gives amazing feedback and really helps you grow as a writer. I had to withdraw from another professor's English 102 class, but this class is manageable with her! You learn a lot and her class is so structured. Uses canvas, so that's a plus.",1
"This class was easy except for the chronological portion on the exams. You have to know certain dates. The terms she gives you is what is tested on, she doesnt pull outside information. You will have 1 paper and you are able to submit it twice for a better grade. Her lectures are interesting, but sometimes she goes fast explaining the terms.",1
"Overall this was an easy course. She made HIST 2112 online fun and rather simple. The tests are the exact same as the study guide so memorize those and you will pass with flying colors. The essays are time consuming but her feedback is solid. The project is time consuming as well but again, pay attention to her feedback and you're good. She's a gem",1
"Be attentive, read all assignments, answer all points, do discussion posts by extra credit deadline, use GroupMe app for group interaction, be organized. Its tough but doable. His feedback is excellent. Assignments are clear. Great professor & supportive. You put in the work, you get the grade. 21 extra credit points. Fun & interesting class.",1
"She doesn't know how to explain her assignments correctly. She expects her students to only work on her assignments and forgets we have other classes to work on. She also doesn't grade her assignments until the very end, so you will never know where you stand. Drop this class if you can.",0
Radhika is great. Her lectures move really fast so you will want to print out the slides and take notes on those instead of trying to keep up writing on a blank paper. You will want to come to class. What she tests on is clearly what is learned in class. You will know what to study in more depth (in the book) based on her slides.,1
"Professor Aizura was very nice, and you could tell he had a lot of passion for the subject of gender studies. Overall, the class was definitely not for everyone. Intriguing, but a lot of talk of different opinions you may not agree with. The structure of the class also was confusing at times, specifically the grading.",1
"I really enjoyed Professor McGlynn's class this semester! She is a great lecturer, never dry or boring with plenty of real world examples to help you relate the information. This class flew by and was never overwhelming. Professor McGlynn is extremely knowledgeable with plenty of experience to steer you in the right direction.",1
"I thought I'd be really bored with Ger Media, but Prof Oosterhof was a really good professor, by far the most understanding prof I've had during COVID. She actually meant it when she said she understood we were stressed out from COVID and didn't want to overwhelm us. She would get our feedback and switch the schedule and assignments around for us",1
"This was the worst English professor I have ever had. He rambles on about philosophy and the true meaning of friendship and ""philia."" He makes you join a messageboard to post your ""excellent thinking"" and it's all extremely pointless. Beware this class and if you already have it I would drop.",0
"Good lecturer, knows his stuff. The class is just really kind of boring and nothing is really worth writing down in the lectures. It can be interesting at times but most of the time it's dry. Most of the student taking the class are Business majors who just want a Humanities credit so they don't really care about the concepts they're learning",1
"Prof Galan is a great professor.  He really knows what he is talking about, loves questions, very willing to help. Takes attendance, if you show up for class but are still struggling, this will play a big factor on your grade. Reviews for Exams are helpful, and you write 4 papers in the semester (2 on films watched in class and 2 on books)",1
"He's a really nice guy, he has a slight accent but if you pay attention you should be fine. This class has a lot of material so be prepared to study.  There's a few quizzes here and there not to bad, two homework's, and one midterm and final. This class is a harder ITM class but he's an easy teacher. He grades on a curve, and gives a fullcheatsheet",1
"She's a Really good teacher. The discussion were very interesting. Its very basic. 2 quizzes,2 exams,2 papers, and 1 group project. Lots of chances to recope your grade.",1
"More than half of the class got D's or F's and Dr. Stone confirmed it in an unprofessional letter to the students. There is no mathematical curve in this class. So if everybody gets below a 60% as their final grade, they are all getting D's or F's. And he said doing the homework and easy quizzes are count as a curve. Avoid this guy at all costs!!!",0
"Honestly her exams are not difficult and are very repetitive, she even posts the exams for you to solve. She's an amazing professor, and I easily got an A+ on her course.",1
"Software Refactoring, more like JDeordrant tutorial. The professor is all cool though, 5 stars for him. Would recommend. Take his courses only if you are a good programmer. If you don't know how to code, why are you even in Concordia? leave, make space for the deserved ones.",1
"Lectures are related to the textbook material, however you may not make some connections during lectures if you don't read beforehand. There is a final group project that will greatly impact your grade if not prepared.",1
"He's a good professor, but a really hard professor as well. However, if you go to his office hours and ask him questions he will do everything in his power to get you the grade you want. I really struggled at the beginning and he helped me on the papers. I ended up getting an A! Attendance is a grade. Good class.",1
She is horrible! Doesnt care about the students overall and seems nice at first but be aware!!!,0
Dr. V was a very brilliant yet challenging professor. Her tests and quizzes were difficult but fair for the most part in Genetics. If you study to understand the material and not just merely memorize the material then you will do well. She is very knowledgable but she has a tendency to be overwhelming with her level of detail at times.,1
Dr. Galan is amazing. He is passionate about history and he loves his students. He makes class so enjoyable you don't want to skip.,1
"I have had her for two classes (Eng 001 and Eng 101) and she did a great job in both classes.  A little essay heavy, but over all the readying were interesting and she is a fair grader. Come to class, do the readings, participate and you'll do great.",1
"Prof. Nedd is a cool guy and creates a good classroom enviroment. There is a ton of homework; usually took about 12 hours a week, unless there was an essay, in which case i'd say closer to 18ish hours of work, but the graded material is fairly easy. Lectures are good for discussion but his power points arent very helpful.",1
"Completely useless teacher. I came out of the class with the same level of drawing skill that I had going in. He will state that he dislikes your drawings without actually telling you what specifically is wrong with them or how to improve them. I received back one graded drawing that just said ""This is problematic""  on top of it and nothing else.",0
"Good prof, obviously knows her stuff. This class was pretty difficult though...mostly because I am not a science person. She's also a tough grader (1/2 points, etc.)",1
"I've taken both MTH111 and 112 with Professor Selph and it's been AMAZING. I've never had a math teacher who explained things so clearly. He doesn't just give you a formula, he shows you how to get the formula, and it makes it so much easier to understand. Great class, great teacher, no textbook purchase required. 10/10 would take again.",1
Great instructor with years of medical field knowledge.,1
Professor Bogdan is one of the best Criminal Justice Professors out there. It will listen to everything you have to say and he is very understanding. If you ever have a question you can go to his office even during is NON office hours and he will always help ! LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM!,1
"Terrible class.  She needs to realize not every student can remember exact details from several books. She has quizzes every day. She is nice and has a good personality, but needs to make her reading a lot easier for those who can't read and comprehend easily.",0
"Just posting so you all are warned. Take another prof. Dr. Wigginton is super judgmental and rude especially if you ask questions or dont understand her examples. She cancelled class 6 times all last minute, twice before the midterm, and expected us to teach ourselves based on the textbook only. No study guide and doesnt follow the syllabus.",0
"Labeled an MBIOS course, but MBIOS was not addressed. This course should be listed as sociology/anthropology. The class only discussed topics like poverty, women's rights, and mental trauma. Teacher assigns a ludicrous amount of reading and writing. You WILL spend every night typing papers and reading about topics not related to MBIOS. Awful class",0
"Took this class two years ago about technology and education, lesson design and assessments. The professor drew on a broad variety personal case studies from his elementary school teaching days to broaden your understanding on best practices for 21st Century classroom.",1
"Chris is awesome, especially considering the online format because of COVID. Grade is based on a few 50 question multiple choice tests w/ explanation, open note. Tests are easy, if you watch the lectures. Also, you have attend some mini-courses taught by the TA. Overall a positive low-stress class to take with some interesting material.",1
"Took Professor Gier for my business class, and now Macroeconomic he is the best!",1
"Janey is awesome. Really can't say enough good things about her. She is consistently prepared, and she is passionate about the subject. She goes above and beyond with help for students and preparing extra-curricular cultural learning experiences for the class. You can tell she is invested and cares about her students and the subject.",1
Dr Wilson is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She requires that your life solely revolve around her class. She assigned 400 question LearnSmarts due in 48 hours. She gives only 20 minutes for a 20 question quiz. She refuses to answer questions in class and calls you unprofessional for asking questions. She cannot explain things at all.,0
"Great teacher. Relaxed, approachable, knowledgeable and easy on the eye :o",1
"I loved his class. It's not often you see a real scientist teaching his subject. Very knowledgeable and excited about the material. I would take more of his classes, but it's not under my degree.",1
Never graded any work so the last week of class I have no idea where my grade stood. Posted a test without telling anyone what book we were suppose to have . Also posted assignments 3 days into the week.,0
best teacher at st.joes she is very helpful and understanding. i took her for 3 years straight because shes a great teacher,1
"I wasn't sure what I was expecting with this class, but it turned out to cover a lot of interesting topics. The discussion sections got a little boring, but the readings and lectures were intriguing. There isn't a lot of homework or exams, just one paper, a take home exam, and participation in online discussions.",1
Dr. Al-Marashi is the most knowledgable professor I have had so far in my college career. You will never want to skip class because his lectures are so interesting. This is the first class that I have looked forward to attending every time so I will definitely take his class again.,1
"The professor is tough, but really knows her stuff. Always willing to take time outside of class to help. Great teacher.",1
Extremely rude and doesn't help you if you ask. Tells you that you did an assignment wrong without telling you specifically what you missed.,0
Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. Garyen Chong is the best biology professor at Langara and he is a very fair and lenient marker. Read the textbook and you will succeed.,1
"You might not like him at first, but you'll warm up to him. He teaches you by the book, but in a different arrangement so that you better understand. It's a great instructional class, you may just find yourself enjoying it.",1
"I don't why there is no option for choosing 185A as his class. I took 185A this quarter, which is complex analysis. He was a funny guy that alway talked about off topic material. He wrote down ever follow his previous notes during the class meetings, which is very useless unless you really understand it. Two midterms and 1 final paper. Aviod him.",0
Took Prof Kumari for Macro and OH BOY... the work load is a lot.  I took her over the summer so the class was over before I even knew it. Every week 4 chapters of 10q homework and 10q quiz + a discussion + an exam.  She offers extra credit which I highly recommend  and she's a solid choice but get ready for butt- hours (about 20 or so/ week),1
Great Professor! Lecture may get a little boring at times but he provides a clear grading rubric for all of the assigned papers. Plus no exam :D ,1
One of my worst college professors ever. She knows that material herself but can't explain it at all. I wouldn't even recommend this class. You really need extra tutoring and like help from multiple people. She literally only explains things once and will ignore your question is hse doesn't understand it or she has someone else answer it.,0
"Ken is a great teacher who is very passionate about what he teaches. I took his 8am class and showed up for every class because the material was so interesting. He cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. There is about 7 assignments, no quizzes, one true/false final and no book needed. I highly recommend him!",1
Very easy class. Assignments are very straightforward and as long as you do them and participate in class you should have no problem getting an A.,1
"I took his Global Cinema class, AMAZING teacher, great movie selection, HIGHLY KNOWLEDGABLE, you will not regret taking his class. A few easy quizzes, one group project over a topic in the class, and 3 essays. Your homework is some of the readings, and AMAZING movies. You'll have a movie to see every week with your boo. (They aren't EVER boring.)",1
This guy knows his material but loses the audience often.  He doesnt know how to teach.  There is a huge difference between a master of material and master at teaching the material.  I have had to teach myself everything even after attending lectures and sitting in the front row. ,1
Professor Chistensen is the best English Professor at Florida Memorial University. He is great. Upon leaving his class your writing skills will improve tremendously. Keeep doing what you are doing Professor Christensen,1
"What she teaches in class is interesting, however she sometimes she does put you on the spot. Her tests have NO relation to what is taught in class. Seems to have little direction in her lectures (no wonder she hates power points).",0
Stein is a great and fun professor. There are plenty of times that he made the whole class laugh. He teaches out of the book and from problems worked out in class. Homework is optional but recommended if you want to learn. Attendance is taken everyday and will affect your grade. Quizzes are almost guaranteed every Friday. ,1
Great professor overall. Taking him for more classes next semester.,1
"He's a fossilized piece of animal dung, worst notes ever, hardest tests ever, absolutely no respect for students.  Goes out of his way to make you feel like an idiot if you ask him a question or answer one of his.  Curses technology when he can't figure out that you need to plug the cart INTO THE WALL, NOT BACK INTO THE CART.  PLEASE RETIRE.",0
"Some people don't mind Dubovskiy's teaching style, but I wasn't a fan of it. He came to almost every lecture unprepared and when he taught, he improvised and flew by the seat of his pants. Although he's helpful when you ask questions, he was rarely in his office, didn't respond to any emails, and was all around, a very irresponsible professor. ",0
"He is extremely brilliant, but I personally think he does not know how to teach. you have to study a lot in order to receive a high grade. he is funny sometimes and jokes around, but most of the time he is boring, only because the material is too much to take in.",1
"Funny guy, very understandable...most class notes are from book...quizzes are HELLA easy...sometimes its jus asking if u were in class tha day....show up at least once in a while so he kno ur not dead =D",1
"Dave Barrett does not know how to teach this class. Every year he teaches it, he changes the format because it never works well. The homework assignments can take anywhere from 6 to 15 hours yet they are weighted the same! His explanations don't make any sense, but at least he is nice and grades very easily. The worst class in the MBA program.",0
 he didn't clarify much and he's a very hard grader I wouldn't take him ever again,0
"I don't know what it is about her, but she goes off on tangents that aren't necessarily about the topic at hand. Would be nice if she went through problems step by step and wrote on the board for once. She's a decent lecturer but if you're absent minded or have attention problems it'll be a chore.",1
"Great professor and always willing to go above and beyond his explanations. Never lets any questions go unanswered. The class is hard and requires a lot of studying, but the final happens to be in a different format from the quizzes and the class assignments. Do not pay attention to the study guide and the sample questions for the final exam.",1
She is a very understanding and approachable professor who teaches the material in class clearly and effectively. Shes willing to work with you to help you get the grades you need to pass if you're struggling. Gives small extra credit incentives.,1
This was one of my favorite teachers I've had at Brookhaven so far. You could tell he truly cared about each student and wanted them to pass. He even gave me good tips about my future that I took to heart. He encouraged me to continue my education past my associates. His class is hard but I would recommend it if you want to actually learn something,1
"Enseignement limpide et enrichissant. Un des meilleurs cours de science politique. Prof   très rigoureux sur le plan scientifique et méthodologique. Bravo, une perle ...",1
general physics 1 and 2. hard but he scales it so everyone does okay by the end. could be more clear - lectures can be boring. do the study guide problems before exams and try to remember concepts. final was insanely hard but he scaled it so it worked itself out.,0
"First of all, takes 2 months to put in grades. Second, does not highlight what he is grading on and makes you down 10-20 points. Third, if you disagree with his opinion you are marked down. Forth, final grades are currently due in less than 10 hours and I still have several blanks in grade book. He does not answer emails. AWFUL CLASS.",0
"Took this course online, I think it might have been easier to take in class. Decent marker, but is not really clear on expectations. Assigns 3, 8-paged papers, doesn't care what the content is only penalizes you if its not 8 pages. This course makes you think outside the box, prepare for many personal discussions with the rest of your classmates.",0
"Wonderful professor. Gives great lectures, daily quizzes based off of these lectures. Attendance is mandatory for your grade. Really enjoyed her class!",1
"Good teacher, enjoyed his class.",1
"Dr. Feagin grades incredibly hard for no reason. Like it's history class? Relax. She doesn't give a rubic for her ""activities"" or assignments, but takes pts off for my bibliography not being in abc order???? If I would have known, I would have put my sources in abc order. Nevertheless, do not take her class if you're looking for a easy hist class",0
"Nice lady, but DO NOT take the class. Even if its the only finance class left open don't take it. It's not worth it, half the class fails her tests and theres only 3 tests with no curve, only two homework's so theres no way to get your grade up. She also made sure to remind the class about the withdrawal date...",0
"Great professor. I enjoyed his sense of humor, which I know isnt for everyone. His assignments arent hard, just get working on them as soon as you can bc they can be long. He repeats info often throughout the course to help you remember stuff & makes light jokes out of mistakes. Overall an awesome professor & great class.",1
"I took speech with her over 10 years ago. I'm back to warn those of you who are nervous about speaking in front of others. I suggest you find another professor. She never offered any kind support, in fact, she actually created more anxiety causing situations. It almost seemed, to me, as though she enjoys watching people suffer.",0
"lopez is a really cool techaer he reads off his slide and you cannt take notes but yet you can get them off the internet  thier  is no homework throughout the semester only 3 exams and the last one is the final, he gives out study guides for every test which is very helpful we alos have a powerpoint to do in a group and give you time to work on it",1
"I took the Winterim and it was the best way to take this class. Julie was very helpful through out, and you can clearly see she has a ton of experience in engineering.",1
Awesome teacher!I didn't know anything about Business law going into this class. I have learned sooo much from him. Attending class is highly recommended!Print slides off before class and take notes as he lectures-helped me alot.dont buy the text book! you can print it off on the website you do the 1quizzes on for a cheaper price!test-werent to bad,1
"She comes off as mean at first, but then you learn her sense of humor. She is very clear in her teaching. Easy to understand. You have to have the courage to speak up and tell her when you don't understand something, then she will help you and won't make you feel bad for asking. The book is expensive and confusing but she is great. Tests are easy!",1
"Quite brilliant, but doesn't seem to prepare lecture beforehand (leads to some moments where he's staring at the board coming up with an example problem). Homework is sometimes off-topic. Tests are very fair, and over-prepares students during lecture. Overall enjoyed his class; also, if he offers stickers, they might become extra credit.",1
"She's very opinionated and you might as well not waste your time disagreeing with her. ONLY take her if you are taking very easy classes because you'll need to dedicate an awful lot of time for her reading assignments, and you can't get away with not doing them. I did learn a lot but it wasn't worth the stress and workload.",0
"Professor Brownlee really cares about his students. He was always very accommodating and willing to help. He was extremely knowledgable in his field, and exposed us to wide variety of sources. I feel like I am coming away knowing a lot more than I did when I entered his class. His tests are written, but he is very helpful in guiding you.",1
"Mr. Fultz is a great guy, and will try to help you any way he can. However, he can be confusing at times, and when you ask for help he confuses even more. He's very disorganized and can be everywhere. His class was super easy, though if you plan on going into A&P classes you may not learn much in his class.",0
"I took characteristics online. TOUGH. There's a lot due every week including a quiz. YOU HAVE TO READ THE TEXTBOOK TO PASS THE QUIZZES. The quiz questions aren't easy. I wouldn't say it's a super hard class, but it's not an easy A like a lot of Kent's online classes.",1
"Took immunology with him; hes a smart guy and really knows his stuff, but the material was hard to comprehend and he couldnt explain it in a way that would make sense. Tried to teach myself , but no luck. Im usually an A student, but ended up with a C+ (NO ONE GOT AN A THAT SEMESTER) without a curve. Hardest class Ive ever had. Avoid.",1
"Martha Steffens is best described as completely, totally, and utterly incompetent.  She doesn't care about her Econ 1051 Journalism class.  And she is completely computer illiterate.  The class is really easy, but she is a bore of a teacher.  Take it, don't go, and just read the power points online.  You'll be fine.",0
"Professor McKean challenges his students, and those those that embrace the challenges  quickly become stronger writers.",1
One of the Toughest professor at ccny.,0
"She's really nice and I can tell she likes teaching. I had her for Writing about Literature and  the first part of class covered Fairytales, the second part was on poems and the last will be the book ""Disgrace"" and the movie ""Fight Club""
 I recommend taking her, but don't take advantage of her because she can be pretty lenient.",1
"Dr. Haspel assigns journal assignments almost every class period, which are surprisingly fun and easy. He assigns 4 large papers a year, and no midterm. He is a great teach who is more than willing to help any student. He is also very funny and interesting to listen to.",1
Stein is undoubtedly a wizard and knows what he's talking about. He is super helpful if you actually put in the effort to ask for help one-on-one. Will make you seem like an idiot in front of class when you ask questions though. ALWAYS has office hours. Tests/quizzes a lot like old ones. Uses Course Reserves.,1
"TAKE HER!!! Easiest class Ive taken. Only 3 exams and 2 assignments throughout the whole semester. If you want a class/professor that wont add stress to your course load, this is the one!",1
"Really knows his stuff, but his assignments and tests are tough.",1
"If you have him for microelectronics, do not expect to learn anything from him. My advice is to find a better textbook, and follow an online class so you can learn the the material. When midterm comes, copy every useless and very confusing assignment questions that don't teach you anything on your cheat sheet.",0
"Laycock was my professor for Astronomy and Astrophysics. He tends to ramble and over explain the topics he finds most interesting while brushing over others. Seldom does he remind you of assigned homework. But overall, he is a good professor who will help you greatly if you make the effort to reach out to him.",1
I actually really liked this professor. PAY ATTENTION TO ONLINE HOMEWORK AND SLIDES FROM LECTURE WHEN STUDYING FOR TESTS!,1
Sweet person. She grades hard on papers so do them well in advance and/or look over them thoroughly. Some of the material is boring and some is really interesting. She is really invested in students doing well. Overall interesting class but a decent challenge.,1
Tests are the worst thing ever. They are poorly written and really hard to pass. He does curve your grade though. He does care about his students and is really passionate about ecology. He will occasionally do funny things like mock mating dances and songs of birds.,1
"He explains problems while writing on board, then u don't have time to figure out how he gets answer. Not good with patients for others, you may somewhat understand, then he totally throws u off before u leave class. U leave with confusion and head spinning! And tutoring lab teaches differently. He knows math but not one to teach it!",0
"Mrs. Wang explains her lecture material very clear. There is homework for every chapter as in every math class. However, her grading is tough. Your grade are your test scores, nothing else. She will take off full points for small details. You may think you have solid passing grade on a test and get a D or F in return.",1
"Johnston-Blair is a great person. She is helpful, funny, and accessible outside of class. She does LOTS of examples and thats how I learn so she was a great professor. Highly recommend, she breaks everything down so everyone understands.",1
"Dr. Vohs is great. He's a brilliant professor in my opinion. He's the best lecturer I've taken to date, he's clear and concise, he has good analogies to help students understand what he's teaching. He really dislikes swearing, so avoid swearing in front of him (I accidentally dropped a swear word and now he isn't particularly fond of me)",1
Amit has got to be my favorite professor thus far. He is incredibly caring and takes time to help each of his students. He goes above and beyond by offering extra homework or problems and even holding multiple review sessions. He truly cares that his students succeed. Explains difficult concepts very easily too.,1
"This was an online course. Fawcett was not quick to grade but was very respectful and grades easy. He guides but does not micro-manage class, just leaves you alone. I loved that he didn't require a lot of discussion board entries. He was understanding for extenuating circumstances.",1
"I took culture, nature, and society with Prof Li and it was pretty easy. Took notes every day and when tests came around he'd hand out a study guide. I'd read over my notes maybe once and make sure I was able to answer all the questions on the study guide and got an A- in the class. He's very respectful and enjoys when you participate.",1
"Tells interesting stories to make the class more engaging. She has a lot of experience in special education and loves what she does. Extremely knowledgeable about content. You do need a textbook. Cancels class a lot, which is great. Pick a good group of peers to sit with early on because group work is heavy. Groups are set once picked.",1
Good guy. Good Math Teacher. Class was not hard if you showed up and did the homework.,1
Not recomended if you can help it will not be a enjoyable class,0
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
This is my favorite class of the semester. I love the topics and reading he's selected for us. Tableau is touch at first but it's way better than exams. I'm loving this class.,1
"Good prof, very smart. Prolly one of the best i've had in uni",1
Waxler is a cool dude. This short story course is a must for anyone trying to get some lit credits. Interesting reading and neat discussions.,1
"Second half of BIO340 after Prof. Liebig. Mangone is incredibly energetic about the class and is very knowledgeable, but his slides are crazy detailed. Exams are very conceptual and not super difficult if you give yourself a few days to a week before the exam to understand content. I crammed the night before and did fine but don't recommend it.",1
Sandi genuinely cares about her students and respects hard work put into papers/class participation. We read many short stories and poems and we finished with a Shakespeare play and a novel. I enjoyed the class and would take it again,1
"If you are a logical person this class is super easy. It is similar to math in the sense that if you get it, you really won't have to study much and you will make an A. He teaches the material in class very well and provides optional videos for extra help. I actually really enjoyed this class. It can be extremely hard if you don't get it, though.",1
"People are very dramatic about her. She doesn't give you an easy A; you have to hustle for it if you want it bad enough; however, you will achieve it. She's very knowledgeable about the subject and shes very fair overall. This was not the easiest class, but very do-able. Good luck!",1
Quite possibly the worst professor I've taken at Rutgers. Took him last year for  Research Methods and thought that it was just the class that I didn't like. He ended up teaching this class last minute and has never posted a syllabus or graded assignments from two months ago. Makes jokes at the expense of any student with a different opinion.,0
"Don is the best prof I have had so far, and the reason I went into finance. Finance 3227 is a tough, tough class, people seem to blame Don for this. Most of the class is going through practice problems which is the best way to learn finance.",1
"Easily one of the nicest people you will ever meet. Even though waking up for a 7:30 was rough, his attitude towards teaching and Latin made it easier. We had vocab quizzes almost everyday which aren't that bad, and he cuts you slack if you don't do the translations.",1
"Professor Chooljian's course is not easy. You will have to study 2-3 hours a day in order to fully understand the main concepts and processes. Imo lab is much harder than lecture this semester, so study hard. She gives lots of EC opportunities. Go to SI sessions, office hours, and watch a lot of Khan Academy and Anatomy Zone videos. GOOD LUCK!",1
"Avoid this class as it's a lot of work. She is unforgiving of absences/missed work and personal needs. There are many papers to write, projects and debates. She says her online exams are hard and timed and most people fail them and yes, it is completely true. She favors girls/outspoken individuals. There are better classes out there.",1
"I have mixed feelings about him. Sometimes he will say a student's opinion is not correct and can easily point you out for having your phone out.. rude. Boring lectures, BUT he has nice guests come in and the movies he plays are inspirational. Tests are pretty hard but as long as you study key ideas you'll be ok. I didn't read i'm passing fine!",1
"Had Mrs Sumi a long while ago, but learned she continues to teach here after a friends daughter attended Northwood. Highly respected. She and Mr. Bennett were my favorite accounting instructors. Accounting IS ""fun!",1
"This class was a struggle for me. Be prepared for a lot of homework (20 hours a week) and lot's of quizzes. Professor Flahaven knows a lot about what's she's talking about but it can be hard to get help or her to share her knowledge. While I think she is a good person, I would never want to take a class from her again.",0
"Erin is one of the most amazing professors, more particularly she's intelligent, passionate, upfront and honest, entirely fair concerning grades and effort, and she will most likely convert you to the dark side (into a Biology Major). Grade received doesn't reflect Erin personally, it describes the unworthiness of us all to learn from her!!!!!!!!!!",1
Dr. Neupane really wants you to understand the material. Was available and willing to help before and after class. He does have an accent but is easy to understand. Hopefully I can take him for physics II!,1
I feel like I learned a lot in this class. It is a fairly tough subject because its solely computer program based. Dr. Smith is funny and approachable. He is willing to work with you.,1
Easy class study guides are the exams.,1
He wants to make sure you know the material. He sometimes let's you retake exams or assignments so you can learn the material and raise your grade. He is always offering his time and making sure everyone is progressing through the material smoothly.,1
"He is such a smart guy. He is very well-spoken. A lot of ppl in my class didn't like the class because his teaching style are power points and pictures, and he just talks. But i thought it was such an interesting class! You analyze advertising, logos, signs, architecture. Very interesting. I took him again fro Art and History. same teaching style.",1
"too many group projects for online, worth 40% of grade tough grading on group assignments Makes it seem like an easy A class but quite difficult slides don't prepare you for the tests read the textbook",0
"Proffesor Lovio is a pretty laid back teacher , class can get a little boring but its a good intro class and helps understand criminal justice his tests are open book and he has no hw also he only has 1 written assignment",1
Great professor. She is big in citing your work. Do the work and you will pass. I would take a class with her again. She's very forgiving and easy to get in touch with.,1
"Senora was FABULOUS. I had her for Spanish I and I really, really, REALLY wish I had her for Spanish II!! She is very energetic and helpful. She makes an overall very entertaining and educating class.",1
"Allows test corrections. Very easy class, does not make you do much of the stuff that he says on the syllabus.",1
Brutally hot. Lots of group projects. Exam's harder than expected. Attendance and participation mandatory.,1
The most boring class and very essay filled. She goes essay crazy. And too much reading,0
"Really great professor. He genuinely cares about your success, which really means a lot. If you put forth the effort  you will learn a lot from him.",1
"Advanced Nutrition is a tough class. Prof. Watford is interesting to listen to, provides lots of help (if needed) and is overall a very good teacher. No book is required for this course - only a $9 packet of notes that are VERY helpful for exams.",1
"Truly talented prof, willing to help. Just follow the syllabus, do work and don't miss too many class and you will be okay, get an easy A. I've missed so many class in the beginning, but he still gives me a chance to fix it. Nothing to complain about him, don't trust those people. Be in class, and you will get an A.",1
he makes his own jokes and has a blast laughing at them. Hes a cool guy thou... his vocab is ridic! Bring a dictionary to class..lol!,1
Reads off textbook entire class & takes too long to explain things and everyone in class is falling asleep. Everyone just does training on SAM since he opens it when class starts and he's wondering why nobody is paying attention to him.  Make sure you sit beside people who know what they're doing or you're either gonna fail or do really bad,0
"This was my favorite class this semester. Research and writing about new media and social media. Time in class is never too demanding, but I always felt like what he talked about was useful. And his comments on essays are really helpful. (also, I got a 95% on one of our essays, so I don't know what the comment below me is talking about!)",1
"Every-time I asked for help, she made me feel like the dumbest person alive. She is so smart that its hard for her to dumb things down. If you dont have a strong science background, youll probably fail.",0
She blew off the students questions and told us not to bother going to the tutor,0
"Professor Bledsoe is an amazing instructor. He is extremely knowledgeable about creative writing, which is the course I took. He gave numerous good tips for writing creatively and each lecture was unique and exciting. Definitely recommend this course, no matter what your major is.",1
Kendra's really enthusiastic!  Her love for literature shows in her teaching.,1
"It can be a very boring class at times but he is actually really interesting and funny. I never stressed or worried about anything with this class, way easy!",1
"A very hard class. there are a lot of memorization but he allows a cheat sheet.  Even though he was hard to understand, he was very dedicated to his students. He held a lot of office hours. I would recommend to study the material asking for help because he will get angry. He counts attendance by asking clickers questions.",1
"you need to really pay attention to him to hear him, and he can be a little grumpy sometimes.  But he can teach well, he grades easy, and if you can hear him, he has a sense of humor.  I recommend him.",1
Amazing! I learned a lot from his lectures. He provided all the materials needed to be successful in the class as well as giving input to keep everyone on the right track.,1
"Stay away from McConnell. His classes are dry, his voice monotone, and his readings tedious. There is not too much work and he is an easy grader, however it's still not worth it. He's v vague in his assignment descriptions and seems to grade many papers without reading them. Even films did not make this class any more enjoyable.",0
he was really cool and made class fun,1
"I'm in between when it comes to Professor Guerra. He is funny, insightful, and kind. He has an arrogance about him, but what 30 year old man doesn't. His tests are difficult and you cannot find the answers in the textbook or from his powerpoint slides, so you have to write down EVERYTHING he says during lectures.",1
"Lotssssss of reading, but Quizzes and assignments aren't too difficult",0
I've been terrible in math my whole life it just never made any sense to me. I also am taking mat 001 for the 3rd time. But after having her I did amazing in math! She's the the best teacher I ever had!!! She really breaks down math problems for the students who need it and she comes up with different ways to teach you a problem if one way doesn't work. I'm taking her again next semester for mat 007 I recommend her to anyone who struggles in math!!,1
"Ms. Pena is a great professor. She's a little on the young side but she connects well with her students. She gives you the option to buy either the online or physical book. You have one group presentation but it's fun because you get to choose your subject. Make sure to play close attention to everything, especially the pop quizzes. Final was easy.",1
"Shes very nice if you ask for help, and very understanding. However, i took this class as an elective and it felt like a major requirement. Overall, i passed the class and learned a lot!",1
"Out of ALL my professors EVER, Dr. Anitori was the best I've ever had. He's incredibly knowledgeable in the field, and though there are pop quizzes they are only on the material from the previous lecture, super easy. Loves when you ask Q's, and whenever I see him on campus he asks me how things are. He'll give letters of rec, most fun class ever.",1
Greenberg is a professor where you can tell that he'd rather just do his own research than teach. He was a pretty confusing lecturer and it was also difficult to read his handwriting on the chalkboard. He also didn't answer emails. The textbook is your best friend.,0
"She said some inspiring words to me after class one day and it's the reason I am getting my masters 7 years later.  I admire her passion for what she teaches but she expects that same passion from her students. If you don't have it don't expect to slide by. Her classes are by no means ""easy"" but, I personally, learned about life from her.",1
"Avoid if possible. Homework is long, boring, and miserable, if you can even figure out what your homework  is. Lectures are repetitive but not horrible. Essays and tests are difficult and tedious. You will read and read and read, and when you are done reading, you get to read even more.",0
"she is such an angel. trust me you'll do good in her class, she really wants the best for everyone. shes super approachable and i wish i could give her a thank you hug",1
very interesting class and material. weekly quizzes to make sure you read. no attendance policy but she makes sure your grade gets docked when you arent there by having assignments due when there arent quizzes. she is probably my favorite psych professor ,1
"He kept lectures fun and enjoyable, and his jokes were funny because they were intentionally bad. He has a dry, sometimes sick sense of humor, and he is very passionate and excited about what he teaches, which really helped me learn as well. He loves seeing students interested in the material, and loves handing out extra credit if you show effort.",1
"She has made so may people i know cry and try to ruin their careers because she has a horrible habit of choosing who she likes and hates. She hates most girls. She has always been great to me, but when she treats my peers so poorly its hard to think she's genuine.",0
Honestly a good guy that you can talk to. Unfortunately his lectures are extremely hard to follow and are super theoretical. A lot of over complication on simple topics. Self-studying is required to pass. Don't take unless you are super into theoretical math or confident about self-studying a lot.,0
"Super nice guy. He's pretty funny also. He's an easy grader. No tests, not graded on participation, only three essays.",1
"The worst teacher I have ever had.  She was very difficult, wouldnt accept homework through email even though the system was down, very rude and would not let you explain anything to her.  Do not take this teacher online, you will be stressed!",1
"I took a lecture-heavy course, so there wasn't much room for different activities or any type of variety, but that's not his fault. He's a solid professor who is generous with partial credit and knows how to teach stats. You can't go wrong with him.",1
"Michael is very fair and easy going. I went to her many times after class for help and advice, and she was always so positive and easy to talk to. As long as you do your homework and show some effort and understanding, you'll get an A. I've heard some classmates complain about her, but those complaints come from the students who never put in effort",1

Dr. Currier was an excellent teacher! I would really recommend her for this class. She wants you to succeed and she makes the class more interesting and manageable.,1
Professor Tyson is awesome!  I learned so much and he is easy on the eyes too!,1
"BEST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE! IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, JUST PAY ATTENTION, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS MATERIAL!",1
His teaching is just terrible. I pay good money for this class just to sit in here and be confused for 2 hours. His accent inhibits him from giving understandable lectures and he gets an attitude when you ask him to repeat himself. DO NOT TAKE HIM. EVER!!!!!,0
The professor is definitely educated when it comes to philosophy but tried way too hard to make the class difficult. I took him for summer b term this year. There is a timed reading quiz for every single reading assigned. He assigns multiple readings every week. About 8-11 assignments due every week. All quizzes and exams have original questions.,0
"Dr. Snaza is very engaging and laid-back. In his vampires class, he assigns books but pretty much feeds everything you could possibly need to know to do well. VERY few grades: two 5-page essays + a group talk; NO participation grade. Every class was so much fun, and it never seemed unreasonable. Honestly can't recommend him enough! He's awesome!",1
"John Fischer is a very well-spoken professor who teaches very difficult topics, my only complaint is that his tone is very monotone and his tests are long and somewhat difficult so be prepared to come to class, pay attention, and participate.",1
"All I have to say is good luck! This professor is a very tough grader and gives tons upon tons of homework. There were always various assignments due at one time, whether it be a lab, worksheets, or online homework. I took 20 units last semester and never had as much homework in all of my classes combined than I did for this single class.",0
If you could avoid this class I would,1
75% of the semester was her having us get in groups and Google the answers to topics ourselves. She doesn't use PowerPoint and talks way to fast and quietly. Hard to follow her and shows up late a lot but takes attendance.,0
She puts handouts on learn@uw before each lecture that are very helpful. Her tests are also not too bad if you study a little!,1
"Prof. Lohrey was knowledgeable on the topic of accounting, but did not make it as easy when he taught. He would point out questions that would be on exams, and tell us the HW was not required to do. I still did the HW because those same questions would be on the exams. Utilize the textbook cuz he can be confusing at times. And no phones in class!",1
"Worst experience of my life!!!!!. He is not clear at all, the things he says are not on the test are not on the test, and he sometimes won't even give you what to study. He talks about his students behind there backs and just does not care about his students passing. He is one of the worst instructors I have had and I am an A student.",0
"Attend all lectures. He tells you whats on the test, just go to class. You do 3 readings. Do them as they help your grade. Class was not hard. I got a 96 just bc I was doing my work. As in doing the readings. He gives out in class assignments as well so go to class. Sometimes, if hes nice he gives bonus points. So go to class and study for exams.",1
"Great professor! He is super passionate about his class and loves when you go up to him to ask him a question. Loves our football team as well. If you can, TAKE HIM. Easy A, I'm telling you. We only ""read"" 2 books, write 4 easy papers, have a take home midterm, and the final is super easy. He made me like Texas history a little more.",1
Vague explanation of how he grades the journal which is a major part of your grade. The class seemed more for students to fail than succeed.  Would not recommend taking this class unless you have to.,0
"Easy A, he had three assignments and had attendance and participation as extra points. He was very inspirational, we took very light notes. The assignments were long but really easy. I hate writing and I still managed to type a 12 page paper. Trust me you'll like it. For attendance he passes out a sign in sheet",1
"Great guy, conveyed a lot of passion about the subject, and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom, and the class is well structured, even though there was some confusion about the textbooks/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams, removing confusing questions post-exam.",1
Do not understand his bad reviews. Online class is easy with discussion posts and midterm was easy as long as you studied. It is content heavy so be prepared but he does not deserve the bad rep. Study and keep up with content and you'll do great,1
"Dr. Liu is the best. She really helps you out. You get to build your own website which are 3 assignment worth 10%, 15% & 15%. She posts videos that guides how to build it & its super easy. Midterm & final are both worth 30% each. Didnt study for the midterm bombed it. Studied for the final & I aced it so STUDY! She also provides us the textbook.",1
"I took Dr. Buchanan for Senior Assessment because of how great he has been in my previous classes. He cares so much about his students and his lectures are very clear. Him and his wife are the some of the best professors in the psychology department hands down! Take him for anything and everything if you want to learn, have fun, and do well.",1
I have been using rate my professor since my freshman and never made a rating. Until now because Professor DBH is amazing. She will go the extra mile to ensure you get the best grade possible. It is a writing-intensive class so papers have to be done. Easy A!,1
Tremendously nice man.  Class environment fair and engaging.,1
"Her scores are low but look at what class there for 11100. That's a hard section of math, in general, to pass b/c they're trying to cram a lot of info and homework in. Math 15300 is so much better. She is amazing. When she sees your trying but have a low-grade she'll work 1 on 1. She'll give encouragement and tips. Powerpoints are on point.",1
"This teacher, though sweet and caring, set up her online class in modules. A LOT of reading, I did not like the class one bit. I prefer professors video themselves teaching instead of making students read and understand the material by themselves. There are lots of small quizzes. I wouldn't take her online class if you're not a reader.",1
"Extremely helpful, nice, and interesting. Made an otherwise dull class exciting.",1
Dr. Schuster is a very professional & old school type of teacher. He also has a very fun and interactive personality. His teaching styles are very straight forward and he gets down to business when it's class time. Attendance is a must and he is very particular about it. Go into office and look over papers for his class though. Strong paper grader,1
"Terry is an intelligent inspiring professor who is passionate about her subject matter. You will rarely get an ""I don't know"" from her, although the occasional ""I'll have to get back to you"" occurs; but she actually does get back to you. She cares very much about her students' learning and success, but she's no softy. She has high expectations.",1
Love this guy!,1
He is a great professor and I can't wait to have him as my professor again.,1
Glen is great. he is hilarious and always has interesting stories to tell. No matter what state you're work is in he'll always find something to adjust or change to make it better. Manages to make the most boring topics entertaining.,1
"Professor Humber isn't very good, though he does try. His tests are difficult, but he grades very easy, though sometimes it's frustrating how arbitrary his qualifications are. Take him if you want a decent grade without too much work (at least, in comparison to other sections), but if you really want a good Calc II professor, try someone else.",0
"This Professor loves her students, she will make sure you get the most out of her class even if it means answering all your questions until you understand. The only thing with her is that YOU will have to let her know what your problems and I know she will explain it. AWESOME PROFESSSOR!!!!!",1
Gerard expects participation in class and in online discussions. If you read the additional material you'll be a star in his class.,1
"I really liked Mr. Hoover as a teacher.  Accounting is a tough class, but he teaches the material very well.  Do not be afraid to ask questions if you need help.  This class requires some studying but if you do the homework and study, you will be fine in this class.",1
"Mangone is a really good Professor, he took over from Liebig in spring 2018. HIs lectures require you to memorize a lot making it a little hard course of the course load. u would take his class again.",1
I like this Prof. I take online classes and she is the prof i choose for most classes. Assignments aren't graded fast but she's a fair grader.,1
"great guy, very helpful, very understanding, comes to the bar crawl with the students at the end of the semester",1
"two homework assignments each week, one was due on wed, the other due on sat. prof bertens has good instructional videos posted each week and each video is for each hw assignment. discussion post is rlly helpful bc you can post which problem you are struggling on and either prof bertens or a classmate will explain the process and give u the answer",1
"Dr. Bradshaw is the best professor I've had in college.  Entertaining, funny, and knows his stuff.  Awesome!!!",1
"I loved her teaching style. Very informed and actually interested in what you have to say. Easy to talk to, and willing to work with you for you to succeed. Would highly recommend her to anyone. Great proff that cares about her students.",1
"I'm not the biggest fan of writing short stories, but Prof. Smith definitely pushed me to become a better writer of all genres--and to become better at giving criticism. The writing workshop format is perfectly suited to the course contents, with a strong emphasis on revision. It was fun to read my classmates' stories and to give them feedback.",1
"I love this guy. He goes slow with lectures so no one gets left behind. He gives out homework but it is not graded, if you want to understand I recommend you do them. There are only 2 tests, midterm and final. He is easy going and is extremely fair. He goes off topic sometimes but I find his stories hilarious. Would take a class with him again",1
Professor Nelson is a really interesting guy. His lectures are great - very engaging and easy to follow. It's obvious he has a true passion for what he's doing as well as an excellent understanding of it. I would really recommend his Arts&Cultures of the Slave South class with Professor McInnis. The two really teach well together!,1
I LOVE PROFESSOR CARINA!!! she's soo awesome she lets you be yourself all the time even in your essays. She only gives short assignments every week and gives some reading that ARE NOT BORING! and she gave a short report by the end of the semester and THAT' IT! participate and be yourself and do small work and that's it. She's really funny + awesome,1
"BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! He is funny and completely had me changing my major by the end of the class. He is the deal. He isnt easy, but his class is not impossible. He genuinely cares about his students understanding.",1
nnnn........,1
Overall she is pretty awesome. The class is easy and not boring because you learn out of the book not a boring PowerPoint and she makes everything interactive with the class so you learn how to speak aloud usually with a partner.,1
bad,0
Her instructions are as clear as mud but the flip side is that she doesn't actually expect much from you in terms of getting work in on time.  She's also a really sweet person and very smart.,1
No Comments,1
if you think your gonna go in this class and take exams on Jazz History your not.  All 5 of your exams will be on distinguishing what type of jazz you are listening to. not easy because in class ALL he talks about is the history which is not on exam. So u teach yourself from vids on blackboard! If your not a music major avoid! Extra cred impossible,0
Shes nice but shes just a bad teacher. I didnt learn from her lectures. I mostly muted her and did my hw during class. P.S. Almost all quiz/test questions are on Quizlet,0
He is almost impossible to reach via email which is annoying considering the class is online. He will respond to one email which may take a few days to get a response. His class was so easy one homework a week and 3 tests for the entire semester. His only tests are easy and so is the homework. I recommend taking because of how simple the class was.,0
"I loved him so much, I took 2 classes with him. His jokes are corny but my kind of humor. If you're stuck, he'll get you thru. As long as you make an effort and he sees that, you're fine. Can't not make an effort and expect an A",1
She's a great teacher! She uses power points for her lectures to supplement the chapters you read in the book (there is some overlap but mostly varies). I took her in Holt 170 so there were clicker/participation questions every class. Weekly online quizzes were easy. The tests were a little more difficult just take good notes and read.,1
"One of the hardest, but most interesting classes I have ever taken. Learned more in this semester course than I have during my past 2 years at KU. She really makes you work for it, but she is one of the best professors I have ever had. As long as you pay attention and actually try you will do fine.",1
"One of the nicest professors ever!!! I love his teaching styles and his concerns for his students. He will do anything beyond his powers to help his students. Never seen a professors that cares for his students like him. Also, very professional and fair!",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed aspects of this class. The readings were interesting for the most part, the in class fre writes were stimulating and the discussions were interesting. However, I felt her grading was unclear and her comments on my writing did not help unless I met with her at office hours. When I did, she helped a lot. Pretty decent overall.",1
"The teacher is really great, probably one of my favorites so far at Tech. She'll work with you on anything you're struggling with and if you want an A you'll most likely get one.",1
"If you want to be a real mathematician, or, you are a maschoist who wants to test if you are an idiot or not, take his class when possible! Prof. Rezk is extremely likely to be the smartest person you will ever meet, and he has tons of examples ready for you, regardless of how weird the question is. By far the most challenging and rewarding class.",1
"Gina wants everybody to do well in her class and goes above and beyond to make that happen. There are no tests in this class which is awesome. She has a great relationship with all of her students. By far the best teacher I have had at Chico so far. Show up to class, try your best and you will get a good grade.",1
"Inconsistent & unreliable-says one thing & does another. LAZY-doesn't answer emails unless threatened, didn't update the syllabus from last semester so we had no test dates & no schedule all semester-we never knew when the test was, as of wk 12 still no graded labs or papers. Group projects so he doesn't have to grade more papers. Disappointing.",0
"I had absolutely no rhythm when I started the class, but by the end I was dancing fairly good and had great movement. Would recommend taking this class for an easy A. Just show up and dance, it's not that hard.",1
Mrs. Elizondo seems kind of tough at times but she is only preparing you for what comes next. She is an overall AMAZING Wonderful instructor and I can not wait to have her again for MIcro !  ,1
"I have taken two of his classes now and I just signed up for a third, I think that says enough right there. He is a great math teacher who is extremely helpful and understanding. The workload is pretty decent but I put the difficulty as a 3 because there's videos to help with almost every question and he will respond promptly to emails.",1
"during my course the professor required quizzes on a weekly basis which is an accelerated rythm, it prevented me from fully assimilating the chapters and since i had classes twice a week, I couldn't accumulate good grade due to almost 8 quizzes one midterm and one exam . we all know the law of large numbers however we don't need extra pressure.",0
"Greatest professor of all time! I don't like government but Prof. Tapia makes it really interesting. I learned a lot in his class. He's really funny, and good looking. The class had easy online quizzes, and a discussion assignment on the budget. This was my favorite class at MDC!",1
"I LOVE Dr. King! I'm taking his cancer biology class reserved for nonmajors only, and I've always been awful at science, but he really makes it accessible, surprisingly unstressful, and enjoyable. You can tell he truly cares about his students. He even brought us breakfast for our first quiz! Such a great guy.",1
a very gifted teacher...but talks too much. it seems like she has to cover every little thing in the book and still add more stuff.her three hour lecture classes are just too much. doesnt give too much time for lab(20 min tops/wk im serious) i also think she gives you very tricky quiestis for the exam.im def. not taking her for a&p2.,0
Take ACTG1040 and 1050 online...they are both really easy.  She gives so much extra credit it is hard not to get an A.,1
"Very disappointed. Ridiculous amount of work for the level of content covered. Labs worth 1% of total bio grade but could be 8-10 hours of work each week when done right. The 4 tests were cruelly short (45min) with short response that required more than could be done in the timeframe, 60% averages. Even if you are a good student, avoid this lab.",0
"Don't take her class if you can't teach yourself. She usually has you watch voice-over PowerPoints at home and then holds class for about 30 min. She doesn't give detailed feedback on tests or assignments. If you need help you will be diverted to the HAC. If you don't already know chemistry and are taking this class to actually learn it, good luck.",0
This class shouldn't be rated as a 1000 level course. I've taken upper level classes that were way easier. That being said he is a great teacher. He takes a moment to adjust to and figure out what he wants - then you will have to put in work for your grade outside of class. In class discussion are great -but they are heavily guided by him.,1
Jeff explains things well. Study for the test and you should do well. The tests are challenging.,1
"Professor Lockhart tells you exactly how he wants things done, and exactly how to do it. If you follow his instructions you can easily make an A in his class. There is homework weekly and you will need to study for the tests but he gives you a study guide and tells you everything you will need to know. I want him to be my professor in every subject",1
Great teacher would definitely take again. Hard grader and sometimes confusing in class but if you go to her office hours she will help you and tell you exactly what she expects.,1
"This was a great class, and I would recommend it to everyone. I learned so much from her and wish I could take the class again.",1
"new to teaching and it ,changes his mind on what needs to be done in assignment hard to know what he wants",0
I love this teacher. That bieng said - she is very hard. Her class is not for the weak or those who do not want to do any work. That bieng said...Im praying that i pass her class. If i don't I know that - it will be because I didn't man up and rise to the challenge.,1
"I really enjoyed this class. A bit repetitive at times, but she's incredibly nice and very helpful. She is willing to help you with anything she can, even issues outside of class. I later did an independent study with her and it was great. Take her class.",1
"I thought he was a good professor! He was very interested in the topic he was teaching & I actually learned a lot in his section of the course. Because he is foreign he can be hard to understand at times.  I took Judiaism, Christianity, & Islam with him in which he teaches the Islam portion.",1
"His class isn't THAT easy,but if you do the work, you will do fine He's huge on meeting deadlines so just do work on time (there will be alot of it too), and you will be fine. He can come off as overly confident, but ask questions and get clarification. He will answer. He asks for a whole lot, but it becomes easier as you get used to it.",1
"Guerra could not have made this an easier class. I didn't even use a textbook, just his lecture and powerpoint. Grading is 1/3 attendance survey, 1/3 quizzes, 1/3 final paper. No tests ever. He is very passionate about law. Class fully based on Facebook movie ""The social network"".",1
"I have taken a few of his classes, including an online class.  I enjoyed them all.   He is a great instructor who is clearly very educated on the subjects he teaches.",1
"I learned the majority of the content for this course by going to the math tutoring lab or by using the ""help me solve this"" button on the online homework. Mrs. Ryburn is very willing to help you one-on-one, but does not do well with lectures. The class talks over her and does not pay attention. Class is almost pointless because it is all online.",1
"Really makes you think and work for an A, but an absolutely fantastic teacher who clearly describes the content and offers up help at the drop of the hat. You get out what you put in, definitely.",1
"best teacher ever. she goes out of her way to help students. not only with the work for her class, but also with personal issues or whatever a students needs. shes gives helpful advice and can even help u get free money for textbooks. :-) she is the person you want to know if u ever find yourself in a difficult situation.",1
She is the most inspirational woman I have ever met. The best part of the course is office hours and I'd highly recommend attending each week. She is so full of knowledge and insight. I learned so much from her within and outside the curriculum. I have never had such an approachable and caring professor. ,1
"Definitely knows his stuff. Thinks hes funnier than he is. DONT think this is a blowoff class- ATTENDENCE and complete notes are a must. Types his notes on overhead for class (take notes on a laptop to keep up) STUDY NOTES FOR EXAMS. KNOW your definitions and be able to apply them. Hard exams, but hes probably the best professor for this class.",1
Amazing professor !,1
She loves math. She will get you to like math. She always writes the important information and equations right before class starts.,1
"EASY A, but he did pick on me alot through out the semester. He seems unhappy in his marriage and belittles you when your proud of your happy marriage. Like I said, EASY A, and gives extra credit as well as extra redit for attendence. Also, no need for book..",1
"This class is very interesting, its alot of work and the test are hard. Make sure you READ YOUR BOOK! this is what get you through the class.",1
"Had her as a chem recitation professor at Rutgers, & she was OK; But our professor had an emergency and couldnt lecture the class one day, so she did it. She teaches the lecture using powerpoint slides and goes so fast. Its rly hard to follow along with her! Shes kind of rude too. She makes thing unnecessarily hard and I really hated how she taught",0
"She is rude when you asks questions, but I am not sure she realizes it. Does not review for exams, and there is no SI for Bio 2.  She does not make lecture very interesting and her Power Points are awful. ",0
"She is a awesome professor! Only have to write one big paper, but you write it through the whole semester. Test and pretty easy and straight forward, and if you attend the study session before the exam she will give you everything to study for. She is easy to get a hold of and has lots of office hours.",1
"She is a great math teacher. I don't understand people saying her test are hard...they are NOT. People who fail the test are the same who don't come class, and don't do the HW. I do the homework and it's easy to get an A. She is very nice and wants to help you of you let her. Go to her office for help.",1
"One of the best professors I took at MVCC. If you have the opportunity to take him, do it. You actually learn concepts and take away a thing or two from his class. Amazing teacher, nuff said.",1
"My favorite professor. Took her for ACC 311 and was genuinely expecting to hate accounting but DJB made it awesome. Teaches clearly and effectively, is hilarious in lecture, and will do everything she can to help you understand material. I would do my homework outside her office just so I could pop in and ask questions if I had any. Truly the best",1
Proffessor Williams is a good person but a BAD examiner. The class is hard The exams are open book open notes but hey .. the notes should be hand written only and the book must be physical one NO EBOOKS. his exams are hard with a 50 minutes time window .. you've better hurry!!,0

"Dr. Childs does not know logic, therefore she should not be teaching logic.",0
"Dr. Grange is a fantastic teacher and has been called ""the best of the best"" when it comes to what he does.  The class is, by nature, extremely difficult.  He is very clear about that from the beginning, and does all in his power to help you succeed.  Try to take the class when you can guarantee serious study time and avoid the 7-week version.",1
"Very clear on what will be on the exams. Lots of homework online. Do it in advanced. If you don't understand biological sciences, this class can be tough. Gives out lots of extra credit. Do well in this class so you if you do bad in the lab you shouldn't have a bad overall grade. Lab grade is combined with lecture grade at the end of the semester",1
"We do 2-3 sections, online and handwritten homework for those 2-3 sections, online forum posts, & have a test/ ""quiz""(1hr long, 2 pages) in class weekly. We meet for 1 class a week in which she answers 5-6 homework questions before we have the quiz/test. Have to study all material on your own, theres no lecture at all. Wouldn't recommend this class",0
"I had Sanda for GD1. She shaped how I work in the program, cares deeply about her students, and wants everyone to succeed. She is strict, structured, and caring. If you come prepared & ready you will be rewarded with one of the best instructors in the program. Also if you go to office hours she will inspire you and blow your mind with knowledge",1
"As a Human Resources major I was very disappointed. Her lectures are rushed and vague, her online tests have nothing to do with the slides she presents, and the criteria for the group project is illogical. It's not a difficult class, but she doesn't know what she's talking about. Needless to say, I expected more from a PhD in Human Resources.",0
"fels does not know what she is teaching, our class average for midterm exam was 45% while other classes had 60%. for the final, she put a short answer while no other class had it, she also made us watch 2-3 hours of youtube videos and study all case studies and noother class had to. she also counts 5% of participation mark for tweeting",0
"A very nice professor. Plus, he would make a very good artist (his diagrams were always well rendered). I took his class years ago and enjoyed his teaching and personality very much.",1
"Overrall great teacher! He wants you to learn so you do have to put some effort but there is no reason you should not pass this class. He is really helpful, gives extra credit and will do whatever he can to make sure you pass",1
"Mrs. Noland is the best teacher I've ever had at CPCC and I've grown in so many ways and have learned so much from her class. She's so hilarious (like really hilarious) and I looked forward to going to class. Her homework load is light and as long as you do all the requirements (speeches, oulines, etc.), you'll do great in the class.110% Recommend!",1
"I had Dr. Strange for Conservation, a class he created.  Incredible!!  This was one of the best classes I have taken at UT.  Dr. Strange is funny, passionate, engaging and a downright blast.  I learned so much in this class.  Don't miss this one!!",1
"Great professor! Very interesting; obvious that he really cared about the subject (novels from the modern period) and the students. Gave a variety of assignments which really helped to learn the material in different ways, leading to deeper learning. Very fair grader, and always willing to help if you need it. Gave extensive and helpful feedback!",1
"very smart, gives good notes, class is so boring though only downside",1
"Tons of reading and about two hours worth of lectures to watch before class. Overall hes a good professor and pretty easy if you can manage all his readings. He will ask questions about them and his midterm/final are a combination of the reading and lectures. If you pay attention, youll do well.",1
"Awesome instructor with bad accounting jokes, but they help make the material memorable. You have to do the homework because the class lectures cover the assignments and tie them into the concepts covered in the chapters. Professor Hurley tries to pace the course progress off how well the class is learning the material. Highly recommend.",1
"Carson grades HEAVY on papers. Anything and everything on a paper. Good teacher just kind of bland and worries about how your papers are written. I would take again. Tries to be funny during his lectures just awk. However, if you want an easy A then he's the way to go.",1
"I loved McNiel, she made going to school very pleasant, I loved her class. She's super nice, funny and an educated woman. She is super understanding over people's fear of public speaking and helps you get through it, shes the professor you want for your speech elective credit",1
Mangone is obviously very passionate about what he teaches and really tries to make the information digestible. He puts all the information you need for exams on his PowerPoint slides and his tests tend to be easier than Liebig's to help your grade. His lectures are a little rushed but if you review the material you will likely be successful.,1
"i love this lady....  she is so sweet, understanding, and always willing to help you. Her discussion are very interesting. she has a good heart and only wants her students to succeed.",1
"Baughman is awesome. I've had three classes with him and I learned a lot in each of them...PLUS he's really funny and will always take some time to show his classes his newest favorite youtube video. Definitely a professor to take a class with at Bates, especially if you're interested in politics.",1
"Nice person, but not a good teacher. She is way scatter-brained but means well.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Very confusing and all over the place kind of teaching. His teaching is to give you 2 different textbooks and watch you tube video lectures-which he states not to pay too much attention to! Tests-essays on 450 pages of info but no specifics The ""reviews"" for the quiz/test are paragraphs and can't relate to the texts.",0
"Amazing professor! She's clear and nothing is ever confusing. She's energetic and you will never get bored with her. She's extremely helpful and will kindly assist you with any kind of questions. She's a joy to learn from, however, don't expect an easy A. It's a tough course and you really need to study and do the homework.",1
sometimes she doesnt regulate class discussions well which can be frustrating.,1
"I absolutely LOVED his class! He's super funny, and seems like a genuine guy. Really gets into the lesson and clearly knows his stuff. There's a lot of reading, but the two tests are not hard as long as you actually read. While he counts a lot on participation, he makes sure that even the quiet kids have a chance to speak.",1
"most unorganized teacher i have ever dealt with. Barely goes over topics, will talk more about things that do not pertain to the class than teach.",1
"One of the most unorganized professor I have ever experienced. Unclear answers when students ask questions. Assign homework, quizzes, and exams on materials we have not touched yet. Do not take this guy.",0
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
i really enjoyed this class i took it this past semester in summer 1 i enjoyed this class and he was very caring and friendly i always sat inthe back next to joe and azata he gives the best stories,1
"He's a great teacher and you have two projects but you only present them to his TA, the only problem for me was I just wasn't interested in the material. The lectures are on blackboard but he has you do little like 2-3 sentence things every class just to make sure you're there.",1
Dr. Anderson is a great professor. He always emphasizes on working FOR the student. He makes learning Latin very easy to understand and is attentive to any problems you may have. It is obvious that he has a passion for what he does and makes the classroom (even online) a fun and safe environment. Highly recommend!,1
"Make sure to study the notes. If you understand the theory you will do well. He is very helpful and welcoming, but you need to be familiar with what you are wanting help with or he will talk over your head.",1
"I would never recommend anyone to take her class who is doing a gen ed or if you have any traditional views. She gives out many writing assigments, and also grades very unfairly on your own analyzations of the theories learned. She is a very young professor and a joke. Uconn really needs to get rid of her. I should've looked here before taking.",0
"Lisa is amazing!  To anyone taking the field seriously and capable of the workload, you will find the assignments extremely useful.  They are relevant and challenging, but absolutely worth it!  My favorite professor at BSU.  She still keeps in touch and is a true advocate for BSU students and students with disabilities.  Thank you Lisa!",1
"I really liked his portion of the class because he was very easy to listen to because he was just so lively and passionate about genetics, RNA in particular. I also really liked his slides because he underlined the key points which made it very easy to study off of for the exams. He is a great professor all around. Highly recommend!",1
"Lectures are detailed and clear with zero assumptions of prior knowledge of coding. Issues are resolved quickly and fairly. Restrictions on coding methods are extremely rare so if you do have experience coding with the language taught you won't be penalized for using techniques not taught in class. Overall, this is a well-taught course.",1
"Worst class and worst professor I've ever experienced. Incoherent, arrogant, insecure, condescending. There's nothing I learned in this class that I couldn't have picked up from reading the books by themselves. In short: a waste of time. Buyer beware.",0
He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats,0
"Professor Pittman, is really nice, but  she makes you work for a good grade. She does have a quiz everyday , but if you study really hard and read the material ahead you will pass. Her test are just the quizzes and essays.  Chapter quiz every Monday, essay Wed, and map Friday. Take if you are hard worker.",1
Professor McLendon was a excellent professor.  She explained what was expected clearly in her syllabus.  She graded papers in a respectable amount of time.  I would definitely take another course from Professor McLendon.,1
He's a really chill professor who wants to see everyone do well. Definitely make sure you go to class and try to participate!,1
"His grading criteria feels random. A paper a week (yes, theyre short, but theyre so frequent!). If your paper is perfect hell nitpick it and find problems anyway. I spent more time on homework in this class than for my 4k level classes. Even though it wasnt hard it was tedious.",0
He is a great professor! A lot of homework so prepare to work your butt off. Quiz every week but its a group quiz and its fairly easy. He grades pretty tough and is very helpful and always try to help you get obtain an A. Tests are long and hard but study the review sheet as they should be some what indentical. Great professor!,1
He is the best professor. He give one midterm exam and one final and both of them are home take. in the midterm you can do as many times you can and raise your grade. He usually look at the effort that students put in his midterm. He is simply awesome and care for his students.,1
"Professor Ratner has dry lectures if you are taking the hour long 3 x a week class. His presentation notes are helpful and necessary for tests. He is strict with cell phone use and computers are not allowed. He insists every student is on time, attends every class, and pays attention. His sarcasm is dry and somewhat insulting, be aware. He is ok.",1
"Very very nice man, but terrible professor. He does not know how to teach physics at all. Tries to be helpful, but is terrible at explaining things. Lecture heavy! Not much practice with equations, but thats what the exams are on.",0
His quirky persona makes the class very enjoyable. From day 1 he gave me a new lens to look at society through which i used in the course material as well as outside the course. Gives clear feedback and assisted me in my growth as a writer. A few papers (as usual in an English course) and a few free writes. Very approachable person and great class.,1
"Dr. Landrum is an amazing professor and he's really passionate about what he's teaching which kind of rubs off on the class. He's funny, makes stuff relatable, and super nice to his students. Don't take this if you don't like reading, though. He expects you to do your reading and you get quizzed on it. Tough, but you definitely learn a lot.",1
Professor Jefferies was amazing. I learned so much from taking his course and it helped set the stone for my programming foundation. I wish I would've taken his course prior to taking the JavaScript course as I feel this course are based upon the essentials when learning any new programming language,1
"She makes it as simple and clear as possible. Organic chemistry can be difficult for some people, but she will help you. She will encourage you to go to her ""office hours"" with questions. If you take her class, study hard, no other way around it. Study her power points well. Great teacher overall, I'll have her for Organic II next semester.",1
Mark Johnson is an AWESOME professor. He is helpful and honest with his feedback. He believes in his students. I also had accomaditons through the school and he went above and beyond to respect and help me throughout the ENTIER semester. You do have to read a ton. He is great and I highly recommend him to anyone! ,1
"Professor Meshelemiah is passionate about the study and practice of Social Work. She makes an effort to learn everyone's names and ensure that the class is involved and discussion heavy. The textbook is absolutely required and she assigns minimal homework. Great class, and I highly recommend the class and professor.",1
She is a very picky one and you definately know you earn your grade. She a nice ladie too.,1
"I've taken Physics and Intro to Solar System Astronomy with her. She's very interesting, and gives lots of great examples. Class is extremely interactive and she is incredibly quirky. Honest grader. Her English isn't perfect, but it doesn't take much to understand what she says. Encourages students to correct her grammatical errors. Very chill.",1
"I have taken this professor multiple times and have always loved her. She cares for her students, knows her material, and gives great feedback on papers. Much of her assignments are just for class participation, but they do require reading the textbooks. The rest of her homework is few and tests (3-4) are spread out.",1
"Worst professor ever. Very boring and unorganized lectures. Adam has zero passion and doesn't seem like he wants to be there. Equation sheets aren't allowed on tests, no partial credit and review days are a joke. Material isn't that difficult but tests are you're whole grade and he makes them as hard as he possibly can. Avoid this professor",0
"Just take his class to listen to his lectures.  The man's voice is like chocolate rubbed in your ear.  Loves having discussions about abstract (and thus, often difficult to follow for some) topics, but in the end you'll certainly broaden your intellectual horizons. Highly recommended.",1
"Professor Bowman is not only a great teacher, she is an amazing person. She listens to her students and cares about their lives. I would take any class that Bowman has. LOVED HER.",1
"shes nice but her teaching is bad, she's also hard grader, don't take her if you don't like math coz she doesn't know what she's teaching and IDK why GGC has someone like her",0
Excellent prof! Very clear and decidedly hot. :),1
"Truly an unnecessarily tough grader. During the corona virus crisis she did not lower her expectations of us, and additionally stated during class time that she would spend less time grading our work and would give us fewer comments on how to improve. Though through her words she acted sympathetic to her students, her actions spoke otherwise.",0
Intimidating. But knows exactly what he's doing. Incredible percussionist.,1
She is very sweet and a good portion of the textbook she goes over in power points in class. All the stuff she goes over in class are always on the test and if your not doing so well she allows a lot of extra credit,1
"okay, yes he is tough. But Wilson really WANTS each person to succeed. If you're willing to seek him out for help - help for ANYTHING:no matter how small - he makes the time to work with you on it. Loves to help you, but makes sure YOU do the work.",1
"Dr. B is a great professor, very inspiring. His grading may be confusing but it's very hard to fail his class, she give extra credit for EVERY EXAM .",1
"would take her again. she is a tough grader, extremely specific about apa. but she is clear in what she is looking for. her test questions are specific, but i guess technically they are fair overall. she gives all the info you need in the slides and when she talks you really need to listen. and she is super nice",1
Mrs. S is an absolute sweetheart! she is beyond dedicated to her students and works around the clock to help you achieve your goals. I never had a professor that was so caring to her students and truly helps you in whatever you need. As long as you work hard and follow directions you will be successful in her class! She has a great sense of humor!,1
"her class was pretty fun, and i think that she is cute, even though she is married.",1
No Comments,1
If you want to experience a condescending instructor who believes that the only way to test students is via hard essays this man is for you.  If you just want to learn and have a good experience avoid him like the plague.  If you take him dont ever miss class or he will fail you for not coming to hear his sermon.,0
"Professor Camarena talks about how he's huge on attendance, but he'll make you waste ur gas by missing several classes w/out emailing his students ahead of time. I think everybody takes his class because he's laid-back and isn't strict. You can use a calculator in this class.  HW 25% of ur grade and Quiz/Exams 50%",0
"Great professor, real world application",1
"The best professor I had at Cal. Truly a crystal clear speaker, and you can tell he really cares about the topics. Tests are fair. Wish I could've taken more classes with him.",1
"Really relaxed guy will work with you and understands that you have a life. Will not overload you and will go over and edit your paper with you. If you do what he requires you'll have an A. I will be taking 102 with him, great guy, you learn a lot!",1
I took Alex for Calc 2 and came in expecting to just get by but ended up doing much better than I imagined! She cares so much about her students and will go out of her way to help you and make sure you actually understand the material. I'd highly recommend her to anyone; she is by far the best prof I've had at Pitt!,1
He's flexible and helpful ,1
"Easy A to satisfy the GWAR requirement if u like writing creatively. 3 required readings, I found 2 online and Last of Her Name I didnt read. Dont really have to discuss readings so ur good. 5 easy quizzes, 2 short stories, peer reviews, presentation on a reading, and final portfolio (8 prompts, ur 2 stories, and 1 revised story). Def recommend!",1
"He is probably the best Spanish Profesor that I have ever had! He not only teaches you what you need to learn, but real world application for those of who really want to speak Spanish fluently!  He enjoys teaching and doesn't mind joking around. The tests are all standardized and I think he prepares you well. Attendance is a must for him!",1
"There's a quiz every week in this class. One midterm and one final. Two papers. Participation definitely matters and book is mandatory or he'll deduct points. He'll count every time you participate in class. His lectures are very long and tedious. Personally never paid attention, but you can tell he cares about his students. He'll help if you ask.",1
"I sincerely took several  aspects of this class for granted, especially the production aspect. I was one of the students who felt we were doing too much in the class. Now as a teacher, I realize  every aspect of the class was relevant. Well, the professor was kind enough to award me an A- despite my failure to submit assignments timely.",1
No Comments,1
Best professor in the department. Never learned so much and had fun doing it. Really enjoyed going to class.,1
"Prof. Appel is amazing! Was very specific when asking questions and takes the time to answer any questions, also was very helpful when going in for tutoring. HIGHLY recommend her if you're not good math because she made it so easy!",1
"Amazing prof, really down to Earth and cares a lot about his students' success. Lectures were very engaging, and Prof. Adve effectively created an environment where students felt comfortable to ask questions. Homework was designed with a good difficulty; it reinforced concepts while not being overly hard. Exams were fair, but had to work fast.",1
"His feedback seemed copied and pasted for each student. He is completely impersonal. He left almost no weekly notes. The reading was good for the most part-- a few utterly boring reads, but more often than not interesting and useful information. The assignments were often very easy.",0
I would avoid taking Eric for MTH162. He gets off topic and then speeds through the lecture because he doesn't manage time very well. He assigns an excess amount of homework that you'll have a quiz on and expects it all to be done by the next class. It'll be pretty much a self-taught class. Good luck.,0
VERY SINCERE IN HIS TEACHING QUALITIES,1
"If you do the short hw readings, class is simple. If not, no biggie unless there is a pop quiz but those aren't too hard. The tests are take home (but 12 page essays) and the in class test he gives you the question weeks beforehand and you bring notes. I got above a 97 on all tests, easy easy grader just use the lectures online!!",1
"I don't even know where to begin where to start with the guy. He is extremely friendly to all of his students, first of all. Whenever I see him outside the class, he always takes the time to chat. Secondly, he will do anything you think needs to be done to pass, especially during office hours. Overall, the best professor on campus, by far.",1
Grades like an English prof. but he makes class interesting and keeps everyone engaged.,1
Professor Young is the best MATH 211 professor ever. She explains things in ways that students can understand.,1
VERY VERY VERY hard. But a great teacher,1
"This is a very interesting and easy UGS. There are many grades that are gimme 100s. You must show up to weekly discussion sessions but they're easy and enjoyable. Lectures are optional. He is invested in his students, really cares about their questions, and wants to give you the tools to make your own decisions. Very fair and well taught course",1
"This class was simple and straight forward for some parts, and overly complicated for others.  It doesn't help that the teacher seems to want to talk more about monkeys to explain everything than practical information.",1
"Get ready to read, because his PPT slides only glance over what is on the exam. It is very book heavy and his study guides are just the topics you need to read in the book. Learn the terms and go to class because his lectures (although sometimes boring) are based on real life examples. Friendly fellow and takes feedback well.",1
Lisa assigns assignments with little to no direction. She requests that you go to peers for help instead of her. She grades tough- you get a C for doing exactly as she asks; you must go above and beyond to get any higher.,0
"She's amazing to watch teach. She's always enthusiastic when she comes in and her lectures aren't boring like most teachers in her subject. She is a challenge if your'e lazy, but if you stay on top of your work, she'll work with you.",1
Awesome course. Her notes were really clear and easy to refer back to when doing the problem sets. She gave us a bunch of practice midterms and finals which made a big difference. Super busy prof but she made our class the priority if we had questions outside of the lecture,1
Show up and take notes and you are good. You have to take notes by hand but it's not bad. He keeps things interesting and fun. I'm not a history person but he made this class very enjoyable.,1
"great teacher, keeps it interesting, VERY nice and helpful, will work with you if you need help, would take any of his class!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Not sure what these students are talking about. The bad reviews are clearly from the people who don't want to work for their grade. This is nursing, what do you expect? If you can't handle the lectures, then you're not smart enough to be a nurse. She cares about her students and people are getting mad about the HESSI, it's her job, not her doing.",1
"Professor D'Sa is extremely smart in his field. There are two tests; both 25 questions and multiple choice. He is willing to help and will not trick you. He will tell you what is on the Exams, verbatim. He is the ONLY teacher that lets you use a financial calculator! Take advantage of that! Otherwise, formulas are not easy to memorize.",1
"Prof Richards is the coolest, nicest professor ever! I took his class but then changed my major so I didn't need his class anymore but I still decided to stay in it because he has such a great teaching style and is always very organized! Definitely one of the best professors at DSU!",1
"Quizzes are basically all trick questions. Multiple choice questions on the final are mainly straightforward, but some questions are tricky. The short answer questions on the final are about the most irrelevant details out of all the material that was covered (when you're studying, everything you think is useless is probably one of the questions).",0
"Pay attention in class and youll do fine. Do the extra credit, ask questions and theres no reason you cant get an A.",1
He one of the best teachers ever. You can listen to him clearly. Take notes. Mr. Furno is the reason I take notes to this day.,1
Mrs. Barclift is a great teacher! She is funny and you learn a lot from her stories about her past experiences in the field. She can be blunt and somewhat rude when she feels overwhelmed so if you need to talk to her about your grade be sure to do it when she's not overwhelmed. Overall she is a really good teacher and very easy going.,1
"Professor Monahan is the beginning, then end, the one who is many. He is Monahan. I transferred into Suffolk from SUNY Cortland, and he is the best professor I have ever had to date. Monahan Cares about every one of his students, and is always there when you need some advice. Overall, excellent professor, And will be continued in mgmt. :)",1
pretty funny guy. he'll keep you awake during lectures most of the time. listen and take notes during class and you won't have to panic while studying. buy only his little book that he writes ($20) and don't buy the textbook. that's all you need to do well,1
Mr. Newcomb is an amazing educator! He explains things very well and is patient. He gives great feedback! Tests are huge part of your grade so just make sure to do the homework and review! Ask questions when needed! He is hilarious and very personable.,1
"A bit hard to understand at times, but the class is not hard at all as long as you attend and pay attention. I am not an A student at all but this class was an easy A if you go to class and do the HW.",1
"The best professor for theology! He cares for students by understanding they have other classes. Need an extension or to miss a class b/c youre sick? No problem, just talk to him beforehand. He always checks in with the class to see if they understand the material or are feeling stressed. Explains the material to the simplest terms. Great teacher!",1
Do not take this class. You are paying to teach yourself. The professor does not teach and his LA's teach the course instead. Each LA will give you a different answer and you will end up confused and unsure. I regret having taken this course. The class is also extremely slow and not even the professor can give you a decent answer when you ask.,0
"Avoid this professor. Bad in every way. Rude, arrogant, hard to reach, and disorganized.",0
"She has a lot of personal experience under her belt. However, her grading is harsh, and her manner in class was very uncomfortable. For her I'm sure it feels like impassioned political discourse, but it comes off as mean and belittling. Unclear assignment criteria. Interesting but narrow range of topics discussed. Needs major changes to class model",0
"Shimizu is ok. Her lectures are scattered and sometimes incoherent, but she's definitely passionate about what she's saying. The grade consists of 2 papers, 1 essay final, and some pop quizzes. She is very strict about what the papers needs to be like, but I found that made the papers easier since you knew exactly what she was looking for.",1
I love Prof. Willmore! She is the best professor you can get for a foreign language. She is very very helpful and clear in instructions and what she expects from you. Her teaching style is awesome. She speaks in English and Spanish so it's never confusing or frustrating. Lots of homework on cengage but it's not that hard.,1
"This teacher is very difficult to get along with.  She is very demeaning to students and does not seem to want to help students learn.  She is a very hard grader, to the point I would say unfair.  If a small aspect of a lab write up is not exactly how she feels it should be, she will gouge your grade severely.  If you can avoid her DO SO!",0
3 mc exams on definitions found in the textbook. 5 easy hw assignments. he grades on participation and attendance but as long as you show up you'll be fine. he doesn't allow any electronics. you don't need to pay attention long as you memorize about 50 terms each exam. he's approachable and always willing to explain more. kinda boring lectures.,1
"Maybe an hour or two of homework per week. To get an A: - go to class - complete and understand the homework - the above will allow you to get good grades on the quizzes and tests If you dont get an A, you were probably too distracted by her attractiveness.",1
"Prof Jones likes to be called Randy. I took his Fine Art class and WSU Tri-Cities. While attendance was mandatory, you can really just zone out during class. He's really passionate about art and has some cool lecture points, but the lecture isn't at all in the exams. For the exam all that you need is re-read your hw which he corrects to perfection",0
"Incredibly boring lectures. I was able to teach myself out of the book and still do well in the class. The group project isn't too bad, but the directions are incredibly unclear and he had to be asked multiple times for things to become clear. Easy class if you read the slides and do practice problems. So boring though. ",0
"Incredibly easy class with clear cut grading criteria! Amazing and clear lectures: there were 8 lectures coupled with a quiz, 3 assignments that had to be done with a partner, and 1 midterm and 1 final. She provided a study guide for both exams and the week before she holds a review. I would take her again and highly recommend her to anyone!",1
"She is always upbeat and excited to teach, good at explaining and reviewing.",1
"Honestly, the only thing that really killed me was the final. There was so much information to study it was unrealistic. The teacher seemed really nice, though It was an online class so it's hard to really tell. But yeah, there's a lot of reading and a lot of information. Don't think I would recommend it.",0
Hands down the best professor I have ever had. Made me look at the world in a completely different way and changed my life!,1
He was the easiest professor and the most honest. He always tells you what to expect in the midterms and final. He gives handouts which basically outlines the class lecture. You don't need to go to class BUT he gives good examples that can help for the exams. Key ideas and examples are his thing. Not boring if you listen attentively. Really chill.,1
"Awesome professor. Very helpful, seems to truly care about her students. Notes are online, attendance isn't mandatory but you should go because sometimes she shows films and had worksheets. It's an easy and very interesting class. Take her",1
He often went off topic and his lecture slides were terrible. He clearly cares a lot about the material and the students but his lectures have nothing to do with what you're tested on. The multiple choice on both the midterm and the final was very difficult.,0
"I love Kristin.  She is very vibrent and really cares about helping all the students.  She is very fair y mas bonita.  Highly recomended for students just trying to get through the class and for students really interested in espanol. Muchas amor, siempre.",1
"Great music teacher, I don't know how he isn't famous.  From beg. to advanced, don't be afraid to take this course, music major or not.  He is helpful, only a few oral tests, but you'll learn more than you can imagine.  I learned more in 2 semesters on guitar than I have in 4 years.",1
"Dr. David G. Schuster gives awesome lectures. He is very passionate about the subject he teaches which makes the class all that more interesting. Only takes grades on four papers and two exams. Exams are all essay, so break out your pen.",1
Sweet guy. AWESOME CLASS!! EASIEST A EVER!!!!!! Quiet.  A lot of time to do your essays (could be 1 page as long as they were decent). Simple binder check at end. Lots of movies. Gets out early. Need the book. Can get away with missing 1 or 2 days. Not good if you want discussion or feedback on your work. WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE! Be respectful.,1
"Amazing prof. He really knew his stuff and made every class super interesting. Super caring, helpful, and gives away 25% on participation. Midterm was super straightforward, and the essay wasn't too bad either. Would definitely recommend if you like Medieval Studies.",1
Don't take her. It's hard to understand what she says during class. You mostly will have to teach yourself.,0
"Great professor! Took this class at SJSU and Kress was a nightmare, 100% better experience here. If you do all your homework you'll have no issue at all. Tests are all based off of the quizzes and he's nice and helpful! Taking again for 4B!",1
"He's a great teacher! totally recommend him to anyone! and hes has a great sense of humor which he uses to teach. As long as you do your work and pay attention in class you should get an A, no doubt! Great Teacher! I would take him again if i could :D",1
he knows his stuff. gives great notes. study notes for tests and quizes and get A's. can be a little boring tho.,1
HE IS VERY HELPFUL AND FUN ,1
"Mrs. S seems mean at first, but once you show her you are serious about nursing she will love you and help you with everything you need. I can see where some people might not like her, but if you give her a chance you won't want to leave her. I promise!!",1
"She is hands down my favorite teacher. She genuinely cares about her students, and constantly accepts feedback. I have learned and grown so much this semester with her. Absolutely the best! I will miss her next semester.",1
Amazing guy and teacher. He is funny and easy going and someone who actually cares about his students passing. He may spend a bit of time on examples but it is needed for a spreadsheet question. He shows you how to use Excel and take the easy way of calculating the problems instead of you using a calculator. More professors need to learn from him.,1
The class is hard. Read the book and don't get behind. His tests require a lot of writing and understanding of the material. He is the only E350 prof so you might as well do well the first time.,0
"What I liked most is the integration of cultural stories and personal experience that you cannot find in any textbook, that helped look at issues from a very, very different perspective. The only criticism is that this course covers too much. But I would recommend it to anyone interested in Islamic and Middle East studies.",1
"This man has a doctorate in accounting. If you were to look up the word ""accountant"" in the dictionary you'd probably see a picture of him. I highly recommend taking him if you ever plan on majoring in accounting in the future after NVCC. Attendance isn't mandatory for his lectures but I recommend you go.",1
Mr. Petro is an AMAZING math teacher. He truly cares for students to learn and provides a clear pathway for success. Get ready to learn and to work. If you don't put in the effort then you'll definitely fail. He is accessible and willing to answer questions so be ready with yours. My grade was solely due to my effort and not his teaching. Great guy,1
"Take notes and you'll do well on the quizzes. only gives about 3. for the papers, work hard because he is a hard grader. very nice and wants you to learn and understand what he is teaching.",1
"While mr. Fu is nice and is very knowledgeable about this subject, I feel like he is not a good teacher. I had a hard time understanding him because of his accent and broken English. He seems to prefer outdated ideas over modern ideas so beware of that. He doesn't give very good feedback either. I don't really recommend his classes.",0
"Mr. Hoover's 1020 was great. He's very patient, and will go over the material until you understand it. Always gives extra credit for the exams. He also goes over most of the homework. There's no reason to fail his class.",1
Seemed fair to me. Gave a redo on one quiz that the whole class struggled with as he felt is was too hard and not fair. Liked the class as we got to build a robot. It was a lot of work but learned a ton and had fun doing it.,1
Very nice and caring teacher and person. She will go out of her way to help you with personal problems or school problems. NUMBER 1.,1
This class is very hard but professor Aunave is such a sweetheart and helped me as much as possible. As a student taking French for the first time I would say it was extremely difficult even though I made my best effort. Its a small class with lots of talking and group activities. She can tell if your really trying and will grade accordingly. ,1
"This was by far the best experience I have had in college. Professor was knowledgeable, efficient, and sweet. Graded faster than lightning speed. Light coursework, brief assignments, and discussion boards. East tests. Lots of extra credit offered. Take her!!",1
Ms. Hunt is an awesome teacher. She makes the class a lot easier and funny. I would take her over and over again. We need more teachers like her.,1
"Professor Okten was a very caring professor, and it was evident that he wanted everyone to understand the material. Though the lectures were remote, he did a stellar job of explaining the concepts to the class. Some of the assignments were graded a bit tough, but he did a good job of explaining why things were graded how they were. Would recommend.",1
"His passion for the subject is so clear. He cares a lot for his students. It is  really intense course, but, if you show that you are trying, he will work with you.",1
She is a great professor. She will take her time explaining to make sure you understand. Her final exam is long: 30 long multiple choice questions and one essay. She prepares you well. She offered three reviews and was willing to answer every question.,1
"12 quizzes, 1/2 point each. drops 2 lowest. 3 assignments, 3 exams. Study the content of the assignments, go to class, and you will do good. This professor also uploads supplemental videos for you. goes above and beyond, very knowledgeable about SQL. TAKE HIM",1
Great teacher. Interesting. Very nice person. Made class easy to attend because it was not boring.,1
Lab reports are impossible. If you miss a lab or are late you are screwed. Five minutes after lab starts she wont let you turn anything in. She enjoys taking points of of everything. If you have an option do not take this professor.,0
"She is a very passionate teacher. She is also very caring and respects the students. However, her exams killed my grade. They are based on the book and while I read the book and even took notes from the book, I did poorly on the exams. Many other people in class had the same problem. Many of the questions are trick questions.",1
"I definitely liked her style, but if you're an art major- she will enforce her own style onto you, promoting no style for personal development. She also enforces her animation class quite a bit, and she can be very sensitive. Attendance is mandatory, no excuses. Overall, she is a good teacher, BUT- prepare yourself for her. She is a handful.",1
"Tabea is the best teacher I have ever had at NAIT. She is knowledgeable, puts effort into her lessons and really cares about her students. Leadership isn't always the most exciting course but she made it great!",1
"Ryan is funny and entertaining, and his lectures on creativity are interesting. However, in person, Ryan can be condescending and critical. Sometimes, criticism is constructive and based on facts. Other times, he just has his own opinion of how things should work. Frequently made me feel stupid in emails. Just be tougher than he is.",1
"He was a great professor, all his lectures were entertaining and made you reflect a lot on personal issues or something that may be going on with your life. Do all the homework and you'll pass with flying color, easy grader as long as your answer seems like there was effort put into it",1
"He's been in the game for a long time and I feel like he knows what he's talking about. The reason I gave him a 4 and not a 5 rating is because he's a really good teacher but he ain't perfect, I'll tell you that. P.S. But then again aren't we all...",1
"What a great professor! While this class is in a lecture hall, she still manages to interact with the students and answers individual questions. Plenty of extra credit is given if you show up to class. There are very few grades outside the tests, so it is important to study for them. However, Smith does provide study guides and TA study sessions.",1
3 open notes quizzes. Midterm and final are 3-4 essays each. Prompts are given ahead of time so you can memorize your essays. The most important thing is to write down EVERYTHING she says. Printing the slides is not enough. If you include all of the details she verbalizes on tests you'll get 10s easily. Don't get caught not reading hw. Easyish A/A-,1
"Great Prof. Very sweet, will try to help you as best she can. Definitely read the textbook if you want to do well and make good notes. This is not an easy class, but she is not unfair. Just study and read carefully and you'll do well.",1
She is very good at photography but not a great teacher. Will instruct clearly on how to do things in the Photo Lab but doesn't clearly explain things about photography. Very nice & helpful!,1
Ms. Louis is a good teacher. I just want to say that the test questions are not very good but Ms. Louis did inform me that she is working on improving them for us. :-),1
"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! Does not respond to emails, does not fix mistakes in grades, and made one of the tests at the last minute! Would strongly not recommend this professor.",0
"After taking a long break from school, I'm glad I had Prof Blair coming back to academia. Prof Blair prepares her students to be ready to critically think through ideas, situations, and real world issues. It was an honor to have my creativity, thinking, and writing skills mentored under Prof Blair; and I'm sure you'll have a similar experience.",1
"Teacher makes you look forward to every class. You will learn a lot in the course, he is extremely helpful. If you go to class and do your work, you will receive a good grade. Highly recommended!",1
Great professor and very interesting class!,1
"Exams are from his lectures so obviously you cant skip classes if you want to do well. Pretty straightforward. Seems like a lot of online homework but its really not (its actually quite easy). I wish there wasnt a term paper involved but its not the worst thing ever. Basically just go to class, pay attention, take notes and youll do well.",1
Ms. Murnighan is an amazing teacher. She makes sure students understand what is going on in class. Class discutions are great. I wish she taught all the business classes I needed.,1
"Dr. Justice was the absolute best professor ive every had period. Im not the greatest in math but the way he explained the content it made a lot of sense. He is always available after class and for office hours for you to ask questions. If you have trouble in math and dont want to repeat, try your hardest to get Dr. Justice he is the best!",1
Awesome professor and great class.,1
Dr. Andrews is a super great lecturer that loves to talk about his personal experiences & call on students to hear about theirs. The class itself is interesting but it covers almost too much. Your grade is all dependent on the TA. 3 tests & 3 essays in addition to weekly paragraphs. Tests are online but are not as easy as u might want/expect.,1
"This was my first philosophy class, even though it was a 200 level class. Almost every quiz and exam is online which is really nice. However, this means that you have to take notes every class because she doesn't post a lot of the powerpoints  online. She really enjoys talking about cats. Kind of boring, but an easy A for me.",1
All like an amateur writing workshop.  Didn't get much out of it.  She was soometimes nice and helpful and sometimes full of herself.,0
"I loved Señora Pilkington! She's super sweet and really cares to get to know all of her students. English was her first language so she doesn't have an accent, and repeats important stuff and makes sure you understand. I definitely learned a lot in her class and did more speaking than previous classes, so I definitely recommend!",1
The best Lited professor ever. I learned a lot about language development and literacy in her class.,1
"This class is difficult, I will give you that. You have to work hard, but Jacobson makes every minute worth your wile. She is always enthusiastic about her what she is teaching and wanting to help you every step of the way. She is strict when it comes to grading and some textbooks used in the past were dull, but class was always fun.",1
"Prof. Nathanson makes a content heavy course easy to understand and enjoyable. She is passionate about social work and her students. While grades are important, Prof. Nathanson cares more about her students thinking constructively rather than simply memorizing facts. By the way, she is hilarious- her jokes are perfectly timed and clever!",1
"Adam Meyer is a very laid back professor. He is kind of awkward and shy, but later in the semester he opened up more.",1
Basic assignment. But if youre into not learning this is your guy. Hes nice but very unclear. assignments are very easy but it gets difficult when you're taking a test and have no idea what hes talking about,0
"Cynthia is an amazing teacher. I heard people in the class complain about how much reading you have to do for homework, 2 times a week you read an article and answer about 10 questions on it, but it's a 400 level class so it's not as bad I expected it to be. She's very helpful and wants you to succeed, very energetic also and keeps you engaged",1
"I'm going to keep this short and concise. If you show up to class and put in a little effort in your essays, your guaranteed an A. She is very nice and always willing to help. I would 100% recommend her to everyone. If you need an English-101 professor, you should definitely go with her.",1
"Terrific teacher:hilarious, interesting, smart and opened-mind. Even though both math class are not easy, you will never feel sorry that you took these casses. Lectures base on real evidences with good simple explanations. Tests maybe heavy only if you dont do homework that is a lot be given for every class. However, all this homework's very useful",1
My entire class LOVES Janey. She will make you very interested in the language as well as the country. You need to attend class daily or you will fall behind very easily.,1
"Unorganized. Objectives a joke of a study guide. Prepare for 75pt exams that turn into 250 pts because she can. Writes her own exams and questions are tricky. She is nice to your face but u can tell she enjoys making everyone squirm. Read your book and answer questions in lecture, she will ask a lot of them and will grade you easier if you answer!",0
STAY AWAY! The school may as well throw a statistics book at you and expect you to learn math by reading the book because thats what he does. He refuses to help students even when i asked for help finding a tutor he said he knew of none,0
Greta is a bit cooky and the class is a bit boring. BUT she is a wonderful professor and genuinely cares about the well being of her students. I personally just do not care for the class but would take her again.  ,1
Professor gibson is an amazing instructor. Be Aware she's in love with Tupac as well as being funny and actually engaging with her class and making sure everyone understands. She really is your ideal professor i honestly wish i could've taken her for 1102 after taking her for 1101. Work very easy and understanding by the way.,1

great teacher,1
She is one of the best professor at hostos. Took her for my EDU 104 and 105 . Both of her class was awesome. She gives you lots of information that you will remember for lifetime. I love her teaching style. She cares about each individual student. I highly recommend her .,1
"Luallen is a superstar. You will learn *everything* there is to know in EC11 if you take his class. You'll only get a B+ because his tests are so hard, but if you care about learning the material then you need to take his class. He's also just an awesome guy, and he's great at helping you out if you get stuck - he really cares about his students.",1
Prof Shively was awesome I had very little interest in her class but she made everyday interesting. Make sure to keep up with D2L !!,1
Took her course in 2013 and found her to be quite delightful.   Good teacher,1
"Dr. Lorton is a great teacher. He does each problem step by step and explains things really well. He is a little monotone, but he does give study guides for his test which are REALLY helpful. Solid choice!",1
"Professor Godwin is great - he's so smart he makes UFO's and fairies believable, the class makes you question your opinion on the paranormal. Also he has some great relevant personal experiences and does know what he's talking about... ps, he's sassy!",1
"Great Professor. His tests are ""essay"" based typically 2-4 paragraphs is enough to answer the question. One Midterm, One Final, one project, and case studies. Read the text and attend lecture. There are no surprises on his exams. If you study you will pass with a high grade.",1
Telling Tales is the class I look forward to the most this semester. Much of the material Mclane assigns evokes deep thought and analysis which he lets everyone discuss during class. He is a tough one to acclimate to but once you accept that he expects your solid effort and input he actually becomes quite endearing.,1
"She is the best teacher and best mentor that I could ever have!!! I've taken her for 3 classes (including an internship). She really cares about her students and takes the time aside to sit down with you an figure out what to do, whether it is for life in general or for the class.",1
THIS IS NOT A CULTURE CLASS IT IS A HISTORY CLASS. What I thought would be interesting ended up being super boring. I skipped class all the time and when I did go I never took notes because she went way to fast. Her tests are pretty easy though. Get the english version of the book if you can...that saved me in this class.,0
"Very clear about what to expect. Is so passionate about innovation and adds so much value to the classroom. One of the best instructors at NAIT. Truly cares about her students. You will get so much out of her if you try. If you skip class or show up late, you will struggle in her class. She is great!",1
She is an AWESOME teacher.. makes class fun and ineresting!! Easy and FUN!!!,1
"HARD, BUT REAL!!  thank you!!",1
Dr. Mangone's lectures were engaging and he explained the concepts well. The tests were very fair: know all the information from the lectures and you will be fine.,1
"OMG. He is a wonderful teacher. Yes, you do have to do your speech and test, which are all take home. Don't be disrespected and you will get along just fine. I was one of those students, who went to class and didn't talk much. You need the textbook to do the test. ",1
He is by far the hardest physics professor in Kennesaw. He doesn't care if his students understand the material. Overall not a good teacher in my opinion and other peoples opinions as well.,0
"If you go to class, you are going to do fine. A lot goes on in class with lectures, discussion topics, and group work. She's experienced and thoughtful with her answers to our questions. I want to take another class of her's again.",1
This was my first online class ever and I absolutely loved it! Prof Zaranek was extremely helpful and always responded to questions I had. You have to post at least 175+ word response for each discussion board which is not that hard and then reply to two other students. Gives an easy essay every other week. She is super nice and understandable!,1
"Quite possibly one of the best professors I've had at AWC. He really tries to make sure you understand the topics through power points, in class discussions/work, & makes class relevant to everyday life. Gier is very passionate about economics & never fails to make his class interesting. Assignments are nicely spaced out. Fair grader, achievable A.",1
"Alyssa is a wonderful professor. She cares about her students and explains the material very well. Take her if you have the chance, but be prepared to work.",1
"Dr. Picault is extremely helpful and posts his lecture slides. If you attend lectures and ask for help outside of class when you need it, his classes are manageable and interesting.",1
Really a horrible teacher had to drop math 112 from winter term. This class she doesn't know the material at all and student ask her if she supposed to follow the math formula in the text book and then she get mad and yells as the student. Really a rude instructor and bad at teacher math course. Please avoid taking this instructor for math.,0
"Did not pass his class the first time, I got a D. Second time I got a B. If you dont attend class you will NOT pass. If you dont study hard for midterms or finals you will fail them. Take notes on everything and study them any chance you have. I never got 100% on my homework assignments, he would always dock off a point for something ridiculous.",1
DespiteThe class being tough and all of the negative reviews on here. Dr. Wynekoop is a very caring professor and is willing to help you whenever you are struggling and explains anything without giving you a hard time. My favorite professor at FGCU.,1
"If you want to learn what an anecdote is by listening to someone talk about the motorcycle helmet laws in West Virginia for an hour, then Hetrick is your man! All joking aside,  Professor Hetrick is a really good guy who wants you to pass.  His grading is kind of strange, but as long as you put some effort into the paper, you'll be fine.",1
"Best ASL teacher at Mesa hands down! Comments about being too tough are totally invalid, It's ASL 4 and everyone taking it SHOULD be expected to actually know ASL. Over all the classes teaches a lot about how to actually use the language instead of using meaningless words. Very helpfull!",1
"Whatever he teaches, will be on the exam; word for word. He is a very good teacher. Can be scary and ignorant at times but not a bad person. Likes to make jokes no matter how insulting that is. Classes aren't boring at all and you will learn a lot about real world economy.",1
"This class is not an easy A. There is a LOT of content, and a lot of the time there will be things on exams that weren't even discussed in class, so keep up with the textbook. Despite this I felt like I really learned a lot and that Dr. Lyons is very knowledgable and passionate about archaeology.",1
"I would advise to take this class online. It is a lot of work required, but just make sure you do it bay the deadline.  She was extremely helpful and doesn't require you to do as many LearnSmart questions like other teachers. That's why I took her twice.",1
He's smart but he is too intense when he is in his lectures. He doesn't care that you have other classes and assignments because he only gives you mon - fri to do a long and hard assignment. I have not had one assignment that was interesting. Nice guy but makes me regret going towards my major in english since he has taught me nothing at all.,0
"I was in a 3-hour long lecture and I did not learn anything. He gives and outrageous amount of reading and does not make sure that you genuinely understand the information. He isn't  very concerned with how you do in his class and takes attendance randomly by asking students to answer questions. It's a boring, frustrating class, would not suggest.",0
Her Mixed Media class is simply awesome! So many lovely techniques to learn: silkscreening! Bookmaking! Printmaking! So fun! And what I loved about this class is that u don't actually spend so much time outside the class like most other time consuming art classes!,1
"I was never good at Spanish but she made it manageable. She explained the material clearly. Sometimes she was funny which made class more enjoyable. She would also give us lots of hints on what would be on the test which was nice because her moto is ""Life is hard enough, so I don't want to make it any harder""",1
"Professor Khadka is the best teacher. He is well organized, knowledgeable respected and helpful.",1
"He is the sweetest professor everrr!  the class is a joke, if you get As on the first two essays he won't even read the rest and will give you As for the rest. No tests, only 1 research paper (5pgs including outline, coversheet, and works cited) 1 book report that you will have to share to the class and 3 essays. Easy A would take again!",1
"really awesome prof. super nice. his class is kinda hard just because of his tests. he purposely makes them really hard to get an A, but offers some extra points. homework assignments are pretty much pass/fail. so just do them. attendance is not mandatory, but you should go. he is planning on changing the course tho. i'd take him again for another",1
"Bernadette is the best teacher I've ever had! She is so easy to talk to and she is very very understanding and so kind! I took psychology online and I found it very interesting, you just have to do the work of course, like any other class. If you're debating whether to take her or not I would definitely take her.",1
"One of the best professors I have had. Knows his subject matter. His use of Heidegger in explaining Transcendentalism this semester was so incredible. You HAVE TO READ!! People say they did not buy the textbooks, but that is only shorting themselves. If you don't use texts in your essays you are penalized. I looked forward to this class.",1
"This class is chill because of Shapiro and fun because you get to know everyone in your class. Assignments are fairly simple- such as attending a religious ceremony, interviewing an immigrant, or  visiting a foreign restaurant. Lots of reading (but no need to read it all) and several papers. Overall, a fresh class  that's worth taking.",1
He was so respected that rarely I see professor willing to arrive to class for office hours and left late for question regarding to dynamics question. Although sometimes the material taught was a little confusing but he is willing to keep doing lots of example for us to get there. Amazing and passionate lecturer.,1
"Class was easy, homework was easy, but if you are a student that likes to keep up with grades and use feedback from grading or professor notes, then you will be disappointed. Most of the grading that he did was AFTER the class was over. At this point if you are or have been doing something that he doesn't like on the assignments, it is too late.",1
"She's a softie - she desperately wants to have an all french class, but it doesn't turn out that way.  She's funny, and will let you slide on homework assignments, which is a lot of homework!  Tests are fair.  You'll get a better grade than you'd think - homework is key, though.",1
Awsome professor! Very clear and helpful. Took him for a summer class and things turned out to be more sucessfull than what I thought. Highly recomment him,1
"Celine is a strong and dedicated woman to her love of cinema and students. She is nice and brings up interesting topics during her lectures. Her pop quizzes are open book and she supervises her TAs when they grade papers. Follow her guidelines and you will get an A. She doesn't check attendance often, but I still went just in case.",1
Very interesting class. Great activities. Fascinating guy to talk to.,1
"I took Melissa twice, both in Winter 2019 for ENGL101 and Fall 2019 for ENGL102. She was my favorite professor throughout Clark and she really cared about her students' success. She really connects with her students and helps them throughout the term. Instead of just ghosting with emails, she'll write back in a positive manner! 10/10 Professor!",1
"I'll admit. Xing expects alot out of you. And the course material is hard to cover, however I think she tries her best to cover it for her students. I'm still suffering in her class, however, you can see that she wants you to succeed. She isn't like other profs. She genuinely cares. She should clarify things more, but she's great overall.",1
"The tests are hard and really test your complete knowledge on the readings and class. But, Dr. Britton is always there to help and also are the GTAs. So, if you don't like your grade, there is a place to go to help you with study strategies, answer questions, and clarify content!",1
"Fantastic Professor. He is hilarious and loves to get the class involved in his lectures, in a good way. Lectures can be a bit dry but make sure you take notes. Class is moderately difficult but if you pay attention and participate in class you can learn a ton.",1
"If you're looking for a sarcastic teacher that just sits behind a desk and lectures you, then this is your guy. He expects you to remember everything from previous classes and ridicules you if you do not. His lectures are very long, dense, and content heavy. There are a few lab days that could help your grade. Tests are online in class. No curves.",1
"Has a very good understanding of the subject and is willing to answer questions/give help if you need it. Also since there are lots of sections of this course there are lots of opportunities for outside help. Must buy online book for code, lots of online homework. Attendence is mandatory.",1
Hes very good at his job! I had a blast with him even though I ended up missing an entire week of class. He emailed me making sure I was okay and I was there to finish the semester! Would recommend! Just stay off your darn phones!,1
Stevens was great. He tells you what is on the quizzes and tests because he realizes that the robot is really hard. The class is just ROUGH because of the robot (pray that you get a good group). I would recommend him for 107.,1
Dr. Miller is perhaps the best teacher at PCC. He not only know his subject material but is also very inspirational and passionate. He makes his classes fun with jokes and real life stories that enhance the learning experience. I HIGHLY recommend you take him for any religion or philosophy class.,1
Really loves what she does. I wouldn't mind  staying after class on the naughty list either.,1
Amazing professor! Enjoyed his class! His lectures were easy to follow and understand! He gave past midterms to study from which was very helpful!,1
"Favorite professor ever, hands down! :D",1
"Maybe for the English language courses she's worth it, but not for any Spanish language courses. This woman can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly. She needs to stick to political feminist college classes in english rather than intelligent spanish classes.",0
"This course earned my first C in my 3 year college career.  Teacher would make us do hw and take tests before ever teaching the subject, which she thought was a hot new teaching method, so the only reason to take the class was for the weekly quizzes, because after that you would not learn anything new. Reading the book was the only way to learn.",0
"Professor Leung is highly competent is his material he teaches. His tests and quizzes are incredibly difficult, with an average exam grade for our class of a D+ before the curve he applies at the very end of the quarter. If you are prepared to work for it, this class can be rewarding.",1
"Ana is such a great teacher. If you have taken Spanish in high school, this class will be a breeze. Not only is there rarely homework, the tests are so easy, some of it even comes straight from the book. She really cares about her students and gives great feedback when needed. I am definitely planning on taking her again for SPAN 102!",1
She is one of the first professors Ive had that actually took time to learn my name. I was impressed by her ability to create discussions even through zoom. She is what I call a Master Teacher. I recommend going to speak to her whether you take the class or not. Her door is always open. She will change your life. She changed mine.,1
"He pauses in between sentences which adds up to half the class time Spends a month lecturing half a chapter. During reviews, he goes over questions that won't be on the exam . Takes off points if you don't solve it the way he wants it. I should have listened to the previous reviews on this man. Please read the other reviews and avoid this man.",0
Enjoyed his class so much i took another with him. great experience. he will explain till you understand. no dumb questions in a philosophy class!,1
"This teacher is awesome. He's not boring. Tests are super easy, you read stories and take 5pt quizzes on them. Most importantly no essays. Got an A in this class and enjoyed every minute of it. Take him if you want to keep your GPA high and still learn something. Wish more teachers like him cared about what they were teaching.",1
"Took for int'l elective credit, class was rather straightforward - he actually makes the whole course sound harder than it really is.  Only grades are 3 exams and project - 2nd exam is 35% and final is 45% of grade so you have to study, but if you write exactly what he does on the board, and look thru the practice, you'll do fine.",1
No Comments,1
"AMAZING teacher. Had him as a highschool dual-enrollment professor though, so I got to experience his teaching in person in a classroom environment rather than an online class (which the other reviews were.) I don't know how he is as an online professor, but I know that he was the most interesting, informative, and fun teacher I've ever had!",1
"I absolutely love Steve. He is the prof who cares the most out of all the professors I've taken, and he understands students more than any other professor. Also, he lets the class choose how they will be graded, so all of my work was for completion. He is such such such a good prof, and I would take him again 100%. I didn't want CH1 to end.",1
He is a great professor!  Follow his readings and attend class and you will learn everything you need to plus more.  I will take him over and over again.,1
"OK, I realize a lot of people do not like this class, but as someone who does not understand math at all, I thought Rayburn was extremely helpful especially during office hours. The class itself is not easy, but you get to use a notecard on tests and he gives extra credit. I thought he was actually a pretty good teacher.",1
if you apply yourself and study you will do fine in his class. if you dont study then you wont do good at all.,1
She is a really TOUGH GRADER.,0
Loads of work in the 2nd half. Assignments are tough. Very strict on papers.,1
You need to go to class in order to do well in the class but his lectures are fun to listen to he brings to light elements of the reading that make the class really interesting.,1
"I cannot stand this woman. The class is easy, but she is awful to her students. In her online course, if someone asks for help she wont answer them, only say things like ""this cannot be any clearer"" and leave it alone. SHe is persumptuous and egotistical, and an overall snobby and elitist person. i don;t know how she got her job. F-",0
"Honestly, you learn so many life lessons in this class. Prof. Wingora is a very wise yet funny teacher he can be amusing and makes class interesting. Theres homework on blackboard every night but it can honestly be a 2 sentence answer. Tests and final essay or presentations are super easy, simply study or memorize moral theories and add support.",1
"If you dont like lectures, then his class will be a drag. Besides that he was very good at explaining the lessons and made everything as easy to understand as possible. ",1
"Knowledgeable about the topic, could answer the questions you ask very well. Wants students to succeed and makes the class enjoyable.",1
"This is an easy class, and you don't really need the book.  Online tests are simple and you can take them like 8 times, so you're guaranteed to pass.  It's moderately interesting, but sometimes Nelson can be spacey.  He's sometimes entertaining though.  All in all, it's a class worth taking, but bring something to do.",1
One of the best profs I've had. Knows his stuff and keeps lecture interesting.,1
His teaching method uses the material from the text but he goes beyond and incorporates real world experience into his lectures.,1
Really nice guy. Very knowledgable and want's to see you succeed. Would recommend him to anyone.,1
"Prof Jones was amazing! He is definitely passionate about art and wanting the students to take something from the course and continue to learn and appreciate art. It was a lot of fun for a summer class. Some lectures his voice was monotone, but the power points were chalk full of information. No final. Just quizzes and projects. Easy A. :)",1
Awesome online prof!! She is super organized and makes everything super easy to follow. One quiz a week and 5 exams with questions straight from the book. highly recommend this course,1
"Tabea is a great instructor with clear requirements. I had never experienced a course with such a high number of assignments. Consequently, I would recommend that students planning to take this course ensure that they can set the time aside to spend at least 5-10 hours per week to devote to this course and its assignments.",1
"This professor is very knowledgeable, but she spends SO much time discussing diet/food topics that are unnecessary for this specific course. Because she spent so much time going on tangents about nutrition instead of delving deeper into our A&P topics, I didn't gain much from her lectures. The class is an easy A, but you won't learn much about A&P.",0
"Professor Liu is an extremely tough grader. The reading assignments are  long and difficult to understand at times, but this class really broadens your knowledge on the complexities of restoration ecology. The tests are much harder than they need to be, extremely specific. Overall, not terrible, but she makes you work for your grade. ",0
"She is a bit of a hard person, very strong opinions and shares them freely. Her classes are very easy, attendance is mandatory and assignments are simple (but assigned very regularly). Overall an average teacher.",1
Change my world about Statistics!!!,1
"Professor Gonzalez is a great teacher. He provided clear instructions, as well as great feedback. He is not too heavy on grading, but does strongly enforce deadlines. He gave good examples, and shared very interesting ideas.",1
"Best prof I've had in my university career. Lectures are interesting and effective, labs/ exercises are helpful, and tests are fair. Wish that every prof was like him!!",1
"Upbeat, nice guy.  Always willing to help.  His grading system allows for mistakes throughout the semester.  Be a serious student and you will do fine in his classes.  I was actually very disappointed that he went on sabbatical this year and that I might not be able to have another class with him.",1
Gandy is an amazing teacher and super funny! Teaches the class exceptionally well and pushes you to do your best. Quizzes every Friday but if you study youll do fine.,1
Antoinetti is the man. Explains all the material very clearly. Nothing is online so you have to go to class. Quizzes and exams are straight from the notes. Don't buy the book. It is not needed one bit. Likes to crack jokes in class. Sometimes picks on kids but means no harm. Great professor to take economics with.,1
"He can be a bit dry and sometimes lectures were boring, but it wasn't a hard class. I barely went to lecture & got a B+. Grading is clear/assignments are fair with a lot of time to prep. TA/discussion is crucial for grades/feedback. Never opened the text, 2 exams, 3-4 assignments that aren't easy but preparation for isn't ridiculous.",1
"She is a really nice person but as a professor she is not that great. If you have to take her make sure you study ahead. She is very disorganized and her test are really hard especially the multiple choice part, the essay part is pretty easy but multiple choices are worth more so make sure you study and read the questions and choices slowly.",0
"Kathy is a tough grader. She refuses to give out A's even if she loves your papers. I didn't learn anything in her class, yet she expects you to be an amazing writing. I want to be taught, and she isn't doing it. ",0
"Very fun!!!  If you ever get a chance to take his classes, do it.  And if you ever have the opportunity to see him in any of the schools theatrical productions, go to it!  He is a very talented person and wonderful prof that I would recommend to anyone.  He is very helpful and knowledgeable.",1
take plenty of notes and make sure you attend review days because they are the test.  The book is a must and reading the chapters are also a must.,1
She is a very strong lecturer and explains the concepts very well. The grading is all around fair and there is nothing unreasonable. The material on the midterm and final are covered well by the professor and the homeworks.,1
Dr. Kunz is the best! I actually look forward to going to class because he makes it so interesting. Quizzes every week that are easy and straightforward. Tests come straight from the quizzes. Very easy to do well and you'll learn a lot.,1
Professor Shimizu's class was very informative. It's also incredibly easy if you have a grasp on analyzing cinema. Your grade is mainly made up of three papers and a couple of pop quizzes based on the reading. Easy beginning cinema class to get out of the way and enjoy at the same time.,1
amazing teacher. He is super funny & helps you develop more into your essays! I recommend this teacher.,1
This class is EASY if you know how to do the lab because most of the questions on the EXAM/FINAL are from the LABS.,1
"YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP IN LECTURE. Unless you get a good T.A., you probably will have a tough time in this class. He goes off on tangents a lot and is very monotoned. He doesn't use slides either so it's quite boring. Grading consists of 2 midterms, a final, and weekly quizzes in discussion. All of the test are essay questions.",0
Dr. Wydner is the best biology professor in the school! She gives students detailed study guides whenever they have to study for exams. She gives a lot of extra credit which can help boost your grade up.,1
"I took the online class. It wasn't too hard, but keeping up with the reading is a must to pass. The work load isn't a lot: Two discussion posts, a research paper, three quizzes and two tests.",1
"She was one of my favorite professors. She pushes you to write your best and also engage with readings. She is organized, sweet, and accommodating. You'll most likely have homework every day but they're always relevant to what you're doing. She's also a tough grader but will help any way she can. So all in all, do you best and you'll be fine.",1
"Conacher is absolutely amazing! I've never met a prof who simply wants her students to succeed like she does. She's approachable, funny, and even brought in snacks on both exams and Christmas crackers on the last day! 100% will take one of her classes again... love her! ",1
Mrs. Web-Stewart is an awesome teacher.  I wish she could be my teacher for all my English classes. She is extremely accommodating when giving test.  I would always recommend her as a teacher.,1
"She helped with all of my assignments and checked everything before I turned them in. I had an A throughout the entire quarter. At the very end of the course she went into the system and changed all of my grades to failing. I emailed her and she accused me of plagiarism. When I reported her, she failed me, but I was still passing. Discrimination.",0
"She was a fine professor, she really knows what she's talking about. The only problem with that is sometimes she kinda forget we're students and are trying to learn. She can get frustrated really easily with students if they don't understand something. Participation is SUPER important also.",1
I took this class online for Spring '14. He will grade you accordingly as long as you do your work and complete it thoroughly.  Will give advice and tips if asked. Note that discussions can become a bit confusing at times. Doesn't always explain what he's looking for with them. Tests are also challenging and don't always cover what's in the book.,1
"She is a good teacher, but it took a few weeks until it finally began to click. She teaches directly from the textbook which can be dull and difficult to understand. If you ever need help, she is more than happy to sit down and help you with whatever you need.",1
"Ms Padget is Horrible, This week she taught us how to do MLA formattingn on Work cited pages. This is the second to last week of the class and we were supposed to be doing it all along. She doesnt follow the syllabus and yells at you if you dont do the things on it. She is unclear about everything and cant even answer questions about what she wants",0
He likes to make lots of jokes and make fun of his students which is cool because we take him as a joke as well. His class is stupid easy. If you do the bare minimum you'll pass with 100% He canceled class often and would end class after 30 minutes. Little to no hw throughout the semester. You can tell he's not passionate about teaching anymore.,0
Mr. Prunty is an amazing professor! His teaching style is easy to follow and very straight forward! Loved everything about his class! Definitely want to take math from him again!,1
"b/c a 400 level seminar, material was hard but he knew that class was not experts and did not expext us to be interested in medieval lit and culture.  very fair grader, a little out there but if you just do the VERY FEW assignments and hand in last paper.  he's very laid back and understanding",1
This teacher is awesome! I learned so much from this class and I actually retained a lot of the information. He is a public defender with great stories.I would totally recommend him. LOVED HIM!! :),1
"Very good English teacher.  He pushes you to be the best and really guides us to our very best.  He is very family oriented and he remembers all his student's name and gets along with all of us very well.  Really nice guy in and outside of classroom, very professional as well and he is always there to help you.  But we have to work with him as well",1
class was pretty easy. attendance was graded and if u were absent more than 4 times u were dropped. class was pretty easy it consisted of reading and taking tests. shouldn't be so hard to pass.,1
Really nice funy man! Quizzes are all online so you can use your book. However it is timed. But 20min for ten questions is easy! Interesting class. I highly recommend! No homework either except for the online quizzez and of course reading the chapters in the text.,1
Took this teacher for MTH112 (which is not hard at all) but this prof makes it sooo hard. Takes off points for dumb reasons that do not even affect the final answer. Always in a rush. Expects you to remember and know all the formulas like you're some kind of Math Wiz.,0
"Do yourself a favor and STEER CLEAR of this course/professor. She has terrible rapport with students. Unpredictable, unkind. And this coming from someone who did well in her class.",0
"Rare combination: understands advanced math concepts AND can explain things to people who aren't great at math!  Amazingly helpful during office hours.  Patient,  respectful, and non-judgmental to questions, responds well to feedback.  Genuinely wants students to succeed. Study guides for tests.  Tests reflect HW and class content.",1
Great Professor!! Definitely learned a lot in his class.  He is very philosophical.  He has a lot of ideas on making the world a better place.,1
"Go to class, just go. Go to office hours the second you need help, he is more than willing to help, but it's hard to do that in class lectures due to the class size and the fast pace of his classes. Don't wait till the last minute to do homework. Get a tutor if econ isn't your thing. Always go to test reviews. It's a difficult course.",1
"Tinnirello is an awesome professor. He really breaks chemistry down so that everyone can understand it. He'll answer any question, and will answer it multiple times happily if people ask the same one over and over. There's a quiz every class, but its very easy and there's always lots of extra credit. You can use a cheat sheet on every test/quiz",1
Easiest tests and quizzes Ive ever taken. Got a 95% on the midterm and 98% on the Final exam. Not sure why he has such a bad review. Take him for a easy A!!!! All you have to do is read the textbook and you will be good. Test questions are so easy.,1
i was awful at the material in this class and handy made it easy to understand and works with you to help you figure it out. she is a sweetheart and even helps students she has no obligations to. you don't even have to have her for a class and she offers you help.,1
Lhota is very caring and cares about your success in this class. Attendance is mandatory but you can miss up to 4 classes. Just go in during office hours and she will tell you what you need to fix on your paper to receive a great grade.,1
Not even worth your time,0
"Adams a chill professor. Though he's sometimes monotonous, he can be funny at times. This was a hybrid course (online/in-class) but Adam was there to facilitate, guide and review. Asking questions, respecting the professor, and going to class should get you a good grade. Make sure you understand the material!",1
"If you want an easy A, look elsewhere. You really need to work for this one. Your writing skills will be 1000x better than when you started the semester, but she grades on the tough side. She's super helpful and clear, and will make you into an extremely good writer. She's kinda zany and very passionate about english, she's basically leslie knope",1
She is a sweet lady to your face but when she returns assignments it is as if she is Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde. She is not clear about what she wants and then takes off alot of points when its not up to her standards. Take her if you want to work your butt off and still get a bad grade.She is one of the toughest graders in the nursing program. BEWARE!,0
she is very clear and explains things in great details,1
The 3-hour lecture was brutal. She read right off the slides and didn't give us much additional information. I could've stayed in my dorm and looked at the PowerPoints (which were posted online) and still would've learned the same. She is VERY tough on APA formatting but her rubrics are very specific and are very clear on what she wants.,1
"Kelm is one of the best Spanish professors I have ever had. In general he is very laid back. I struggle with Spanish and his class was an easy A. His exams are straightforward, if you study and have a basic understanding you'll be fine. Tip: when taking the exam stay after class and he should help you.",1
"Quizzes are online. He's funny and tends to get off topic during lectures. There's one group project. I wish there were some extra credit opportunities or more points available to earn. He puts the lecture slides online, but I recommend going to class so you can actually understand them. Overall good class.",1
"Crumpler was great, he gave examples during class that really helped see what he expected from us and also what we would expect on the exams. At least one of the problems he went over in lecture would be on the exams. He is a little intimidating but as long as you don't ask dumb questions, you should be good.",1
Professor Donia is a gem. Definitely take notes during his lectures and do not be afraid to challenge him. He gives his opinions and tells you its his opinion and why he believes it. If you disagree write it in the essay and use facts for your counter arguments. Received great feedback in disagreeing with him. Which is very rare in professors.,1
" He has a great sense of humor. Nothing about his classes are ever boring. He plays music videos, lectures, commercials, and so on to teach you to distinguish Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. As long as you show up, do the work he assigns, and laugh with him, your good to go. Very understanding, and treats you fairly. Would take again! ",1
Glens the bomb! He gives awesome feedback and his classes are interesting. Good guy 5/7.,1
"Amazing professor all around. I can't wait to take another class with her before I graduate. Her readings are challenging, but she breaks them down very easily without outright giving you the answer so her discussions were very gratifying. Fair grader with very insightful comments to give. She is a theory buff and is very knowledgeable.",1
"This Professor wants to prove he is smarter than everyone else. He tries to make questions tricky, add questions on material you haven't studied yet, and when you ask for help his reply is always ""read your syllabus"". Just so he can say he did not lie to you, to purposely make you fail!!!",0
"Dreaded going to her class. Sheila was one to get side tracked a lot with arbitrary banter and stories, along with getting caught up with stories from students. A total waste of valuable class time.",0
"Dr. Fan is a great prof. She is very caring and interested in her students success. As long as you show that you are trying and putting the effort in, she will do everything she can to help you. Very enjoyable class with real world examples and application. You can tell she is very passionate about her field of research. Wish I could take again.",1
"This is an intro class to theatre, but all she can talk about is her history in costume.  it gets redundant and annoying.  if i wanted a theatre costume class, i'd take it.  no dice.",1
She talks a lot.,1
"Very helpful. Will take the time to explain as much as needed. There are multiple quizzes and assignments online for every unit. DO THEM. Unlimited attempts means free points and exam questions come from there. If you don't do well, it's probably your fault for not doing the work. ",1
"Schore is by far the best professor I've ever had. His exams are fair. He wrote the book and has been teaching for a long time- so he knows what he's doing. Definitely go over your notes and mechanisms before tests. Although it was a long lecture and early in the morning, his enthusiasm keeps you up.",1
"He is very strict. Don't ever think he would accept your excuses, for example, when you forget to bring i-clicker for the quiz, he'll NOT let you write the answers down and turn it in to make up for it. He simply just tell you that's what you get for forgetting to bring your i-clicker. His lectures were pretty good though. Very enthusiastic.",1
HE IS A NICE PROFFESOOR. HE MAKES THE LECTURES FUN. I RECOMMNED TO READ THE BOOK BEFORE THE EXAM AND MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT THE SLIDES! SOME QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE SLIDES.,1
"extremely nice professor! Class was kind of confusing, but the online homework really helped. Study what is on that to help with the tests. Easy assignments as well. Very glad I took the class with her, easy A.",1
"not bad at all.. very useful class if u are really interested in learning chemistry.. however, doesn't like to be asked too many questions and repeating same stuff over and over again...",1
He is really very nice to students.,1
Dr. Watts is a great professor. I started her class as a terrible writer and improved so much by the end of it. She provides many extra credit opportunities and lots of great feedback.,1
"Holcroft is an incredible teacher! She's funny and helpful. If you want to actually learn about Nutrition, take this class! You have to work for your A. Each week you do an extensive analysis of one part of your diet (carbs, protein, vitamins). Weekly quizzes that you can retake unlimited number of times. No final. Some discussion assignments.",1
"Great teacher and motivator. Used textbook a lot, along with lecture notes for exams. Took during summer and enjoyed the class, not easy but interesting and he made it fun.",1
"Opie as he likes to be called is readily available to help his students, who he wants to succeed. He gives his cell phone number so students can call him anytime they have a question, and he will spend hours explaining something until you understand it. He is personable, a great teacher, and a wonderful motivator. One of the best teachers ever.",1
"Dr. Brown , and Jason Marion is the best professor  EHS department ever have. I wish only them two will teach all the EHS classes especially the "" Vector"" class. I would definitely will pass if I take it with Dr. Brown Or Jason Marion because they will teach you clearly and they expect the result back. ",1
She is very chill and tends to end class early which I loved. My class was from 10 to 10:55 and I usually would end up leaving at 10:15 instead. The work was all participation so if you finished it you got 100%. The assignment were never anything you couldn't finish in 30 minutes. Just show up to class and turn the work in and its an easy A.,1
Great Professor. Just pay attention to the interesting lectures and read the book to get an A. Objective grading (just get a total score of 400 with all tests and homework for the A). Funny and fair with lots of extra credit. Would take again.,1
"Jon is a God in the theatre department. Everybody worships him. However, he gives everyone the same grade (B+) regardless of input.",1
AMAZING TEACHER! Very helpful. She expects a lot of her students but she is always their if you need her. Very knowledgeable on her subject and gives real life examples. Very interesting class!,1
Gives some work but its not too tough. Great teacher and enthusiastic,1
I would never in my life take this class again.. If you don't write your papers in his writing style then you can best believe you're not going to get a good grade in this class. He's rude and I did not find his lectures to be interesting. I would never in my life recommend this class to anyone... even if there aren't any other classes available.,0
"This is the most unorganized teacher I have ever taken in my life! We have (4) 4-5 page papers due within a 6 week time period. And she couldnt figure out how to work the online system for 3 of those weeks. She didnt even grade out first paper until one week before the summer term was over. If you are in unorganized student, you will not make it.",0
If you went into his class ready to do the work assigned than you did well.  His feedback is important so take his comments to heart  they will help you get a better grade.  LISTEN TO HIM! ,1
"You will do very well in this class if you have just come out of high school Algebra and are a A student. I found this instructor to be difficult because She didn't give out homework assignment right away. One time she didn't post the homework for eight hours. The second exam hours were written on the white board as 9AM-12, at 11:15 test stopped",1
Good lecturer but tended to repeat the same thing over and over in class. And her english is sometimes difficult to understand.,1
"Unfortunately these ""writing classes"" aren't graduate level. They have no standards except you write. Nothing is really evaluated on its merit (except you really really tried). Most students are Hallmark card level writers and that's just fine with the instructor... she's getting paid the same!",1
"Dr. Vutha is an amazing professor. He is very accessible outside lectures and genuinely cares about your success. Do the homework, utilize office hours to ask questions, and the class will go well, thanks to Dr. Vutha.",1
Professor Montanari is an amazing professor. I would gladly recommend her as an instructor and I would take her courses again. I learned a great deal from her instruction and her methods of assessment helped me to gain new skills and knowledge. She is a fair instructor and she works with her students. She is also incredibly organized.,1
"Amazing professor, this is the 3rd time I will be taking her, read, study. The quizzes are short and are time, mid term and final are also timed. one paper that is 5 pages long. she gives extra credit. Modules are straight forward. She will help you as much as she can, She goes above and beyond if you don't understand something. Take her!!!!",1
Makes you work terribly hard,1
"Profe Fletcher is literally one of the sweetest ladies ever. She is so understanding, and will do anything to accommodate you to make sure you get a good grade in the class. There is a ton of homework, but its really easy and just a matter of staying on top of it cause it can get overwhelming if you slack off. Exams are super easy.",1
"Dr. Feagin was by far the best professor I have ever had at Georgia Highlands. She spelled out exactly what she wanted for each assignment given. She gave an opportunity for an extra 20 points over all, and the study guides for the midterm and final were exactly what was needed to study. I plan on taking another of her classes in the spring.",1
"Not just for this class, this is an overall review for Dr. Kamau. In my opinion, Absolutely the best professormentor a student can have. Dr. Kamau truly cares about the success of his students and will help as long as you show a willingness to learn and be active in your own success. ",1
"Lynn talks excruciatingly slowly and the lectures are painful. She grades homework so harshly for absolutely no reason and doesn't explain things well AT ALL. I would rather drop out of college than take this class again. She made me cry on the first day and if you like yourself at all, don't take her class. You will fail.",0
"Excellent professor. Wants her to students to understand the course topics. However, Cotes grading strategy is hard to come to terms with. Double check your work! Also, a friendly tip will be: dont email her about a question you received no credit for on your exam or quiz, she will review your whole exam and maybe deduct more points.",0
"Candida was a great teacher, she is very open and willing to work with her students. She assigned about 10 papers (1-2 pages each). There is a required 15 hour volunteer assignment, so make sure you make time. Class attendance is a good idea, this class wasn't one I wanted to miss. The content of the class was interesting and opened my mind.",1
"Fabulous class! I learned so much from Prof. G, she is excellent at explaining difficult concepts and giving examples. Plan to take her for all classes I can.",1
"Philosophy honors with Dr. Cash honestly changed how I saw a lot of things. We had many open discussions as a class that were respectful and insightful. I am a slow reader, and so often fell behind because of all the mandatory readings. Tests are fair (mostly easy). Dr. Cash was engaging, respectful, and represented as many perspectives as he could",1
Very hard course for a 200 level course. A ton of reading as for the quizzes even though it is open book the questions are extremely tricky. The VOH sessions in general are completely useless they do not provide any relevant information. I would not recommend this course.,0
She's a babe.  She's funny.,1
"Upper level literature course on topic of ""the journey""--Waxler thinks life is a journey and literature is, too. Could be he's right. Risky business anyway. I dig it!",1
I haven't yet completed Prof. Engelhardt's Macro course but a lot of things people say below hold true with how I feel. One of my favorite professors so far at UWO. Doesn't bore you with PowerPoints and ties material with real-world events which in turn makes you better informed. He's caring and has really takes up on students' suggestions,1
"Professor Peters was an amazing professor for intro to psychology. Her class was not the easiest course, but it was by no means extremely difficult. For every exam, she is clear on what content is going to be on it. If you are unsure of anything, she always responds to emails to clarify. She is a very genuine and caring professor. TAKE HER!!",1
"Dr. Galileo is truly passionate about teaching and his research. This class is a lot of material and there is no curve either. However, if you memorize the slides, you should be able to receive an A. He is a really talented professor! Take this class :)",0
"Très long et plate, en plus de ça il n'est pas claire!",0
"I really like her as a person but I didnt care for this class.  She likes to write all over her Lecture slides and all over the white board during lecture, she was all over the place and throwing out too much info. She would write stuff out that you didnt need to know. But she is more than happy to help you if you ask for it.",1
Online Summer class. A lot of reading but most is interesting. Only one book review but so many long articles and lectures to read. Keep up with your work and email her for any problems. She's willing to help. I'm an average student and I received a B in the class. Over-all a good class. You'll learn a lot!!,1
"This course was very intense but is easy to pass if you dedicate a lot of time to the weekly assignments. The weekly assignments tended to be very time consuming, though.",0
Be prepared to work hard for your grade. You have to show up to class and only 25%  of the class showed up everyday. If you show up and do your homework then you will be fine. He gives a 20 point curve on tests and homework . He also allows a cheat sheet. If you enjoy a challenge then he is your guy.,1
"Mary is Great!  Very helpful, easy-going and encouraging.  She made Eng 240 fun and interesting.",1
"He was a pretty solid professor. His accent was not too bad, he's easy going, and he provided great reviews for the exams. As far as I can tell, he is hands-down the best option for 2450. Just make sure you get a good group for the semester project. That could make or break this class.",1
"Awesome having him for the introduction to computer science, he was great at teaching assembly and basic logic gate wiring.",1
"Comes off intimidating at first, but you realize it's only to rinse out the non serious participants. Once you get started he's an extremely funny, pedagogical and knowledgeable teacher/actor, who genuinely cares. A few of us in class became a core group who came back next semester for Act 2 only for him, but he doesn't teach every semester.",1
Makes class enjoyable by sharing experiences . Has many extra cred opportunities . Sometimes will follow a PowerPoint .,1
"She cares a lot about her students. She likes to know you by name. She has an extra credit opportunity before school even started for 242. That saved my butt. If you ask for help, she will help you. The Lectures are fun!",1
the man knows a lot about the ocean but his lectures are as boring as watching paint dry. His knowledge of technology is terrible and usually put the opposite of what he says will be on the exam. the funniest thing about him was that he put his office hours around the same time as the class we had. Nice guy but you can tell he doesn't want to teach,0
"This lady does not know how to cut any slack. She wants things done precisely with no room for error every time, and she tends to set unrealistic and frustrating deadlines.",0
"Professor is nice, but the TA is mean and doesn't help at all!",0
Excellent  teacher who takes the first part of the semester to cover the formation and basics of a contract and the second half on more specific pitfalls. Superb in-class experience and posts all PPTs online. Test is very manageable and posts old tests and rubrics for them online. Reviews info throughout semester to ensure understanding by all. ,1
"Very clear speaker, but you have to pay VERY close attention to his lectures. I love classics, but I have to say this class does nothing for me. Too many texts to read, and tests take a long time to write. There are also too many definitions to study, but that doesn't guarantee you'll see some ever on a test. He leaves off really important terms.",1
"He's informal and laid back, but super informed and intellectual.  My writing definitely improved a lot, as did my understanding of politics and how to read carefully.",1
"The worst ""professor"" I've had at UConn. Unclear expectations, no real lecturesfocus during class, nonsensical exams, rude attitude towards students, not conducive to learning at all. I gained nothing from this class, because we were not taught. The department should totally rethink her employment, as her students will graduate knowing nothing.",0
"Overall, I have enjoyed this class. Lee is very knowledgeable on the content area, and he seems genuinely interested in student learning. I feel I learned a lot from this course.",1
"If you have an 89 in the class, you will get a B instead of a B+.  I don't think that is very fair",1
She is humorous. I like going to her class to do different fun activities for language development methods. She is very organized and clear. Personable and approachable. Kind about any questions. Take her.,1
"TAKE HER. HANDS DOWN BEST, MOST HELPFUL, AND EASIEST PROFESSOR AT NOVA. SO FUNNY AND EASY TO TALK TO AND MAKE SPEECHES IN FRONT OF! took this class 3 times before with other professors and ended up dropping out because of the course load. AMAZING PROFESSOR LOVE HER",1
"Abdallah is amazing! Great teaching and examples, and he always encourages his students to succeed and does his best to do so. With such trying times, he keeps proving to be a great prof. It is obvious he is trying his best to help his students succeed while maintaining a reasonable amount of fairness and integrity.",1
TAKE HER CLASS! Most influential professor I've had my entire college career! She is so passionate about teaching & will help you understand a very difficult subject! Study her slides like the bible & dedicate 10+hrs/week to studying. Highly recommend!,1
He's a really good teacher. Lectures are fun and time goes by fast in the class. Would recommend.,1
"I took the full year shakespeare course and barely went to class. ended up with a 70. the lectures that i did go to were very entertaining. he's really funny and witty, he's definitely not a boring lecturer. however, the lectures were definitely too long. ",1
"Most people like him, he was ok but tests are extremely difficult, I'd go in knowing I was going to get an A and end up getting Cs and Bs. He even got mad at our class for having low test scores. I wouldn't highly recommend him if you're aiming for an A",0
very difficult for a 100 level class..he tells you too much material to study for the tests so its hard to know what to focus on..he says test will be on chapters 1 to 5 but then there is only 7 short essay/questions on the test..he also does not care about his students succeeding or not..if all you need it for is a gen ed..go somewhere else,0
"Reddy was great. The class moves fast, it covers a whole chapter each lecture. Every class except three throughout the whole term is a lecture, and theres very minimal homework. The material itself is definitely manageable, as long as you stay on top of your learning. The labs taught by grad assistants were genuinely fun, which is a plus!",1
"Woody is one of the coolest teachers at Saint Leo! He gives you the option of how you want your grades to be set up. If you at least try, the class shouldn't be hard at all. Not many group projects, but definitely a lot of in class group work. I'm not sure how any couldn't like him he's one of those teachers you always speak to outside of class.",1
This professor is a good professor but he gives a final exam with no information. Meaning after the midterm we did nothing but speeches and he DID NOT review any of the book but then turned around and gave a final exam the final exam was redundant and uncalled for but he would not cancel it. He expected us to read 4 chapters in 2 days long chapters,1
"This class was a bit difficult, but I got so much out of it! Prof. Mangone was amazing!! He was always available for you to talk with and really wanted students to understand the material. This class was one of the best I have ever take, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about RNA or research :)",1
"Prof Leung is one of the most caring professors I have had at University. I had him online due to the pandemic and he was always flexible with assignments and tests. He is lecture heavy, but the quizzes and tests are well formatted and he gives you A LOT of support.",1
Great Professor. Quizzes and Exams are from the lesson. Great lectures and notes that are easy to follow and understand. If you read you will pass.,1
He is such an amazing professor! I loved his class a lot. It was what I looked forward to every week. He is very helpful and loves his students. If you have a chance take his class he is an amazing professor!,1
"He seems like a very nice guy, but that truly does not outweigh the insane amount of classwork he gives each week. He is also completely inaccessible outside the classroom, and will take off 1% point from your final grade if you email him something that could be discussed at office hours. PSU offers a variety of ECON courses, TAKE ANOTHER ONE.",0
"Brad is a wonderful professor. He truly cares about your future and your experience as a student. He wants you to take away more from his class than just what's in the book; He wants you to become a leader. He will go above and beyond to help you succeed. There is no reason why you shouldn't do well in his classes. Also, he offers a lot of EC.",1
"I took this class purely out of my own interest in the subject (LGBTQ+ history) and she definitely didn't disappoint! All of the readings were incredibly interesting, her written out lectures were fantastic, and she made the class enjoyable, even through a computer. I'd definitely recommend this class!",1
"If you study the test reviews and your notes, you will do fine on tests. If you have questions, be sure to ask them. He's very helpful and willing to help you out if you ask. He wants you to know the material and not just memorize things.",1
"Best, BEST professor I've had here at Suffolk hands down.  Not even an art history major or minor, and I loved it.  Highly recommend taking his class.  Great guy!",1
The best voice professor ever. She transformed my voice. Shes old school and you cant be one of those sensitive types that gets offended over any kind of critique. Pay attention to her critique because she is going to make you a better singer. I absolutely love her! I went from a not so great singer to a powerhouse.,1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich fail to respond to your question in a timely manner and when he did finally respond the answer mada no sense to the question you had asked. I would not recommend this class unless you have no choice.",0
Dhavan is the best.  I LOVED this class.  Hot when he has a haircut :-*,1
"Eh. He's okay. He's not the best professor in the entire world. He's quirky and makes you think, but he won't tell you ANYTHING about a big project. He grades harsh and doesn't really tell you what he's even grading on. You can easily make a B. Always go talk to him in his office. He gives great feedback after your grade is out there.",1
"Very bad professor. Explains things without detail, expects you to understand the first time as if you already know the material beforehand. Extremely disrespectful to students during class (won't let you use the bathroom, condescending if you don't understand, etc.). Random pop quizzes and random homework checks can make or break your grade.",0
"Whispers during lecture, have to read the entire book to study for a test because you can't understand a thing he says.",0
"Dr. Russell is by far the most popular professor in the PSCI department, and for good reason. She is passionate in class and really works hard to make sure her students are not only learning the material but appreciating it as well. Overall, Dr. Russell is amazing and I would certainly take her classes again. (Beware: lots of reading though.)",1
"A quarter of the class withdrew, and half of what is left is failing extremely bad. AVOID AVOID AVOID. glad i withdrew when i did. horrible professor.",0
Lectures are hard to pay attention to b/c kinda boring. Tests were hard considering the class basically failed. NO CURVE. Iclickers so class is mandatory.,0
"Great instructor! Great stories from a public defender that are a learning experience. Make sure to attend class since all test material will be from lectures, no need to purchase textbook unless you want to. Best instructor and would recommend his class to all those that want to learn Criminal Law.A GREAT TEACHER, wish more were like you...",1
"class is ok, but maybe not graduate level",1
"doesnt take attendance which is awesome....basically your grade only depends on the 5 tests over the semester, you pass those your fine..homework is easy,he goes over it in class and you can get your answers there and i loved that he gave you credit on tests for trying even if you got the wrong answer, but he was really softspoken hard to hear",0
"Very clear lecturer, excited about statistics. Does have an ego but you don't interact with him much anyway. If you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters, you'll do well on the exams. Put in the work and you'll learn Stats. I understand the subject so much better now. Take this class, you won't regret it.",1
"I loved the fact that we watched films that I really hadn't heard about, but were really good. Our second essay was hard, but somehow I loved it. Honestly, the semester was EPIC!",1
"He is mean to the students taking his class, vague while presenting his lectures (at times reading off the slides directly or editing his slides on the spot), and inconsistent in his teaching.  While emphasizing the importance of responsibility, it took him over two months to grade our papers and exams. Each week was a new excuse. Avoid",0
Scanlon gave us a decent introduction to poetry analysis. It's hard to get accustomed to literature analysis. I recommend recording his talks so you can listen to them again and again. He is straight forward but it takes time and effort to adjust to this mode of thinking.,1
"Excellent blend of lectures, reading, templates and industry professional guests. He is very helpful and provides excellent templates for budgets and schedules. It's sometimes unclear how to get to the data you fill in to the templates but he will help you! Group projects may drag you down in grade or make extra work if your team is lame. Good guy!",1
Only a few weeks into the semester and she is literally the best teacher I've ever had in college! She is understanding of us college students and our lives. She deserves an award. So far I am actually understanding and more in depth into the subject because is not a stickler about due dates. We need more professors that care like her!,1
"Dr. Holtan is an excellent teacher! She's caring and makes lecture very fun and interesting.  There isn't a ton of homework, and I didn't open the book once so don't get it. As long as you take decent notes in class, and put in work on the projects you'll do great. The final project is really difficult though, but she helps you through it.",1
"This class was on the holocaust and we had to watch/ read/ think about some really horrible things that have happened. There were lots of quizzes on language and key terms/ concepts, too. Catherine was really good about telling us expectations and was so thoughtful about the material. It made a shi*ty subject a lot easier. Earned my respect 100%.",1
"This class required a lot of reading and studying. Dr. Schwartz recommended 2-3 hours of study time per day; there is a lot of material to learn. If you put the time and effort into his class, you will do well. He gave extra credit on every lab pratical. Ask questions and participate as he awards extra points for it.",1
"Such a sweetheart and says lots of funny stuff. Her class is test heavy but she is not trying to trick you, go back over your HW problems and you will do great. She is always willing to help, and will spend an entire class answering questions is she has to. Highly recommend, I actually found her class to be more fun than I thought it would be.",1
She is my all time favorite,1
Really great teacher! He is very passionate about economics and will always do his best to help you. The homework is directly related to the tests but definitely make sure you take good notes too.,1
"Great teacher, thanks to him I enjoy reading now.",1
boring,0
"Julie is very laid back and cares very much about her students. She brought lots of real-world experience to teaching my section of GPS which I appreciated. She's accessible outside of class, and even if it's not office hours she's always welcoming if you just drop by her office for a chat. Super nice person, very understanding and caring!",1
"Professor Anderson is great. His class is lecture based with short readings assigned. He shows some cool comedy skits that relate to the material. If youre uncomfortable discussing and thinking critically about religion, dont take his philosophy course. Pay attention and participate. He will fail you if you are frequently absent, so show up.",1
The books could be very difficult if you don't have a philosophy background. He got off topic really easy and it was difficult to know what you should be learning. He doesn't review materials before he gives it to you so there were entire books we read and movies we watched  that he eventually didnt grade on. But very knowledgeable.,1
I dropped the class on the first day because he doesn't let you wear a hat.,0
"Great teacher, there if you have questions",1
Native speaker. Upbeat personality. Very engaging. Uses Harry Potter and fashion shows to teach.,1
"Bob is an extremely helpful professor. Not only did he help me with my writing as a professor, but has remained a mentor. I'd call him a friend of mine. He's wonderful at lecturing, gives great material to read, and leads the best workshops that I've ever been a part of. If you're interested in creative writing at IU, take his class",1
She cleared everything up about the whole extra tution charges..,1
"Best professor I have had at Towson so far.  Very clear and decisive on work and tests.  Actually really learned a lot of the material.  You can pass the class without attending, however, you will not receive a good grade.  I studied pretty hard and ended up with an A-.  Very good professor, would take again.",1
"He is an immature caveman and I love it. He is loud and obnoxious, but he cares more than anyone I've ever met- both for the subject and you. He realizes that his material is hard and does everything he can to help. He acts like a real human being.",1
"Hard not to pass! She gives 6 quizzes (provides an outline with all of the answers) and 4 essays, minimum 500 words, easy grader.",1
"Professor Sieber likes to connect with you. Her lectures and notes cover what will be on the test. She gives you a study guide for each test, but read the chapter as well. It isn't an easy A, so be prepared to read. She is very understanding when it comes to personal issues. I would take her again if I could because she was so fun!",1
"I was a little nervous in taking a math class online. The mandatory forums and his videos took a short time for me to get used to. I just did all the homework and meet deadlines. The forums and videos is very helpful, the website for the class is very helpful as well. Overall, a great and fair teacher. Signed up for his MATH60 and Im so ready for i",1
Trust me. AVOID. Worst experience ever.,0
"Very old school style professor. Super knowledgeable and helpful when you approach him, but expect a lot of work to be done.",1
"Lectures do not help for tests, but he is a great guy and won't put you to sleep all the time(I mean the material is boring he does what he can)",1
"Goes over material pretty fast.. you can do well in the class if you read the book thoroughly and study a lot. The TA's were pretty horrible, and I'm pretty sure they made up the midterm/final...",0
I have had three classes with Prof. Tang and have loved every single one of them! She's a fair grader and genuinely wants people to do well. She pushes ideas in class and challenges students because she wants you to flesh out your thoughts more. She knows theory like no other and is amazing. One of the best professors I've ever had.,1
"Dr. Lee is such a nice person but I would not take his class again. His exams are so hard, I failed every one. HIs lectures don't help, you are basically teaching yourself. Nobody even shows up to class. You have to read the chapter before class and that doesn't even help. Maybe tutoring would have helped me. HARDEST CLASS, PICK SOMEONE ELSE!",0
"She's knowledgeable about her area of expertise and is available to help for the most part, however, she does not particularly care for student opinions unless they agree with hers, and I agree with the poster below, she is big on attendance.",1
"Took him for lab. All the work is done in groups, including the midterm, final and all tests and quizzes. Open notes, open book and you can work with a partner. Easily approachable, laid back guy. Hes actually surprisingly very funny if you listen to what he says. Not much else to say, Id take him again.",1
"This class is such a good class if you are interested in film. Not an easy A but its not impossible just expect work. Brent knows SO much about film and is a really good teacher. You will have homework every week but most often it is enjoyable plus 2 big papers. You watch lots of clips and a few films expect to participate, he will make/call you.",1
shes great! very clear in speaking and understanding. she does try hard to be friends but thats what makes her good,1
"This was my first time taking accounting and he made it so easy to understand. I would definitely take him again! Class is not mandatory, but his lectures are easy to follow and making learning accounting very straight forward. He is an amazing professor!",1
"Professor Fazelpour's lectures are very condescending, he seemingly talks down to the class and has a hard time articulating his words and some parts of the lecture are hard to understand due to a harsh accent. Sets seemingly arbitrary rules for homework assignments and passes the buck on any mistakes he makes when it comes to the class in general.",0
"Straight Up Awesoem Dude, made learning fun!!!",1
I took scientific inquiry for science majors. It was very easy and watered down. PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS because this stuff is applicable in later life. Don't just take this class to get it out of the way,1
"She doesn't teach anything, gives homework every night but doesn't check it until halfway through the year when all the assignments are due, she usually doesn't know your name and you can skip but you won't pass the tests, I wouldn't recommend, getting an A was a struggle.",1
"Prater requires you to do the work.  I've taken her for 312 and 313, because I actually learn accounting in her class.  She doesn't go solely from power point and will explain things in different ways until you understand what she's saying.  Be prepared to work, but if you're in college, you should be used to that.",1
"take chem of cooking. the class is easy and dr vohs is very good. fun,easy class. not enough cooking though.",1
"she talks too fast and speeds through her slides. I often answered her questions in class and went to her office and i still failed. She doesnt care about what you have going on outside of her class, and she doesnt like to help you. She allows 15 minutes per student in her office, and isnt even there half of the time. Avoid this professor!!!!",0
Professor Leung's lectures were not the most interesting but he really cares about his students and is enthusiastic about teaching. The first exam was difficult but the second two were easier because he'll even show you some of the material from the test before you take it. He records attendance every day even though it doesn't count for anything.,1
"The way homework is setup is awful, if you get a question right then try another one for practice it take's away from your hw grade. The hw also is graded week of unlike better professors that let it all be open till the end of the course. Instead of using the regular software for test he make's you use zoom so he can watch you which is odd.",0
I loooved this class and I am sooo thankful for this professor. He used the class participation grade to round UP my class from a B to an A and that was the difference of me getting into UF!!! I reccomend his class.,1
He took my passion for sociology and turned it into a gray world full of boringness and dullness. He's a good lecturer but gosh I wanted to run from his class everytime,1
"I wish I could take another class with him. ece 368 is pretty hard, but this is what made me appreciate him even more - he's good at teaching one of the hardest and essential classes in ece. He really cares for students and their learning. Definitely takes a little getting used to (aka you might not like him at the start, but that will pass)",1
He was a pretty interesting. Very intelligent but looks disheveled all the time. Easy class as long as you take notes on what he says. Exams were easy and based off what he says in class pay attention and you wont have any problems. He is also repetitive so you If you missed something he is likely to tell you again next class.,1
Nothing about her classes are designed to help students succeed. Her online courses are rough if you're also working full time. I would rather do just about anything than take another of her classes.,0
"Teaches by saying ""Look at your notes."" No help when questions are asked. If you have a good grasp on the subject before the class, he is fine. Not too much homework. If you do not know calculus 2, do not take him.",0
"He is a horrible teacher, he doesnt try to help students. His grading is very harsh, i would suggest a different teacher",0
"Tests are very straight forward, almost identical to the practice exams he gives. ",1
Awful. Seems to think their class is the most important or something. Doesnt seem to realize there are students taking 5 classes and still assigned a 10-12 page research paper. Wish I never took their class.,0
"Unexpectedly, I had a great time in Phil1. I am neither interested in Philosophy, nor a good writer. Still, I enjoyed professor's McConnel's class. He is an easy grader and always willing to help. The class discussions were always interesting. However, you might find yourself spacing out. He is disorganized, so don't take his class if you hate that",1
"Fun class, she is an excellent teacher and really encourages students to particpate and learn about french culture. It is not overly difficult, but you must study outside of class to retain the material. She truly cares about student progress. Wouldn't be difficult without previous French, but any experience prior to the class is helpful.",1
"She seemed cheerful and exciting the first day, then quickly became more arrogant. Especially if you didn't know exactly how she wanted problems worked, which she didn't explain at all. I'm a straight A student majoring in math, and i got a C in her course because she refused to help and only got smart when i asked her something. Avoid at all costs",0
"Steve is my all-time favorite instructor. I went on to Uni after this and he's twice as good as any other teacher I've had. I wish so much that he would teach my Uni classes. He assigns a good amount of homework, but not too much. Just enough to make you learn. His lectures make sense. He truly cares about teaching.",1
"Consider yourself lucky if you get her for 250. Very knowledgeable and passionate about OB. Makes you want to come to class and makes it fun!  Her lectures prep you for exams and she genuinely cares about your experience (lecture and clinical). To sum it up, she rocks!",1
Reads directly off the slides and does not do class examples. Uses Minitab which only people with PCs can use and it is not offered by the school. Teaches coarse through minitab but tests students using equations. Half of the the test is multiple choice and have no connection with statistics. Gives no reference material to help study for the final.,0
First of all its hard to understand what she is trying to say because her English isnt very good. She makes things harder than they needed to be. Yes she lets you use all your notes and past homework on exams but they are not helpful at all,0
"Excellent teacher. Very organized, funny and interesting. You will learn in this class, but your grade will not be handed to you. If you attend class and apply yourself you will enjoy this class.",1
"Professor Marshall was probably my favorite professor at State. The books she chose were interesting and we even watched a few films that were enjoyable. She never put down anyone's opinion and was helpful when it came to essays. If I had had the opportunity, I would've taken her again. :)",1
"She is great!! There is alot of reading in this class, but if you go to class you will get at least a B or an A on the test with out ever reading the book. She offers alot of extra credit pts. It was a great class, lots of fun, and very intresting. Pretty easy class!",1
"He's ok. He cares about people participating to an annoying extent. If he learns your name, he's going to call on you a lot. There are a lot of iclicker quizzes. He teaches the class well, but the homework can be frustratingly and disproportionately more difficult than the examples provided in class. They're worth a large chunk of your grade.",1
"Took him for intro to communications. Nice helpful guy. You write 4 out of the 6 papers he assigns and two of them we had were on Top Gun and Rocky. and you do have quizzes and a group project, but honestly not that hard. I dont know about English, but for Comm, i would suggest him to anyone!",1
"took intro to public speaking saturday mornings. class was done in 8 weeks instead of 12. she graded very easily. class activities were fun, videos boring. her voice was screechy some days, but her hotness made up for it.",1
"Too difficult for ENG100, *few* students got As.  Would not allow you to improve your paper's grade to show progress, instead on the next paper have you improve that criteria, but knock you down with another new one.  Endlessly talks in lecture and is ultra redundant, seems to love his own voice.  Class was *so* boring it made everyone seem dreary.",1
"This teacher doesn't require textbooks for this class, with that said expect to have art supplies, and spend some money. The projects aren't hard but just time consuming, in one project you can easily spend up to 24 out of class hours on one project. Teaches useful principles to art design regardless of degree field. A great class to take.",1
"Teacher was kinda annoying. Lectures felt really rehearsed (and not in a good way) and he seemed really into himself. Took this class in high school but didn't take the AP exam so I already knew most of this so if you're not an absolute beginner, don't take this class. There are extra credit opportunities (3) and tests were easy (3). No final.",1
"Entire class is based on a group project - unfortunately, I had the worst group. Projects are okay, there was one term paper and a few other assignments (not anything crazy) but like I said entire class is based on your one group project. If you get a good group, you'll be good to go. Marking criteria is not clear / no real schedule to the class",0
"Took her for Psy2012 she's super nice! If you hate people with an accent do not take her... lol she has a really bad accent but i really enjoyed her class! I took her 6 week class and unless your good at writing essays do not take the 6 week with her, its way too fast! but overall  her class was pretty easy.. notes are extremely important!",1
Who has two thumbs and makes chemistry more difficult than it needs to be?? Dr. Evans. He is soo tough he barely ever talks and uses hand gestures to get his point across. Usually he just grunts and picks up things because he is unusually strong. He kept getting stronger during classes and began to smash things. I think he was also turning green.,0
"One of my top 3 teachers. I had her for Fairy Tales and Fables and I wish I was allowed to take that class again. The class was a very open discussion about concepts and it was a class that we could think in. Only had 3 essays throughout the class, and we had plenty of time to think them out. She's so sweet, and very easy going. Loved this class",1
"She has odd rules, like you can't ask questions after class about the lecture, instead come in for office hours. Her voice always sounded condescending to me, like she was teaching elementary school instead of college. At the same time, her explanations are partially mumbled and said as if she assumes we already learned the material. Would avoid.",0
"Candida is an absolutely amazing teacher.  You get one point a day for saying something.  It doesn't have to be much.  She respects you and understands you are busy.  Very inspirational class, changed my viewpoint.  Candida is great, the course is great, the interaction is best!   Not much reading, you should just go to class!",1
"Easy class if you follow his rules. Make everything JUST LIKE THE OUTLINE- I cannot stress this enough. Speeches are easy; just follow the outline, careful with time, and practice. He makes the class feel very supportive. You don't have to be a good speaker to do well. The syllabus and outline examples will be your best friends. Take good notes!!",1
Professor Fultz's class was exceptionally great! I recommend taking his class.,1
The entire class is basically test taking. She is not a terrible teacher but doesnt go easy on grading.,1
"Awesome teacher, couldn't wait until class started, had him for summer semester and he was very chill. Easy class, homework can be a pain in the butt sometimes, but the class is definitely worth it!",1
"He is a super easy professor, but he will put you to sleep so fast. He gives a good amount of writing assignments, but they are all really simple. Lots of grades so it is easy to make an A. Requires attendance. He let me redo a paper that I did bad on and then he gave me full credit. Nice guy, just boring.",0
"STRICT! be there for class EVERY DAY (i took it in school). Not too hard to get a B. make sure your speeches are in the time limit, dress appropriately. follow directions and you should be good on speeches. P.S. She likes when you wear a tie during a speech.",1
Amazing guy,1
"Dr. Reddy is great! The course is hard, but if you go to class and review the exams from previous years you can do well exams. Her lectures are awesome.",1
"Hysterical professor. Tests are super difficult, and there is no study guide. But he gives EC clicker questions. And he divides 3 exams by 300 points (100 each). But he then adds the extra credit to the grades. So you could have a 60 average, and end up with an A if you went to class every day. Awesome professor who is genuinely interested!!",1
"His class was challenging, but it really taught me so much. If you don't understand something, go to his office hours. He is always there to help and will definitely be one of my fav. profs. ",1
Not at all understanding of missing class. It is a pandemic and life happens but to him nothing should be more important than his class. Often did not explain assignments clearly. Ignored students email. If you were oh so lucky to get an email then all he'll tell you is to look at the syllabus.,0
Avoid. You may be on her spit list before you even set foot in the class.,0
I took Professor Errico for Accounting during Summer A and I regret my decision. There are MULTIPLE times that Professor Errico did not have a clue how to do the problems and students had to correct her. I recommend going to her youtube channel BEFORE choosing her class to see if you can handle taking her class. Maybe this was just a bad semester?,0
"Oftentimes she will have a group assignment she will post on Canvas in the middle of a lecture. If you're at home sleeping or don't have a group, you will lose a lot of points in the class. She also requires you to attend three events outside of class - do not fake these, she will catch you.",1
Prof Mantell is super sweet. Lecture is VERY boring. She does read from the PowerPoints posted in canvas so if you miss class a lot & review them and take notes you should have a good understanding. 4 exams & online quizzes she drops the lowest test grade.,1
The essays assigned are almost impossible to get an A in. The essay prompts are also poorly written. His expectation on said essays is very different from just about everyone's previous writing styles (which he will deduct points for).,0
She made me want to drop out of college and move to another country.,0
"This is the absolute most disrespectful person I have ever had to encounter. Extremely rude, unsympathetic, and name calls. Completely unprofessional, and you need to have some proof that you were tardy else she will mark you as unexcused absent causing your grade to be potentially affected. Avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"His lectures are funny, but no need to attend. Graded on 4 main projects. Group projects graded more leniently, but the two projects done alone are really harsh. Tries to be Cool Guy, occasionally succeeds. Makes weirdly sexist remarks, tried to convince class that female brains are physically different, which makes them good at feminine stuff.",1
The class was so hard. He graded the paper so hard i withdrew his class right after midterms. i don't recommend him,0
"I had to take two classes with this teacher. The first semester all he gave us were two reading assignments with papers, providing little to help your grade if done poorly on them. Also his comments on papers are confusing and not helpful. With this teacher, be prepared to use sources such as smartthinking to help you and to work hard without help.",0
"Really good professor. It's kind of an interesting class and she posts handouts on the website before lectures, which makes note-taking a lot easier. She is kind of absent-minded, though, especially with the electronics in the lecture hall. But overall, straightforward class and with a litte bit of effort, you should do well.",1
"Vraiment un bon prof, il est calme, posé et sait de quoi il parle. Il faut cependant participer en classe et rester à l'écoute quand il parle. Les examens sont faisable et représente bien la matière enseignée. Si vous l'avez, gardez-le mais allez en cours! la participation est importante",1
"SHE IS SO GOOD!!! She has some real industry experience that a lot of students could really benefit from, she lectures very well and honestly, is one of the best. You will have to work for your grade but it's so worth it!",1
was this a class or how to follow directions? First of all if you miss one question on the hw she doesn't give you credit also if you take out your phone you have to leave for the day and cant take the test or quiz. there is like a test everyday I didn't really end up learning a lot you have to buy like 8 books I would not take her again. ,1
Mr. Kraft is a really great teacher. I feel like I learned more from him than any other English teacher in my educational career. He is very caring and gives plenty of opportunities to be successful.,1
I love this professor!! Best I've had so far at UB. You won't regret taking any of her lectures!!,1
"One of my favorite Professors now. Incredibly caring about his students. Lectures are all a fun conversation with the whole class. Very reading/writing intensive, but he understands life happens and is flexible with you. Emphasis on flexible!! Hes funny and makes you feel like hes your friend. I learned SO MUCH in his class. Shoutout Dr. Cash.",1
"Ok wow I can't stand how she talks, so boring, and her online quizzes are pointless. Also, her whole participation grade is CRAP because its only if you show up or not. So if you're deathly ill for two weeks she'll give you a Zero... so basically you can show up and sleep in class and get a 20/20 she friggin sucks... i will never take her again",0
"She's really sweet but she's a tough grader. No matter how well everyone did, no one got an A on any exam. If you participate in the class often you should be fine. She won't fail you as long as you try but she isn't an easy A.",1
"Very hard to understand. Seemingly doesnt know how to use technology, reads off of slides, and gives little to no instruction for assignments (even exams). Took the joy out of art history and most of my brain cells. Definitely would avoid this prof.",0
This is my second time in college (going back for another field) and this was honestly the most difficult class I've ever taken. She gives an unreasonable amount of homework and her tests were totally unreasonable. They're all short essay questions and about 30?/test. She is a very slow grader so you don't always know where you stand grade wise.,0
Amazing,1
"Amazing professor!  Very well versed in his field.  Lectures are fun, energetic, sometimes a little too ridiculous.  Although, his tests are not easy and you do have to read a few chapters from the book.  Highly recommended.",1
"Kathy Jesse expects alot out of her students, but is very helpful and enthusiastic about the subject. Easy to get along with, and will work with you to catch up on missed assignments or tests.",1
"Teaches the class like it's some 6 unit 400 level class... very hard exams and quizzes. Her lectures often have nothing to do with quizzes and exams and just feel like a waste. So if you are unlucky to take this class, get ready to teach yourself.",0
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
"Don was pretty intimidating at first, but he's a really nice guy. He's really quick witted and he makes a concerted effort to learn about his students. I took personal finance with him. The material wasn't particularly difficult, but I found the midterms to be hard because they're very detail heavy. Tough marker but his expectations are clear.",1
"Thought I was good w/ grammar b4 this class. Such a nice lady, knows her stuff, but not a gr8 grammar prof. Unless you are prepared to be confused 24/7, take someone else. I was only able to make an A because she is gr8 about partial credit + HW, and projects are pretty easy. Beware of exams and quizzes. Would def enjoy her for any other class.",1
she is great,1
Excellent Knowledge about security,1
This class was probably easier to understand then the other religion class but you had to take notes on the lecture because that's where her questions come from for her tests.,1
Professor Luallen is fantastic. So clear and enthusiastic. One of my best professors. Tests are hard though.,1
"If you're actually interested in learning, do not take her class. Doesn't have the in depth knowledge to explain the material well or derive stuff. Was telling in the class how hard the grad school was and how she was getting pretty poor grades. However if you just want to get an easy course without needing any proper deep understanding, she is ok.",0
"I doubt if we were in an English class because half of the all blog responses are to be in English 150 points, the final project in English 100 points, the annotated bibliography  100 points also in English. He does not respond to emails, has blank assignments which he grade at the end of the semester. Can't even speak French himself!",0
"Phil really cares about all of his students and wants you to understand how real businesses work. He bought us all ice cream and organized different things for us to do, like working out at 9 rounds or volunteering at the zoo. 10/10 would recommend",1
This class made learning psychology more interesting. There's a weekly discussion. Each chapter has practice questions that you have to do. That can be tedious. There's a test every Thursday. Overall the class is an easy A. The professor also responds quickly to any questions.,1
"Brilliant teacher for those who can hear him. I'm sure it's frustrating if you can't. Keep an open mind, ask questions, and really try to understand what he is getting at! You will learn as much as the openness of your mind allows.",1
He is a great professor. He knows how to find ways to make the material stay in our memory. He is really the best of the best. You get a A in his class by paying attention. His study guides are helpful.He gives extra credits and gives you an idea on what it might be. Take him if you want to  get a good grade and learn at the same time.,1
Very fun class. Easy assignments and fun lectures.,1
"He was difficult until I figured out his style, then he became predictable and easy.  The only hard part was the 12-15 page paper he wants for each class.",1
"Great professor!  She is not always clear in answering question or explaining problems, but as long as you pay attention and attend class, you should be fine.  She gives you study guides and reviews before the tests which are very helpful.  For a person who had already taken Calculus in high school, this class was a breeze!",1
DON'T TAKE HIM!!!! Unless you wanna fail... Lots of studying outside the class for the exam since the explanation in the class is not that useful... although I attended all his classes and recorded the lecture on my phone to make sure not to miss anything and studied really hard for the exam I still got a C with a lot of hard work...,0
"Highly recommend, Prof West is awesome! Took course previously with a different professor and went from F to an A. West does everything he can to help students pass and is available for help outside of class. Miss class, you'll easily fall behind and won't pass. Don't need textbook -keep handouts, take notes. No homework, 4 tests, entertaining lect",1
Easy class. I hate public speaking but she doesn't critique you too hard. If you do the assignments you will get an A. 1 midterm and 1 final. Very easy A,1
"Definitely a fantastic professor. only set back is that he is extremely politically biased, which can make class uncomfortable for those with different views than his. Other than that, he's a total grammar nut and will drill you with grammar and style rules during free time in class. Took him for 2 classes.",1
Professor Leung is my favorite teacher I've had class with at DU.  His classes were always entertaining and he is more interested in a student learning something from his class than their grade.  His tests are fair and his power points are so thorough I never used my textbook.  Wish all my business math classes had been taught by him.,1
Very great teacher. she relates a lot to real life so you understand alot of what she says. shes more a co-student than a teacher which helps her be a great teacher.,1
"He is one of the best professors I have ever taken. Leaving his class was so hard because the whole class felt like a family. He is very understanding and caring, he's also funny. I loved the environment he created for our class and I never wanted to miss a day for that class. I learned so much from him. He's just an amazing human being.",1
great teacher,1
"he is really a great professor, he explains things in such a way that you just understand it so well.  I really wish he could teach all of my math courses and i certainly encourage anyone to take his class.",1
"Project-based, but she helps you understand and do part of the projects within class. You don't really have to read the book and it's free online.",1
"Great professor, really enjoyed the class. Its not an easy A by far, but if you go to lecture and pay attention to the powerpoints (which he puts online) youll get an A. Midterm exam and research paper final for Poli-sci methods.",1
"Good guy, bad professor. He asks very passive aggressive questions and makes students feel bad when they dont have the same political views as him. He cancels class a lot, and his lectures are very long, boring, and repetitive. Easy grade for busy work and can find answers because he doesnt teach what is on the tests.",0
Yo this guy is the man!!! I love Prof Field. Suck up to him and he will love you. I just kind of chill at his office hours for funsies. <3 him best professor and easy as hell. Plus he's really funny and is a great lecturer. Take him im serious.,1
Nice lady but her demands for the class are overwhelming. I'm a science major and her class took up more than half my life and was more unnecessarily demanding than my other classes. Work isnt tough but extremely time consuming and tedious. shes a tough grader so get ready to rewrite everything all the time and never feel sufficient,1
"Whatsoever, DO NOT take him as your prof. Biggest procrastinator i have ever seen in my life. Took 8 weeks to grade 2 assignments. No feedback on time and doesn't reply to emails for up to 4-5 days, sometimes never.",0
"I didn't think I would enjoy Philosophy, but he helped a lot. He's full of energy and is there for you if you need extra help. You'll easily get an A if you attend class and pay attention to what he says in class. Quizzes and tests are really easy. I would take him again.",1
Challenging class but I like the subject.,1
Dr. Harris is a wonderful teacher and made my first year of eartraining a wonderful experience.  He really works to help you when there is a problem.  Just do your work and you'll be fine.,1
hot nerd surfer. good teacher. Cabrillo college has an AMAZING music department... and a sh*t load of badass equipment accessible to all types of music people.,1
"Ana is by far one of the sweetest, most caring teachers at Chapman. All she wants is for her students to learn and succeed. She is very understanding and will accept late work if there is a valid reason. I would definitely recommend taking Spanish with her.",1
Do not take this professor. She is a tough grader and quick to give out zeros to her students. She does not respond to emails and she is not approachable and will give you attitude if you need to talk to her about something. She is not a fair professor at all.,0
"Professeur très compétent, tjrs dispo pour éclairer ses étudiants. C'est vrai que ses powerpoints ne sont pas très bien construits et que son ton de voix est assez monotone, mais il n'est pas un animateur tv et ses pp sont là pour aider à étudier, pas pour remplacer les notes perso. ARA1001, ARA1002, ARA2001, POL2840 : je le trouve vraiment bon.",1
Nice guy but not a good teacher. He did not reach me and didn't make an attempt to do so.,0
This online class was horrible.  He was not helpful and you have to do rediculous amounts of work and still can barley pass the class,0
"He talks very loud and fast, and for me personally is hard to take lecture notes. If you don't take notes be prepared to read and do some research. ",0
"I really like Kathy, and I enjoyed this class, but it's not easy. A lot of reading, a lot of homework, and a lot of tests. On the plus side, there are also cool field trips.",1
"Senora Pilkington is a very kind professor. If you took a couple of years of Spanish in HS, you will be fine. She will get you up to speed if you feel rusty. Keep up with the homework and ask questions and you should receive an A.",1
His Intro Biology class is very hard. He told class that if you need help study he would help. when I was failing the class I went to his office a few times. He just went over the tests it didn't really help me. Hard for him to explain things. Most of the time in class we just take notes which aren't very helpful for the test. Withdrawal the class.,0
Professor Qualls is a fantastaic Professor. He requires much from his students.  He will teach his students how to really think as well as write!,1
This teacher is definitely the worst I have ever had going to this school. I took this class online and it was nearly impossible. The homework and test questions did not reflect her slides or the book. She was amazing at pulling questions out of thin air. She also would answer emails asking for help with snide remarks. AVOID HER IF POSSIBLE!,0
I took Stephens for Shakespeare.  The material covered in class is not hard.  What's hard is that Stephens likes to ask juvenile trick questions on her tests to lower the scores.  It's damn near impossible to get an 'A' on any of her papers (I only managed 2 A's) because she is always extremely vague when explaining what she wants.,1
"Will shows interest in his students and is overall a nice prof, but lecture content can be boring. There are fun field trips tough. The course has a lot of group projects, papers, and academic readings. Engage with your peers, improve your writing, and keep up with the weekly readings to succeed. Tests are all multiple choice.",1
"Hard work pays off in every class except for this one. If you can't sleep during the night, show up to his class and he will put you to sleep with his lectures. If you can't read, no need to worry because he will read the powerpoint slides for you for the entire class.",0
I took Professor Carson for English 1101 and 1102 because he was such a great teacher! He is very kinda and sweet to all of his students. He is pretty chill and funny too. If I could take him again I would. His class is very easy as well. Easy grader. I made an A both semesters.,1
He is truly amazing! You will be doing short quizzes weekly. They are helpful for th e midterm and final. Make sure to study those well and understand the labs as they help with the final exam. he really knows what he's doing and makes the materials fun and understandable. Take him if you can!!,1
"Excellent professor.She goes over exactly whats gonna be in the test.the only thing dont be absent to her class. I got an A+ in her class, gives lots of extra credits.TAKE HER!!!",1
"Professor Lhota is SOOO sweet! She will help you any way she possibly can, is understanding if you have to miss class, and loves to review your work and help you fix it. Easy A if you give it a little effort. One of my favorite professors at ASU.",1
"I took Professor Yetman four years ago during my first semester at NJIT. Great guy and really knows the material. On a personal level he is also a friend to all students and will help you on any subject that you are stuck on, he is pretty much like an advisor to students throughout their degree years and as for FED, best one to teach it at NJIT.",1
"Really good professor in class and lecture was interesting. However, the way she weighs the grades of the assignments. I understood everything in class as well as the readings, did really well on the midterm and final, but ended up barely passing because the only 2 papers we had were worth 60% of grade, midterm and final only 15. Unclear feedback.",1
"Ann Mantell is a very sweet lady! The reason I got a C was completely on me, I skipped class every time unless there was a test. Although if she made attendance mandatory I would have been more motivated to show up. Overall, if you take this professor just dont skip class cause it will be extremely hard to learn the material on your own.",1
"She is a very knowledgeable person who makes the class active and engaging, especially by talking about her own experiences. However, the amount of material in this class is insane and she moves through the slides very quickly. The midterms are hard because there is so much to remember for only about 40-50 questions, making studying so stressful.",1
gr8 teacher very easy,1
Had Dr. Jennings for several graduate courses. His wealth of knowledge is unbelievable.I learned more from him than any other professor I've had for over 240 credits of college course work.,1
"Won't tell you your final grades. Makes you do impossible math equation to figure it out. Tough grader. Says out loud ""4 people are failing"" won't tell you directly. Causally said 7 in last class failed. 5 people I know changed majors after her. Art isn't creative, it's a chore in her class. Homework given like you don't 5 other classes. Avoid her.",0
Macro is difficult but his help and encouragement really made a difference for me.,1
"Dr. Stein is amazing. Easily the best professor I have had here at UT. Very engaging lectures, his exams are the basics of the material so he doesn't try to trick you. He is a lot of fun and can be really funny.",1
"Dr. O'Leary is nice but I do not like the way he teaches after having to take 3 of his classes. Lectures are confusing, The homework is ripped from the textbook and often unrelated to the lectures. The exams are long and only easy because he allows the students to take the answers into the exam. He actively discourages learning.",0
"If you care about cognitive psych, take this class with someone else. If you don't care about cognitive psych, find another class--don't suffer through this one. He tends to spend 5-10 on slides with less than 15 words on them. Know the studies, or better yet, just don't take this class with him.",0
"Leonard is wilin' at all times. Beware of the first essay exam. He's a tough grader with that. Seriously, though, just show up to class and do the homework. Raise your hand. He might cop a 'tude with you, just ignore it. He's a sassy little guy. He will say no wrong answers, but let me tell you, there are for him. Take the class, though.",1
She is the worst,0
No Comments,1
"Laura is a very easy to understand, probably most likable person in all the TIM school. Even though this class does require a little studying, it is fairly easy and I would recommend it to anyone.",1
"I have taken 2 classes (I am going to take my 3rd one) w.her and although shes not completely easy she's the best teacher I have had at UF. If you do all ur work u will get an A. Extremely Fair, Easy to Talk To, and Very Nice. I love her and recommend everyone to take her classes.",1
Sheila is fabulous! I took an accelerated online class. It was so easy! You get 5 assignments and 2 exams. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. My only complaint is I wish I hadn't bought the book. Her notes and resources are certainly enough to get an A on the exams.,1
Marchetti is awesome - really made me work but I was ready for the next class.  Could watch her lectures over and over because she posts them online.  Lots of problem solving in class which is what really helped me.  Take her class!,1
"Lots of reading and many assignments, but  assignments lead up to the final paper and are helpful. She seemed to really care that students learn the material. She definitely knows the subject and tries to be very clear. But doesn't give grades unless sought out. If you are here to work and learn- this is the professor. ",1
"TAKE COTE SHES AWESOME!!! Expect to be put to work though, it is chemistry! Shes super funny and will always help you no matter what. She keeps it real with you and it could come off as rude but she really means well. Shes literally awesome and her labs are super quick, she goes right into it and writes the procedure for u on the board AWESOME!!!",1
"I took her class 2 semesters ago, and I absolutely LOVED her class. She is so nice and HELPFUL.She is a hard grader, but she offers extra credit and you can correct your papers and she gives you the new grade.One thing that I love about her is that she still knows my name even 2 semesters later. DO your part and she will help you as much as she can",1
good prof,1
"Mr. Norris has skills that help students to feel valuable and smart. He is trying to teach the students, not to start hate the class. I always attended the class with satisfaction.",1
"If you want an easy class with not much work, do not take this professor. She has high standards and does not ""dummy down"" her grading because you are at a community college. You will learn a lot if you are willing to work hard, but her standards are high. Other teachers are much easier, but you won't learn as much.",1
"I had the privilege of taking all three of Pittman's classes: Comparative Relg., Hist. of Christianity, and Geography. Out of all the Professors at RBC, she was definitely my favorite. Her tests aren't hard if you take good notes. She is a very approachable, and nice lady who is always willing to help if you need it. Take this professor's class :)",1
"Nice guy. His looks are deceiving, I thought he would have an attitude but he is actually super-friendly. He is always willing to help and he remembers everyones names. The material is not difficult but it is a little bit of work.",1
"Excellent professor; very straightforward lectures. He is a stickler for the rules, so show up on time and put your phone away. Take a lot of notes!!! All of the material he tests you on is covered in the class. Professor genuinely cares about students' futures and has a very ""tough love"" approach.",1
Favara is one of my favorite professors ever! She is kind & hilarious! Don't be afraid to speak up in her class because that makes for the most interesting discussions! She chooses a wide variety of texts for us to discuss. By being open minded & putting in the time to read you will definitely succeed in this course! Pay attention to readings!,1
Great Teacher that knows his stuff.,1
"Butowsky is so dry and boring when he lectures.  If you don't read the books he assigns then you won't get higher than a C on his tests.  He doesn't really go over them, and doesn't teach all of the material he's going to test on.  He has literally two grades for the entire course, so be careful.",1
"Fran is a great instructor who is compassionate about her work. She interacts with the students, in order  for everyone to understand what it is that she is teaching.",1
I have had Mr. Lee for 2 classes and he is very easy going and easy to work with. I have had him for intro to programming and Assembly Language.,1
"Hard class, but prof. Strange made it worthwhile. He's humorous and tells stories that are entertaining, yet sometimes have nothing to do with the lecture. He is very well informed on what he teaches and is passionate about teaching it. Only take three tests, but a good amount of extra credit will save your grade if you attend class.",1
"first day of class when i walked in and saw her i thought to myself ""oh man she looks like one of those crazy mean strict professors"" but i was totally wrong. Although the class can be hard and there's a lot of homework, she makes the class fun and before you even know it its time to get out.",1
Awful this man is a terrible teacher. He acts like his students in an intro class are CPAs and know what they are doing. I will be lucky if I make it out of his class alive. If you get this man change out of his classssssss please save yourself,0
"Real chillin class..all you have to do is show up every now and then and turn in three essays. NO FINAL and optional essay at the end. Nice guy, very understandable and always lets you out of class early",1
Not helpful at all! She expects the students to know everything! Don't take her class!,0
"Possibly the best professor I have ever had. Excellent listener, really good at talking to during office hours, very understanding, very nice. Grading is fair and she uses class input to adjust lectures and schedule. For example, she moved a Monday exam to Wednesday because it was after the weekend of Homecoming.",1
"Really great prof. Understands the material well and conveys it to students well. If you don't show up to class your going to be in for a rough ride. He is available pretty often for office hours and if you need more help he can usual schedule some time aside other than whats listed. Textbook was not used, only used it for more practice problems.",1
"Great Professor! Biology is hard so you are gonna have to put some effort into it, but she gives you everything you need to get a good grade. 3 lecture exams, 1 lab exam and a final. The test are pretty fair you just gotta know your stuff. Labs are easy. DO ALL OF THE EXTRA CREDIT. The extra credit can boost you up a whole letter grade.",1
"Best teacher I have ever had. He is very nice, and all the work I did in his class really helped me become better at drawing. His lectures are very engaging. I can tell that he is passionate about art, and he really cares about his students. His class is the only class I was actually excited to be in. I enjoyed everything about him as a teacher.",1
"Prof. Schellhorn is a very straightforward professor. She didn't assign homework so our grade was mostly based on exams. Honestly just pay attention during the lectures, take good notes to study from and you should be fine. She has weird grading curves but her exams are always fair and she's always available if you need more help outside of class",1
"My days are good until I walk into this class. Unnecessarily rude in emails, expects a lot out of students for it being a 101 class. Readings every night, pop quizzes usually the next class. A bit sarcastic, which I didn't appreciate. He knows the material, lectures are decent, but if I could go back in time I would take an easier core.",1
"I didn't really enjoy Peter as a teacher. He was super unorganized and wasn't willing to help me outside of class. One time it took him 3 weeks to grade our tests... 3 weeks!! (Mind you, he only teachers one class.) I was embarrassed to be one of his students.",0
"My review is for her online Intro to Kinesiology class. It's set at a good pace and not too demanding. My only issue is that on the tests she uses outdated terminology from a previous edition of the book. A lot of my test answers were wrong because a lot of terms have completely changed in the new edition. Otherwise good class, good assignments.",1
"great instructor, test match study guide, not a piece of cake you have to know your material. didn't like his labs was his own drawings threw you off a bit, got an A in class, but was challenging. in his hybrid class no review for tests,",1
"Mrs. Ryburn was very helpful if you needed additional instruction. This class is a little different because everyone goes at their own pace based on online test scores. If you needed help with ANYTHING, she was always more than happy to see you during her office hours. She made the math problems very clear when they weren't on the software used.",1
"The material is interesting, but I would have taken it with someone else. His lectures and his notes are unclear and not very helpful. You won't understand anything unless you read the book before class. He thinks he's funny.",0
Willing to help if you ask for it but very tough grader. Class was not enjoyable because of the slow pace and boring content.,0
I really do enjoy her class. She is consistently moving around the room and keeps everyone's attention. Sometimes lecture courses can be tough to sit through but everything she says will help on a test.,1
"SHE IS A AWESOME TEACHER HAD HER FOR ANOTHER CLASS. HER MIDTERM AND FINAL ARE TAKE HOME. SHE MAKES CLASS FUN, NEVER A DULL MOMENT. I HAVE BEEN TELLING ALOT OF PEOPLE TO TAKE HER IF THEY CAN.",1
He is an amazing teacher! I suck at bio but he made it interesting and he is pretty funny.,1
One of the better professors in accounting. I learned a lot from this class and passed with a B. Theres online homework and tests where she lets you use a notecard. I would recommend!,1
"This is one of the best professor's I've ever had! Listening to his lectures is REALLY interesting, and he's incredibly helpful. He cares about his students and has an endearing sense of humor. He has a bit of a following, so he's not for everyone. I'm really looking forward to taking his class again next semester!",1
"Dr. Galan is the best history professor i've ever had. He is very professional, but also willing to help whoever reaches out. If you participate in the class, or communicate with him before/after class you will be fine. Book/film reviews are the most important.",1
Tough grader and does not return emails in a timely manner. Would not take again. Nor would I recommend this proffessor. ,0
"Dr. Schellhorn is by far he worst professor I've ever had. She says on day 1 that the final exam is going to be incredibly difficult and every semester the average is an F. She also says that she won't curve the course at the end, but not each individual exam. She only curves by 9 points but says that she will curve by a lot more than than.",0
"There were a lot of readings (free online textbook and articles) and videos, but I learned a lot. It is not hard to get a good grade in the course if you follow the rubrics for the major assignments. There were weekly online discussion posts, an online quiz, a midterm assignment, and a final paper. She was very accessible via email for questions.",1
I loved the style of lectures which were more of a group discussion. It was easy to get involved with the material and give your opinion without judgement. Course was 8 weeks and included a heavy workload but it was doable. Definitely love her teaching style.,1
"Very multiple choice test heavy, which can be a good thing. Lectures are amazing.",1
"By far the best teacher you could have, she is so nice and actually takes time to get to know her students and work with them. She is hilarious, I look froward to her class every single day. She helped me get over my fear of public speaking and would also keep me motivated the whole semester. I was really sad leaving her class",1
Cogan is a very nice guy.  I thought this class was lots of fun and he's an easy grader!,1
"Took HIST1113 online- easy for the most part. Lectures are posted online as a video and can be pretty boring at times. 2 papers, but easy grading. 2 essay tests that aren't too bad.",1
Fun and easy spanish class. Especially if you are not a spanish minormajor. There are test corrections. Tests are OKAY. Lectures can drag on but he is very funny. He loves what he does. Very helpful. Would recommend for spanish.,1
Dr. Schaller is inconsistent and confused a group of adult graduate students who had high hopes for her.  Susanna Schaller is not helpfull and profoundly undergrades her students.,0
She is an amazing professor. She is very caring and explains things until she knows you get it. Very easy pass show up know whats going on and go to labs and there is no way you could fail. All quizzes and homework is online and at home. Overall really great professor would for sure highly recommend. She also gives some extra credit.,1
"Fantastic, kind instructor. If you just go to class and do myspanishlab, you are almost guaranteed an A. She is especially helpful if you want to talk to her and very willing to offer any advice you need. FANTASTIC instructor!",1
I personally thought Greenberg was a great instructor. I understood his lectures clearly and he was there to help the students when they needed it.,1
She is very energetic so you won't get bored in class. She genuinely loves the material and cares about her students. She was very helpful when we didn't understand things and even bring in extra material to help us understand things better. The class was tough but if you need to take it take it with her!,1
Dr. Hayes is a great teacher. I have looked at life different since this class and he has taught me a lot. I'm planning on taking more classes with him.,1
"Good, a little disorganized but very enthusiastic.",1
Alice is my favorite teacher! She is so much fun and makes you feel like you're her best friend! Take her! You won't regret it!,1
AMAZING! I look forward to taking her class next semester! I highly recommend.,1
Dustin is the best engineering professor I have ever had. His testing is consistent with everything he teaches in class. Most of my classes with him required no book. He genuinely cares about his students and is always ready to help when you don't understand. Take every class that you can from him!,1
"She takes attendance every day but we just work on our online stuff in the class, and sometimes we will write papers and have to read them in front of the class. Overall she was a nice lady, but she never gave me a single comment of feedback, and we just had a bunch of busy work online that didn't teach me anything. Easy A, but not engaging. ^1102",1
Deluna is a funny amazing professor. Just because he is funny does not mean the class can not get difficult. Theres really only 2 assignments in the class. The test and quizes are hard but only if you dont read the textbook and dont pay attention in class. Pay attention on everything he teaches because it is all on the test. You will love the class,1
Amazing teacher best teacher I had in college. gives good feedback I would take her class again,1
"Promises to be ""your statistician for life"" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can",0
She's very sweet and very animated. Don't take her class though if you have an attitude against strong accents because she's too nice and doesn't need bad vibes in her class. I took the once a week class and it can get a little boring but she's great.,1
"Mr. Rodriguez throughout the semester assigns weekly supersite quizzes, an oral presentation, mid term, and a final. He tries his best to answer your questions, if he understands what you are asking.  He values participation and attendance, and will give extra points to those who participate and attend class. He is overall a good professor.",1
"A very good teacher and a super kind and caring person. She is lenient about deadlines, and homework is never strenuous while remaining interesting. Was super nice to talk and interact with. Highly reccomend.",1
"If you can take him, do it!! He doesn't nitpick at your work or presentations but just wants to see your effort. There's an assignment due nearly every class but they're short and easy for the most part. 2 Group assignments also with minimal work. This is one of the few classes I feel I actually learned something from the Prof. He's great!!",1
"If online, skip her. She's terrible. Uploads videos of lectures where she just reads off the PowerPoint without explaining things properly. She rushes through everything. You seriously won't learn anything from her. Not hard to pass but she's a terrible online instructor. She offers extra credit which helps your grade but I wanted to learn...",0
"Professor Tanoukhi is clearly knowledgeable in her field, and a very intelligent woman. However, her teaching style is confusing and often muddled. Does not highlight concepts, but attempts to derive them from quoted text, and does so rather poorly. Rely on the TAs for this class-- they will save you!",0
One of the best professors i've had at hofstra.. I hate sociology but he loved teaching so much that he cried during class when he had to cancel one of our classes and he really cared about the students. Made class easy and explained everythng multiple times before the test.,1
"He's scary at first, but you'll learn to like him.  Really funny guy.  He really wants the class to succeed and offers extra help if you need it. The tests weren't that bad but you need to study your notes to get an A. If economics was my major, I'd definitely try to take his class again.",1
Very subjective grader.  Must Avoid!!!,0
Ms. Carter is  a character! She's is professional BUT don't think that you can take advantage of her cuz SHE WILL NOT HAVE IT! she did favor her Jamaican ppl a little toooo much though! I'm sure they all passed. Some times we would get a little off topic. but all in all she makes the subject fun and interesting. She's a tough grader also,1
Dr. Schuster gives some of the most amazing lectures I have ever had. I had an almost three hour class with him and it truly did not feel that long. However he is a tough grader! Just make sure to use a huge amount of examples on tests (bluebook) & utilize office hours & his feedback to write your papers. Riveting lecturer & extremely accessible!,1
"Learning statistics was very challenging, coming to her made the different from failing to class to an A. She explains the material so well in class, it sticks to you. She is very lenient in grades. She wants you to take your time and slow down, that is why understanding the material with her is amazing. The other Stats class are far behind. ",1
She's super nice and helpful. The only thing is the test and quiz questions are kind of hard for an entry level class!,1
Ms. M was a great teacher. Not very interested in subject but made it very bearable. PowerPoints have lots of info but all of it is needed to build concepts. Replaces lowest grade with attendance % if it helps you. Emails back very quickly and easy grader. Extra credit available. Very nice and approachable. Really - a great prof! Recommended.,1
"If you take her NGO class, take it seriously, and it will be one of the few courses at NYU you will cherish.",1
Great professor. Take him if you get the chance.,1
Great teacher. Really wants her students to pass and to be able to do well in the next levels of Spanish. She will respond to emails promptly and will be able to help students in her office hours. Tests are very easy and straight forward. Homework is very minimal and is completed online for an occasional worksheet in class,1
Everything about his class was above my expectations!,1
Easiest class I have ever taken I don't know how he doesn't have a 5/5. Would highly recommend pairing this class with Micro Bio or A&P 1/2 if you need this credit for your degree because it is stress free and allows you to focus on your more difficult classes. No citation required on writings just read the material and answer his questions.,1
"Really nice, really helpful",1
"She was a really nice and warmhearted professor. She takes the time to meet with you and help you with your papers. Make sure to come prepared with questions though. Her grading is fair and she sees that you put effort, which will help you in the long run. She is always smiling and pleasant as well. Unifies the whole class into a  welcoming group.",1
Prof Rizzella really likes cognition and it shows. She knows her stuff and loves what she does. She doesn't act superior like so many other profs!,1
"Dr. Meehan is the funniest sweetest lady in the psych department. She's always willing to help you and she really goes the extra mile to make sure you understand the material with in-class examples. She likes people that come to class, and her tests aren't easy As but you'll learn a lot and she keeps you interested. TAKE HER!",1
"WORST teacher I have ever taken. Very rude, and super unclear. Half of the class time would be spent would be spent going completely off topic and talking about her personal experiences (interesting but NOT related to anatomy or things to help us study). Never learned anything from lecture. Tests are timed and have 5 chapters per test. DONT TAKE IT",0
This teacher is one of the worst I've ever had. She bases her class on personal opinion (about abortion being wrong and the likes) and you don't learn any sociology. She goes on about not being politically correct. And  her tests are like 60 questions of stuff she didn't teach. Everyone saying she's great has to be white and have the same opinions.,0
"He's a good prof. He's funny, and class gets off topic a lot.  Good, fun class",1
"mollie gave us a very clear description as to what to expect when we decide to become ag teachers. I feel like she does a very good job at giving us the reality of being an ag teacher. class met once a week for about three hours, we never actually used up the three hours until near the end of the semester. makes it very clear that shes a mom first",1
Dr. K is a new professor at Cal State Fullerton but teaches Environmental Engineering 441 pretty well. He is very hilarious and a cool guy. He will answer all questions that are asked and he really cares about his students' grades. If you study and go to class everyday then you will pass. If you don't then you are preparing yourself to fail. ,1
"You learn a lot from class than any other high school or human sexuality courses. It's true he talks about his life A LOT so likely you won't get through the whole chapter. His exams are hard so study repeatedly. I had open book but I still ended up with a C so be prepared, attendance is key, read during lectures, and stay awake he watches everyone",0
"He got phone calls in the middle of class almost every time. He would ignore your questions. His TA didn't know how to complete most the HW questions. Would go through examples in class that had nothing to do with the HW. He seemed out of breath most days. But I guess he knows R pretty well, if that is what makes you a good teacher.",0
"Dr. Lim is an interesting professor. On one hand, you could say that he is a really hard professor since you have to figure out all the material on your own. On the other hand, all his tests are pretty easy, you must know the basics though... If you get him, form a study group and be persistent in working on all the material...",1
"Mangone taught the second half of my genetics class after Liebig, and I was very disappointed. He had terrible communication skills, if you couldn't make his office hours then good luck getting in touch. His explanations did always make sense and could conflict in lecture. When I did talk in person he was nice and gave advice about pursuing a PhD.",1
"Shes so sweet! She is very nice and can is able to help you with whatever questions you have. However, she is kind of unclear about the tasks, and the homework/classwork is extremely easy. ",1
"It was his first year teaching Intro Bio, and you could tell. Nice, and presents material well. Still feeling out his curriculum, so some assignments are too much for the time frame. Changes deadlines very frequently- sometimes without informing his students. Tends to make you search for answers instead of just helping you. Needs to proofread.",1
"Very Smart anf knows EVERYTHING!!! seriously. Trust me an A in her class is an A at Harvard! She command the very best out of her students, so you either do well or fail, and most fail. She my favorite professor at Morehouse.",1
"Awesome professor and warm individual inside and outside of class.  If you make the effort to get to know him it will mean wonders to your outlook as a developing scientist.  DO come to class, DO ask questions, and DO attend the student lead study sessions.  They help a mil for exams.",1
"Great professor. During lectures, he taught with such clarity that I scarcely needed to look at the book. However, he's a bit difficult to engage with outside of the lectures. If you need help with a problem, it's probably best to tell him about it ahead of time. He's also a tough grader on exams, taking off way too much for minor missteps.",1
Very scary... She hardly understand your questions and her tests are very hard--8 choices for mc questions. Try to avoid her...,0
"This teacher is a very confusing teacher. She talks around everything. She grades you on everything literally everything. The way you dress, the way you talk, how you stand. She makes up topics that don't apply to the real world. She makes you feel like your opinion doesn't matter. She's just horrible, I recommend that you take someone else.",0
"The way he lectures makes what he's saying really easy to follow. He emphasizes what's important (what you should know for tests) and when he gives extra information that isn't necessary for you to know, he makes sure you know you don't need to be memorizing it, but it's always interesting, relevant stuff. Very helpful, sympathetic if you get sick.",1
"Terrible. Exams were extremely difficult because the lectures involve no actual learning. His lecture style is very dry, unfunny, and not helpful at all. His accent is sometimes incomprehensible. The other instructor for this class, Dr. Storch, was much more organized and presented the material in a very clear and understandable fashion.",0
"Professor Lopez is an incredible speaker, very intelligent, and has many interesting points about Shakespeare that you will not learn anywhere else. He's also surprisingly funny. Grading is fair. If you like Shakespeare, you'll enjoy it a lot!! Kept sleeping through the 9am lectures, though, and missed all the days he handed back the test aha;;",1
"WORST TEACHER AT NASHVILLE STATE! Doesn't enter grades at all, claims he only gives a final grade and you are suppose to keep up with your own grades to know if your're passing. Takes the fun out of art! Does the same thing every single class!!! He talks with terrible language and bad body language and uses profanity, which is so unnecessary!",0
"Funny, awkward guy. Lectures are very boring (sorry Wes), but he's nice and very helpful. Participation isn't a big deal, but make sure to show up often... there are in-class assignments on random days. Attend the group conferences and turn in essays on time.",1
J.R Jones hates Java and but loves his students. He interacts with the students and  gets to know them. He never forgets a name and always is your friend.   Best Teacher ever,1
Professor Stoner was adorable to me. He really is passionate about all our topics. Test are online so its fairly easy. The finals a little harder but overall the class is easy to get a B in.,1
"Leats favorite lecturer of the WOC crew but they are all very good. This is a very interesting course but beware, no0t as easy at it looks. Buy the NTCs and re-read them and you should be fine.",1
Loved him. It was a difficult class but Taylor made it totally interesting. He has a great sense of humour and really interacts with the class. He changed my entire view of Old English and I'm sorry that it's being taken out of the curriculum.,1
he's sooooo mean,0
"Her class was extremely easy. It was not a challenge at all. She is really nice and gives you multiple chances so no one really has an excuse to not have an A. She responds pretty quickly to emails, gives out extra credit, and you can watch great movies during class. I recommend her for Intro to Afro Studies. I would defintely take her again!",1
Pretty funny guy. The class is very easy. Don't buy the book it's not needed. Study the online material and everything is a breeze. Also as long as you do well in the lab you should do fine. He curves the heck out of the exam scores too!,1
"GREAT PROFESSOR. ALWAYS wants to help you out. But, STUDY for his opportunities. His exams are VERY TOUGH. But if you work hard, you will do well.",1
this was her first time teaching this class so it was okay. i thought she was helpful and i loved the videos she showed the class. i wished we had more time to discuss topics but over all a good class.,1
"She's really harsh and strict, and even though attendance isn't mandatory, she treats it as such. Goes too fast for most of my class to keep up, I kinda just stopped showing up because I missed ONE class and she wouldn't help me out, and I fell behind. I learnt a lot more at home from the textbook. Try a different lab professor!",0
"Prof. Steven's is one of the best organized teachers in the math department. She doesn't cut corners and is VERY caring. She doesn't dumb down the curriculum like other instructors but provides an extremely well coordinated online class. If you put your hours in you will learn and get a good grade, period. Best way to do Calc 1.",1
"Energetic, enthusiastic and funny. Works hard to bring the class alive. Tests are comprehensive, you must read the book. Two papers. Gets grades back quickly. I wasn't particularly interested in the subject when the class started but got interested as it progressed, in large part because of Dr. Hynes' skill at presentation.",1
he has us do so many Tableau projects that are peer-reviewed and graded pretty harshly. On top of that you have many readings and you are not allowed to email him or he will lower your course grade. Who does that?!,0
"Awesome class, Professor Fritz is understanding and caring.  Learned a lot and had a good time in class.  Highly recommended.",1
Yeah just stay away from this Professor! Really hard to understand her directions at times I wish she would communicate more effectively with her students. Not bad but I would not take her again if I had the choice.,0
Loved having this class! Professor Dunham was awesome! He made everything in class easy to understand and I learned so much! He also made the class super fun! Would 100% recommend him!,1
Great teacher! This was my first time taking a math class online and it was an amazing experiance! Everything was super clear and easy!,1
"OH MY GOD!! Stay away from this professor!  I am in her class right now and I have to drop it.  The course average for EVERY student in my online class is below a 40%.  I spent 6 hours on one of her ""basic"" homework assignments, and had a friend with a MASTERS DEGREE in computer sciences help me with this homework, and still got a 65%. SHES UNCLEAR",0
"Jennie will make all of your dreams come true, one week it's a take home quiz, the next is a group quiz. Always there to help and tests are easy if you study! ",1
Her class is a breeze. It's an Easy A. She's a chill teacher who enjoys discussion with her classes. We talk about what's happening in the business world and in world news. The homework is extremely easy. Most tests are open book -online on Blackboard. The Final is a project highlighting a publicly traded business. Just study for the Midterm exam.,1
"Took this class online and it wasn't that difficult. If you put in the time and study for the midterm and final, you will pass the class. The only bad thing about this class is the midterm and final make up 40% of your grade. Overall, it's an easy class if you study and put in the work.",1
"Dr. McCartney was a WONDERFUL teacher! Sweet lady, really knows her stuff. If you're looking for an easy gen ed, this is NOT the class for you. If you're looking to learn/ challenge yourself, the class is great. Lots of reading, weekly 2-3 pg journals, map quizzes at end of sem, one current events pres., midterm, final, and 12-15 pg research paper",1
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! such good lectures, you will learn so much. Generally there is no extracredit, but due to COVID she was understanding when we went online. STUDYSTUDYSTUDY. She is very friendly and easy to talk to as well. Kind of neurotic in the best way. There are only 4 grades. 3 exams and homework each worth 25%. I suggest her you wont regret",1
"Really nice guy, listens to his students, excellent online resources! I took the class as an elective and actually learned something. Notice that he is always happy when he walks in, never upset! He really enjoys what he does, and that reflects on his students!",1
"One group project that takes up the whole semester. Pretty easy as long as the group stays on task and keeps up. Discussion boards for each chapter and one research paper but have the whole semester to complete. Only one test, the final, but gives a study guide with answers and the final is very closely based off the study guide.",1
"He is a very smart teacher, who genuinely cares about his students, and has a very straight forward grading criteria. He gives you feedback throughout the semester and is always there to talk to after class about anything confusing. The ratings on here of this teacher are unfair. Read the lectures BEFORE class and participate everyday!",1
She is a very nice teacher she just gives a TON of homework and outside work she is a very fair grader. She will take late work and is very clear about what she wants you to make. As long as you follow directions and take her advice you will do just fine in the class. If your are a not a art student she takes that into consideration while grading.,1
We did labs every week. The final was worth 42% of the grade and that was the only test. She let us use a cheat sheet,1
"GREAT professor! I took online Comp II, and got an A. It is not a slack off class, but all the assignments are extremely clear and he will help if you need it. I really, really enjoyed this class and feel like I actually got something from it. Highly recommended!",1
Worst professor I ever took this semester  she's disorganized and confusing ended up getting a D in her class BIG MISTAKE!!,0
"DIfficult class, make sure to write down everything he puts up on the board and always do the vocabulary and maps. Go to his office hours if you need help, he will help you with anything. Great guy.",1
"This is my second class with Crocoll and he is the best professor for those of us who don't have a strong suit in Math. His lectures really do prepare you for the exams and quizzes, making a difficult subject not so daunting. 5 exams (lowest dropped,) and 17 quizzes (lowest 2 dropped,) and offers 25-40 extra credit points. No homework.",1
"I took psych 2301 with professor Whitney and Im so glad I chose her as a teacher. You can tell she loves what she does. Class if fairly easy, just do the weekly assignments and youll do well with the test and quizzes. Make sure you do extra credit I missed out on an A by .9% because I did not give myself a cushion which sucks b/c I was so close",1
"I took Alice's online statistics class. The expectations were very straight forward, but there was a lot of work for one summer session. Online homework and quizzes/ tests were due for each section of the book through the the book's website. She provided her lessons through canvas and links to videos and worksheets which were helpful.",1
"Mr. G is honestly the best professor I've ever had. He teaches stuff that is valuable in real life, not just pointless labs. He responds to emails within 5 minutes, and is the most helpful human being in the world. I had him for Cell Bio lab and Genetics Lab and I wish he was my professor for every lab. He makes labs fun and useful.",1
"Helpful teacher, but when you ask him a question he always gives you a half hour explanation and sometimes you never get the answer. He's a talker! If I had a dollar for every minute he talked I could retire already.",1
"This teacher is a great person, but not a great teacher. She did not teach this whole semester. All she ever talked about was her kids and her life. She only taught a lecture three times  the whole semester, and still expected you take quizzes over material each week. Get the book, its the only way you will pass.",0
Class consists of lecture and discussion.  Grade is 100% based on two oral exams that are similar to the class discussion.  The exams can be pretty easy to quite hard depending on how good you are at arguing your point.,1
She's a hippie but in a good cool way. She's very go with the flow do what you want at your own pace but still encourages you to do better,1
"I absolutely loved having him as a professor! He puts a lot of work in and really cares about his students and you can tell. I took his class online and even though the quizzes were open book, if you didn't watch his videos you are going to struggle. If you watch his videos and take good notes the quizzes are easy. I didn't have to read, just watch",1
"Awesome teacher! She is very clear about what you need to know, and also gives extra credit to those who work hard and know the material.",1
"Professor Johnson is a great lecturer who transmits her passion well. She grades fairly and but harshly, and expectations are pretty clear. This class is great to improve on writing and to gain tons of factual knowledge.",1
"Great professor! I had him for 3 classes, and enjoyed his perspective and humor.",1
"You have to work very hard to just pass this class. It's hard to understand her and she is very particular about your work. Doesn't help you out very much, but she will push you to do your best.",0
She give you a easy a,1
"Does not exhibit clear teaching style, i.e. no grading rubric, no syllabus, confusing lectures.",0
"Sharon London is a brilliant teacher - if you want to really learn about acting and experience it, you should take this class. While she will say that most people will not get an A, if you really do try your best, she'll recognize that and reward you for your efforts.",1
"Easy A, show up for all the labs, and do all of the homework and you will pass. He does a lot of power point lecture.",1
I hate to not say nice things about people so I will just say Dr. O'leary makes it non-stressful to go through these classes. Having been out of his classes for a few years now I have relearned everything he did not teach us. Unfortunately you can learn semiconductor devices much better on Google than with Dr. Oleary.,0
"So, I thought it was me, but after speaking with other students in the class, there was a consensus that he isn't very friendly and cold.  His lectures didn't help me at all so I studied on my own which was better use of my time.  Take him if it's the last resort.  But he clearly doesn't like students.  In office hours, he'd come off as a jerk...",0
"Take this class you wont regret it, this was my first college class and I enjoyed it he is hilarious, the class was pretty long but he would let us get out early. Over all amazing professor one of my favorites.",1
"Melissa is a literal blessing of a teacher. She was really kind, easily accessible if you have questions, and she gives great feedback on every assignment. As long as you put some kind of effort into your work you will be well on your way to an A. I would definitely recommend.",1
"Her lectures are not as detailed as the book but discussion does help with the material. There were 4 HWS, very manageable and 1 programming assignment. Studying the lecture slides & HWS was sufficient to do well on the final and midterm. Pop quizzes that can only help your grade. Overall, very nice teacher!",1
"Logan is a very understanding instructor,I took his math 27 class because I had already taken one the previous semester but didn't pass. Attendance is not mandatory.I highly recommend him if you already are familiar with this material or else you wont learn  much and will struggle in the future. ",1
"Prof. Ams is among the worst teachers I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach. He just stands in front of the room and talks at the class. He draws rxn mechanisms, but I don't feel like he ever explains why things are happening the way they are. I would not recommend Ams to anyone. I am certainly going to avoid his classes from now on.",0
Lays out clear requirements from the students.  You will have to make your own notes from the class. Lecture slides are of little help. Group assignments. Great course content!,1
She's very knowledgeable about the subject of biology.  The textbook and her lectures also give you a strong foundation for the subject.,1
"Great Teacher, very helpful and easy to talk to. Her online speech class was challenging, but fun. She makes doing speeches very easy!",1
Wonderful teacher. She gives a quiz every time you walk into class. They are open note. She takes some of the questions off of your homework and puts them on the quiz. Make sure you do the homework. The quizzes are just to help improve grades. Not anything too hard.,1
Teacher is knowledgeable. Class is lecture heavy via PowerPoint presentations. Quiz and tests are HARD and cover a wide range of topics and concepts that are not always covered in class. LOTS of reading. LOTS of homework. NO lab time given in class. The class started completely full I think only 7 showed for the final exam. Be ready to work hard,1
The best professor to do it!!!,1
"This is the easiest teacher you'll ever have.  If you want to learn, I'd advise against taking her.  If you want an easy A, go for it.  Don't buy the book, you can use any Intro to Psych book. Class is never actually 3 hours, more like 1 1/2 - 2. Gives extra credit. I like to learn, but took this class because I already knew most of the material.",1
"I love Tancredi. He's chill, good-looking, plays bass, teaches well, great sense of humor. Dude, sign up for his class.",1
"Avoid this class/teacher at all costs. She is way too upbeat to be a human. Her grading is ridiculous. Our team got points off because she ""felt we didn't get along"". When we asked her about it she said it was because she just had a feeling. We all liked each other a lot actually.",0
"Thermo is hard. No doubt about it, and it's going to take a lot of work to do well, but it's possible. He's willing to help if you're willing to put in the work to try and figure out what you don't understand before coming up to him. Very rewarding class in the end, and the better you do here, the easier Kinetics will be.",1
"Nice guy.. but thats about it. He is a good teacher and knows his stuff but clearly asks the students to do too much work. A minimum of 2 essays due per week, sometimes two depedning on the students choice. Thesis paper was easier than I expected. The tests are essay but you feel like you write a lot and know the stuff but still grades too tough!",1
"She'll give a quiz every week, but by half ways through the semester, she won't post the slides from lecture until the day of the quiz. And if you're like I who has a class at 9 am, and then her class at 10:30, you're screwed. She has only given one bonus question on 1 quiz and gives 1 on exams.",0
Brianna is an excellent teacher. She explains things so everyone can understands and won't move on until you do.  She is willing to answer questions and encourages them. Probably the best math teacher i've ever had in my life.,1
"Dr. Law is a very nice professor that I ever had, he treats students very kindly and even let them take quizzes at home which is very nice of him. Thats so sad that people dont show up until quiz session or they leave early or dont pay attention during the lecture! Hes so respectful to me and I think students should respect him a lot.",1
"3 exams, hw and attendance taken for pts. Review classes held before exams where he goes over test questions & answers. Book hw every week. Sometimes, he would do 2 chapters at a time. He is very nice and will answer all questions. Has habit of writing really small on the board. Ppt lectures & goes over examples. Easiest prof to take for IS 310.",1
"If you show up to class and try you can pass the class with no problem, He also ""attempts"" to make an 8 am class fun! I would say take him and try to have fun with it!",1
Kinda like his son...tells stories for like 20 mins that could be told in about 30 seconds...other than that great professor:-),1
After the first day of class I knew exactly what hw I would need to do and when to turn it in for the entire term. He gives good feedback on tests and hw after 2 or 3 days. His lecture are well structured and he is able to explain things in multiple different ways so everyone can understand. attendance only matters on the weekly workshops.,1
"She is a great teacher and extremely helpful. Also, Czech is really interesting.",1
"Dr. Falvo (Doc) is simply the greatest instructor I’ve had. You can treat him more as a friend than a professor, and you can expect the same from him. Very talented performer.  Mistakes not a part of his vocabulary. He will help you about personal stuff and assumes the mentor role for his students.",1
She is awesome! She can be a lil tough but like a grandma u will love her. She is so much fun.,1
"Impossibly hard grader.  1 credit class with 100 points, took off 3 points because she saw me talking in class (3 points = 3%).  She has no sense of fairness in terms of grading and will go out of her way to ruin your grade.  Avoid this teacher.",1
"Her lectures are pretty boring, but they are straight to the point and she doesn't post them online so you have to go. The class is pretty easy though and she is super nice and cares a lot about her students and makes sure that everyone understands what she is lecturing before moving on.",1
"Professor Fletcher is the best! She makes learning a foreign language fun. There is a lot of work in the class, but she makes the class easy. There is a lot of working with partners, which I did not like. If you have to take a foreign language, take it with Professor Fletcher. You wont be sorry!!",1
"Like the others said, he's loud and opinionated.  He doesn't give students a chance to speak their opinions and if he does, he counterattacks.  His class overall is simple with 2 essay questions and 50 multiple choice.  If you don't mind rude teachers that are offensive then take him.",0
"I'm beyond grateful to have stumbled upon Kate at the onset of pursuing a career in education. 1st though: don't take Kate if you're looking for an easy A. PLEASE do take Kate if your curious about a discipline that's complex, challenging, and messy. She gives you a wealth of knowledge. Take her wisdom and learn from it, future educator.",1
She skims over explaining how to actually do things and just expects you to understand. Assigns lots of online homework in bulk but you have a week usually to do the 15-40 problems. Test vary in difficulty and the final is under 30 questions but adds up to 200 points and 20% of your grade and she takes points away for every little mistake...,0
"Showed up late to almost every class, likes to hear himself talk and tends to ramble. Exams were easy as long as you studied and did the guide he gives you, show up for attendance points.",0
AMAZING MAN TEACHER AND AWSOME IF YOU EVER NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. HE KNOWS HIS STUFF AND WORKS WITH YOU TO LEARN.,1
Professor López is one of the best professors ive taken. Everything in the syllabus is clear. She gives amazing lectures and makes the class fun. Shes also a great person to talk to if you need help.,1
"Very passive aggressive! It gets frustrating when he punishes the class because someone else was unprepared and in the next class too.  Difficult tests, he expects perfection but he tries not to hide what he wants and expects.",1
Very difficult lab instructor. She's a really nice person but will rip you a new one when it comes to grading. She will take off points for any little thing and before you know it you have a terrible grade on lab reports. She always seemed annoyed when you asked her questions during lab so take her at your own risk,0
Dr. V is fair but tough. If you do the work and ask questions there is no reason you should fail. He asks a lot but overall and fairly enjoyable person to learn and work with.,1
"One of the most awesome professors I've ever had.  Hard and utterly confusing, but so much fun.  The man is my hero.",1
I took this class hoping to learn a little more about writing fiction and ended up learning ALOT more!  Barkley really knows what he's talking about and all his comments were smart and right.  Plus he makes the class fun with lots of exercises and funny comments.  The best class I ever took at FSU.,1
"Absolute great experience with this professor. While he can be a little strict when helping you with code, you can tell he genuinely wants you to learn. His lectures are very well organized and he gives real world examples. His assignments are very manageable and I felt like I walked out of this class with a lot of gained knowledge.",1
"MacCabe's class is really good! I'm bad at science but he taught it in a way that I understood. There's not much homework (1 or 2 assignments a week), and the tests are alright as long as you study",1
Just don't take her. I would wait a year to take the class with some other teacher. She's pretty bad. ,0
"Multiple choice tests,no partial credit, 20, 8-16 problem hw. Studying midterm for final is futile. doesn't matter how much material you can shove into a both sided cheat sheet You are screwed. Got tutored, did all the extra credit, showed up every class ON TIME, took notes still failed, Pass is possible if taking teacher twice.",0
Great professor. Lectures are fast-paced and carry a lot of content. The exams have a written section which tends to be the most difficult. Amazing lectures and teaches economics with real-world examples and show clips. Entertainng class.,1
I absolutely love this man. He makes you understand what he is talking about and tries to make it interesting!! Take him if possible!!,1
"Gina is so funny and entertaining. Her homework assignments are not tedious and she bases a lot of her reading and paper topics off of psychology subjects, so the class is interesting and the papers are not awful to write. She wants everyone to succeed and has offered many extra credit opportunities.",1
"Professor D'sa's relaxed and calm teaching style is extremely effective in teaching material as dense and comprehensive as corporate Finance. He gives no surprises on the tests and says that he tests how well you understand the concepts, not how good you are at memorizing. If you want to learn Finance, take this professor.",1
"This course is graded on participation, so read the books and try to understand them. The only other grades are research papers. He wants you to say something insightful, so do not give him a book report. Don't be afraid to be wrong and make sure he knows who you are. My advice is to never shut up in his class.",1
He is a very nice teacher and his class is easy to understand. There is no homework and the class is based off test that you take.His test are very confusing because he does not really clairify what he wants you to write on the test.,0
"Gives notes out in class already printed off along with practice notes for you to work on. Goes over everything in class with you and has reviews before the test. Great teacher, advise going to class because you can get extra credit and is much more helpful if you are there. Makes Econ actually very interesting and fun.",1
"great professor and helper, take his class if you can.",1
"Worst english professor I have ever taken. Never goes over her expectations in the course, or what she is looking for. Weird deadlines, and just unrealistic expectations. Then at the end there is a wonderful essay during your final that she never even brings up. Don't worry about it though, it's not like it's your entire final grade or anything.",0
"Horrible?Too tough?There's a hellofa workload but rise to the challenge& you'll increase your asl skills& learn more about Deaf culture. Isn't that the point? Her criticism is constructive, and she knows what she's talking about. Put your pride aside, cause you don't sign perfectly and it gets a lot harder from here. Be an adult&you'll be fine",1
"Professor Laws class was great. Attendance is not mandatory. 5 easy quizes and most of them will be take home, 1 easy paper with an enough time amount. If you were absent on the quiz day, he will give you a chance to make it up by giving you the quiz as a take home quiz. Hes super nice and caring. Really do recommend! Easy A class!",1
"Great teacher; really know his stuff and has real world experience which, in this field, is priceless. Never uses the book and all the tests are based on his notes. Very easy class if you take good notes and study them for each class. You will learn a lot, too!",1
"Excellent advisor, knowledgeable in the field of social work. slow on grading but will answer e-mails. Expect lots of homework and papers. he is courteous and respectul, patient and willing to advise you sincerely about the field.",1
" Dr. Beymer-Farris is my absolute favorite professor at UK. Her classes are more discussion based than lecture based, and expect to write. If you are interested in the subject matter, she is a wonderful resource. She is not only a good professor, but an overall good person. She's genuinely interested in the lives and well-being of her students.",1
Great professor. Really cares about the material and is passionate. He makes it interesting to learn about (as much as he can). Tests can be difficult if you dont study and take notes. Assignments are once a week and fairly straightforward and not very difficult. Overall good class and excellent professor.,1
"he knows the subject well and teaches you things that you'll need in your career, but he is a little biased when it comes to design.  if your design is not how he thinks it should be, you kind of sense this negative vibe from him.",0
"College Algebra. Quizzes everyday, but only your best 10 are averaged and the rest are dropped. Homework everyday, 3 tests worth 50% and the final is 33% of your grade. Goes pretty fast in class so if you arent the best at math dont take it. About half the class dropped, shell answer questions but she arent very clear",1
"Great prof, cares about his students, explains things well. Except bi-weekly quizzes with very wordy multiple choice, and a short time to complete the quiz, so it is very hard to prepare for the tests.",1
"what a joke. if you cant make it, teach technique out of a textbook",0
"When I signed up for AMH2020 with Dr Leflouria, I did not expect to be taking History of American Slavery ,as Dr Leflouria focuses completely on slavery as the topic of the class. I enjoyed learning about the significance it had in our country's past & how it was dealt with. A lot of reading, some tests and a Research Paper. Pretty decent overall ",1
Attending lecture is not helpful. He always assumes you know something. He puts high expectation on you but does a really poor job teaching us in a understandable and organized way.,0
Goodwin was a great professor. He always worked incredibly hard to be sure everyone knew what was expected of them and he always got things graded very quickly. I feel as though I learned a lot taking his class and he was incredibly helpful.,1
"Ehhh, this class was okay. Definitely not easy A. The context was interesting at times. Look on note swap for tests and quizlet for the quizzes. Stoner was a nice and credible guy but his lectures were jumpy. Being able to write good and dense one paragraph essays is key to test. Final consists of one paragraph essay and a 2-3 page essay.",1
"This professor actually believes you would be paid ""the big bucks"" to do complex calculations by hand. He assigns much more homework than other professors teaching the same class, however, he doesn't cover the material or work examples. Your only resource is the book and the lecture notes he posts. He provides a pdf book which saves money. Avoid",0
Do the work and you'll be fine. Seek help and he will help you. Don't expect him to pick you out of all the students. This was my third attempt at Statistics and he made it easier to comprehend.,1
Will Valley believes in pedagogical learning through experience and discussion. The LFS core courses are designed to shape students into interdisciplinary learners that do more than simply regurgitate information -- but rather to learn to prepare for uncertainty in the field. Lots of guest lectures. Group grading sucks but amazing prof.,1
"Fantastic professor.  You have to be as dedicated as he is to get through this class.  It is NOT an easy class to pass, and I LOVE this.  Be prepared to study and practice and go to office hours and tutoring and ask the majors' for assistance..... And if you do all of that, be prepared to LEARN!!!!",1
"I HATE political science, but Dr. Swint made class very interesting and I actually enjoyed learning about the discussions.  Not quite an ""easy A"", but very manageable and you will learn a ton!",1
"I have had Dr. Brown for TEC 110, TEC 211, TEC 217, and TEC 317. He is by far my favorite teacher. He is very easy to understand, funny, and knows how to get you prepared for the real world.",1
"Shes the worst prof I have ever had at bsu. She doesnt care youre a college student, she doesnt care if you have to wait until pay day to buy her mandatory expensive textbook ( which she only wants you to buy bc her weak writing is included. Certainly she did not publish anything decent) shes no willing to help. She always thinks shes right",0
Professor Shine is the best professor I have ever taken. He is what every professor should model themselves after. He is an exceptional human being who strives for nothing but growth in his students.,1
She is a great teacher.,1
she is really bad...she didnt help me at all...the class was a waste of money and time. dont take her class.,0
"Great teacher, her lectures were stimulating. She is very entertaining,and passionate. I enjoyed the class overall. Tests for COMM 301 are very easy as long as you look at the study guide. Definitely a class worth taking.",1
"Class is relatively easy if you read the book. Tests are based on items not really from lecture but more so from the book. Teacher doesn't make an effort to be there for students, GSI's are more helpful/nice.",0
"Professor Kim is a really kind teacher, who cares for her students. Her class makes you feel comfortable. She will always help you if you're struggling with Korean.",1
"I have taken both of the courses Dr. Alderete teaches. You will work hard for your grade, but it is worth it. What an inspiration to take a course where you learn more than you expect and from someone who teaches with passion. I'm going to med sch thanks to him. Here's something else. If you plagiarize, he will catch you. Don't do it! He's the best",1
"Garyen is an amazing prof, he really cares about his students. He is super funny and understanding. I always looked forwards to his lectures, so if you can take HSCI 1140 with him!",1
She's awesome! Very approachable! She grades essays really easy. We played a lot of games! She makes everything fun and interesting!,1
"She is a friendly professor who rarely gives homework and grades quite easily. The lectures in class can be very boring because she just goes through slides, but if you want an easy A, she's a good choice. There was a girl who always came late and barely showed up, but the professor never got mad. There's a paper and a test for both midterm + final",1
"He is very good pro,  everyone should get A . Try his class",1
Good class. The lecture part was interesting. Can be a hard grader but fair. Always willing to help.,1
I had mr. hernandez this summer for cal 3. too bad i didnt have him for my other cal classes. i had bad instructors who never email back and have confusing syllabus. mr Hernandez is very organized. he is really good.! He went over each test with me and gave me partial credit. if you can take his calculus 1 2 3 classes pick him! I recommend him!,1
"Mr.Blanton is an awesome teacher. He has taught me more in one semester than my four years in high school. Gives a good amount of work, a lot of extra credit, easy tests, and many opportunities to bring your grade up. It is up to you to get an ""A.""",1
Did not give study guides for tests and makes you study everything. The final was incredibly hard along with every single other test because you have to study all of your notes since she gives no indication.,1
"I took 252 twice with Stewart. The first time I got a D so had to retake it. He was always honest and supportive when I had to make my decision about retaking the class. It is a very hard class but if you listen to his advice to stay diligent, do the ready, and attend class then you will be fine. Stewart is one of the best professors at the school",1
"What a cool teacher Professor Carter is. He is straight forward with assignments, nothing is confusing. He has a sense of humor- which to me makes a good teacher a great one. He loves golf! I highly recommend Joe Carter to every CJ student if you can book his classes. One of my favorite teachers ever.",1
"He didn't give a study guide like everyone else said and his tests averaged about four questions each, making it very easy to fail. All other opinions seem accurate. I wouldn't take him, again.",0
"her class is solely based off 5 HW's and 3 tests, that is it. You are going to have to be detail oriented. She is particular about the papers, she lets you submit papers early for review and she gives good feedback.  I started doing that the class became a breeze. also don't buy the book all I needed was notes didn't open the book once I got an A",1
Most boring professor at the university.  Totally unsympathetic to student concerns.,0
Dr. Birx is a very well educated man who knows what he is talking about. His class is completely revolved around class participation. If you do not like getting randomly called on do not take this class. There are only 6 grades and they are all exams. If you do not read the chapters and come to class everyday expect to fail.,1
"Beba is awesome :)  Sure, she talks about costumer design a lot - but she knows her stuff!  She has done a lot of interestesing things in her career which she shares.  More work in the 2nd half - be prepared to write and see plays!  A few minor reaction papers, too.  Overall enjoyable class!",1
"It was an 8-week course, each week you had 2 essays, a discussion board, and activities to be done on the online book. If you are taking other classes, family, and/or a job, skip the class.",1
"Kate is knowledgeable, wise, caring and commands respect. Her class isn't easy; she pushes you to become a better teacher and sometimes that means stepping out of your comfort zone. But she guides you through every obstacle and is always happy to help. I am so grateful for her mentorship and guidance and I hope to one day teach like her.",1
Professor Bordowitz is a really nice guy. He usually is in a good mood and will make corny jokes. It's kinda interesting to hear what he has to say. I worked hard and he helped me whenever I needed his help. I recommend others to take him. I took him for WRT101 and got an A and I am taking him again for WRT201.,1
"hey-everyone who wonders where he is- i know i had prof abrams in my last yr of high schoolin 2006. he said he teaches hostra as well.. maybe he does HS only now.  he ws so funny...class was a joke, but filled w. good memories",1
"Perkins was my favorite professor at Sam! His class is so easy as long as you go, pay attention and do the work. Textbook is not really he needed. He is a very good teacher and always tries to make sure you understand the material",1
"Life-changing.  Hegel can make even the most astute students want to tear their hair out.  Professor Holt makes Hegel not only understandable but enjoyable.  His proficiency in German Idealism is remarkable considering his age, and his teaching method is very Socratic and thorough.  A must for any student of philosophy - highly recommended!",1
"Survey of Modern Math is a course that strikes most mathematics majors confused. Upon first glance, it would seem all the classes math majors take prior do not really prepare students for survey. However, Professor Mynard makes it accessible, affordable (he produces his own text), and clear as to why it is important for a math major.",1
"She is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. I had to switch majors and I was not looking forward to the classes I was required to take; she made me love my new major. She brings in her own real life experiences and you never want her to stop telling her stories. She makes you work hard, but it will helps you become a better doctor.",1
David is very knowledgable on the topics he presents but is not a captivating lecturer. The class as a whole is completely disorganized syllabus seems to never be edited and just added onto each year. The required text teaches more than any of the 2 lectures I went to. It's a mandatory class at least make it interesting and engaging for students.,1
"Overall, Prof. Stevens is decent. He clearly knows a ton about the subject matter and is passionate about it, but sometimes he comes off as impatient when students ask questions. The lab and project assignments are also rather vague, yet the grading rubrics are very well defined so make sure you understand what you have to do.",1
"He makes even the most difficult chapters very easy, helpful and approachable. He takes all students as equal and with respect and the best thing about  is when you do not understand he will come to you and explain the subject to you  personally but one thing I will be honest is that you have to read your text book very well hard work absolutely ye",1
I really like Dr. Holmes. He is my favorite teacher. I had him for Bio 1 lab and he covers the material really well. Also makes the class period fun and different. There is a reason I am going out of my way to have him help me out in A&P Lab.,1
Took Western Civilizations. Didn't reference the book too much. Gets off topic easily. Hard to understand accent. Pay attention to the review! Alright guy but not a good teacher.,0
"He was kinda of boring, but knowledgeable. Just a midterm, final, and discussion attendance determines your grade. You don't need the book since he has handouts. Hope you get a good TA, since they grade everything. He has a very very generous curve!",1
Professor Washburn is a great instructor! Her class was fun and I enjoyed every bit of it. There are two group project which are easy. She also gives extra credit. Easy class! I'm looking forward to take other classes with her.,1
"Tancredi is really chill and passionate about music. The essays are really easy, just make sure to take notes during class. Its hard not to like him, hes sarcastic and funny.",1
Great teacher tries to help you pass.  Accepts late homework and provides help. take him you wont regret it,1
Amazing class. He's the most respectful and helpful Professor I have ever had.  As long as you do all of the reading and put in the effort you'll do great in the class. Extra credit is offered throughout the term and he gives excellent feedback. Definitely want to take his another of his classes again in the future.,1
"All around one of the best teachers I have had at Clark College. She is so sweet and loves to talk to you about her dogs or vast collection of typewriters. Gives excellent feedback, has a clear grading criteria, and lets you makeup one essay and one quiz. No tests, just 3 essays make the majority of your grade in this class.",1
"Really good guy, he is kind of spacey. Ex-pot head, Tough grader but really helpful.",1
"Fun and informative class, with a knowledgeable and laid back teacher.  I have every intention to take a class from him again.",1
"In this class, expect to have homework due every day. Homework is the bulk of your grade so try to stay on top of it. Exams are an easy A since she allows open book but that doesn't mean you shouldn't study. Only bad thing about Pretill is that she is not easy to contact. She can take up to 2 days to respond and she doesn't fully answer questions.",1
"Vraiment un cours chiant, le mieux c'est de lire le manuel (lui la structure de son argumentation est complètement désordonnée). Pour sa défense, il connaît sa matière et ça l'intéresse... mais il arrive pas à intéresser",0
"There were many books that we had to read this semester, but homework was to post two questions on our discussion board every week, so very doable. It was a 3 hour class so of course it is hard to keep focus for long, but she did give breaks halfway through. Recommend this class because it is only once a week and she is a lenient grader.",1
"Excellent professor and very nice, friendly guy.",1
"Dr. Lafferty was extremely organized and gave clear directions.  Class consisted of several module posts, 1 powerpoint, and a final exam.  She was a little strict on APA but was super easy to get in contact with and always willing to help.  I would highly recommend her!!",1

Very good professor who cares about his students.  Makes this sometimes complex subject understandable.  Recommended professor.,1
"Best Professor! You have to work for your grade but the professor makes it worth. Not an easy A, but very enjoyable.",1
"Incredible professor. So knowledgeable and so willing to help! She really made Chaucer attainable, and I now I absolutely adore him, even in middle english!",1
"Jeremy Fry was super nice from the first day. If you don't understand something, he'd usually go back and fix his mistakes, or show you how to do it better. I really liked his teaching style.",1
One of the best professors at CCNY. She is really caring and makes her lectures engaging. If you get a chance take her and you will never regret it. Make sure you do all your assignment because she gives really good feedbacks and is always available for office hours. SHE REALLY IS THE BEST,1
Professor Sanchez-Bello is cool and helpful. She does have an accent but you'll be able to understand and get the concept of the course. Her reviews are great. I wish more professors were like her,1
"Fran is one of the best teachers in the WORLLDD. I love her so much even though I am terrible at Chem and found the class to be challenging. Tip: her lectures are always more helpful than the book. Also best way to study for her exams are by doing practice problems (I learned this the hard way). Shes sooo CARINGGG almost like a mother :,)",1
He is totally hot and very smart.  He really made class fun for a monday night.  I wish it was a friday night becasue I would love to take hime out!!!,1
"Overall, a great professor!  Sometimes the notes that he provides on the board get a little unorganized and he goes through the material quickly so listen carefully!  Notes AND lab activities are both covered on the test so don't forget to study the lab activities as well.  I made copies of labs for study in case he collected them for grading.",1
"His assignments are not clear. He does not explain his grading, he simply assigns a number or in my case a letter grade with no explanation. He can be very slow to answer emails. He also has a lot of work that is outside of class interviews, community service, etc. that makes it very difficult for an online class.",0
I would take one of his classes again in a heartbeat if it pertained to my major. His lectures are easy to listen to because of how funny he is. I had trouble with the multiple choices on tests sometimes but always did well on the essay portion. Hardly any homework- just reading articles from time to time. Definitely a class for the logic-minded.,1
"He is a very difficult grader, but he doesn't seem too bad overall.",0

"cool dawg, 10/10 would take again",1
Do not take a class from this guy. You won't learn anything. The class is poorly organized and  you receive very little instruction. Assignments are vague and learning materials are unhelpful or incomplete. I seriously learned more from YouTube tutorials than this class.,0
"You have to buy a connect code for the book. An essay assignment is due the first week. A discussion, quiz and learmart is due every week. He asked alot of us in the discussions, he would ask 4 questions but he would ask other questions within those 4 questions so it came out to be 10+. Easy class, just very tedious and he asks alot from you.",1
"Professor Birch is a fantastic teacher.  He will know you by name and care about helping you.  I wish all of the MET professors would adopt his style.  His classes are challenging, but very rewarding.  ",1
"I took this course F/09 and thoroughly enjoyed the course. Loved the info however, there is a LOT of reading if taking online. The exams can be tricky because we did not receive any study guides. Other than the exams, the course was easy. I would take her again for the ease factor. I agree that she does not answer emails in a timely manner.",1
Instructor paved the way for you to succeed in the course by clearly telling you what you needed to do to pass. She was very good about reminding you what needed to be done every week with a weekly Monday announcement. I took the online course and I really liked how the tools I needed to pass were all outlined in the syllabus.,1
Took a 1.0 credit class with her. You can tell shes very passionate about what she teaches. Don't be distracted or text in class cause she will get very butthurt about it and make announcements. Overall a wonderful teacher really engages with students. Only had one exam which was based off the notes and readings. You should do the readings.,1
"Professor K gives great lectures that involve real life situations. Gives study guides for exams, so do them and you'll pass just fine. Attendance is mandatory. No paper just a few hw assignments and two midterms and final. Would take another class for sure.",1
"She cares for her students and really wants them to pass. She also breaks down what you have to do well enough to understand, easy going and so joyful. I'd highly recommend her.",1
"Professor Wu is a very nice guy, he allows cheat sheets on tests and doesn't have too many exams. Be sure to put everything on your cheat sheet! His lectures are hard to understand what's relevant, and for his lab projects make sure you attend those classes because his instructions are vague at best.",1
She has a Phd in genetics but that doesn't translate well to AP. She is almost as confused by the material as the students. Test questions may be randomly plucked from the text. Only 8 students out of 24 left from all the course drops. Massive amount of material. I study every night for 2 hours or more for the A I currently have. You will struggle.,0
The class and lectures are very interesting but be prepared to write down everything said in lecture. The quizzes and finals are made from whats covered in lecture and the answers can't be found online. Make sure to attend class or else you won't get a good grade on the quizzes.,1

"One of the BESTTT professors at UCF. He is so passionate, energetic, excited and knowledgeable about the subject which makes his class a breath of fresh air and really easy to follow along. He does optional zoom lectures that are very interesting. Always clear on deadlines, schedules, and what to expect for the week coming. Such a great,fun class!",1
Teaches at a graduate level although it was an undergraduate course (non-profit mngmt).  Course should have been taught very simply to get an idea of the non-profit world - instead class was put in groups to create our own non-profit organization from soup to nuts.  Excessive amounts of work and writing.  Very helpful but not quite as effective.,1
"I was terrified of theory but she made it so easy.  online, open note tests. doesn't post the notes on blackboard. you have to go to class but she keeps it interesting.  breaks down the writing so that it is much easier.  extremely helpful if you need it. need the book. ",1
I loved this class! You will have one powerpoint presentation to present. Study from her lectures and participate in the labs by completing all assignments and you will pass. Dont skip labs! You don't need the book. She is very caring and willing to help you in any way possible. Take her for all science classes if possible!,1
Kathy is the type of professor who will not give an A. She really makes her students work for the A. This is a HEAVY WRITING course so be prepared to write a lot. She is tough when it comes to grammar and will dock points for every little missed comma or capitalization errors. She only lets you miss 3 classes before she docks you a letter grade.,1
Tests are just like the homeworks this is usually the case for lazy professors. However he cares a lot about his students. Gives excellent lectures.,1
One of the best professors Ive had. I respect her so much & appreciate all she does for her students. I love how passionate she is about what shes teaching. Shell make students participate in discussions only because she cares & wants to hear you out. I love that she makes you feel comfortable in class. I highly recommend taking her class!,1
He is an awesome teacher! Very caring and personable. Would recommend!,1
"I love Mr. Ariail!!! I took his capstone class for my Associates Degree. Great way to finish off the semesters at TCC. He offers a great business simulation that is really fun. He, himself, is very fun and comfortable. I took his class Saturday mornings for 3 hours and looked forward to each one!",1
"Temple expects students to know really difficult proofs. He can't explain anything to save his life, and his class is awfully managed. He says he's going to cover one thing in the syllabus, and ignores his plan in lecture. In discussions, TAs cover completely unrelated material. This is why professors should not have tenure.",0
"The most interesting professor I have met! He is hilarious and if you're having a bad day, your day will get better with his humor. He is very considerate and open minded. Listen to his lectures, do well on group projects, do the group labs and you'll pass.",1
"One of the best Professors in Concordia University. Crystal clear lectures, On time feedbacks. Very inspirational.",1
"She is a very sweet and caring professor. She inspired me to never give up playing piano. I thoroughly enjoyed her class, it was super fun. I recommend anyone to take her. Try not to miss class though, every class is essential to pass the course with a good grade.",1
Professor Gibson is awesome. Show up for class do the work and pass. She teaches you how to write papers step by step. Easy A if you really try.,1
An awsome teacher. Can sometimes ramble in Japanese and lose you but overall she's an awsome teacher. And HOT!!!,1
Don't take advanced auditing without taking him!,1
"The lectures are really boring, but occasionally he will show a movie that will make the content more interesting.  It's important to read the textbook, but the tests are split almost evenly between lecture and reading material.  Attendance is checked about three times, but he warns you ahead of time.",1
"Do NOT take this class with this professor!!! She is a tough grader and can come off very rude when you have questions. I would go above and beyond, completed all of my work on time and always received zeros. Best advise I could give other students is to find another professor to take BIO with. I never write reviews but I had to warn you guys!",0
"Dr. Zarb is my advisor and one of the best teachers at Riddle... Very Funny Guy... If you speak italian you're gona have a blast talking to this guy on the breaks... His Maltese background and accent are hillarious... Very good, very interesting classes and a great person!!!",1
"I really like Prof Poole, her lectures are engaging and she's really good at explaining things. The course is pretty easy, but make sure you read the textbook.",1
All i have to say is he gave us another revamp on how to do math.,1
"Despite previous reviews, she is PHENOMENAL! She is a tough grader but she gives herself that status right away. She gives great feedback and is always available if you need help or have questions. She gives great memory tricks and is very good about explaining things that may be harder to understand. Amazing. 10/10 would recommend.",1
PSU would be a better University if there were more professors as dedicated and understanding as Dr. Brennan,1
You'd better be prepared to regurgitate conservative viewpoints and hold Scalia in the same air as Moses and Gerber himself.,0
"I took ""Exploring Photography"" with her as an introductory class. It's a pretty laid-back class, no homework other than the four major assignments. Participation is essential to getting a good grade, in the sense that she likes you go explain your thought process at critiques. She can be a little sassy, but has an overall funhappy persona. :)",1
Miss Sexton is amazing! I saw a post where someone said if you miss with a doctors excuse she wouldn't allow a make up but that's not true. I missed and she helped me loads. She teaches hard subjects so the student has to work and study but she helps any way she can. Loved her! ,1
"Meyer makes you think his class is really easy throughout the quarter, but then he's really obscure about how he grades. Basically, the only feedback I got was A/A- on the midterm and then he dropped an A- on me for the quarter even though I participated and was in class every day.",0
"Prof.Gilbert's class was life changing. If you've ever thought that there is more to philosophy than the critical-logical approach, try his class. No guarantees on whether you will be able to keep up, even though he is helpful, the material isn't easy. Expect to really walk away with something at the end of the day though.",1
"Under the impression teaching A&P was not her first choice and it shows. She is a speed reader and will not slow down to give time for note taking from the time class starts until 5 minutes after. No make-ups, no late work, no excused absences, doesn't present the material in a clear way. Minimum of 15 hr study week, no multiple choice test. ",0
He's the best professor I've had. His lectures were really helpful.,1
"Best. Language Class. Ever. If you've heard that Chinese is super hard to learn and are worried about taking this class, don't be. Yue Laoshi is an amazing professor and you can really tell that she cares about teaching. If you're looking for an easy A, this isn't the class for you but if you want to learn Chinese, there isn't a better class.",1
"Mook is one of the worse professors I ever had in UB. He had failed to provide bare minimum requirement of the contents for the course (ie competent notes, and lecture recording). Avoid this guy at any cost.",0
"She is honestly one of the best math teachers ive ever had, she spends a lot of time making sure all of her students are understanding the material and spends a lot of time trying to explain things you don't understand. She is very easily reached and is by far one of the best math teachers on campus :^)",1
"Good prof; very engaging and enthusiastic about topics and conversation regarding the course; can be a bit over-enthusiastic when this was a morning class, but overall easy to talk to and approachable. Would recommend for a research paper prof.",1
"Loved this class. Brad was super helpful when it came to writing papers. Participation really does matter, speak up in group discussions and you will do fine. He's very nice and is passionate about what he teachers. Assigns 3 papers. No tests. Overall great class, and I learned to love and appreciate poetry. My favorite teacher at FSU.",1
"TAKE HIM!! If you struggle with Math just like I did, he will help you out. He may seem to speed through some of the math problems, but if you just ask, he will take time to explain it to you and re-do it if needed. He really wants you to succeed. If you don't pass his class, it's because you did not try. Get him during priority Registration!",1
"Great teacher. Attendance is mandatory, but every class is awesome so it's not an issue. You learn a ton about the making of films and how to get more out of them. You watch a full movie in almost every class, and always tons of relevant clips. Teaches everything well, too. Can't go wrong with him.",1
"He is a great professor who cares about his students and also he tries to accommodate  everyone. He is one of the best teachers you will find at ECC. Before any tests or quiz, he goes through review with you and also he breaks down his work step by step",1
"I took Mr.B for summer & It turned out better than expected. Mr.B has great videos and if you follow through you will be just fine. There's HW but it's only 10%, If you watch his videos and take notes you will be able to pass his quizzes & exams. The final is easy (40% of grade) & you can take a full page (back & front) of notes! I say go for it!",1
"Great prof! I enjoy his class, and humor. If you like the office and 24, you will get along great. Tests were moderately difficult, study hard and you do fine. I got an A.",1
"Very easy class and the professor is cool.  I had a point where I missed a bunch of days and was really far behind but he let me turn everything in for full credit.  Really nice guy, you'll like him.",1
"She is really into the topics and If you're not into it (most probably aren't) do not take her. She is a touch grader and has quizzes every class, a map quiz, midterm, in class writing essay, and a final. She is not approachable and a lil rude. The worst part of class is when she asks difficult questions and calls out people at the end of lectures.",0
"Ms. Michelfelder was very good at being clear and precise with her lectures.  Sometimes lectures were long and boring, however manageable.  Notes are available online via powerpoint.  Easy class, but not a blow off.  Lowest test score is replaced by your attendance percentage (if its beneficial to your grade). ",1
"Dr. Mata is  a great person who really knows his stuff. The problem is, he is not at all tech-savvy. So the class was very disorganized and due dates were unclear (although he did not deduct points for late work). D2L was very confusing as there were readings mixed in with course material. Easy A, but it is so confusing that it is almost stressful.",1
"Taking this class is the biggest waste of my life. Matlab and maple are basic tools for computation and Engineering etc, you DON'T sit in a classroom to learn the how to use the tools!Latex is completely useless. You can achieve the same much easier with Word and other math symbol typers. Also, Prof Gupta gives the most boring lectures on earth.",0
"I didn't even understand everything he said but still got an A. Make sure you attend every class, follow his directions and turn your assignments in and you should be good.",1
He is a good professor after every class he will ask if you have any question to ask or see him in his office I wish we had more professors like him very helpful if you don't ask for help is your job to ask he will even tell us to finish what we have stared not to give up,1
"As terrible at math as I am, Professor Conner was wonderful! She is so helpful and willing to help any student out. She does give a lot of homework, but it really helps you to master the material. I would definitely take her again!",1
I took the night class which was like 3 hours long and he always made us stay until the very last second which would be fine if he wasn't so boring! He's cocky and makes you buy books that he wrote to read for the class. He talks about stuff that has nothing to do with sociology and he doesnt make sense. I dropped this class after the first week.,0
Super Easy. No midterm. No final. each week you will either write a comparative essay or take an open book online quiz. Easiest class in the world. I suggest him to everyone.,1
Awesome teacher! His classes are vey fun and productive. Time goes by fast having him as a professor! Very outgoing and animated,1
"Attendance is not required but lecture material is on the exams, so you should probably go to class",1
I dont understand how anyone says they like prof kaur. her class is extremely boring!!! she lectures the whole class and never closes her mouth so her students can get a word in. she makes you read the worst pieces of lit. she also loves to regurgitate dates at you like a history prof. i don't recommend her to anyone and will never take her again!!,0
"Dr. Lockhart is the best. I had him for a five-week online Sociology course (during the pandemic). Even through email and announcements, he was always so kind and respectful. He keeps an open mind and seems to really value what each person has to say. He assigned a lot of discussion boards, which were fun and never very difficult. I love him.",1
Dr. Searfoss was a good teacher. I had her for zoom university. She gives a pile of hw once a week(takes about 45min to do) Slow talker but you get use to it. Not a difficult class if you pay attention and take notes,1
"READ THE BOOK. Lectures are not specific enough to prep for the exam. Go through all of the problems at the end of the book to do well. Exams are super specific and the grading is awful. Don't beat yourself up if you get your first D on his exam bc 50% of your grade is the final. Avoid if possible, or be prepared to work hard with little guidance.",0
Professor Rice is very rude to students. She takes forever to grade quizzes and lab reports. She is a tough grader on both (especially lab reports). I got anxiety walking to her class because I was worried I had done something wrong and she would kick me out of lab (which she did one time because a student wore the wrong type of socks). Avoid her!,0
"He is a great prof. lectures are fun and intresting. Yet, tests are really hard. I read all chapters, went to every class, and studied and still got a C. So if you are a slacker do not take him.",1
"I've had bad proffs before but Mr. Haze is very unorganized it's almost unprofessional. He talks a lot about irrelevant things and his directions are so vague and poorly put together be it verbal directions or even written. He doesn't grade timingly ,doesn't keep your grade current,and just generally isn't very direct or responsive when confronted.",0
Extremely hard grader. He is very smart and lectures the entire class. He gives breaks in the middle which last about a minute. very hard to follow and gives a ton of information. only take this class if you love reading the textbook every night.,0
I had to take this online stats course for my program and was not looking forward to it at all. Turns out that this the best class I have taken in my 3 years at university. Dr. Devey actually cares how you do in the class and he's put together all kinds of activities (including badges!) to keep you interested in the course. Wish he taught more!,1
Good prof and very care about students. She could explain the question very clear but her test was very hard. Her few extra credit can not change the grade and some questions of the test are you never seen before.,0
"Dr. Keeling is a great professor! You can tell she cares a lot about the class and students. You're expected to buy about 20 children's books, and read a book, sometimes 2 every week, which need to be read to do the correlating journal entries. She assigns several outlines/papers thought the semester, but she clearly defines what she expects.",1
"Professor Perez may come across as a hard ass, however she is one of the sweetest professors you can have if you work with her and get to know her. Don't miss any classes cause she will give you extra credit for attending all her classes. No phone use in class she's very strict. But, if you participate regularly, she'll work with you.",1
"His class is structured with his own interest in mind rather than students, a series of tricks/gimmicks, seems he is interested in making life more difficult/not expanding knowledge. Changes grading criteria, hides info so that you can only get from his office hours, bizarre test structures which test memory not knowledge, plays favors. Got A tho",0
"Biochemistry is a complex subject to study. But, Dr. Kim makes the class easier by telling you what will be on the exams when you attend class. Plus she is very helpful during her office hours. If you study everyday you will pass!",1
"If you go to class and pay attention, you'll be fine. She helps you along the way, so just do what youre supposed to and not to mention, she is a gorgeous...no problem attending class.",1
Tough tests you can't image!!,0

"Took Public Speaking Spring 15. Class was easy because I took Speech Comm in Fall 12. I somehow still got a B, did the math and it was because of the tests on book material we never specifically reviewed ever in class. If you're not shy in a classroom and can do some research for a speech, this class should be fine for you.",1
This professor was a tough grader and very specific in grading . She took a long time to grade assignments which made it very frustrating. When asked for help she forwarded general information to blackboard as oppose to specifically answering my question based on my work. I wish I did not buy the book as well as more of her study guides were used.,0
"One of the most interesting class taught by the best professor for it. Professor Michal gets you thinking and encourages you to speak your mind. Though I find it impossible to fail the class, you will definitely have to earn your A. Be sure to participate frequently!",1
"He is by far one of the best professors I've ever had. He is very willing to help and gives extra credit all the time. I am purposely taking him again and would recommend taking him, without a doubt.",1
"Proff. Mancini is a great teacher for SDV. I've heard that some ppl say that teachers take to long to get to the point, but if you take Mancini that wont be the case! There are weekly assignments, but they're pretty straightforward. She makes lecture fun and the longest class we had was 40 mins tops. She is caring and funny.",1
"Professor takes some warming up to, but she is cool AS HELL. She's the type of professor where you wish you met in high school, because she just has the cool vibe about her. Professor is very well articulated and very evidently educated. And I love how her class is, like, history class in Professor Smith's POV",1
Koh is a very caring and understanding professor. He wants to make sure students learn in his class and it shows. He made opportunities to resubmit assignments available and had a great open door policy. He recorded his lectures for students to review them and explained concepts and examples very well.,1
"Experience the class yourself, and you definitely won't regret.",1
"This is NOT an easy A. If you are not fluent in Spanish and want that A, you're going to have to work hard. It's crucial you show up to class! She follows her syllabus religiously and does not remind you when quizzes or assignments are due. It's important to keep track and be organized!  She's tough, but a great professor. ",1
"Went to class twice, got an A. As long as you go over his 3 question practice exams there is no way you would fail, since he gives the same questions on the actual exams. Huge curve, even though everyone did great. If you actually do want to learn though he is actually a very good lecturer too. Take him, you won't regret it!",1
"If you get a chance to take Raynard, absolutely do. You will get both an interesting course and a great professor. Your participation grade is based on quizzes instead of a nebulous idea of what a professor thinks you deserve, just one example of her dedication to fairness in her courses.",1
TOOOOOOOOO SLOWWWWWWW!,0
"Good Prof, very helpful, cares about students, lots of examples. I would take him Again.",1
"Great teacher, but tests are over the top. I'm used to getting 90+ on a test that I study decently for, but with her tests, I spend two days studying and wind up with mid 80's. But she knows her stuff, is very helpful, and gives great feedback.",1
"Dr. Alderete takes an interest in your learning and wants to know about your future. I feel that, because of him, I now know how to read science articles critically and how to write better. I will work full-time in a lab and feel I will be headed to graduate school. I wish my other profs were as challenging and motivating as Dr. Alderete.",1

This class should be at least and easy B.  There are now 4 essays but you can re-write them as many times as you want for a better grade plus you write on whatever you want.,1
"Monica Hall is an amazing professor!  She is very clear when explaining different topics.  BIO 121 is a very difficult class, but she makes the material make sense.",1
"Good professor overall, really knows her stuff. She is funny but stern. Get ready to read a lot of articles, the tests are mainly based off all the articles she assigns. The test questions are very difficult, she asks for very specific things. She allowed our class to have an open computer exams since there were so many articles.",1
"Pat McKean is an amazing professor. He gives you major insight to what it is like in the journalism world, so if you are interested in being a journalists take his class! I did not buy the book and good thing I didn't because he went over the important info in class.  There are many assignments but if you do them in a timely matter you'll be fine. ",1
"awesome teacher, super-cute and her classes/readings are usually pretty interesting. Definitely take one class with her before you graduate!!",1
"Mary is really nice and unbelievably knowledgeable. Her instructions can sometimes be unclear and her assignments are a little out of the box, but the labs are fun and she is a fair grader.",1
"BEST seminar, Dr. Tone has high standards but is a fair grader and gives you every opportunity to do well in class. Read, go to class, speak in seminars and you will not only do well but will learn valuable skills for academic research and writing. One of the best classes I've taken at McGill.",1
"Took a condensed class with Mr. Gier. There is a lot of homework, classwork, participation required but that's College for you. Always on time with grading and feedback. Overall, excellent experience with this online class and excellent teaching from this Professor. Advise to take his class.��",1
"She was always available,personable and laid back. ALl that and she's easy on the eyes, too!",1
"Origins of Life and the Universe: its the same disappointment as the rest. Its a shame because U can tell he loves his field of study. Knowledge of his field is 10 out of 10, knowledge about ""how to teach"" 0 out of 10. Not a clue about Teaching. Its incredible that College & University teachers do not hold a Teaching Certificate!WTF!DO NOT enroll",1
No Comments,1
"He makes the lectures interesting, if sometimes a bit too crazy and off topic. If you just go to class, pay attention, and make a serious attempt at your papers, you'll get a good grade. He never responded to a single email however.",1
"Eric is an awesome professor that genuinely cares about his students. Something to keep in mind is that, while attendance is NOT mandatory he does give RANDOM extra credit points to those that come (by just picking a random day that not many are there). His lectures are very straightforward and he gives you a copy of the notes before class starts.",1
"He is the best!  You'll probably hate him in the beginning, but after the first half of chem110 he turns into such a nice guy!  I was having problems understanding some of the material in che111, and he actually offered to sit down with me and help me understand the material.  He saved my semester!  Sometimes he grades really hard though...",1
"This course is difficult for a lot of people. Statistically, your grade drops 2% for every class missed, which is huge. Jeremy incorporates humor in class. If you get a wrong answer for a minor math error such as 2+25, he won't count the entire problem wrong, if you show your work. He is understanding and flexible if you are serious about class.",1
"With out going to class you will fail. And study by going over the homework not reading the book. I really enjoy Dr. Steward, he is a good prof",0
"His classes are very informative and interactive. Unless you have the time to really stick to the text book and lectures, you'll have a really hard time in his class. He is a really hard marker and has very specific expectations for his assignments. Be prepared to receive lower marks than you expected. I would not take a class with him again.",0
"For both Macro and Micro, this class is fairly simple to succeed in. Mr. Daigle does lecture a fair amount, but if you attend class and take notes on the facts he provides you will be successful. This class requires you study your notes and text but if you are willing to put in the work then you will succeed and learn in this class",1
Teaches straight from the book. Doesn't write anything on the board. Not easy to take notes to refer to later. He was OK as an instructor. Glad I don't have to take anymore of his classes.,0
"Boring, difficult to listen to lectures. You have to write exactly what he wants for papers, or you miss massive points. Avoid if possible.",0
Really fun prof. Made French grammar interesting. I am excited to take another course from her!,1
"One of the easiest and most pointless classes I've ever taken. Didn't learn anything valuable but it's required. Take Lee and not Kraas if you want a good grade. Show up, do projects and online quizzes and you will pass for sure. No need to read textbook, just used it for a few quizzes.",1
"I would not recommend taking an online math class because of the frustration of getting problems wrong because of rounding or technical issues. The computer grading did not offer partial credit. However, the teacher was always quick to give points back when I explained errors. Her grading was fair and she always made herself available to help.",1
"DON'T DO IT. Ryan is very popular with the Advertising students for the lower division classes, but for ICC (Campaigns), he's the most lackadaisical and vague professor to pick. Your grades are pretty much based on his opinions, so you can follow the rubric and STILL get a crappy grade. Instructions are unclear and his organization of the class sux",0
"Fun and quirky guy, but not one of my favorites. Long lectures and assignments as well as lots of reading that'll correspond with the Clicker questions he asks the next lecture. Bit draining especially for those who take the course in the summer.",1
"Professor McLane is really passionate about literature and that translates in the work in which he assigns. The ""abundant weekly papers"" he assigns are at the most 300 words (unless it's an essay which even then are 800 words max). Particpate, show up, and go to his office hours! He is always willing to workshop your papers with you.",1
"I took Hernandez for Span 1 and Rod for Spanish 2. I recommend Rodriguez because he only gave us supersites every week, the midterm, the presentation on food, and the final exam. There were never quizzes or tests at all so it helps if you have other teachers that give out a lot of homework but you still need to study and participate in his class.",1
"Very tough grader and hard class. Would not recommend. He did answer emails fast and was helpful, but papers were very hard to even receive a decent grade",0
"Hard grader, but I've really improved in my writing. Go to the production meeting with a rough draft because she helps you so much in editing your paper to tell you what she wants too see for a decent grade. No tests and she posts the readings. Blog project at the end with 3 stories and a few quizzes & EC make your grade. Not a bad class",1
"Matt was super nice during the whole semester. Never did I get the hint of him being mean, or not caring about any of us in the class!! He really wants you to do great in the class and will help you out in any way he can. Must print out power points and labs to bring to every class, you'll be glad you did because that's pretty much all he tests on.",1
Fantastic teacher. He has the class laughing all the time but he still does well teaching a hard subject. Choose him if you can.,1
"Great guy. Wants you to learn and comprehend the material, not just memorize. His lectures are pretty funny and entertaining. He made me like Chemistry!!",1
His class was easy and straightforward. He made his class engaging and entertaining.,1
I think she is a good teacher and funny too but she needs to learn to be more respectful of students and more understanding!!,0
"She's a very nice person but terrible professor. All we ever did was critiques, which are important, however she has given us hardly any instruction and is very harsh when it comes to critiquing.",0
"It all comes down to a great professor. (Wish i had him for lab too) He makes silly jokes like ATP and kcal9. And I STILL remember them. And that's the point. His lectures aren't boring but memorable. He makes chemistry fun and understandable. Easy A if you just try! Seriously, I'm an English major and he was able to make everything easy to grasp.",1
"As a freshman, I had to take Sociology from Mr. Darman and it was a pretty terrible experience. The class could not be more dead. This guy is the biggest liberal I've ever seen that loves to make up stories that interest almost nobody and talk about his personal life for 2 hours straight. The only learning comes from the text book. Terrible grader.",0
"Her classes are extremely boring.  Although she does let you copy her slide shows from her website, you still have to show up for class... and all she does is read the slide show to you.  And she cant dress appropriately (stomach hanging out) but tells you to dress for your mentor teacher. I dont quite understand that. And group work? come on!",0
"She is a great teacher.  Pay attention in class, and make sure you do the  homework.  If you do that, the tests will be pretty easy.  She is also very helpful.",1
"This teacher can, and most likely will, drive you up a wall if you actually want to learn. He goes WAY off topic when lecturing (his stories are either funny, weird, or just annoying). His grading is fine and the essays are basic, time consuming assignments. It's simple to pass his class especially if you do his many extra credit assignments.",0
"Professor Kumari's online class is extremely easy. I didn't do any of the 3 discussion boards (4 discussion boards in 1) and I missed 1 of 3 tests (not proctored, aced 1 and failed the other) and ended the class with a B. Read the material, do all of the homework, practice homework, and quizzes and you are golden :D",1
Great class!  He was a great professor.  Make sure to do the reading!,1
"This teacher is super nice, she cares about you and youre education as well... I took her late start online class, you will have to read a textbook, and take exams every week, they are easy and obviously open notes/textbook. Easy pass if you get your work done.",1
great teacher!,1
Awful professor. Her lectures are just completely boring and she makes no sense whatsoever. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. She states test is based of her PowerPoints however many topics that we were tested on was not in her PowerPoint. Lab is fun but again most of the time students were lost. I am surprised she is rated a 4/5.,0
I had Polanco for Public Speaking and I never dreaded going to her class. Her grading criteria is exactly how the syllabus states. If you have perfect attendance she gives you a great amount of bonus points at the end of the semester. Speeches are not graded too hard. Expect to watch videos outside of class for homework. Quizzes are simple.,1
"Really easy teacher, awesome dude. Funny/stupid humor. Tough grader on essays but he will really help you out on proofreading it. Definitely take his class. You can probably get away with not having the textbook at all.",1
Dr. Kaur is one of the nicest and most enthusiastic professors you'll have at WPU. She is very passionate about her job. She will give you readings. Read them if you want to pass the class. They are short and simple. Class was not very demanding; it was relatively easy. Dont ever be late! She hates that. You will love her. Take her!,1
Boring class but easy. He is nice and wants to help. Would recommend if you need to take BMIS,1
OK,1
Finishing up American Literature I now. The class insnt too bad. Stagg always answered my questions quickly and provided examples. I liked most of the assigned reading. The course was easy to follow with lots of resources.,1
"Saralina's like a ball of sunshine, and I really appreciated that for a 9:00 am class! The only time I felt particularly frustrated was when I received grades. She's a tough grader, which is not a bad thing. The issue is that her feedback on papers tends to be sparse and vague, so I didn't have a clear path for improvement. Beyond that she's great",1
Easy class I guess... but he gives a ton of homework and kind of a picky grader..,0
he offers so much extra credit theres no way anyone could fail his class. he made understand the math lesson easy but i always did my homework in the math lab incase i had questions.,1
"This was a well organized online class, and I learned a lot. My main issue was that I could not reach him by email or blackboard. He rarely responded to messages. Nevertheless, if you follow the homeowner, the quizzes are easy. I did not use any of his lessons during the course so I don't have a comment on that.",0
HE IS GREAT. TAKES THE TROUBLE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHILNG IN DETAIL AND I LEARNED ALOT FROM HIM. RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY,1
I cannot begin to express how amazing this professor is. She was truly one of the best professors I have ever encountered. Super understanding and motivating. she makes her class fun and I actually look forward to doing her assignments. She is truly a gem. You will not regret taking her. The material is so straight forward and she is super organize,1
He was always glad to answer questions after class and course requirements and expectations were clearly defined.,1
"He has a very superficial understanding of sociological theories and does more preaching than teaching. He teaches with a heavy bias, outdated facts, and outdated materials. However, he is very nice, forgiving, and encourages in class/ outside of class discussions. The midterm/final are given and the class comes with five short papers. Easy A.",0
"Very clear instructions, wants everyone to participate. If you read the stories and attend class you will receive a good grade. Makes class interesting and choosing books with great topics. Overall a great professor.",1
"Jenneke is awesome, she has been the best teacher I have ever had! Zij is een heel leuke meisje!",1
"His lectures didn't help with the tests. He lectures from a completely different book. So,  in turn,  his tests are very difficult because he will ask questions about stuff he never lectured on! He gives a lot of homework and there was so much to do that the homework didn't help me understand anything.  I would not recommend this teacher. ",1
I've had this instructor for 1301 and 1302. He's always willing to answer my questions seriously even answered one in the middle of the night. The test are pretty easy. The essays can be a challenge. But he's always around to help.,1
"The homework, you will need to fix his spelling errors. Whilst the homework assigned is long, the homework is easy. However you may completely understand the topics being tested yet be cruelly graded.(the general layout of class is efficient and he gives great lectures) No response ->emails, takes too long to open Dropbox too",0
"She allows students to learn bits at a time than at the end bring it all together. After every class, I feel truly inspired by the story she shares that are always applicable to what we're learning. She taught me more than how to be good writer, she taught me how to see the bigger picture in life to take it one day at a time and to fail forward.",1
"Professor demanded perfection from students while constantly being late on his promises to the class. He pushed deadline for the final assignment 3 times, totaling two weeks and and kept failing to provide the assignment specs. In the end, he didn't even provide what he had promised and basically said ""too bad."" There were also lectures missing.",0
"She's great.  At first, she comes off as intimidating, but she is actually very easy-going and approachable.  She tells you exactly what you need to do to receive a good grade in the lab.  Some of the experiments are tedious - obviously not her fault",1
"This guy is THE BOMB!  You may often find yourself bored off your ass in his class, but when you tune into his slow, but intent manner of speaking, you realize he is giving you the best advice that you could use as an actor. Work your ass off outside of class, and you won't have a problem coasting by IN class",1
Everyone seems to give her a bad rap for her teaching. She is a great teacher and you will certainly learn your stuff. She gets a bad rap because people are lazy and dont want to work hard. Lab is tough but extra credit and curves make up for it. Best advice I can give you is make friends fast and study with them. Class is very doable,1
Worst teacher ever. Literally piles on and I mean PILES on the work. Test are timed in a short period so you get less then a minute on each question and she expects that to be normal. And these are problems you have to write out. Horrible. Do not take,0
Pretty good proof. He is fair with grades when he grade the course work.,1
"ALOT of reading exams could be confusing by the way they were worded Show up to class and take notes and you'll pass, amazing lectures.",1
"He was a great professor! His main priority was making sure that you got a good grade. He checks to see if you do your hw or if you just copy the answer key... His tests were pretty easy and if there was something that you didn't know, he will probably tell you what the word meant (even if you were supposed to know it.).  THE FINAL WAS REALLY EASY!",1
"He's a great professor.  He makes the material easy to understand.  He wrote the book so you do have to spend $ on that in the bookstore, but its easy to follow and homework questions are easy.  Quizzes are based off those. Discussion boards are typical and he stays on top of them.  Gives you months to do the paper.  He really is a good professor!",1
"Chooljian is one of the most difficult professors I've ever had. If you're looking for an easy A, this is not the course for you. Chooljian is very respected because you really have to work to earn your grade. She does not give handouts and will not sugar coat anything, but I will be a better nurse because of how much I had to study for this class.",1
Great feedback on writing. Very flexible and understanding if you need extra time on assignment. Other students say she is critical but I found her very fair. She pushes you.,1
He does everything using activities rather than lectures.   I thought that was helpful in demonstrating the concepts in ways that I could see.  It also helped with practice with calculations so by the time the exams came I had done the calculations plenty of times.,1
Took summer course for PHIL 1304. Very clear outline in the syllabus. As long as you participated in discussion boards and did the web assignments on time you should do fine. All quizes and the final were open note. I honestly phoned it in a lot because I was starting a new job during this semester and still made an A+.,1
One of the nicest professors I've had. The class is not that hard. If you just show up and listen to the lectures it will make the test really easy. Had a group project but was not that bad. I ended up with a 3.7 and used sparknote for the last half of the semester,1
"He sucks tbh. He wont let you ask other students for HELP (he considered it cheating) hell call you out for other students to see, rude, unprofessional, and a horrible source of help or guidance. Dont take.",0
Listen to me! If you are planning on taking her class RUN! as far away as possible you wont pass. She is the worst professor at Valencia. You will not learn you will write 8 papers every Wednesday. And her test is hard even the multiple choice but majority of her test is open answer and all she talks about is giraffes! Online work kills you! RUN,0
"She is a horrible instructor. She ""acts"" like she doesn't understand you when you sign, and make you do it over and over again. She is the worst ASL teacher at Mesa. She says the students are below what ASL 4 students should be at and says the other ASL teacher are not doing their job. Take some one else!!",0
Dr. Harris was an amazing professor! He makes the lectures more interesting and the iClicker questions were a lot of helpful in the class. All of the work in the class was online that way it will make things much easier and more time to work on your other classes and still pass the class.,1
Do not take this class! Our Final exam was too long and he sent out an email before the exam saying he knows it is too long and doesn't expect us to finish it in time. Also the exams are very proof heavy. He flips a coin just 10 mins before each exam to decide if he should proctor it. Skip this class if you can.,0
"Do not take this class whatever you do. If you want to learn calculus you are better looking at youtube tutorials than learning it here. If you do not spend 5+ hours studying the homework (Given every 2 days) then you will fail the class. If you do take Eran Makover, Good luck!",0
"All I can say is DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. I took him last semester, his test is crazy hard. NO REVIEWS TEST. A LOT OF HOME WORKS. He said that he have extra credits in EXAM. TRUST ME, you will never get 100% of the test. If you guys think that I didn't study and just blame on him. I HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES IN HIS CLASS BUT I CAN'T GET AN ""A"".",0
"This is a HORRIBLE professor! Her tests are way too hard for a principles class, she doesn't allow a formula sheet, will not help you if you go to her office for help. The first test most people scored in the 60's and lower. She completely refuses extra credit or curving grades. This is the second time Ive taken this class...and there will be a 3rd",0
"“Best prof” at Hamilton?  Werner is smug, self-absorbed, and aloof, except to a few of his favorites.  He shows little interest in student opinions.  He plays mind games.  He penalizes students for not meeting his hidden expectations.  That all adds up to one lousy professor.  I got a decent grade from him, but I found him distasteful.  Avoid him.",0
Take sociology of aging if you have any interest in the field of gerontology. Dr. Mclaughlin is a great lecturer. But take good notes in this class! And keep up with the reading.,1
"2 papers, one final, journals on books due every class or an outline. LOTS of reading but it is fairly simple. The second half of the semester focuses on chapter books / first half on picture books. Decent grader on papers - around a B average. Final exam is fairly simple BUT you must read the books. Participation MATTERS.",1
"Dr. Phil Schertzing is a great professor. He provides feedback, guidance and insight and feedback on assignment.",1
"Sarcastic and rude.  Does not care about her students and loves to kick people out of lab for any reason she can find.  Wrote up 25 students for academic dishonesty in one semester. Many of which claim was a false accusation and had to get appealed.  Doesn't grade anything on time, doesn't give good directions, and takes off points any chance given",0
"Dr. Shively is legitimately my favorite professor or teacher I have EVER had. I have learned more from her than just about any professor on KU's campus, and I respect and admire her as my mentor and as a friend. If ever you have an opportunity to take a class with her, please, please do. She is truly incredible.",1
"Prof. Morano is incredible! Super funny, take her for Reading Prose! It's a great class with great books! There is a bit of reading, but nothing serious. Overall, I would take her class 10000 times over! Interesting and insightful!",1
"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",0
"Dude, you are teaching an INTRODUCTORY class to ACCOUNTING, one of the toughest subject ever. Students just don't come in and pick up debits/credits or balance sheets right off the bat. He really screwed my accounting GPA over.",0
An amazing lecturer that does a phenomenal job at engaging with students. He always gives some back story on the material which makes the concepts much more interesting. Really knows his stuff and is very approachable.,1
"Unless you enjoy terrible teachers, do not take Dr. O'Gorman's class.  He is as liberal as they come, and he thinks that everyone is a political science major (and he grades accordingly).  I can honestly say that he is the worst professor I have ever had.",0
"DEF TAKE. he is kind of slow with replying to e-mails but there is so little to do in this class. 4 quizzes, all non cum, about 5 discussion boards that take not even 10 mins to do. 2 exams, non cumulative. one 8-10 page paper but EASY. exams are easy since half of questions come from the quizzes. I got an A. he has an EC in person meeting, GO.",1
"This lab professor is not helpful at all.  He always changes his mind so don't believe what he say. Every class meeting, you will need to do your teaching presentation. He would pick on people during their presentation. He expect you to know everyting!!! if he ask a quetion and you don't know the anwer to it, he will lower your grade.",0
"Not the most cogent lecturer and a very harsh grader on homework assignments and exams. That said, perseverance can enable you to do well in his course. Just be sure to rely on Paul's Online Notes as a quintessential supplement to his lectures (which are incidentally copied and pasted from your textbook). Eastern style of teaching/grading.",0
"She is very nice and a good professor. Be sure to take notes of what she says, not just expecting to read from the PowerPoint. Tests are open book but that makes them very specific and difficult (unavoidable some questions will come out of nowhere). But if you organize yourself you can pass.",1
There were several beginners but most of class had a ton of experience and many were already working in this field yet no one in class came close to knowing what the instructor knew. He was extremely knowledgeable and made  complicated topics easy to understand. He does have an illness that caused him to miss a few classes.,1
"Jeanette is a great teacher. She made lectures fun and meaningful in real life. The Target project was also a great experience. She was always there for her students to help on the report. Though she can be vague sometimes, I see it as she wanted to guide students toward a right direction, instead of flat-out giving the answers.",1
Very easy A if you read the texts he gives and do all the papers. Super nice and understanding. Makes topics about social issues going on now. I would recommend.,1
"If you are an english ed major, this class will definitely benefit towards building your own ""teaching philosophy."" There is a fine line on teaching someone how to teach, and this class really puts you in the teacher's shoes.",1
Expect to receive most of your learning experience by reading the book. I'm upset this teacher talked about everything but accounting for most of class. Homework given but randomly requested back for grading. No study guides for tests. Interested in busting people on cells or talking than more than teaching. Couldn't learn.,0
"easy peasy lemon squeezy. his quizzes are the notes as well as the exam. One page quiz (about 5)and exam (7-8). You don't have to use your brain much, just memorize. He can be a little intimidating at first, since he calls names, but he rarely does it after a while. and he just asks dumb questions when he calls on you, don't be scared. 10/10",1
"Wow, I loved having her this semester. She's sweet and soft spoken, and really knows what she's talking about. She can explain just about everything and tries to accommodate to her class major demographic. Her tests are a little tough, but she gives you hints where to study and some extra credit occasionally (which I needed). She made geology fun.",1
"If you took Intro to Chem in HS prior to this class, you might want to reconsider! There is loads of homework (online, texbook, lab, etc.) & so much money to be spent all on supplies for the class. Easy grading if you do all the work, but 4 midterms is NOT it. She expects you to memorize absolutely everything. Had to drop due to too much stress!",0
"I read the reviews for other classes and did not think it described the professor I took, however, I will be honest, She is a very late grader, her communication is not great, and it feels like you are working on the same project the whole semester but, when she does answer she is helpful, her grading isn't terrible as long as you put in the work.",1
"I sm majoring in business so I had to take Macroeconomics. Be warned you have to teach yourself in this class. Most of what you learn will be on the test, but some questions you have to read 3-4 times cause they are ""trick"" questions. You are required to do a paper at the end about how to boost Maine's economy, and she gives no help whatsoever!!!!",0
"Stockton is much more laid back, understanding, and accommodating than he first seems. His lectures can get boring sometimes, but overall he's a very funny dude. I barely read the material and would miss class on occasion, but his LA, Kortney is AMAZING. Go to her sessions and you will do fine. I would highly recommend Stockton.",1
"I've had this professor a few times, he's amazing. He is very approachable, his lectures are absolutely fantastic and easy to follow, homework is easy, exams are multiple choice and he gives you plenty of material to study from (old exams + the answers, and study guide) . Everything is posted online, he'll even record lectures if you want him to!",1
"I took Historic Papermaking and Book Structure in Fall and I learned so much from Gail, and I ended up with so many amazing books and handmade paper! It's quite a bit of work, but nothing more than expected from a standard studio class. Would definitely take again! Gail is a great resource.",1
"Prof. Fowler is great! While her lectures are usually unfocused, she bubbles over with enthusiasm about her subject. Prof. Fowler has also been really    accessible outside of class; she visited nearly every section before the exam. It is tough, but a little studying and you can ace it!",1
"Professor Tang is amazing! Her lectures are engaging, and she was always willing to help out. I wouldn't consider English a strength of mine, but she was a pretty easyfair grader. Only two papers and one final paper for the class. ",1
"Best professor I've had here at St. Thomas! Really cares about all her students, super nice, easy, and makes class a lot of fun. I was hesitant to take it as an 8am but she made it go by fast and let us out 10 mins early each time (sometimes more if the weather is nice). Understands this is likely the last Spanish class needed for credit. Take her!",1
Doesn't take attendance but if you want a good grade you should show up and do the home works! Tests are hard so study in advance! A lot of memorization is needed! Moore is a great professor she's respectful to students and engaging. Definitely take her!,1
John Shon's class was a pleasure to be in. He made Accounting interesting and showed he was very knowledgable about the subject matter. His grading criteria is clear and the quizzes and mid-term were easy if you studied and paid attention in class. A good man and pretty funny as well.,1
really nice...well spoken  good sense of humor and sense of how to help his students. very approachable.,1
Dr. Nussbaum is an amazing professor! Extremely helpful and nice. I wish he taught more then this class!,1
"Dr. Wike is a very knowledgeable in her area and made this class something I enjoyed learning about. She grades kind of hard, but if you put in a good amount of effort you will do well. If you are pre-med or anything of that nature I would recommend this class because it brings up relevant issues!!!",1
"Professor Wahl is the epitome of an engineer. He is professional, ethical, moral, and extremely intelligent. If your goal is to learn engineering, then take classes from professor Wahl.",1
"exellent instructor!!! always look forward to his classes. writing was not an interest to me (couldn't write APA style to save my life) til i met this man. Really detailed oriented, you'll enjoy this instructor.",1
"By  far the worst professor ever taken out of 4 years of  school. she goes on about her  personal life .waste of time and doesn't grade clearly  , i would recommend another professor if this is your major",0
Hes a great guy. Hes caring to his students that show up to class and make an effort to participate. I learned so much in his class because he made me think. He calls on you randomly so you always have to be prepared. Take his class! You will learn and meet one of the greatest professors at PBSC,1
"I had her for my first year seminar. She is amazing. The class was really hard, especially since I've never done philosophy and it's really a different way of thinking. But for me, it was amazingly fun. Plus Prof. Vavova is amazing. She's really funny and knows a lot about what she's talking about. I love her so much. I want to go to class.",1
"I enjoyed Professor Casada and the way he ran his online Psychology class. There's an online book you'll need to purchase but no need for the hard copy unless you want it for reference material. Straightforward, lots of questions on hw & tests but you'll learn better for it. Interactive with class discussions to participate in & quick to reply.",1
"This isn't a particularly deep dive into political theory, but Solari's lectures were good for the most part and the class provides a spring board for further individual examination of the topic.",1
Very helpful and is an amazing painter!,1
Stewart is very particular. He likes things to be very precise so when doing assignments or essays keep in mind that he wants you to be detailed--almost painstakingly so...,1
"This class was not worth taking. I didn't enjoy the class at all, if you don't understand something he yells and slams his hands down on the table. He is very rude and doesn't help you understand anything in the course. The course itself is hard if you don't understand the materiel and has a lot of math work in it.  Maybe try another teacher.",0
Great Teacher. Music requires practice.,1
"One of my favorite professors so far. He truly cares about each and everyone one of his students and is a great resource for professional advise. His self deprecating humor can be a little annoying after a while, but other than that, zero complaints. Exam is Multiple Choice, tough but fair. No hiding the ball. I will take home again.",1
"Very Unorganized!! Knows his things well, but cant teach!!",0
"Though I have a bit of an interest in Dr. Jacobson's class, I honestly just took it for the credit. Regardless, her lass was the most enjoyable I've had so far at YC. I definitely would recommend taking any of her classes just for the chance to be there.",1
"I loved Professor Haldane. She was always so enthusiastic when it came to class and learning the new material. 2 Exams, weekly WTLs, and a project. The exams are straight up vocabulary, the only thing difficult is trying to learn all 40 words per chapter. if you study vocabulary really well you will get an easy A.",1
"Professor Pilkington is very caring and always has a smile on her face! She is a great Spanish teacher and wants everyone to do well. Group activities help you get used to speaking the language instead of just writing or doing grammar. The activities are relatively simple but are helpful to do them. The class was fun and easy, so that's a win win!",1
"Avoid Mook at all cost. Where the other professors/sections curve, Mook did not. Also his class is significantly harder than the other professors to(We learn more material than them). And his lecturing style is atrocious. All he does is make terrible jokes and does no example problems. Final was insanely hard(worth 40% to). HW at timesis impossible",0
Amazing teacher. I love her teaching style and will 100% take her class again. I feel like she does a great job of helping each student in any way they learn. Shes so kind and understanding!,1
"Catherine is very personable and helpful outside of class. She takes the time to work with each individual. Most of all, she makes the work interesting and is super funny!",1
"Professor Ken, was a really nice guy. He really cared about teaching, and impacting our lives with what he taught. 10Lectures were sometimes boring, but overall really good class. Minimal homework, and most of the assignments he gave were pretty easy, and as long as you had the format he requested, it was an easy A.",1
Did not like her class at all. I had her class last semester and when she would teach she would go off topic and talk really slow. she is rude and reads off of her powerpoints. she does not give out reviews for tests.,0
"Professor Seymour is really lenient. Most of the grades are from quizzes and tests but they are easy, if you follow the lecture notes. The lectures are very fast and simple to understand. I would highly suggest you take this class, he likes students to participate in conversations it makes the class enjoyable.",1
"Dr. Creed is probably my favorite professor that I have had so far at the College. He WILL make you work for a good grade and the tests are really challenging, however he is one of the smartest people I have ever met as well as one of the most caring and understanding. Really willing to work with you and he is a MUST if you are a poli sci major!",1
Amazing professor. Apply yourself and listen to his lectures and you will be fine! He encourages questions and is very understanding. Some of the concepts were difficult to grasp but he never belittled students for not understanding the first time. Study guides are very helpful and always reflect the exams well. I enjoyed his class!,1
She's very helpful and you get to choose which production you want to do or just do shop hours. For me I did props for this fall's production of M. Courage and I gained experience from it. Lacey's there for most of the rehearsals to help out fixing props and all that. Totally recommend it if you're missing semester units. :),1
late marker. had to self learn course.,0
Hes a really nice teacher and super chill but the work in the class is busy work and so unecessary sometimes. He gets really upset when no one shares their thoughts so even if you arent thinking anything you better make something up. He grades papers as though its an english course and treats it that way sometimes as well.,1
"I really have nothing nice to say about him. Its his way or no way. he is rude, cares nothing about his students, and really doesnt listen",0
"He always starts off with 30 min life lesson before every class, tells u to read textbooks over n over and won't help you outside of the class. Many people failed first two tests and dropped out of the course right away. The only things that are going to save u from this class r take-home tests and the final test (which seems to be rather easy).",1
"Galina Sundberg is very helpful, kind, and even funny.  She is very clear about what is due when, and if you simply do your work, ask if you have questions, and stay on schedule you will get an easy A.  (note: If you work ahead a bit, you can get away with missing a class or two...and that's nice.)",1
Forces students to talk even if you don't want to. Kind of rude for no reason and is seen on her phone via the reflection of her glasses when students are presenting on Zoom. She doesn't seem interested whatsoever. This is a completely student-taught class so don't take it if you wanna hear boring students present work they could care less about.,0
"Plenty of empirical evidence for best professor in Psychology, best professor on campus. Period.",1
"An older man. You leave early every class. Buy the textbook. You have 2 essays, 1 book review (midterm), 1 research paper, 1 binder check, and your final which was a compilation of 5 things. None of these assignments were hard at all if you put in the time, effort, and don't procrastinate. Very easy class. No stress which is always awesome.",1
Dr. Meehan is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. I took History and Systems with her and she makes it extremely easy to do well as long as you carry your weight. She is understanding and if you are having a problem you just need to talk to her and she will help you. She makes it easy to pay attention and provides everything you need.,1
"study material is in too many different places, gets confusing; video transcripts, articles, textbook, and slides. The teacher is helpful but vague; gives general guidelines on how to study and what to study. No specific help. Does not prepare material for VOH sessions so students are at a loss. quizzes are very difficult.",1
"Very helpful, intelligent, well cultured from world travels and brings that to class to share. Daily online homework and critical of punctuation and spelling. It is a challenge which one can assume about learning a new language. She wrote the textbook for the class so curriculum is very well organized. Great Proffesor",1
"Jennie is an amazing calculus teacher!  She makes complicated topics much simpler, and she really cares about her students and wants everyone to succeed!  She loves math, which makes her classes fun!  She will help you succeed and will probably make you like calculus too!",1
"He is by far the worst professor I've ever seen. He has a very thick accent and I barely understood what he was talking about. Not only he has a thick accent, but he also did not go through the materials very thoroughly. He will explain something without reason, and he expects you to understand the concept. He repeats stuff over and over again.",0
"This is one of the easiest and funniest classes I have taken at college.  He is pretty lenient. Show up for class and participate and  you are guaranteed an A.  I highly recommend this class not only because its fun, but you really do learn a variety of self defense like getting out of grabs and other cool stuff. ",1
Emily is very kind and sweet. She is a fair grader and helpful if you seek her help. If you are looking for an easy A this ain't the class. You need to do the readings and participate in class. If you do that and you get good grades on all your essays then you'll get a decent grade.,1
100% take this class. So extremely easy and the online textbook is a really amazing learning tool. Super easy and quick grader. I took an online class but I still could feel like he truly cares about his students. The only downside to class was the textbook was very expensive.,1
"Mr. Carson is a great teacher that I am taking him again for English 1102. You have to go to class because there will be pop up quizzes over what he used in the powerpoint. This class was a hybrid, and he normally tells you about the friday assignment. He super chill with late work and even turned my classes final into a take home final instead!",1
A decent lit ed professor at UNI. Attendance is a big deal. She grades in a reasonable time. I would take her again.,1
"We gave 2 individual speeches and 1 group speech. The longest speech was 4-6 minutes. We had 2 tests, but you look the answer up in the book and write it down. Mr I is very understanding, but he is so respectable that you wouldn't  think of taking advantage of it. He transforms his students into public speakers. I highly recommend taking this class",1
"Straightforward. Stay on track, and complete the work on time. If you mess up on a project, she allows you to go back and fix the issue. The one gripe I have: the videos you need to watch are excessively long. Teaching material could use an update that's more to-the-point. The online class definitely took 3-4x longer than a reg class would. :(",1
Don't take this class unless you like learning while competing in Marvel Themed Chemistry Cosplay. He encourages students to dress up and connect chemistry to comic book heroes. He gives extra credit for non-store bought costumes when you wear them to class.,0
I'm getting A's in all my other courses but did terrible is his. Class is 2 midterms and a final and he's a terrible and unfair marker. He'll only accept the answer he is looking for and will even give 0 on questions out of 10 if you don't write specifically what he wants (even if what you say on the topic is factually correct and from the notes).,0
If you want a class that is easy this isn't it. She is a good teacher and is very helpful during her office hours. She assigns a lot of homework  and has you do a couple presentations during the semester. The two downsides to taking her class is she takes a long period of time to grade your assignments and is slow on emailing back.,1
"Profesor Bamford loves Philosophy, and wants her students to learn something. Two papers (opinion-based), a midterm and final. For both tests, you can bring a 'cheat sheet'. Incredibly kind and understanding. Assigns lots of readings for class, but does not check if you've read them or not. Class usually consists of powerpoints and group work.",1
"Hands down best professor ever. Articulate, passionate and always available. I learned more than I ever thought I would. Easy format on-line and the class runs smoothly. I would definitely recommend this professor to anyone. Not an easy class you will work for it but it all makes sense the way he lays it out. A+++",1
"Quizzes every single day, and just 10 mins per quizz, make sure show up every day for grade. She will drop some of your bad grades. She teaches very fast. Don't take her class If you are not good at math. She has no inspiration, i can't not focus on what she taught. Study by myself at home help me pass all her test",0
"TAKE CSBS 320 ONLINE AND YOU WILL PASS!!! EASY CLASS, BUT IT DOES REQUIRE A LOT OF HARDWORK. TAKE IT ONLINE.",1
Cares about her students. If you show that you care about your grade she will be flexible.,1
"Dewald does give A LOT of reading (100 pages/week). However, he makes up for it by being an easy grader. Just quote from texts and you'll do fine. He gives feed back on essays and seems happy for you to drop by his office and ask him questions. I've emailed him a few times and he usually gets back the next day with an answer.",1
"Her classes were interesting and thought-provoking. She does not use the book, but uses selections that make you think and also help you be aware of writing. Do not take her class if you are easily offended; she is not offensive, but she uses some provocative material that makes you think and discuss.",1
"One of the worst professors that have ever had. I was behind, due to a sudden shift in work scheduling  and contacted her through email. That vfery same day,  and requested to contact her at her office phone and that she was available until 9 that evening. It was 4 pm and I called after I saw the message,  called, and she never answered or emailed.",0
"Mr. Johnson is a wonderful Professor. He cares about his students success, is very flexible, and gives lots of feedback. He gives clear instructions and gives students enough time to complete assignments. I highly recommend his class.",1
Love her! She is passionate about her work! She is a great lecturer and givrs fair assignments and grades,1
"Professor Couch is honestly amazing. Attendance is very heavy, and she will ask for an excuse if you do not attend class, but other than that it is such an easy class. She does weekly assignments from the textbook that are due the next week. You will write around only 3-4 essays, and she cares about her students! Take this class you won't regret it",1
"Her micro class was the most frustrating college experience I've had so far. Her teaching style was just reading off of a power point, I didn't learn a thing during lectures, or in lab. The only way to survive this class is to memorize the textbook word for word. The tests were ridiculous as well. ",0
"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government. He invalidates opinions that aren't his own. If you don't want to be in an echo chamber, I'd suggest another professor.",0
"Jeff is an absolute beauty, didn't really show up he didn't care easy grader",1
"He is perfect in every way, shape, and form. I love you.",1
She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :( She's not a great teacher. Don't take her.,0
Great Teacher Always willing to help out.,1
"I learned so much in this class about culture that I apply to everyday life, I loved it. She makes class mandatory but you don't want to miss out. I did not do so well on my exams so I was worried but she gives you a lot of opportunities to make it up.",1
This guy is a total jerk. He's told me to my face that his priority is not to the students. Wonder why he's such a bad professor? You will learn nothing from this man. All he cares about is his precious research.,0
"Cool Prof...deserved the grade I received (not a bad one though but could've been better)Overall listen, take notes and express your concerns with him, he does listen and tries to help",1
Amazing. She's super sweet and understanding. She likes for the class to participate. There is a lot of reading and some assignments and tests. But if you go to class and understand what she is talking about than you'll do just fine on the tests. She is a very helpful professor who cares.,1
"Plenty of people are saying this guy is great, do not be deceived. Take this from somebody whos been around the block a few times, trust me Ive dealt with some bad professors and I took this class twice with him, none have been as vindictive and cruel. The tests are incredibly difficult and tailored to ensure that you do poorly.",0
"This teacher has got to be the worst math teacher I've ever had. All of the lectures are on powerpoints- learning math through powerpoints is not ideal and makes things unnecessarily complicated. When she writes on the board, she writes so small that you can't see what she's doing. Save your GPA and choose a different professor.",0
"Dr. Jacobson is the most energetic professor I've ever had, and that makes the class super interesting. Now I want to take every sociology class that there is, but only if Dr. Jacobson is teaching it.",1
"I liked the way he went over the homework in class. If anyone had trouble or had a question, he wrote it on the board & explained it. I also liked how he gave 4 tests during the semester & averaged them for the grade + points for homework. I think it's much easier than just one test at the end & you can see how you are doing before it's too late.",1
"She doesn't try to help you when you need it.She graded an assignment I turned in 2x by mistake 2 completely different grades, A AND C!It seemed liked the more questions I tried to ask,the worse my grades were!When I told her I was going to speak to the Dean, she said she would report me 1st and it would get me no where because she was the teacher.",0
"Kelm was one of the best Spanish professors I've taken from. I found the assignments clearly planned and understood what was expected of us. He gave concise and funny lectures and I always felt like he wanted us to do the best we can. He was very receptive to questions. Grade comes from online homework and chapter tests, no cumulative final.",1
One of the best teacher's I've had! I loved all of his classes.. He has a story to go along with every lesson which is extremely helpful. He gives you lifestyle/work tips to carry on for life. He basically teaches you how it is in the real world. He covers every chapter in the book along with powerpoints that you can print out. Easy exams,1
"Professor Gier is an awesome teacher! Make sure to stay on top of the vocabulary and any notes that he goes over in class, ask any questions you may have, and you will do great in his class! He appreciates a higher level of participation in his class, in which you will be compensated for via extra credit assignment availability and such.",1
"Very knowledgable and charismatic with his words. Does not know the meaning of ""conceptualizing"" he does not know the art of teaching. His classes and test are all about specific details which are impractical for students.",0
THE BEST!!! Cares about his students. Flexible. Entertaining. WANTS YOU TO PASS & will do anything he can to help. Takes time to slow down & explain if you're having trouble. All tests are taken in testing center giving (relatively) unlimited time. Willing to extend deadlines. Gives extra credit. Gives test reviews. Responds to emails. Dedicated!,1
"Awesome professor. No idea what the complaints are about. Knows his stuff and youll learn a lot if you pay attention. Hes funny in his own way, I guess some people dont enjoy him as much as I did. I would take him every semester if I could!",1
"Soh at times is a nice person, but I would not recommend her as a professor for LITED 3115. The class itself is already so much work, but she takes forever to return your work and she'll ask you to completely change your lesson plans the day of teaching them. She doesn't answer your emails and when she does it's not a kind reply. Not worth it.",0
"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!! Professor is very knowledgeable about Accounting but because it comes so easy for him he is terrible at teaching it to people who have never done it before. Half my class is confused & at the moment and I am having to pay for an outside Tutor to learn what I don't in class. He does NOT explain things well and goes very fast.",0
"I enjoyed this class, I would recommend taking this professor . A lot of homework assigned through MyLab, but she opened all tests, quizzes, and homework on the first day of class and allowed us to work at our own pace throughout the semester. She also offered a lot of extra credit opportunities.",1
She has no sympathy for her students nor does she care to even respond to your emails or questions about any projects. she needs to relax on the workload ! i had a personal problem and she never got back to me but just give me a 0.,0
I loved her class.,1
He helped me when I was struggling with homework and he also encouraged lots of practice for tests.,1
"TOOK HER ONLINE SHE IS GREAT, AND SHE DOES NOT PILE ALOT OF WORK ON YOU AT ONE TIME.",1
Really good teacher overall. I love going to her class for lectures. The hw and discussions were easy. We only had to do 2 projects but she provides the data for you. I'd highly recommend her.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAMP! If he is the only professor available, wait until next semester. He seems great and wonderful until after the last day of dropping the class before having to pay. On one writing I decided to try and be a good student and find the entire book of the section the reading came out of and he counted off, DONT TAKE HIM!!",0
His lectures are a waste in comparison for the exams. But he is VERY understanding and will do what he can if you go to him for help.,1
"This was, hands down, my favorite class to attend. Catherine is super passionate and knowledgable about the class topic and so much more. There is a lot of reading but it is absolutely worth finding the time to do the readings. She's supah caring and made transitioning to online learning a breeze. Also, she has two really cute cats.",1
"I took ENG 101 online with her. She is very fair when grading papers and is very involved even though its an online course. I loved the time she sent us a video of her corrections/ questions about our papers, its so much more useful than just knowing what grade you got. I would definitely take another English course with her.",1
"Candida is one of the best online professors I've had. She grades assignments promptly, communicates well and frequently, is always accessible, has the course organized well, has reasonable expectations, grades fairly, and is caring. I was very impressed with her and would happily take a class from her again.",1
"Dr. Krueger is the best! As a Human Resource Management major, I felt that she was very knowledagable in the subject and gave great examples from her real-life experience in the field. Her exams are based off powerpoints she lectures over (which you will get your own copies) and there is also a group presentation that's worth the same as one exam.",1
"Professor Ayers is a super nice guy and is really helpful. His assignments can be a little bit difficult, but he makes himself accessible if you need any help.",1
She is Romanian so it takes a few days to get used to her accent. It's a fairly easy class just show up and participate when given the chance. Final exam is 50 questions worth 4 points a piece. All the questions came from the study hall session packets. As long as you attend the study sessions you should easily finish with an A or B.,1
"I studied the power-points to prepare for exams and always got an A. I think the syllabus said the access code/textbook was required so I bought it, but never needed to use it. As long as you try you can get an A.",1
"Decent prof. He tends to ramble and get behind a lot. Other than that, his classes are clear and the exams weren't terrible.",1
Andrea is literally amazing!!! I've taken Crim1208 with her and she knows how to make everyone in her class succeed! She is super kind and is very helpful. She emails students as soon as possible with answers to their questions. Her exams consist of M/C and 3 assignments which are a breeze to complete as long as you pay attention and have the text,1
"Prof. Durham is a; dynamic, creative, CEO material, tough grader, but fair teacher. He is one of, if not the best teacher in the Business Administration curriculum. He complements the modules with creative assignments designed to make you think critically and analytically. If you want to learn take him, but if you want an easy grade, don't.",1
"She is a great professor who brings real life stories in to her lecture and actually keep you interested. however, you shouldn't take clinical ethics with her; there is a lot of work involved and the level of difficulty is high. If you don't have several free hours per week to dedicate to this class i recommend taking it with another professor.",1
"Extrordinarily interesting.  I love science, and he made it fun.  He only taught 1/4 of this interdis class, but I loved it.  I wanted so badly to take another class with him, because I thought it would be fun, challenging, and I would learn a lot, but his",1
"Not very helpful when taking his online class- he only answers some questions that are asked, and even then he is kind of rude about it!",0
"Ok first of all, I put a one on easiness, because Eileen Duffy WILL make you work your butt off. You'll have to learn a lot of music and do forums. Great Professor and person. Hard work, but you will improve you technique 100%. Great for classical and musical theatre training, because that's what she does best. You'll enjoy her voice lessons a lot.",1
"Love this teacher! He was so awesome made the class very enjoyable. I felt like I never wanted to miss a class. My advice to you is don't miss class because you will miss a lot. This class is not easy for people who don't understand logic like myself, but I sure did learn a lot from this teacher. He's always willing to help whenever your stuck. ;)",1
she is the wort. she is an old and ugly teacher who needs to go home. the worst class I ever had in my life,0
I was not looking forward to public speaking but his class made it easy because of how well he reached his class and directed it.,1
"This professor and class was very easy and very straightforward. Most of the classwork is done with using the textbook, a lot of stories to read and a lot of writing is done, but it's all simple stuff. The professor is nice and calm and rarely speaks (only speaks when giving classwork instructions). Doesn't tolerate people who are late for class.",1
"She's amazing, helpful, willing to compromise to students needs. I would take her even if I didn't need her class for credit. Or if she was a personal trainer at a gym she'd be amazing. ",1
"Very nice woman, only problem is she doesn't use power points and strictly lectures from her mind without notes. Pay attention and take notes, and if you skip a class make sure you have someone to give you notes. Most classes you learn nothing, pretty easy overall.",1
"Manu is the best prof at ASU for COM by far. His coursework take a moderate level of understanding, which requires reading the book and understanding what is going on in the class.. (not that hard). He is so approachable and wants his students to succeed. Makes participation EASY even for an online class. TAKE THIS CLASS AND ANY OTHER HE TEACHES.",1
"She was an awesome professor, and I wouldn't mind taking her class again. We didn't have any quizzes or test, but we did have daily reading homework assignments and those were easy so there wasn't much to worry about. Her feedbacks are quite detailed and specific, very helpful! I recommend her! :) ",1
"She is a great teacher and she knows her stuff. But, if you need an answer, you better send your question a lot earlier, because she won't answer your question right away. DAAC classes involved with a lot wring anyways and on top of that you will not get graded, So you'll never know you passed or failed until class is over about 2-3 weeks. ",1
Professor Young is really nice and approachable. She makes it clear what she expects for Nutrition. Just follow her directions and you will get an A. She is a kind person and wants you to do well.,1
"I really enjoyed Prof. Stewart's class. Research methods is dry by design, but he made it fun and interesting. He's subtly hilarious and is a real character. You do need to put a lot of studying into the course, but that is just the nature of research methods. I'm really glad I got to take the class with him and I'd take another with him if I could",1

"She's so great and super nice. She's very different from other professors, she actually cares about how well you do and if you're improving. You'll have a good time in her class and it's super easy. Her class was my favorite.",1
"Great professor, great class. Took his online courses. Homework is so easy, just do it and get full points. Have to study ahead of time for quizzes and exams. No discussions and only one term paper at end of semester",1
"Mehdi Majbouri is great professor. He teaches material incredibly well so his class is very rewarding in how much you will learn. He is also a very ethusiastic and passionate lecturer. Lectures are always enjoyable and exciting yet never boring. His class is demanding; As withall worthwhile courses, the benefit corresponds with a level of challenge",1
"Love, Love, Love him!  His class was my favorite.  He tells you what to study and that will be on the test. Very awesome guy, cares about all his students.  I wished he taught more than this class!",1
She is a cute little old lady and thinks she's super funny but her jokes are so cheesy. You have a textbook but it isn't than expensive. If you don't read don't stress she gives the notes the next day. You only have three papers and they're straight forward. She wants to see you do well and get a good grade in the class.,1
"This guy knows so much about his topics. No book, just lecture. Show up and take notes on slides he doesn't post and get those attendance points. Take the class if you care about history. It's hard to get into the content (and the 4 or 5 books) if you don't. A bit harsh on the book response essays but it's clear what he wants answered.",1
"I get pretty much nothing out of this class, except what's in the readings.  The books she chooses are boring and fairly irrelevant, and the class discussion seems wandering.",0
Very easy class.,1
"If you want to learn child and adolescent psychology, do not take this class. It is a very easy A but you do not learn a thing.",0
"No need to go to lecture. He just reads from the power points and the notes are posted online.  He puts up ""old tests"" online to study for the tests, but for the most part they are the same test as the current one.  Never used the book.  Easy class if you aren't interested in biology but need the credit.",1
Cognition was my favorite class in psychology. Professor Rizzella is amazing and fun.,1
Told us all assignments are on hold during move to online which was a 2 week period and then did not change the course load. Actually made us go back and complete assignments that would have been due even though we were not in session for that time period. Can't give him a bad enough rating.,0
"EXCELLENT Professor. Amazaing upper-level teaching style. She requires that you read, respond, and discuss which was extremely helpful. Discussion board was obnoxious at times, but really did force you to do the readings. We wrote one huge paper throughout the course of the semester, and it was probably the best paper I have yet to write in college",1
"I'm in my fourth year now, and I can confidently say that O'Quinn, who I had in first year, remains the best professor I have ever had at Guelph. His lectures make clear the level of personal itnerest and commitment he has not only to the subject matter, but in making sure his students are interested and engaged with the material. Take his classes!",1
I was in the online section so I don't know much about the professors teaching style but he was very understanding and emailed back quickly about any questions on any assignments. I did feel like the programming projects took much longer than the expected times given but that's probably my bad.,1
Great instructor!,1
"Please take any of his classes, you wouldn't regret it! You'll be ridiculously glad you did. It's that time of year, registration is advisable to all, get into his class, before they fill up! Too bad, I can't, taken as many as I can.",1
"Ms. Kim is not the best professor to take for calc. She has a very strong accent, which makes it difficult to understand her. Even if she didn't have the accent, you still wouldn't be able to understand her. Do yourself a favor a skip this professor",0
"The class was fine, and he seems nice enough. One strange thing is it seems like he has a following of students who keep taking him every semester and everyone in the class knows each other beforehand. It was a little weird; that's my only complaint.",1
"Super nice guy, pretty funny too. Only three essays throughout the semester and if you show him that you are trying, you will easily get a 4.0.",1
"Sweetest guy ever! Very smart, his accent is thick so it's difficult to understand him. He wants the best for his students. A lot of hw, gives multiple try's to do it. Overall Solid teacher, learned what I had to and did well",1
"Took his class during a mini mester and online. This isnt a blow off class, you will have to work. I was extremely impressed with how organized he is and how many resources he had to make assignments clear. Not an easy grader, but fair. You get what you work for.",1
"OMG-PROFESSOR BRADSHAW WAS INTERESTING, HE DID HAVE A KNEE INJURY THEREFORE HE GAVE US A COUPLE OF TAKE HOME EXAMS, WHICH WAS SWEET...HOPE HE GETS BETTER..",1
"I have taken many classes with Holly and highly recommend any class she teaches. She is super clear about expectations and always willing to help. The material is always very interesting and relevant, and the homework amounts are always fair. She will also do everything she can to give you extra credit it you need it.",1
"Worst teacher I've had in my 5 years of college, 3 years at UCD and my 2 years at FRCC. Really regret not looking the teacher up first considering all these horrible (and accurate) reviews.",0
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Hutton didn't respect any students in the class, as well as she responded to 1 out of 9 emails I send throughout the semester. Also, hutton believes all of her students should ""look up to her"" and become just like her. She accused me of cheating twice and argued with my class the entire semester.",0
"Literally the most incredible professor I've ever had. Informative, interesting, funny. So worth taking. ",1
Mr. Pode is an amazing instructor. Statistics is a hard class but with his patience and  excellent teaching skills he made the class bearable.  Show up to class and do the homework and anyone can pass the class. I got an A in the class.,1
"I have Mr. Kraft right now, and he is absolutely one of the best teachers I have ever had, especially for english. He is always willing to help with your essays and never makes you feel stupid. He is understanding if you are unable to make it to class and has a funny personality. He makes english fun and I would recommend him!",1
"Dr. Watts is amazing!!! She is so sweet, kind, and caring! I took her class ""Interpreting the Other"" and it was such an interesting class - there's a lot of reading, you have to write a lot of papers, and you have to participate in class discussions. If you can, take her class! It's a real eye-opener",1
a really good teacher provides you with an awesome notes,1
"She is a very nice and caring professor. Lots of work. Lab material, labs and quizzes.",1
"THIS GUY IS AWESOME! I had him for Political Inquiry and The Congress and Public Opinion. TAKE HIS CLASSES! Literally one of the smartest and most engaging progessors at Bates College. Extremely knowledgeable, helpful and funny!!!!!",1
"Alex loves math and cats seemingly exclusively, so when you need her to be available, she is. She's very flexible with arranging to meet with students and she explains the theory behind the math very well. She wants her students to succeed.",1
"Smart, Helpful, and Sexy.  What more can you ask for?",1
"Lecture are straightforward and he asks the class if they need him to explain the problem again after each one so if you need help, ASK! Attend every class or you will get confused as he does quite a bit in one day. He allows a cheat sheet and tests are similar to notes.",1
Very helpful. Works with you to make papers as good as they can be. Assignments aren't always clear but he'll explain them to you.,1
This is the best teacher at NOVA. NO other teacher can come close to being as good as she is. She is Nice and relaxed. She does not expect you to remember everything but does expect you to try your best. As long as you do your best you will get an A in the class. Another good thing is she pretty hot too. I would recommend this class to all.,1
Steve is my Favorite teacher. He goes through the material very well and is available to help you whenever you need it. He keeps class fun and interesting and genuinely cares,1
"a very artistic person, but at times he was extremely snappy. He did not like if I disagreed with him about my own art. I did all the work, worked hard, but he was argumentative at  times. Other times he was perfectly pleasant, and I can't say he was an unkind person. But his tendency to snap at students once in a while makes the class a but tense.",0
"He's an amazing professor. I took his late start class, so even though it was long and rushed he made it very interesting and fun. He gives a lot of opportunities to help you improve your writing with 1 on 1 meetings. Great class. I would love to have him again.",1
"Great instructor who is very enthusiastic and willing to help students. He makes sure we understand, not memorize concepts. His exams are about 65% from lecture, 35% from text/articles so be sure to read. If you're taking 110 with him, be grateful that you only have to turn in a 10 page proposal and no final (other profs ask for 20).",1
"SO glad this class is over. Had her for museum studies, not an easy class at all. Attendance is important as she does not follow her syllabus at all and often gives random assignments with random due dates. She is very forgetful which can sometimes work in your favor w/ due dates. Very writing intensive be prepared for weekly writing assignments.",1

"Mike was my instructor 10yrs ago & remains 1 of 4 of the best teachers Ive had in life. Hes a tough grader but has skill to teach beyond the classroom; he taught & guided me through real life. If you go to college hoping to only come out with a degree, then maybe hes not your style, but if you want to truly learn beyond, hes incredible.",1
took both lit&society and jewish lit classes. didnt read one book and got an A. if you attend class and pay attention to the discussion super easy to get a good grade. weekly quizzes are easy as well. if you take long enough you just pass it in at the end of class (after hes gone over all the answers),1
Professor lectures the whole class period. He's very knowledgable and humorous. Clear cut criteria. ,1
"Gupta is a nice guy, but you should avoid ODE at all costs with him if you can. He teaches off of the slides that the texbook publisher made, and when he strays from the slides, he's confusing. He give NO PARTIAL CREDIT on exams at all. There are 7 HWs, a midterm, and a final; if you bomb the midterm and have mediocre HW, he won't help you out.",0
"Her class is not structured/unclear of her expectations.LOTS of reading, and some annoying online discussions.If you have the time to submerge in her class take it.+presentation,essay exams. 3 essays book report.class was hostile.Diff, but you will learn!",0
"I took this class online, its extremely easy. Never heard anything from him entire semester. Class can be finished in a few weeks",1
It is truly amazing how this professor receives a paycheck. She chooses to meet via zoom with her students once a month and expects her students to read chapter after chapter in preparation for her exams. Her meetings are completely worthless and is very rude. I can't believe I spent my own money taking this course. Worthless.,0
"Okaaaaaay let's see ... Whatever I'm gonna say I can't describe this professor. He is amazing, great, one of the best professors I ever had. I always like to bother him with my questions lol, he always helps. You better take his class if u guys see his name. You will get an A if u listen to his comments on your presentations. Take him��Take him��",1
"Such an amazing prof. You wouldn't think it at first, as sometimes his lectures are slightly dull and hard to follow, but he does a great job in terms of challenging his students and is very helpful. Really makes you understand and love functional programming. Take this course if you have the aptitude, it's far more rewarding than CS135/6.",1
"Dr. Chien was one of the most enthusiastic and engaged teachers on the whole VCU campus. For me, success comes with how involved the professor is with his/her students, and how much they care. I got an 'A' because I love the topic and she loves her job. You won't regret having her as a teacher. Truly a wonderful experience.",1
I absolutely loved her teaching style and class time. Most people wanted to be in class all the time because we enjoyed learning without feeling too much pain from homework or stress from the material. I honestly wish that all classes were run the same way because Chinese I has sparked my love for love for learning all over again.,1
Good classes considering they're online. Very fair workload.,1
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Maybe the first two days of class is good only. If you make it to class 4 minutes late you won't be able to get in. Which he has just arrived 2 minutes late. Tough grader. Doesn't give feedback on essays. Expects you to know your errors. No enthusiasm. Lectures feel like you'd rather be somewhere else.,0
Professor Marsh is one of those people that REALLY enjoys his job. He is lecture heavy so read beforehand so you can keep up with him in class. He does a good job at explaining the material in different ways so that the class can understand it as easily as possible. He will also review the chapters before the quiz as a refresher! Don't skip class!,1
"Good class to take for gov credit. Three papers and three tests make up a very large percent of your grade. LOTS of reading, do not fall behind or else you'll be cramming it all the night before the test. Lecture is required, most of the test material comes from it. Lectures are interesting if not a bit slow. Study guides are provided before tests.",1
"Took this class last semester and hated it. I've always been good at Chemistry but prof ams makes very simple concepts hard to understand, and hard concepts impossible to understand by underexplaining. His labs are the same way. Hes really smart but cant teach. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES",0

Dr. Miller- Herringer is such a wonderful instructor. I wish I would have taken it seriously in the beginning. READ THE BOOK! Keep up with her notes and grades. There is no reason not to pass this class. There is also online weekly quizzes. Do not forget about them. ,1
Super hot. Awesome accent. Funny. Does not take attendance. Tests are straight forward. Take him. ,1
Dr. Swint is a great professor and an expert in his field. His directions and expectations for the class are super clear and he is approachable and helpful if you have any issues.,1
JR is a super cool dude. He is extremely funny and he is a really good teacher. He is also a pretty tough grader and the class was kind of like an english class mixed with a political science class. I learned a lot from him. His class is difficult for being an eng101 class but it is very entertaining. ,1
"Was wary of taking her because of her rating on here but she is Great prof. and a great person. Thoroughly enjoyed the class. It was an easy A, just read the syllabus and do what she expects and you'll be great! She's very understanding - especially if you come to class.",1

"If you struggle with subnetting,take this guy! He is fun, but beware, he won't let you leave his class, if you don't get it. You will definitely get it! Best Cisco teacher ever!",1
"Dr. Lim is a disgrace to the CHE department.  He does not teach!!!  When going to office hours, he won't actually answer questions and just tells you to look in the notes.  Semester tests are easy, but the final was incredibly hard and lowered most peoples' grades by two letter grades.  The class did not prepare anyone for the insane final.",0
"Pro tip 1: Don't buy the book (it's not used). Pro Tip 2: Sit near the front because she's soft-spoken (with an accent) and uses a wireless mic. Two long-form IRS projects, three tests and weekly D2L quizzes in her Individual Tax class. A straightforward class with few surprises, solid lectures and very fair assessment.",1
"Good class.  He is a nice guy, you just have to get used to his style of teaching.",1
"Prof. Gier is definitely caring and a great professor! His lectures were on point, he goes through everything you need for the test. He also shows interesting videos and gives real life examples of the theory you learn, which really helps. As long as you read and do your work, his class is an easy A and you'll learn a lot!",1
Prof. Zeoli is super helpful and really cares about her students. I would highly recommend her.,1
"As this course was moved online due to COVID, expect very long video lectures. Theres is a lot of material in this course so the lectures are very important to watch, though I suggest watching them in parts as they can be as long as 2hrs. He is available for online office hours often which is great. Overall, a great course if you like astronomy.",1
I thought I would fail this class because it was hard to me but he is a great professor. Come to class take great notes and pay attention,1
easy online class. 5-6 discussion boards where you have to reply and also reply to 2 others. four quizzes 25 pts each. 1 midterm I final both non cumulative. you do need the book bc it is online. easy to pass quizzes if u have all the online notes he has open. not timed so can take how long you want. I would recommend bc its not that much work,1
way too hard and hes super picky about grammar,0
"HORRIBLE!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He hates life. Never happy. It's his way or no way. You opinion doesn't matter. Have no idea how he still teaches there. He will give you a zero for wrong format, wrong folder, if he doesn't like your opinion. Should not teach. He hates everything. He's the devil of English. He enjoys being miserable. No sympathy!",0
"He can fall behind pretty easily. He has changed test dates and assignment dates time and time again. His webpage for assignments is outdated, which has caused confusion for us. He is very knowledgeable on the subject however.",0
"She was fun, tried to relate to the students a lot which can be annoying but it made the class less intense. Homework wasn't excessive or overwhelming. Good teacher overall. Worked with the student well.",1
great teacher!!!,1
GREAT CLASS!  Will change your life.  Most powerful teacher I've ever had.  You're cheating yourself not to take this if you're at SLU.,1
"I took this teacher for Statistics at De Anza and it was a rollercoaster to begin with. Constant shouting of ""Stop Talking, You have a question?"" and other little distractions that would get her off topic. Her lectures move at a slow pace and staying focused is hard due to her thick accent. Overall would not take again, nor recommend to anyone.",0
"Such a sweet lady. She will always help you out if you need it, even if that means taking a test earlier or later. She has a very unique personality but it grows on you. Very easy class and does not require much outside work at all.",1
"Very interesting material.  Prof clear in explanations, gives numerous examples.  Full lectures, not much time to ask questions.  Gives minimal extra credit.  Read chapters, attend class, study, easy A.",1
"I don't know how she is in person, but if you have to take Art Crit, take it with her online!! It is sooo easy and she is really nice :-) Not as much writing as other writing intensive courses either!!",1
"You ask a simple question in class, you get a long winded, confusing answer. The lectures were extremely disorganized, didn't even follow her own handouts. If you politely approach her with concerns or need for clarification, get ready for some passive aggression. 200+ pages read per class mainly not discussed, but they're definitely on the test.",0
"She is really nice!!  A stickler at first so that you don't step all over her but then she completely chills out.  Very helpful in office hours. She has amazing stories which she wastes class time to tell but she still manages to cover everything, and better than most profs.  Tests can be tricky but are fair.  She's great!!",1
She's alright. you must do the reading to stay ahead. Over all a worksheet class with confusing tests in between. The class is easily passable though. The study group on fridays are great!!!,1
Overall good professor. Class is well organized. Give homework in every class but easy to finish within class. Do work on time and show up. Strict with deadline. He will give you genuine feedback. Respect Dr. G,1
DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS. You literally don't need them. I just showed up and did other work on my computer. You have a reflection due every week but its super easy and he's a really really easy grader. Your midterm is take home and no final. Other than the midterm and reflections you have an easy group project and a bigger reflection paper. TAKE HIM!!,1
"THE MOST HORRIBLE CLASS EVER TOOK. He's really boring and doesn't help you on the quizzes, and makes you do a  useless group projects. He reads off the power points. He doesn't use  Canvas to grade the work, but it is through SAM.  Answers from the quizzes are not from the book so wouldn't recommend to read the book look it up from a different sour",0
end of the semester and STILL no exam grade?! you have got to be kidding me.  One excuse after another. Guy is a complete joke,0
"The best trust me, wish he teaches all the courses",1
"I took this class because I already took a lower level class with Prof. Lorimer and I liked her style. I didnt know much about California Indian history before this class, and I learned a lot! We did a lot of in class work with primary sources and we also did a quarter long research project on a specific tribe. I would def take her again",1
Nicest guy! He made class fun and not scary to make speeches. Not a hard grader and says funny jokes! Makes class enjoyable and you want to be there. Highly recommend him!,1
Tests are unnecessarily tricky. The way she asks questions makes you second guess yourself. They are so tricky that even she messed up 3 of the questions. The NCLEX questions aren't even that tricky. I am an A student and got a C on the first test. She told the class we were doing very well with an overall C average. How is that a good thing?,0
"The work itself isn't difficult, but he makes you take quizzes before the lecture is available to make sure you have read. It makes it difficult since the book doesn't explain well. The amount of work is crazy and it's difficult to keep up if you're fulltime. You can pass but if you have the option avoid him.",0
"he's awesome..he cracks stupid jokes but hes so nice you laugh just to make him feel good. he gives you the benefit of the doubt and makes it almost impossible for you to fail. the movies are boring though, mostly silent films.",1
"Angie is a wonderful teacher. Don't let her RBF scare you, she is very approachable and willing to answer any questions you have. Whether in class or clinical, Angie is willing to help you understand the nursing process. If she doesn't know something, Angie is willing to help find the resources or point you in the direction to find answers.",1
"YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE MATERIAL FOR THE TEST, but she is whilling to work with you if you have trouble with it being an online class.",1
"You have to read the book to pass the class. Her class is long, but she goes through things pretty quickly so take good notes. She posts supplemental documents that I never read, and aren't on the test. Come prepared for Friday discussions, and answer the questions, they are easy. Tests are easy if you have a clear understanding of the material.",1
"Dr. Mescioglu is an excellent teacher who is very knowledgable in mathematics. Also is the easiest teacher ever! I took him for Finite, Decision Science, and Systems and they were all easy classes that I learned a lot in! Highly Recommend!",1
"Great guy, very scary at first but after the first lab when he really opens up. One of my favorite and most helpful teachers I have had so far.",1
She is an awesome insturctor.  I had her last semester and received an A.  I worked hard for it but she made math fun.  This semester I have a terrible Math teacher and I wish I would have dropped it already.  I wish all teachers were like her.,1
"The quality of Mr. I's class is so much higher than is typical for an introductory speech class. I learned so much about both speaking and listening better. I'm the kind of person who really needs specific, actionable advice on something as difficult as public speaking. Mr. I did a great job breaking it down and offering real techniques to improve.",1
SUPER boring lectures. Probably the worst lectures I've ever attended.,0
"She sometimes appears scatterbrained and unsure in front of the whole class, but is great in a smaller group setting. Attendance and participation help tremendously. Really a pretty good teacher",1
"He tries to make you think the class is hard but it isn't. His exams are easy and he's a fairly funny guy but the classes will bore you to death. If he's an option for you, take him. It's an easy A.",1
"TERRIBLE professor.  You must do all the readings or she wont even teach.  No one in the class ever read so you would keep skipping things.  Other people say she is good in other classes, but this one is horrible.  Never take this class.  She tests on the most random facts from the reading.  She is clearly the worst prof I've had at the U",0
"veru tough professor,at the same time she does not have the gift for teaching. avoid her.",0
I. Love. This. Man.  He is so good at teaching and even though his tests are difficult it is so worth it.  You really do get a lot out of his class.  He is also very understanding with extensions of homework if the lectures fall behind.  Definitely my favorite teacher of all time.,1
Time flies with Mr. Carter! It doesn't even feel like you're taking a speech class because he makes it so relaxing and like it's no big deal to speak in public. Easy speeches and easy class.  Would take another class from him if I could.,1
"Worst Professor Ever. I didn't understand any of the lectures not even one of them. The midterm is all based on proof. I made a big mistake taking his class, I advise you to stay far away from his class. If you can, AVOID at all costs. He is simply a bad teacher. Also, the entire grade was just based on the midterm and the final.",0
Class isn't hard if you study well and put some effort into the class. I didnt use the textbook even though I bought it. You can survive off the PowerPoint slides and notes you take in class.,1
Steve is a great professor and happy to help students.  I would take another class from him!,1
supportive and harsh to. you can tell who she likes and who she doesn't. Seomtimes has attitude. Doesn't respond to emails or follow-up on things.,0
"Took his Shakespeare course, was mildly interested in the subject prior but after taking his class, makes me want to never read another Shakespeare ANYTHING. The class is mandatory and his lectures are a yawn... It's pretty easy though, so if you bring a book or something to do instead, it would make the class bearable.",1
One of the best professors at Keene State that I have had all 4 years of being here.  Makes a subject matter that would normally be boring very interesting with group work and interactive learning.  I highly recommend taking this class not only if you need it for your major but as an elective as well!,1
"Dr. Mahosky is one of the best professors I have ever had at NAU. She is passionate about disability studies which improves your motivation to learn. It would be hard to not get an A in her class, as her teaching is clear and the coursework is interesting. I definitely recommend all DIS courses. They are all exceptional with wonderful teachers!",1
"love this class, have fun and learn a lot  ",1
"A few of the reasons why I enjoyed her: her feedback on papers was super detailed, she allows rewrites on the first essay (but not the second), she is super helpful in office hours, and her reading quizzes aren't that hard even if you didn't fully understand the reading (not to mention she often gives a heads up before a reading quiz). Great prof.",1
"Ruder expects a lot from students, and his tests are tough. He curves the exams though so everyone ends up with good grades",1
"I was expecting this class to be boring, but it wasn't. Prof. Seymour's aware that history in general can be boring, so he likes to make class fun. You don't really have to show up, but he does go over some information needed for exams, which were take home. He has a really fun personality, & I recommend him if you want an easy A. Just do your work",1
"one of the nicest, best professors at sbcc in the english department! took her for eng 110 and eng 111 and got an A in both. most of these comments are clearly from students that didnt do any work and failed. from a student that actually tried, she is great and cares about all her students!",1
Professor McCarthy is a wonderful teacher. She really wants her students to succeed. She gives very detailed instructions and makes sure you know what you're doing. There is a lot of work but the class is manageable. McCarthy is also a fair grader. Would definitely recommend.  ,1
"Extremely unorganized. I dont appreciate that she does not set any due dates and grades almost everything the weekend before finals week, not to mention that there is no final exam to boost your grade. She needs to restructure herself before students should consider taking her.",0
"Dr. Vanderzalm is amazing!  I learned so much in this course and she really prepared me to be a well-educated biology professional.  She is also hilarious, and does a good job of answering questions that come up.",1
"Danae was awesome! Very understanding, and really opened your eyes to the important aspects of African American History (and the things that white teachers don't teach!)",1
"A fairly good amount of work for class (lots of writing inside the lab and on your own). Nan makes you work for your grade, but she knows her stuff. Very funny also. Do not skip class! Bring quality level drafts to progress meetings and save yourself in the long run. No textbook required",1
"Prof Merkel is the best!! He is such a sweet, intelligent man. He knows his stuff and he expects you to know it as well - verbatim! If you can memorize, you can do well. Don't procrastinate, memorize early and you are golden. He will tell you EXACTLY what he wants. No excuse to fail! He will help in any way and evaluate practice exams!",1
"He is a very nice guy that likes lectures to be interactive. He likes to get people to think critically and this can lead people to feel that he doesn't give straightforward answers. His tests are a little difficult because they are all short answer, but not hard to manage if you read the book and pay attention in class.",1
He is an AMAZING teacher!!!! This is the only class I'm taking this semester that I have never wanted to miss! He's so funny and explains everything in such an easy way! If you pay attention and take notes you'll definitely get an A. I'm so said this is my last english class because I'd definitely take him again! I recommend him 100%!,1
What a lass. Loved the class.,1
We all know who wrote these reviews!! Scroll down for the real ones. At one point she even asked students to write them.,0
"Took it over winter session (3 weeks). Had to read 6-7 chapters a week. Lectures usually 1.5 hrs. per chapter (recorded). Had 3 ""essays"" and two projects which needed about as much effort as the ""essays"". A bit of extra research for your essays gets you extra credit. Quiz questions similar to math word problems. Asynchronous. Fri & Sun due dates.",1
This professor is great! Juarez at first had me a little worried because we turned our desks 3 rows on the left and 3 on the right to face each other on the first day of class. And there was a walkway down the middle. But I actually loved going to this class. I learned a lot. I enjoyed the visitor presentations we received.,1
Took her maternal/infant health class and wouldn't recommend a better professor to have class with! Had 2 exams (super super easy) a final paper and a class presentation. Take her if you can!! You are guaranteed an A!,1
The online class 'Intro to Islamic Civilization' was an absolute mess; quiz questions were from material not yet covered or material that was never covered and the prof tries way too hard to be funny. I really feel that I learned almost nothing from this class and online the prof does not look as hot as some have previously posted,0
"I reccomend taking his classes, but go to them. Most of the semester you will feel lost in his lectures, but by the end you realize the method to his madness. He is a great prof and he seems to care about the student. He gave me several extentions, and I am grateful. If you need more clarity in the subject matter or his expectations, go see him.",1
"The class itself is hard mainly because of the material, it is all memorizing but  doable and more than possible to make an A in the class. You will learn. Sieber is very caring and understanding when it comes to helping her students. Just focus and ask questions. Oh and she gives extra credit on her exams which is a plus.",1
Great experience. Teacher was very helpful.,1
"Very Swedish, very puntual. Attendance mandatory. Grades paper rigidly, as English is not her 1st lang. Green classoom-no paper required! You can get by without readng, if you take detailed notes in class and study them a lot. Be sure to take note of her real-world application, it comes up in exams. Easy to talk to, tries to help.",1
"Lois is a good teacher, but not great. I found her to be a rather difficult grader and did not give great feedback. I did find her lectures to be great, her guests very good, and I did enjoy the class. The use of D2L was a bit much as well, and added to the confusion more than helped it.",0
she is such an awesome professor! what you see is what you get. she is extremely fair and very intelligent. i wish she taught more classes because she is so engaging and honestly can relate to students,1
Very good at explaining material and keeps your interest.,1
"I just took this class for fall 2020 semester. It was really easy. Lots of reading along with easy assignments. He also provides the reading so you dont have to worry about purchasing a book. He gives many opportunities for students who may fall behind, as well as giving extra credit. Definitely easy class. Do the work and youll pass with an A.",1
"She's a great professor. I am extremely glad I had the chance to be her student this semester. She is so nice and wicked funny, and the class time is really  chill and welcoming. The grading can sometimes be more challenging than other professors, but overall it is fair. Awesome person and teacher!",1
She is very nice but there is a lot of material for the class and generally we do not go over much of it.  The Cultural Anthropology is never specifically talked about in class but is a must read.  Be careful if you don't read you will have a hard time catching up.  She doesn't really get much accomplished in class as I think she would like.,0
"Goes through the slides fast, and the test has random questions",0
Definitely knows what he's talking about. Willing to answer student questions and very helpful. Gave study guide for exam. Exams aren't too hard if you study. Likes to grill students during presentations. Overall great professor!,1
"I don't know why so many people recommend him. He is a good teacher but not fit for me. His slide just the pics from book. Not help at all. And his test is really hard, tiny little things from book. U just need remember a lot of terms then useless. And his study guide is useless too. Maybe 20% is in the test. If you want to get A, self learning !",1
"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",0
"Raul was awesome! Participate in class and you'll do fine. He assigns a few papers which are reflections so they aren't too difficult. There is quite a bit of reading but to be honest I didn't really read and I did just fine. The two exams are a little bit tougher and you do have to study for them in order to pass. Overall great, nice, fun teacher.",1
Bridges is a decent professor who cares about her students and does her best to be available to them throughout the week for any confusions or homework questions. This course is really heavy on homework but the department is to blame. Another note I can make is that she tends to go off on tangents a lot and sometimes gets confused so be patient.,1
She is very experienced & knowledgeable in her field & tries to make class fun & interesting for her students. Midterms & finals are taken online and she breaks down big projects for you. Nice person & very willing to help. Doesn't enforce textbook reading but there is work to be done in her classes. You'll definitely learn something from her.,1
"Solid choice for ACCT120A. She goes over plenty of examples in class to ensure you know how to do the math side of accounting. The reading and understanding of accounting will be up to you and the book. Tests are semi-difficult but she offers you extra credit the class after so it's easy to raise your test grade by a full letter. Overall, ez A or B",1
"Dr. Osborne is an amaizng teacher. I had him for ENG 105 and then decided to take his 311 class also. He is hard in the aspect that he does expect you to dig deep into the readings, but I love to do that so it was ok. His grading is harsh sometimes, but as long as you are trying hard he is pretty lenient to help you out grade wise",1
"Professor Delius is a great professor and really cares about urbanism overall. There are a variety of assignments but none of them are too difficult. She is a caring professor and always willing to help. There is a midterm, written assignments, and a final paper. Participation is also a key part of this class.",1
Hilarious!!!,1
"Professor Lopez was a funny, charismatic, and approachable lecturer who could make Shakespeare appealing to anyone. Plus there's an option to write no essays (if you take an extra test)! I would recommend his classes to anyone. It",1
"Nice guy, but I hated him. I never understood what he was trying to explain. Sometimes would spend whole lecture on problem then say it was wrong, and it had nothing to do with homework or test. Too much theory and not enough examples. Only C I ever received at Stevens",0
"I like Yvonne, she's passionate about what she does, she's nice, but I don't like her teaching style. I took Exploring Photography, more like, ""history of photography"", she is way into art and film, you'll be using the darkroom for pinhole assignments and won't be learning much about your digital camera. Lectures are long and not hands on at all.",0
"One of the absolute hardest, yet  absolute best classes I have ever taken at SF State. Dr. Guerra means business and this class will be your first real job in the broadcast industry. If you take your role and this class seriously, you'll end up with great experience to put on a resume and great work for your portfolio.",1
Mrs. Jafroodi is passionate about teaching and very good at it as well. I wouldn't say her class was easy but with taking good notes in class and reading the assigned chapters the class was not hard. She also gives a lot of handouts in class which are very helpful. I can truly say I enjoyed taking this class.,1
"Lectures will seem long because there's a lot of information. Tests are multiple choice, but they are tough. For me, the class average was a C every test. There are weekly writing assignments that you have to be in class for and will give you an easy A along with the tests.",1
"Credit/no credit class. Nice guy who can be helpful if approached, but overall disorganized and confusing class. No exams, no homework, 1 easy paper, 1 easy final.",1
"I love mr.fultz he's very nice and funny, he says his 4's in a funny way, his reviews are the same questions on the test, his class is very EASYY, take him, very helpful.",1
Speaks in broken English that's very hard to understand what is being taught.  Never likes to repeat questions and teach at a very fast paste. Never comes to math lab are makes himself available for help.,0
If it wasn't for Professor Hays and this class I would not have rededicated my life to the Lord.  This class really opened my eyes to alot of things.,1
"The only way to learn is through the lectures, which is hard to understand sometimes because of her thick accent. She gives examples that make no sense and are not relate able, and just complains about how most of the class sucks at the material and she cant wait to get rid of us. The material is not overly difficult but she is not good at it.",0
I took Alex for her six week Calc 2 course and she was extremely dedicated to teaching her students. She gives you helpful feedback for homework and exams and takes time out of her busy schedule to meet with you if you ask. She gave us TONS of homework--often difficult--which helped us really understand the concepts. She is also quite humorous!,1
Ray is very nice to look at. He is very friendly and caring. He likes to get to know his class well and genuinely wants his students to succeed. He told us the exact two questions that were on the final exam so that we would be well prepared. I would definitely take any class with him again.,1
2 midterms. 1 final. He assigns a pop quiz every lecture to keep the class awake. Exams are based on the lecture examples. Don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's a cool guy with an awkward sense of humor that helped the lectures go by lol.  10/10 would recommend.,1
Great online course! Weekly short quizzes that were helpful for the exams and Several discussion questions plus she gives some extra credit which is awesome sauce!  If you do your work and do the reading you will pass for sure.,1
Such a sweet professor. She takes time out of her evenings the day before a test to give her students a practice test and go over it with them. I really recommend taking her. She calls on you but its okay as long as you pay attention. There are 4 tests and a final. If you put in effort you will do great. One of the best instructors.,1
"It is my honest opinion that if he was left to run a power plant all by himself, he would find some way to do it. He is the most challenging professor that I had, but not once made me feel stupid or somehow less intelligent then him. If you barely pass with a C in one of his classes, you now have a good grasp on that subject.",1
"Really boring. The class is not that difficult, but she has like a million slides and makes you stay almost the entire time. Her accent is a little thick, and she's not that friendly. Overall, she's okay. We didn't use the textbook a lot, and she made us write both a paper and have a presentation.",0
Great teacher. Very helpful especially in advising. Study the CD-rom and you are set for the tests.,1
"I had Ptak for intro bio and really liked his teaching style. Very hands-on. Rather than lecturing the whole time he will often have objects to look at and manipulate so that you can figure out things for yourself. Attendance is non-mandatory, but he doesn't put much on slides, so it's important. Sometimes leaves too much time for discussions tho.",1
She's very knowledgeable on the subject matter.  Make sure to keep up with the readings and study guide.  Also make sure to attend every class.  She's very helpful if you're having trouble with something.,1
"Craig is a teacher that does what he teaches. He is a video person outside of class time. He is able to give real life examples of what it is to make money doing video/tv. If you do not want to really work in this industry, dont take a class with him. He thinks you want a job doing what you are going to school for. Great teacher. Listen  take notes",1
"This professor is very knowlegdable but it would be nice if he could communicate well enough to impart some of that knowledge, Communication/language barier is a serious handicap to his ability to instruct. The only people who suffer are the ones who wait in hope that they will soon understand him and then lose their money by the time they realize.",0
Honestly this professor seems very good at first. I grew to find that your success is not her top priority.  She is very very strict with criteria and is unclear with instructions. She will kick you out of lab for very minimal things like forgetting to retype a revised procedure. Personally I would avoid this professor unless you are perfect.,0
"This is the second time I've had this professor.  He is awesome.  Class work in COM400 was more difficult than his COM 323 class, yet his professionalism is amazing.  I've learned a great deal from him.  Highly recommended!",1
He is a cool guy! Just show up once in awhile and turn in your paper. He is really understanding if you can't turn in your paper on time. As long as you turn in something and its decent you don't need to worry. If you just want to pass the class and are not really going to need english for your major take him!!,1
"One of the best profs out there! Gandy is really funny and class is super interesting. All notes for tests will be on slides, only in the class. If you show up and at least get the notes, read them the night before, you will pass! He does have extra credit essays to write, but they're long. IF YOU LISTEN IN CLASS AND LEGIT STUDY, THEN AN EASY A+ :)",1
"Don't take this guy if you are someone that needs organization. Lectures are PPT presentations that are like 120-157 slides long and boring as hell. He lies about assignments like he'll say to 1 person that  paper should be 1 page, then a week later, he'll tell someone else its supposed to be 3 pages. no one knew their grade til last week. he's bad",0
"Wasn't sure at first but honestly this professor really cares and loves his field of study. He has his own sense of humor, loves poetry, vocabulary, writing. Book is used so buy it, papers are easy, JUST DO THEM don't let them pileup. Trust me. He just needs to work on how he connects with the class. It was very boring. He's cool one on one though.",1
I took his Math 40 online class because I just can't do the in person classes knowing that I have to be on campus every weekdays. I work two jobs and if you think Math is a hard course? I highly recommend taking his class! Everything seems easy and you only have to meet once which is the final exam! I'm planning on taking Math 60 with him too!,1
"I enjoyed the class, it was the best and easiest of my online classes. Tapia has all the lectures posted, the exams are online, open book and open notes exams, and he provides study guides on what will be on the exam in addition to the book study guides. He literally says what will on the exam in the lectures. Anyone complaining is plain lazy!",1
"She was enthusiastic. The class was super easy, as long as you participated you will pass. I took this online, you either have to put your speeches on you tube or go into class and do them, either way its super easy. Loved this class! Pick your topic carefully, you have to use it all semester!!!!!",1
"Do not take this teacher. Extremely unorganized and never responds to emails, also barely puts work up on time for online class until half the class emails her so she has to extend the deadlines and make assignments due in 2 days rather than the week. Many long, pointless assignments 10+ pages that she won't grade until 2 months later. Just don't..",0
"Barely showed up for this class & passed with an A grade. You can skip his lectures, but DO NOT SKIP review day! He gives his EXACT exam questions so be sure to write it all down & print it on his allowed 1-page cheat sheet. He doesn't check his homework so I just passed HW1 for all the homeworks and changed the name to HW2, HW3, so on. Easy A",0
"Every student who is fortunate enough to take class with Kendra knows what it is to be inspired and informed.  In a lifetime, you are forutnate to have any one have such a positive impact on your outlook and your creative work.",1
"This class was so hard. I really struggled with it, even after studying a LOT! I did pass, barely! The tests never seemed to be what I expected or we were encouraged to study. This didn't help my HATE for history. I did much better in the 2nd part of this class with a better teacher.",0
"Morano reminds me of Anne Lamott...extremely endearing and neurotic.  A great professor, and also a great person to be around.  She has great critiques on your writing.  Take her.",1
"Best professor, I've ever had by far, the best class I've taken in college so far. He's incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and explains everything very distinctly. He tells you just what to expect and never tries to trick you on tests. The lectures are super interesting and he's very funny and charismatic, so you're captivated the entire time.",1
"Bauner is very knowledgeable about Econ, although his lectures can be boring at times. It isn't the easiest class, tests can be tricky and attendance is mandatory but his grading system is unique and balances it out. He does have a german accent but it isn't that bad. I studied, attended class, and did all the homework and got an A.",1
"You must take him for Chaucer. He has a powerful voice and speaks with logic, precision, and detail. It is so lucid. Someone said that he's arrogant and condescending. Not at all. The man is giving you a gift by being so bold, frank, and precise. You have no idea how truly considerate and benevolent that is.",1
"Really engaging class. Dr. McCartney is extremely knowledgeable and helpful, don't be afraid to ask questions. She is a very tough grader on papers, but it really helps you develop as a writer. There is a lot of reading and you write 12 journals. I feel extremely knowledgeable after taking this class. But be warned, it is not easy!",1
Lisa was a delight! Be prepared to write lots of papers and or speeches.,1
"The professor is very chill, nice to talk to. But what he did in exams is not fair. He just left us all on our own, no clear criteria of what to do in exams. Once the exam is done, he posted the actual criteria and deducted marks. If he didn't mess up the exam I would have given 5 rating :(",0
Fantastic prof! Clearly cares about his students. No surprises but still a challenging class (in a good way if you try). Highly recommended.,1
"Jill is an amazing teacher.  You can tell from the first day she loves teaching and being a nurse.  She's always willing to help if you need it, will tell you when you do or don't need something, and will explain stuff in ways that will just make sense.  I'd pay extra to have her teach every class",1
Excellent professor-understands students difficulties.You get the grades if you do your work.Simple!,1
Professor Wellborn is a fantastic teacher. I wanted to go to class and looked forward to the way he was going to present the material. I recommend him for all types of students just because of how vast his knowledge is of history and his passion for the subject. Extremely approachable and wants to see his students succeed.,1
"Dr. Meehan is a great professor for History and Systems. You have a quiz every week, so you must read the chapter beforehand but overall it's pretty easy as long as you study. She gives one 4-5 page paper and one presentation. She takes attendance, too. I loved her and enjoyed this class, history and systems is a lot of info but she breaks it down",1
Her lectures are super boring and long. She sits on her desk during lab and will not walk around and help students. She's very lazy and doesn't care about her students. Don't take her if you don't have to.,0
"The single best professor in the school in terms of ability to concisely relay a rather boring (for me) subject.  His self-deprecating humor is a bit annoying, but you will not find a professor who cares about his students more than he does--he walks the walk and talks the talk.  A great mentor, too!",1
Amazing professor.  Definately one of my favorites. if you get teh chance take a class with him.,1
Hes great,1
"Don't take S&P with Palmer, he makes it unnecessarily difficult. Much of your grade is 2 tests, which are ridiculously hard. He didn't give us any hints on what's on them, saying everything in the chapters is ""fair game"" so I spent hours memorizing like 170 concepts to be tested over 20 of them. It is the hardest and worst class I've ever taken.",1
"Since this class was virtual, she made the tests more difficult than in-person classes by making it more comprehension based. She is a fair grader and does give you tips on how to study for the exams before they come up. Make sure you are doing the assignments she assigns to get a firm understanding of the material.",1
Ridiculous with her grading. Not helpful with quetions or willing to help. Made this online class unbearable. Do not take this course online with her.,0
"two tests, five quizzes count. lots of reading. one book was ok. thought i would get lower grade but did ok. she was nice and willing to help.",1
"One of the most sweetest professors ever! She really cares about you and is willing to help you on whatever you need. The labs were super easy and the only homework there was were lab reports and weekly quizzes that you could take up to 3 times. The class can feel like it's dragging at times, but it's worth it if you need a GPA booster.",1
THIS INSTRUCTOR LOVES TO FAIL STUDENTS! His temperament is not suitable for teaching a introductory painting class. Their grading scale and attendance policy is very strict. This instructor ruined my GPA. THEY TALK ABOUT FAILING STUDENTS IN CLASS!,0
Interesting class,1
Effectively trys to provide a top tier level of ACC at a local regional level.  He has high expectations for his students.,1
"Fun Class, Hard Tests.  You gotta read the book and take notes forthis class.  He is a gret entertainer, but his tests can be very hard. you gotta work for an A in foresty wildlife and fisheries.",0
Professor Fan is one of the nicest teachers and truly wants all her students to succeed. She is very passionate about what she teaches. Her class is pretty simple and pretty easy. A few tests and homework assignments as well as a paper at the end. Not at all as hard as everyone made Econ 40 to be.,1
"High expectations, but she's an intellectual. The class discussions are great.  She directs free discussions towards the topic of the evening.  She inspires a more philosophical/theoretical inspection of the studied topics. Professor Dagenais is one of my all-time favourite professors.",1
She is inspirational and has a lot to share about teaching. The classroom environment is extremely laid-back. This semester we had a lot of classes cancelled and where she just wouldn't show up which made up lose our pace. I stopped going because it seemed unprofessional on her part. Still learned a lot. She made lesson plans easy. I got an A.,1
great guy!!,1
"Amazing professor, cares about his students. highly recommended.",1
Dr. Palmer would tear apart my papers and let me edit them. When I redid the things he did not like I would still get a bad grade because he found other things he did not like in the paper. He does NOT give good feedback. I was PRE MAE and he expected me to be like one of his research students. I would not take him for your capstone class.,0
"OKAY THIS MUST BE THE EASIEST CLASS EVER. NO TEXTBOOK NEEDED. EXTRA CREDIT/DROP QUIZ/ DROP HW...WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK? SHE WANTS EVERYONE TO DO WELL AND THE MIDTERM/FINAL WASN""T TOUGH AT ALL. I THINK THE MEAN FOR THIS CLASS WAS 85? LAST TIME I CHECKED? THAT MEANS MORE THAN HALF THE CLASS ARE GONNA GET B+ OR ABOVE. GPA BOOSTER CLASS TAKE HER!!!!",1
"Best math teacher ive ever had.  I am terrible at math, dont understand it aT ALLL!! boyer is great.  He doesnt rush through the material, he spends a whole class or two on just one concept, which really helps.  he teaches well and is easy to understand.  I highly recommend this class to ANYONEE!!! takee it!",1
Lecture then test.  That is it.  Nothing Complicated.  I recomend him,1
"Professor Rogoff is a very interesting professor in that she can be sweet, genuine, and good at teaching about the world of business, but the class itself can get easily boring and she does have a temper when it comes to cell phones. Do the work and show up to class and you'll do well. Hopefully.",1
She makes a difficult subject and research writing a good experience . She is always accessible and truly wants you to succeed. Clear guidelines and expectations,1
I have never experienced such a rude and unhelpful professor here at Miami. I was very disappointed with the way she handled situations via email and during discussions. The class is easy but is also easily one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. I loved anthropology before her class. I seriously suggest against taking any class with her.,0
"Business cal is a hard course. You will not get everything out of just going to her class and listening to her lectures, BUT she has always been there for help. I have a gap before her class and she is always in the math lab helping her students. Kim loves what she does and she is always very helpful and if you put in the work she will help! ",1
I think she is a very good teacher and I liked her a lot.,1
"I had to take this for a GenEd requirement and was worried since I've never liked English classes. However, I'm so glad I was put in Dr. Searfoss' class--it was focused on Edgar Allan Poe and a little Hawthorne, which made the material easy to read and also very interesting. The second half of the class is student taught through group projects.",1
"Professor Segev is an awesome professor. He is extremely knowledgeable and made hard subject matter enjoyable. You will have to study in order to get a good grade, but if you put in the work and study what he recommends you to study, you will do well. The material is complex and tests are long but straight forward. I wish he taught more classes.",1
"Don't take if you're a bad test-taker; tests count for 90% of your grade, and canvas quizzes are the other 10%. He is very fair though. All his tests and quizzes are multiple choice and he gives you great equation sheets that you can take into the tests. He is well-respected, kind, and reasonable.",1
"Mrs. Bartee was awesome. Granted, I never spoke to her since this was an online course. She was very helpful when I emailed and asked questions, and the actual course work was really easy and interesting. I recommend this professor!",1
Her tests are impossible and she would rather jump in front of a bus than curve your test grade.  One of the most boring classes I've ever taken here at SJU.  AVOID HER OR U WILL PAY THE PRICE,0
"I thought stats class would be very easy for me and boy was I wrong. I am super thankful for Professor Stevens for taking the time to email and guide me through some of the lessons. I almost considered dropping the course in the beginning to take it in person but with Prof Stevens encouragement, I stayed and passed.",1
Love this guy! He is such a nice teacher always taking the time to make sure everyone understands before moving on and explaining everything crystal clear! I wouldn't mind taking another math class with him,1
"I wish words could explain what I took away from Father Coutinho's class, but they can not. I highly suggest no matter what field a student is obtaining a degree in they fit one of Father Coutinho's classes into their schedule. I grew so much from the class I took and have also shared with others what I learned.",1
"Hes very nice and wants his students to succeed, but hes a very poor professor. Tests are incredibly hard, lectures are very disorganized and all over the place, and there is a ton of homework every week. If possible take Spanish with another professor, especially if youre taking Spanish 1.",0
Great professor and he is definitely the best UMUC has to offer. Be prepared for an entertaining lecture.,1
The best acting teacher ever!,1
"Professor Kraft is awesome! I was really nervous about English 101 and am so grateful he was teaching the class. He wants his students to succeed and is willing to help you.  Follow the syllabus, do the homework and you will get an A in his class.  I have signed up in the spring for his 102 class.  If you need an English class, he is your teacher!",1
"Buahahahaha!! See you on Thursday, G.! -de la Veaux",1
Dr. Harris is a nice dude.  Had him for ear training.  It wasn't too hard.  Just do practica musica and practice When you need to.  It doesn't even take that long. just do it. I think people kinda took advantage of the fact that he's nice. or were just way lazy. But I didn't think it was too hard.,1
"He's a great professor that really cares about his students. He is one of the best studio leaders for DCM when it comes to feedback, but his project statements are almost never the same as the rest of the studio and he makes constant changes to what he's looking for in your drawings. Be prepared to have some late nights but you'll be better for it.",1
It was sort of difficult keeping up with what was due things felt a little disorganized at times but overall a good teacher.,1
"Mcentie is a jerk. He rarely communicates you, and seems to not care at all for his students. Even for a community college this guy's a joke. The course is already bad, tied in with a terrible professor is just a bad time. He's not clear with what he wants in hws and essays. Just throws boring lectures and textbooks and expects you to be an expert.",0
"Heavy Russian accent. Instructor is messy when writing on board, other than that she is an intelligent woman. Will answers all your questions. Great instructor.",1
He is a great professor! The lectures are very clear and concise and is willing to make sure that everyone understands a concept before moving on. There is a lot of memorization for the tests. The textbook is not necessary as long as you attend every class and take good notes. There are a lot of notes to take but I learned so much in this class. ,1
"Great teacher!!! He is an active public defender with great experience. Make sure to attend class & take good notes. You will not need the book to pass this class. He also shares great stores that help you remember the material covered in class. Minimal homework, received an ""A"" in the class.",1
"Catherine Elliott is an incredible teacher & person. She makes 112 so fun&entertaining; I always looked forward to it. She legitimately made my writing better & her expectations are reasonable (rare quality in teachers these days). As a grad student she understands where we are coming from. Low stress, she's super helpful, not to mention beautiful.",1
"I took her winter class 2021. You do a open book multiple choice exam 3/4 weeks that is based on the chapters you have read for that week. She has Discussion questions that are also named as legal essays. She requires you to reference the book and or use resources to back up your reasoning. Pretty straight forward, hw takes up a bit of time",1
"Ok, so she has a mild speech impediment and says ""um"" a lot, and I'm petty enough to count how many times she said it over the semester. 1761 times give or take 50 for the times I was zoning out in her repetitive and tangent filled lectures. She's an easy grader, very smart, but not the best teacher... and 1761 times, think about it.",1
"Professor Tang is a godsend! Funny, brilliant, and caring. Loved her class.",1
"He's a way cool guy. KNOW WHAT YOUR CHARACTER WANTS IN EVERY SCENE!!!! Danny is very helpfull and know's his subject, so I guess that makes him good to teach the subject. He is also very easy to talk to and recieve advice from.",1
"Three exams (85%) 100 questions each. first two exams are noncumulative and the third exam(final) is partially cumulative. Clicker Quiz every week or so (5% of overall grade.) He gives chapter homework assignments like right before each test (easy 10%.)STUDY THE PRACTICE EXAMS, he does not change his exams much. If it is bolded on the ppt, know it.",1
HE is the best professor i have ever had,1
She's super sweet and the course was an easy GPA booster.,1
"This professor just reads off of her slides and goes through them really fast. She rarely participates with the class. She DOES give partial credit on exams which is, I guess, a plus. If you miss a class don't worry because she posts her slides on blackboard. She gives study points that don't really help and she's terrible at explaining things.",0
Professor Gronlund is an amazing professor! I took her nutrition class this fall semester and it was such a fun class to be in! Make sure you watch the lecture videos and read the textbook to be successful in her class.,1
Very supportive. If you want to study and take interest in class/project he will go overboard to help you. Since my class didn't have lots of student so knew each person by name.,1
Sister Kirkham is an exceptional professor who is one of the few teachers I've seen that actually does deserve a pay raise. The class is not the easiest but it's not the hardest. You're going to write essays but that of the class so... that's obvious. Actively participate it will not only help with your grade but you will get more out of the class.,1
"She is extremely nice and understanding to the fact that students have a lot going on. She definitely LOVES students who go to her office hours. That being said, the class is HARD. I'm not a theology major, but I had some knowledge prior to the course. I struggled to get a B. She has very precise expectations and does not articulate them well.",1
"He uses the phrase ""social justice"" when talking about poor people.  I wish some people wouldn't offend the rest of us with Communist-indoctrination vocabulary.",1
"He is an amazing person overall. Great professor to have for any class! He is very good at giving feedback and spending office hours with you to aid you in grasping the understanding of the text. My favorite seminar teacher. He is also a good Theology professor, but I have not taken a class with him for that. THE BEST OF THE BEST.",1
"She was the professor that made me change my major to Criminal Justice. She is so kind and will elaborate on any subject until you understand. There are 3 tests online that are multiple choice, and weekly worksheets online to do. If you show up and listen, this class is great! I would love to have her again!",1
"Mike uses humor in his teaching style.  He sometimes does not pull any punches, but he always gets his point across.  Be prepared, always read the material and be ready to discuss it.",1
"Mrs. Johnson is an incredible teacher. Her lectures are interesting and engaging. She provides numerous sources for her points throughout the class. She uses PowerPoints and often shows videos. Students are asked to participate in class, but that's part of what makes the class fun. I learned a lot about social behavior/society in her class.",1
"I absolutely loved her! She really gets to know her students and honestly wants us to succeed. She will do as much as she can to make it easier, and her classes all have built-in extra credit!",1
"I love her. If you show up to class and learn you will have a great time. She is super sweet and cares about her students. In Bi 121 Lab she does grade on spelling, but that is a good thing. It makes you better.",1
Loved this class and prof. MacAuley. Took this class for an ethnic studies requirement but wound up enjoying it more than most of my other classes!,1
"I took this course on top of MBioS494 and got As in both. But, it was not easy. You earn it. Yes, lots to read. Yes, lots to write. Oh, but the learning. You will learn-A LOT, and A LOT is expected of you. If you haven't taken tough reading/writing courses, these are not for you. No excuses, including ESL. You've been here 4 y already! Thanks Prof.",1
"She's fantastic. Don't be scared off by her syllabus: it's intense, 8 pages long, and has footnotes, but that's because she takes the class seriously and expects you to take it seriously, too. If you make the effort, you'll succeed - and she's incredibly helpful. Made me a better writer, and I added a Philosophy major because of her class! ",1
Super nice professor and such an easy class. Shes a very easy grader so its not hard for you not to earn an A. And I love that she always gives great feedback after every essay!,1
the class is not bad at all if you actually listen and pay attention to what Dr. Stone says in class. he guides you and is very accessible outside of class. he explains materials well -- lectures are engaging with crude analogies,1
"Difficulty in class is due to material, NOT professor. During Midterm week we had 5 exams, the last Friday was capitalized by a Quiz none of us had prepared for. You could feel the mood of the room and asked if he could move the quiz. We were fried and he knew it. We reviewed the topic and he moved the quiz. I will always respect him for this.",1
"I would definitely take Nedd again. He runs his class almost like an online class except you still have to show up twice a week. The only grades he gives are a small quiz every week and a few short essays. As someone who has never been incredibly interested or motivated in art history, I actually enjoyed this class and his teaching style.",1
"Paul Mueller is an excellent guidance counselor. He simply puts students into groups to complete a workbook, sits back and refuses to answer questions. Tests are a serious struggle, due to the lack of preparation in class along with the grading period wich seems to be a semester-long process.",0
I learned so much from this class about literacy. What she taught was so helpful for me to be prepared for practicum. She provides good feedback. I would take her again.,1
Dr. Vutha is one of the best professors at OSU. He holds many review sessions outside of class and makes sure you are ready for every single weekly quiz and exam (every 3 weeks). Class is weighted 70% on the exams so be sure to do well. Final exam was tough but all other exams were quite easy.,1
You have 10 quizes each worth 10 points. 3 test and a final. No homework. Quizes and test are what make up your grade. His lectures can be confusing at times and he expects you to read to book. Test are a little tough. Gives one extra credit opportunity for 5 extra points. ,1
"I'm really unsure why people gave him such good reviews. He's a great guy, horrible professor. He only puts up 4 or 5 grades a semester and 4 of them are tests. He teaches his 101 class like a 300 class and goes way too deep into geography. He doesn't teach what Geography 101 warrants. He's also incredibly monotone and difficult to listen to.",0
"Daigle grades on a very high curve, probably because everyone would fail the tests if he didn't. Tests are really long, especially for a 50 minute class period. He is SO boring and I can't even stand to take notes. Hard to study for tests, and there are only 3. Very unclear and hard to follow his lectures. Good luck if you take him...",0
Solid instructor. Wish he would do more difficult examples of differentiation on the board. Don't forget your minus signs!!!,1
Really nice and sweet teacher but make sure you do your work because you might think its an easy class if you skip or fall asleep don't its an easy A class cant get below a B if you do your work,1
Gupta's idea of teaching is to read the textbook's provided slides while waving his hands around in front of the class as if the students have come in to class knowing the material. Anything that becomes difficult for him to describe is ultimately left out of the lecture. There is also no curve in the class.,0
"I loved his classes! I have taken a few classes with him. The class online is easier due to it being only 3 exams online take him open book. EASY-A both times I took his classes, but his online POS2041 class is easier. Highly recommend, don't believe the haters, ask around.",1
"Professor O'Sullivan isn't really a bad guy, he's not a great professor. If you ask for clarification he'll give it, but whether or not it's actually clearer depends on the concept. As far as assignments and tests, I've been completely lost. You'll have to do plenty of outside work to do a decent job. He's curved some tests, which helps. Avoid.",0
"Dr. Rossi is intelligent but somewhat hard to follow in class. He's a difficult professor, but a great guy to talk to. His class requires a lot of reading and note-taking, but getting an A is far from impossible.",1
"Fast talking, hard to keep up with, and gets off track a lot. I had his 3 hour class and I could not take sitting there listening to him speak! It was so boring and most of the time he did not let us out for a break. His tests are hard. You have to write two essays and he does not grade them generously. He knows what he's talking about, though.",0
"I had her for my thesis class.  I wasn't hugely interested in the Holocaust but once I found my topic, I became really fascinated.  As I worked on my thesis and argument, I feel like she wanted me to go one way when I wanted to follow it another way.  She didn't seem overly open to new points of view or thinking outside of the norm.",1
"Non accurate prof. Tells you one thing but screws you over for it. Not the best prof in scad, should just leave.",0
Super easy! I've never taken such an easy class. Granted I feel like I didn't learn much. All quizzes and the final were on quizlet. The final is literally all the quiz questions so I recommend taking pictures of the answers to the quizzes and creating a database that you can reference for the final. DB and web assignments are easy too.,1
"<3 this teacher! She really knows what she's doing with you, and your voice will improve, like, 150% by the end of the semester, but she's TOUGH at the same time! Only bad thing is, she likes to talk more than actually teach you.",1
I took Ms Hunt when I was a senior @ DV. and let me tell you she is amazing. She loves kids and she loves teaching child development. She knows what she's talking about. Of course the class takes some work. She's very understanding and would recommend her. P.S she has her crazy moments and she's incapable of being mean.,1
"Nice guy, but I lost count the amount of times I almost fell asleep in this guy's lectures. Talks too fast, and goes through slides like lightning fast. Goes so fast we all have to take pictures of the slides since he doesn't post the solutions to the questions. Also his quiz and exam questions are WAY TOO HARD, ended up failing the final.",0
"HARD! does not explain material very well. goes way to fast.  He is so smart that he does not understand basic questions.  SO SMART.  he is funny and a nice guy. you really need to stay on top of things, and you can go to him for help. It's just SOOO much is thrown at you, and fast.",0
"I would recommend taking Dr. Crockett. She truly wants to  help her students succeed. Her class is discussion based. She is clear about her assignments and provides a grading scale for each assignment. The assignments are not difficult. If you attend class and put effort into your assignments, you will have no problem obtaining an A in this class. ",1
"She is very enthusiastic about what she is teaching. She also always tries to communicate with students in her class and have fun. But the opportunity of getting extra credit is not fair. It is only for those who have the better understanding. Also, you have to prepare to write more words than numbers during the test which was pretty annoying.",1
"Funny guy. He is passionate about the subject matter and as someone who dreaded taking Theology he was still able to make a difference in my life. Read his syllabus carefully because he does not like to go over it a lot or remind of due dates. Go to class, pay attention, and read when it is assigned and you should do well on his midterm and final.",1
"Seymour puts a lot of work down but he's a really cool guy and he gets it and had a smooth transition to online. At the end of the year, he will typically let you turn in all your late assignments or ones you didn't do for full credit. Love him because he understands the stress we undergo as college students.",1
"Prof. Hasegawa is academically advanced, but a very poor professor. Her lectures are long, boring, disjointed and extremely hard to follow. She is hard to understand both logically, and due to her accent. She does a poor job of answering questions clearly. Not UW quality,  and definitely not worth my tuition. Very unfortunate. ",0
"Dr. Gelburd is a great Professor! If you're passionate about the arts, I recommend taking one of her classes. She knows her stuff and if you want to learn something, take her class. She's great about individual help and quickly replies with to questions. Anything below a B+ can be rewritten, which not all professors allow! Gelburd is a cool Prof.",1
"Took MTH200 over the summer. She talks really fast when she's giving the lessons, but if you're confused, she slows down and explains for you. Very lenient grader for tests and goes over every homework problem. Courseload is very little, just study for tests, and you pass. Her accent is a little hard to understand at times, but you get used to it.",1
Amazing professor that actually cares if you make it in the real world.  Wants you to see the big picture,1
"Ohh man, this is the most hardworking class i have ever taken.  He expects us to do a lot for one quarter.  Nice guy and sometimes funny.  Our final is a take home which is a 9-10 page assignment and we only get 4 days to complete...it feels that this class is non-stop work",1
"attendance is mandatory even though nothing she goes over is on the exams. Exams are based solely on the textbook. Probably would be better as an online course. Her attitude was not the best, i wouldn't recommend",0
"This was a required class for my degree and I was so excited for it  and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Tricky tests, tough grader and very confusing lectures. A LOT of reading of articles so get ready for that. If not required, don't take it is all I can say. ",0
"Very knowledgeable professor! I hate politics but he makes it interesting, is very thorough, knows his stuff and does a great job explaining everything! Hes super professional and handsome too *wink *wink",1
"I took Aesthetics with Prof. McConnell. I loved the class, I thought he was a great teacher. He was extremely passionate about the subject that he taught and that more than made up for any eccentricities he may have had. His class opened my mind in many ways. He may be uncoventional, but he is a wonderful teacher.",1
"He is a really kind professor. I generally dislike having to read articles and write journal entries, but he made it more interesting and the journal entries were straightforward. We had four main papers, and he gave us a full class period to work on revisions. He also gave us feedback and suggestions on our first drafts, which was very helpful.",1
"The best english teacher ever. Read everything he assigns because there will be quiz. The content of the class is boring but he makes it so interesting. Take good notes, read, participate!",1
"Good prof, good ideas, hard to keep up with sometimes. Helpful guy though and generates enthusiasm, Tests not representative of any in class questions, could be vague and grading criteria subjective",1
"Dr. Zhao is very enthusiastic about the subject and comes prepared for lecture with power point slides (which he up loads to blackboard prior to class). If you utilize his office hours he can be very helpful and he generally cares about his students and their grades. Biochemistry is not an easy subject, so  it does require some time in effort.",1
"Very confusing at times, sometimes wasnt very clear. But this class was super easy! Just show up and he usually gives you an A for effort.",0
His exams are tough so study ahead of time. They are directly from the book so as long as you read and take notes you should be good.,1
"He's a pretty nice guy. Class is pretty easy, just pay attention to his long lectures and memorize the things on the study guide and you should pass. The tests are straight off the study guide but you should ask him about some ambiguous terms to get an A.",1
"Great instuctor. Easy to follow. Gives slideshow handouts for notes and printouts (prepunched for a binder) of sample programs found in the book, and then teaches on those.  Gives some extra credit, and is very helpful when you have problems.",1
"Great teacher overall. I took his class twice because I got a D the first time around. If I'd given the subject more attention though, I know I could've gotten an A. I actually enjoyed taking his class the second time just because of how knowledgeable and likable he was. Some people got annoyed with him but I think they were just being impatient.",1
He is very straight forward about grading.....12 quizes (2 lowest dropped) and 4 non-cumulative exams.  Be prepared to take a lot of notes and study a lot.  He is very helpful if you have questions and really knows his stuff.,1
"awful prof, awful examiner",0
He uses a work book that has very poor explanations and he just expects us to learn from that. He rarely explains things to the class or actually teaches. He just has use go into our own little groups and do something we don't understand. His class is a mess. We don't know what we are doing or why. he randomly stops talking for several minutes.,0
"This was a hard class because of the crazy amount of material. I wouldn't recommend taking it. That said, Dr. Lyons is a really nice person and a good professor!",1
Bogdan was great his class was straight forward you learn alot of vocab. Yet this test try to trick you but  if you read it twice you'll get it,1
"Nice guy but treats Intro 101 class more as a master's class. Too much material covered & ""study guides"" are just lists of what's possibly on tests; did not include what he's specifically looking for, which is relevant bc there's so much side material that you lose site of what he's considering the main points. Low class test scores so not just me",0
"Her class is super easy, you have 3 tests and the final. The tests come straight from the reviews, so study them a bit and you'll have an A in the class. Class is super easy and she wants her students to do well. Take the class, you'll pass. ",1
"It's the exact same course as GOV 2301. This guy has a really awful voice and likes to yell at his captive audience. You will be forced to hear about his neighbor's noisy pool pump, Ugg the Thug, and how stupid Sarah Palin/Charlie Sheen/Tea Party/anyone who disagrees with prof. is. Quizzes are easy, answers are online.",0
If you have her as your prof please drop that course. It's the best advice I can give you. The midterm avg for our whole class was below 50%,0
"Professor Elliott is hands down one of the best profs I've had so far. Passionate,respected, organized.",1
Not available outside class. Always tries to avoid students and their questions. Not organized at all.  Made simple things more complicated. Never gonna take his course again.,0
"Great professor, probably my fav professor ever.",1
"Accounting is truly the hardest course in college.  I literally passed 1 test bombed the other and never got two back.  By Professor Sullivan making the class so hard the weekend of the final I busted my ass and read the book over and finished the class wit a passing grade better than my expected D.  Not as bad as peep make him out to be, but read!",0
Great Professor! Bob made this class very interesting. He was very helpful and engaging. One of the best classes I've taken!,1
"I took this class as an elective. As a hybrid course, it was demanding of critical thinking which was helped to hone that aspect of my learning experience. The professor was very supportive of student learning and concerns.",1
Matt's lectures were really interesting and he was really helpful outside of class.,1
"This professor was by far the worst of my entire academic career. Lectures are irrelevant. If you are unfortunate and are taking this class, she posts all of her power points on Beach Board and attendance isn't mandatory. Take this time to read the book because this is what you will be tested on. Great personality. Terrible instructor.",0
I see the last comment on the Prof was in '0 so i think you guys need an update. Teaching is straight forward. Emphasis on the math more than the theory behind the math. So if your skills in Math are weak then be careful.  Assignments are tricky but easy enough.  Midterm was SUPER LONG...barely made it. FINAL WAS NOTHING LIKE MIDTERM.,1
"The professor is awesome. Make sure to pay attention to every detail in class because he will go over most of what to do on assignments and exams, and those things are not easy. Do your best to get help during his office hours.",1
"He is a great professor, and goes into depth with his lectures. Just make sure you read the assigned chapters and the class will be a piece of cake.",1
"Waste of time...class is extremely easy, but she discriminates against certain students and likes to have control as if we're in Middle School.  She gets too gassed about being a teacher- class is boring, but an easy A...try to take online if possible.",0
Hardest class I've ever taken. The tests were impossible. I had a CPA help me with the assignments and they had problems.,0
Mrs. McGlynn is hilarious and a sweet professor. She is knowledgeable about the teaching profession and is very honest which I really appreciated. I learned a TON in her class but had very few homework assignments and the tests were short and sweet! I would 10/10 recommend.,1
THE BEST TEACHER I KNOW LOL...KOOCHIE KOOCHIE LAW...KEEP IT UP YU ARE TOO SMART,1
Amazing teacher. Really tries to keep the subject matter lighthearted and interesting. She is very straight forward about her requirements for assignments. Very lecture heavy though and only gives term lists for tests. If you go to class on and take notes you should get an A no problem. Attendance is only mandatory on reading discussion days.,1
"My favorite teacher this semester. He is very relatable, doesn't treat you like a child. He is always available for extra help. I did not feel like the textbook was essential. Expect pop quizzes but they're easy. ",1
"There aren't many tests, but you do learn a lot by participating in discussions.",1
"At the beginning of the semester he seemed really tough, but if you work hard and get your stuff done on time you will do fine. He really helps during his office hours and he wants students to learn!",1
"BEST PROFESSOR EVER, TAKE HIM. When I saw I was going to have to take a legal class I thought it was going to be boring as hell, but his class is far from that. I actually looked forward to going to his class. Wish he would teach more classes in business so I could take them. Easy and informative classes, show up, listen, no stress.",1
He just lectures the entire class which gets very boring. The quizzes are super easy but the tests are very difficult. Geography was my best subject in high school. I took this class my first semester and got the lowest grade in this class. Expect to study a lot more than you think you will need to.,1
Dont take him !,0
"This lady has no idea how to teach. She makes you put an absurd amount of work into her class and expects everyone to just know things without her telling us or to figure it out ourselves. Shes not the worst, but she wasnt my cup of tea",0
"Easy A as long as you show up or at least know what hes lecturing about. Sometimes hard to follow, he loves to talk- most of the time not about subject material",1
"His online class was the best I've ever taken. Simple and to the point, but thorough. Only post response to discussion board, no response or reply to another post. 3 Tests, open book and straightforward. One paper of your topic choice. Swint is also a pretty funny guy, very relaxed!",1
He is so funny. If you try to get to know him he is willing to help. Good Guy.,1
"Professor Wu is not boring, rather very interesting and easy to listen to. He knows how to keep your attention and I liked his style of teaching. Every point counts in this class, so make sure to do well on the online quizzes just in case you need those points to boost your grade. Oh & try ur best to attend all classes. I would def. recommend him.",1
"Steffens related world issues to whatever we were learning in econ that week. I found it to be really interesting and she did a really good job explaining everything. She also offers a ton of extra credit. My econ grade wasn't too hot at first, but because of her journ. portion of the class, i just raised my grade tremendously",1
"The way he does the class note's are great. He is approachable and funny. The assignments are challenging, but make you learn the material. Mid-terms' are very hard. He made the final exam the semester I did the course and put on a question I was told not to worry about by tutors', as it had not been on the final exam in over a decade.",1
The worst professor ever :(. please don't take her class I had no choice but take her class because when I register for class all the teacher info was TBD. I got so much stress just thinking about going to her class. she doesn't give you enough direction to perform any experiment and she is awfully sarcastic at everything.,0
"Class felt somewhat disconnected. She's not really receptive to feedback. If she asks a question in class and nobody knows the answer, she will act as if we are all mentally incapable. Grading is average, she gives partial credit. You must do your homework, she randomly checks it for credit. Quizzes nearly every class. Exams are relatively easy.",0
"I took math10 with him. His lecture is really organized. I agree that he is a hard grader, but it is really reasonable. Just go over the notes and homework then A is very attainable.",1
"Pretty easy class if you read the book. As long as you go on quiz days you should be good. Youll end up reading the ENTIRE book. The slides are basically the book. Theres 1 group project, gives study guides for the tests which can be found on quizlet. But youll NEED the book",1
We all love Doc!!! Best Instructor Ever!,1
"Took my Inq. Seminar with Professor Bullock. This guy is super helpful and becasue of him I really enjoyed working on my seminar. His comments are really helpful, and I enjoyed this class more than most other history classes I took, despite not really having much interest in Washington and the Cherry Tree (at the beginning of the class).",1
"Expect homework and reading assignments, but rarely long and strenuous. No tests or quizzes, and lots of opportunities for extra credit. She is a fair grader and cares about her students and will help get you the best grade should you put in the effort. If you need to take a philosophy class, make sure you get her!",1
"One of the best professors by far at UAB.  Great sense of humor, and very willing to work with you.",1
"Mildly passive-aggressive in class, but willing to explain some topics again when asked. Tests are poorly designed (typos, repeated questions & confusing phrasing). Was appointed to instruct my class at the last moment, so not entirely her fault. Generally interested in student learning, though lectures are not always useful.",1
Terrible Professor,0
"Retired PGPD commander, told it like it was. Very honest & straightforward. I learned more in this on class than the last3 years at UMUC.",1
"He went very slowly through my linear class; very little new information was given each class. He generally goes over the previous class's lesson at the start of every class so you can honestly just go every other class and be fine with it. Also, he has a pretty nice beard.",1
Nice,1
"He was confused, I was confused, everyone's confused.",0
"Always wants the best for students, and the study guides he gives are very helpful.",1
"Dr. Kidonakis Completely understands the material but dose not know how to teach. He also give copious amounts of Homework which take hours to complete every week, and his tests are extremely difficult. That being said the class is a difficult one regardless, but If you do not find your self talented in physics, avoid this teacher.",1
"I love Dr. Zlesak! He is funny, enthusiastic, and makes learning about plants fun and exciting! I would highly recommend him.",1
"This professor is horrendous. I emailed him and messaged him through canvas multiple times and did not receive a single response throughout the entire quarter. Course load was ridiculous, spent at least 4 hours a day on this class to keep a 4.0. He would 100% be unemployed if his wife was not head of the Psychology department. Avoid at all costs.",0
One of the best teachers for language I've had so far.  Extremely recommended teacher.,1
"So the class is easy, but it is not information dense. He does have a VERY think accent. He is hard to understand. He will repeat himself and is loud. Please be warned this is not a good class for people with even minor add/ADHD, it is very easy to get distracted as there is very little to write down as much of it is repetion",1
"Nice but grading is arbitrary. Turned in final draft of paper that was nearly identical to 1st draft and got perfect score on final but B+ on 1st draft. Students with weaker presentation skills graded more leniently. Largest grade scaled down based on rating given by teammates, opening you up to being screwed by anyone you had a disagreement with.",0
"TAKE HER CLASS!! She loves every single student in her class! We have a Discussion board, essays and a lot of homework!! Plus the TA is super chill and cool",1
"Cramer gives really great lectures, he's a great eloquent speaker so definitely come to class and pay attention. The exams are hard-- studying is required. As long as you pay attention and take good notes you'll probably get an A.",1
"Tests and discussion posts are based on the textbook (take detailed notes!!). Tests are worded strangely and graded harshly, so make sure to clarify the wording with prof. I stopped watching her recorded lectures a couple of weeks in. There is a 10-page final paper but you work on it all semester, so it's not bad. An A requires consistent effort.",1
"Dr. Brown is a great teacher! I took his three hour course and was generally engaged the whole time (which is difficult.) He does a lot of activities so you're not bored, and I found all of his assignments to be worthwhile! He's a super nice guy and a great resource even after you're done taking his class!",1
The best professor I have had while at the University of South Carolina. I learned more from him than any class or other professor. He is real life and doesn't tolerate incompetence. He calls out the slackers every class. Take him and learn more than just the subject material. He is funny and doesn't look like a typical professor :+),1
Lisa cares deeply about what she teaches and it shows! You will care about it too after taking her class. She is very engaging and an easy grader. Be prepared for group work/discussions.,1
"Seems a bit eccentric at times. But hes a great guy and hes honestly just very passionate about what he teaches. U can learn a lot from him. Took him during the summer and he was very lenient with grading. Heck, I handed in papers late and he didnt mind. He just wants u to get something out of his lectures.����",1
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
"He is a nice guy and the class is a typical English class. However, he took forever to grade and I wish he gave harsher feedback. During conferences, he would dance around what he wanted to say and after he graded it, I realized what he really meant.",1
"Holtan is amazing. She's such a good person. She's very understandng, practical, caring, and a prof you will remember. TRUST ME!!! Plus her classes are very much not ""just lecture."" With the last class I took she took us for sushi- ie b/c it was ""Cross-cultural comm"" and we had some kick ass discussions.",1
Professor knows her subject. Tests are HARD! Gives opportunities for extra credit - take them because you're going to need it. Do all homework.,0
"Frequently late to class, rarely responds to emails, tests you over things that aren't covered but doesn't use the book. She requires you to purchase the book even though it's on canvas... We're very behind and continuously get farther behind because she goes off on tangents about her kid or husband. DO NOT take",0
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. ,0
"He will not, ""he will not..."" round your 69.15% to a 70.00% even if you are were close in passing the class. Find other Professor that is more considerate. He will not answer your email or ""will just say grades will be out soon!"" You been warned to not take any of his classes. Dont say you never read this... good luck finding a better professor.",0
"Avoid at all costs. Refused to answer students questions on designated exam review days, because he ""didnt know if the questions would work out"". Lectures last an average of 20 minutes",0
Doesn't have any leniency on quizzes or tests.  Pass/Fail kind of teacher. Very helpful outside the classroom.,1
"Good professor, he doesn't assign a lot of work",1
"Her tests came directly from her notes, so that is really the only thing you need to study, don't buy the book. Her lab practicals were pretty easy. She hands out a chemistry packet at the beginning of the course, make sure you complete it and get it all correct! She adds those points to your final average- they can make or break your grade.",1
You get about 8 quizzes but he chooses your best 3 for your grades. Grades on a curve at the end of the semester. I barely showed up and passed with a C. A little more effort and I could have actually gotten an A. Taking Soc 012 with him next semester.,1
Great teacher,1
mrs. jafroodi is really nice and very helpful in class. so far i am enjoying being in her class!!,1
Best science professor I've ever had at Carleton.,1
"This was the worst professor I've ever had. I'm so disappointed that SVSU employs someone who could care less about his students success. Makes his students feel stupid, scared to ask questions, and does not try to help you in any way. Tried telling me I plagiarized a paper this semester even though I went to the writing center for help! AVOID HIM",0
"He was an overall ok prof. His classes are basically him reading his slides and explaining a bit on its content (good examples). As the semester progressed, lectures were kind dull to go to b/c they got uninteresting. Aplia assignments and 4 quizzes are fine, but the final was difficult b/c it had nothing to due with previous class assignments.",1
"Professor Birch's 4650 & 3050 are structured the same way and its not designed to give you any feedback nor help you improve your understanding. 90% of your grade is based on exams . Average on most exams were between 60-40% so good luck and don't expect him to help you, since all of your work is thrown away!! Guessing is encouraged, No Home Work.",0
Extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. She really wants students to learn the material in a way that is applicable to their life and future career field. Encourages critical thinking and fosters an environment for healthy discussion among peers which is often difficult in an online class.,1
Professor Freed is easily the worst professor I've ever had. She teaches like a kindergarten teacher but grades like a grad school professor. She's useless at getting information across but she will grade your papers impossible hard. I'm an english major and I've never had a professor who grades like Freed. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.,0
He is the worst prof ever.,0
Great Class. Hardly any homework. All quiz and test questions are gone over before hand. Professor Alexander is a very cool guy and has valuable insight into the Criminal Justice realm as a  Public Defender.,1
"Patience beyond measure, critical yet never demeaning, and overall a wonderful human being. It was a pleasure to take his class.",1
"Some complained about Dr. Balshine, but her lectures were very clear considering this was her first time teaching this course. Maybe those people didnt study, or were lost.Also, she gave us opportunities to raise our marks with the critical review assignment and bonus marks. I think she did a good j",1
"Is she easy? Certainly not. But she's an absolutely fantastic teacher. I'll be honest, I was absolutely terrified of her after my first day, but now I really love her. She is probably the best professor I have had in terms of natural ability to explain material. Next semester is her last at Clemson, but if you have her, you'll learn a lot.",1
"This class says it is synchronous but the Professor operates as if it were asynchronous. Only requiring that we be present on test days. So that means little to no lectures to explain the work you're expected to know. HW is provided weekly. Test are VERY difficult. 12-15 answers per question on test to choose from, instead of normal 2-3 options.",0
I went to every class paid attention. Went for tutoring in math lab & nothing helped. When he gave the first test the info seemed foreign to me. I wouldn't advise taking him.,0
There were interesting topics and it related to my major. Readings are long & confusing but she explains it though you have to pay attention when she talks. She is picky about grading papers but goes over drafts if you ask her. I started doing more readings to finish groupwork as the extra points for it helps your grade.,1
She was so helpful during registration when she wasn't even my advisor! She got me into classes I needed for the major and outlined an academic plan with me. Thanks Rizella!,1
"Absolutely amazing coursework with a professor who truly cares about his students and how they connect with the content. Would absolutely take his class again. If you fail, it is on you. He gives a lot of time for asking questions and drops lowest test and essay grade",1
Prof Tone is THE best Prof Ive had at McGill. She cares genuinely about her students/always willing to go the extra mile to help (ie she sent me 2pgs detailed feedback on my final paper proposal which was a BIG help - no other prof has done for me b4) if you want to take a class where you will def. learn as opposed to memorizing TAKE HER CLASS!!!!,1
"An interesting guy. You basically do nothing in class. I took the service learning class and everything was done online. I'm not sure if it's like that for his other classes. He's nice, but cancelled class 4 times. Basically don't even worry about showing up to class more than a few times. You'll just watch movies that have nothing to do w English.",1
Prof. Lorimer is GREAT! I learned so much about teaching history from this class. You can tell that she really knows what she's talking about and that she cares about students. Dr. Lorimer explained the reasons behind all of the assignments. I really like learning about different techniques and technology to use with my students when I'm a teacher.,1
Span 315 with Profesora Hess was a great class. She is very knowledgeable & also very funny & nice. She's also helpful during office hours or after class if you have any questions. Highly recommend her. ,1
"Not a horrible teacher.  She is really nice and tries to make the horrid subject of accounting interesting.  She makes it seem easy and just when you think you get it, the test is totally different and harder.. the homework is all online and is super easier (sometimes time-consuming).  Got a C+, take it online to save some $.",1
On the second day of class he asked me to throw something at him to let him know what time it was. I laughed then later found out he was serious and I now throw stuff every day. He is easily the best professor I have had at Penn State. His class is very interesting. He skips around the classroom (literally) and shows pretty sweet videos.,1
"Professor Swartz may seem scary at first but he is just trying to weed out students who don't belong in hard STEM majors. I took his Chem lab 2 semesters in a row and he honestly is a teddy bear once you get to know him. He will not explicitly give you answers but help you to think in a way that you come to the answers on your own. Overall, great.",1
"He is one of the best professors I had this year. His lecture was easy to understand as long as you follow his stories. But the reason I'll take him again is that he can always help you on any type of question outside of the classroom like current events. Go talk to him, you will be amazed.",1
"Excellent teacher. She really forces you to think about the assigned readings. Her feedback on papers could be a little more helpful, but I think this is just because of her bad handwriting. She is very helpful/insightful one on one. Again, excellent prof",1
"Terrible professor. Assigns homework that isnt mandatory but helps your grade, then spends all of the class time going over said homework. He doesnt teach. Tests are super hard unless you know the material by heart (and great at it) BUT its probably the easiest class to cheat on tests. If you can find a way to cheat, take this class. If not, dont.",0
this class is the reason i question the use of gen eds.  literally so confused every class. his lectures have absolutely no structure  hes really good looking but i wouldn't take him again,0
"I took professor Kanetis for intro to philosophy. He is full of energy at 8 am everyday and is ready to roll as soon as he steps through the door. If you are a person that skips class, you won't pass his class. He has a strict participation score. As long as you read the chapters and participate, you wont have a problem passing.",1
"Great Professor, and down to Earth",1
"Shamane is a great professor. My class only used the textbook twice, but it's not required. Some writing activities from the books are used for some assignments. She is a little intimidating at first but is a good instructor that will push you to become a better writer.",1
"Very helpful, enjoyable to be in her class. She gave us 3 pre-exempt absences. Very thorough in class, always worried about your grades and helps you in office hours. She cares about your grades.",1
I enjoyed Prof. Haney's class. He knows his class and he enjoys teaching it. Very reasonable and helpful.,1
"Hard, but I actually learned something",1
"Do the prelabs and do them well because you will need all of your notes during lab. He comes off kind of mean and strict, but he just doesn't want anyone to get hurt in lab. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not he's being sarcastic because of the masks for COVID, but he knows his stuff. He has a ton of office hours, USE THEM!",1
"Even though she demands a lot in class, I'd take her again. She really pushes you to the next level! Cont. Modes of Criticism is a hard and rly course. Weekly: 3 hard essays and reflections. Annotated biblio & such for final paper (12-15 pgs)ASK FOR HELP! She will e-mail you back and makes time if you ask.",1
Professor Hutton is a wonderful professor who defiantly has a passion for children & will do anything to help her students.  Not only is she a teacher but she is also a mother and foster parent to 6 children under the age of 20 years old. As long as you follow her grading rubric you are sure to get a good grade.,1
She's more than willing to help students who are having difficulty and seems to actually enjoy her job. She honestly cares whether or not students understand the material. The only problem I've ever had in her class is reading her handwriting (gave up trying a while ago),1
"Melanie doesn't try to embarrass people or be hard on students. She is very direct and that's just how Deaf Culture is; it's not about you, get over it. She is always helpful, humorous, and if you do the work, you'll excel and improve your skills! If you can't take feedback from a professor, then good luck being an interpreter...",1
"I dont understand the negative reviews on here. Professor Blake is an amazing professor and has very clear grading criteria but requires you to earn the grade you want, its not an easy A. He pulls right from what he goes over on class for quizzes.",1
Watkins is a genuine professor who cares highly about his students. He has traveled the world and has the most amazing stories. I would take another class with him in a heartbeat. He likes to engage in discussions which makes learning more interesting.,1
"Great teacher, the only problem I had was that assignments didn't get graded for an extended period of time.",1
He is a great professor who really wants his students to understand the material and succeed in class. He is also extremely approachable and do not make you feel stupid for asking questions in class. I would highly recommend students to take him as their physics professor. 1 test gets dropped which helps a lot!,1
"His quizzes come directly from the homework (which is optional) and the tests are composed of a bank of questions he provides. (With the numbers changed of course). So if you put the time into his class you can get an A for sure. However, his lectures were boring and largely based on theory instead of how to solve it. ",1
"Chef Haze was never in class! He was either writeng emails or gone while we cooked the food of the day. If we have ?s, too bad! Poor class, poor teacher.",0
"5 assignments (5x10%), 1 presentation (10%), 1 outline (10%) , 1 essay (20%), participation (10%). Donna was definitely not a standard prof. Very quirky and funny, at times unprofessional and uninformed but amusing nonetheless. Class was a very easy A. Class not grounded in theory, wishy washy text books. Waste of time but a good grade booster.",1
"Mr. Watkins does a great job teaching. He is a well-versed, well-traveled former businessman who loves his job and will teach anyone who is willing to learn. His classes are challenging, but can easily be accomplished with study groups or studying in general. His tests are multiple choice, T/F, & maps. Great class, Highly recommended. No book.",1
"Dr. Aguilar is a great professor, even though i took her class in maymester she which was great overall. If i have to take another english class it would be her. Do not take maymester if your not going to read, arrive to class, or do work, you will fail!. She is not lenient at all when it comes to grading.",1
"Professor Garcia is an EXCELLENT teacher! She makes sure everyone in the class understands what needs to be done for a paper. Each paper she gives you will teach you something amazing by the end of it. She inspires her students and lets them know that they can achieve anything they want to. I HIGHLY recommend Professor Garcia, you wont regret it.",1
"Prof Conner is an amazing teacher, I took her for College Algebra and i am very thankful for everything that i learnt from this class. Math itself is very confusing, but if you pay attention and do homework you will have a good grade. I would recommend her.",1
"The structure of this class was very different than any other psych class I had taken. It was nice to be able to watch the modules on your own time and I found my discussion group helpful. Chris is a great guy and his videos were very straight forward, but I think for this course in particular, you interact with the TAs way more.",1
Professor Blair is a great teacher! Just read the material and you'll do fine on the quizzes. Try your best on the essays and ask for feedback if you feel stuck and you'll get an easy A.,1
"Dr Hanson is a very respectable and knowledgeable instructor. He pushes you to work hard but is helpful and reasonable about grading. If you take the class seriously, there's nothing to worry about.",1
"Easily my favorite prof I have ever had. Doesnt tolerate people not working, but clearly appreciates your hard work. Very clear on what he wants. Blackboard is layed out amazing, very explanatory. He is a stickler tho.",1
"Dr. Pan is great teacher. Always willing to help. Failed all my tests except the last one, did well on the final. Always go to office hours cuz he will see that you are trying. Gives about 10 homework assignments. no quizzes. clicker questions--so go to class. tests are similar questions from class, textbook, and homework. Physics was hard for me",1
"Easy, but boring -- she just reads off power point slides. As long as you know everything on the study guide she gives you (just look in the book), you'll get an A.",1
"Half-way through the semester Meryl tossed out the lesson plans and threw caution to the wind. She left everyone in the dark about the grading for several projects and piled on papers, exams and presentations for the last week of class. She is a wreck organizationally, emotionally, and professionally. Unable to use the computer or moodle. ",0
"She is an amazing prof! puts all slideshows and video recordings on moodle! If you want to do good in psych, pick her as your prof! :)",1
Very easy class if you do the work assigned. You will never stay the full class. He lets you out early every time. Expect to go to class to write the essay and then leave. You will love his class.,1
One of the best prof in dealing with the current situation! 1)livestream lectures(also recorded). 2)online office hours. 2)cancelled remaining assignments + posted their solutions. 3)fair assessment measures (he is using proctorio for exam + helping us practice on the system). 4)changed his grading scheme for the benefit of students. 5)very caring.,1
"Overall an amazing professor, always there to help and is very open.",1
"You actually have to be there to pass, she explains everything and you have to do the homework to pass. Other than that you will learn some good french from her.",1
"Great Teacher! You will get an A. Just Have the F it mentality and perform. Dont be shy just do it. Think about the objective really, use tactics 3 at least in an act. Easy class. Gotta love the teacher~Take it during summer or winter",1
"Professor Bauman is the best writing teacher I've ever had. She is extremely helpful and really wants to see her students do well. She expects you to work hard, but her class is fun and you'll learn a lot. I highly recommend her as a teacher.",1
"She's a really organized professor. Everything's neat, grades are quickly and orderly posted. Class is extremely easy to get an A in. Somehow ended up with an 99... She drops one exam, homework, and lab which gives so many chances. Only complaint are her jokes, they're so terrible that I enjoy them.",1
" For this semester D'Sa has changed the syllabus to make the class even harder than last semester. The class now has quizzes instead of participation. If you miss just 1 question on a quiz or exam you will lose 1 percent of your grade. You will learn a lot in class, but it isn't easy. Take Spizman if you want the easier professor for Finance 3410.",1
"His papers are given 2 weeks to write. first week, He assigns a reading you'll discuss and how to relate it to your paper. The second week, you'll give a rough draft, then a peer review, then a final draft. He is a tough grader, almost impossible to get a high A. If you dont go to class, you wont understand how to write it.",1
"took both american romanticism and New orleans in lit with her and Dr. Watts is AMAZING!!!!! she's super smart, really interested in what her students think, and strongly encourages independent thought. entire grade is based on essays, and she's a pretty easy grader. passionate writing gets As. TAKE HER!!!!",1
"This woman is THE BEST teacher at JSU!!! She is only rude or blunt to you if you ask stupid questions or act up in class. I'm taking every possible class with her! There is a good bit of paperwork in this class, but it is very helpful and pretty easy. I loved this class and I love Mrs. Barclift!!!",1
Great Professor for organic chemistry. The class is hard but his lectures are great - take advantage of them by watching them live to ask any questions. Wish I could have taken this class in person.,1
"10/10 recommend I loved this class! He takes role every class but his class is enjoyable. 2 midterms, 5 homework assignments and a final. He gives study guides which are a list of terms from the section and you just need to memorize the definition. That is basically the test. No math or case study in this class. Only memorization. Super easy class!",1
"a horrible professor and a horrible person, holds no regard to her students or those around her, grades inconsistently with no explanations doesnt respond to emails or even texts dearborn should just drop her",0
"Best professor ever! Incredibly interesting lectures, time flies by unnoticeably! Dr. Clasen is very knowledgeable and cares about your knowledge as well as your grade. Prepare to work and to study. I haven't worked that hard in a class ever in my life, but I exit it confidently with solid knowledge. Thank you, Dr. Clasen! You taught me well!",1
"I don't know what this guy gets out of ruining your GPA and making this class 100 times harder than it is, but he just loves it. Will not help you in any way shape or form. Worst class of my life.",0
"Funny and knowledgeable, grades very leniently. Cares about the material and wants you to learn!",1
"Very sweet and helpful teacher! Show up to class and you will easily pass. Definitely tries to help everyone pass, so don't be afraid to ask questions. Lets you bring a note card for tests. Definitely do all homework and quizzes for easy A. Definitely recommend!",1
"I took Mrs. Wedemeyer for a mini-mester and let me tell you, it was tough. She knows her subject and is great at it. Be respectful and don't get frustrated when you ask questions and she seems to be rude. She wants to challenge you and means no harm. Probably one of the best teachers i've ever had. Be ready to do some work in this class.",1
"Prof. Maojoudi will lecture quickly & he does have a rich accent so my TOP 3 TIPS are sit at the very front, take detailed notes & write quickly.  It was a pleasure to take a professor who is so  passionate about his craft & although he seems like a tough guy on the outside he really does want to see ALL of his students succeed! Maojoudi rocks!!",1
Lots of reading. Memos are tough. Class activities seem annoying at first but are actually pretty fun.,1
"Phelps is an amazing professor. While he may be a bit difficult to take notes on at times, he is overall very clear with what he expects from you. In my experience, if you just come to class, pay attention, and do the work given to you (which isn't that difficult at all), you'll easily make an A.  I'd definitely recommend him. :)",1
"Be prepared to not know when you are presenting, however it is not that bad of a class. He helps you get comfortable with the people in your class and has your best interest in mind.",1
"She is a great teacher,very sweet and very easy,she accepts ALL late work at anytime.",1
"His lectures are great and easy to understand, but his grading criteria is illogical. Take him at your own risk. You will learn the material but can be stressful",0
"Sweet grandmother type. Teaches very well, tests are hard, but she gives out study guides before hand so if you study you'll be fine. She doesn't like dumb questions, try to pay attention. I learned a lot about accounting. ",1
"It's a very dry course so her lectures are not all that enjoyable. That said she could make the class funner by maybe teaching some applicable material instead of a bunch of models we are never going to use. Tests are fair, she rarely pulls a Bailey, can't ask for much more than that.",1
i loveddd cogan i had him for my freshman learning community so im not really sure how he teaches but he seems like an extremely easy grader and hes halrious ! take himmm !,1
"Class and Professor Unorganized and unclear. Never know what is expected. Arrogant, self serving,controlling, retained hardly anything. If you can take a different professor for this class I would recommend it.",0
"It's evident from her teaching that she's not the BEST professor, but certainly you could do worse. She's known by students to be very rude and generally unavailable. Honestly, if you take this class with her you'll pass and getting an A isn't difficult, but if you can avoid it...",0
He does care.,1
"Great professor. He definitely knows how to teach and is excellent at what he does. Obviously, as a student at an undergraduate/graduate level, no one should be going in expecting an easy A. You need to work for it, and he gives you a ton of opportunity to learn and understand the material since he wants you to learn. He is also very approachable!!",1
"He was my professor for the animal psychology research lab. He definitely tells you how it is and may demand a lot, but he is also very understandable and personable if you have a working relationship with him. He is extremely well versed in his discipline and I  would HIGHLY recommend learning from him.",1
We weren't able to have his class face to face due to there not being enough room for social distancing. If you're not good at chemistry definitely do not take this class online. I struggled but was able to pull out a high B. 5 tests and random quizzes sometimes weekly. One chance for extra credit and its an essay.,1
Professor Jon Dunham cares for his students. If he sees that the class is struggling he will address the issue and help the class out the best he can. He sticks to the syllabus when it comes to essays and the portfolio but not with in-class assignments. Come to class and do the assignments and you will do perfectly fine.,1
Dr. Young is very nice but the class itself is very hard and can sometimes be confusing. You have homework every day and weekly quizzes online. There is only 3 tests and a final exam.,1
"Math 112 was super easy. The homework really helps, so do it. Other than that, just show up.",1
He was a good professor and was very knowledgeable of the material. 4 tests that were 25 questions and 4 assignments worth 10 points. 140 points makes up this class with a few extra credit assignments.  For 100 level course the tests were somewhat difficult. Overall good class and professor.,1
"If you genuinely want to learn physics and comprehend the concepts, take Cooney. Understand the topics first and your grade will follow with it. He explains everything in multiple ways to make sure everybody can get a sense of understanding. He does iClicker questions, group assignments (groups are no bigger than 3 people), and standard homework.",1
stay as far away from her! she dose not know how to teach!!!! when students ask questions she just says every one is right and dose not give a complete right answer.... she dose not know what she is talking about and she forgets everything she dose and says...dont take her class you will regret! she is not helpfull and she is soo baD!,0
This is a tough class! He will be very straight forward with you from day one. Only take class if you are serious about wanting to be in the medical field. Test are advanced. Make sure you have time to study EVERYDAY! Oh... And make sure you participate!,1
"Class is boring, but you definitely should come to class in order to get the i-clicker points, which is worth 15% of your grade. Midterm is only hard for those who do not know how to study properly for this kind of class. Try to get Wei Mei for TA, he is great! Class is semi-easy, it requires it's own share of studying.",1
"If you want to pass the class expect to work for it. He explains everything thoroughly and clearly, but you have to pay attention! (just like any class you want to do well in). He tests on what he presents in his lectures and uses the textbook problems as test questions. He's there if you need help, just ask & don't be afraid. Work hard! Good guy!",1
She replaces your lowest test grade with your attendance grade so if you go to class  you can bomb one test.  Her lectures are really long and boring but all of the test information is in there so just study them a lot before a test. I thought the class was easy and the tests were not too hard if you study.   ,1
Mr. Prunty is an amazing teacher. He takes the time to help you if you need it and all her lectures are clear cut and there's no way you wouldn't understand them. I'm bummed he isn't going to be teacher 101 next semester he is really awesome and I would definitely take him again. It's really hard to fail his class.,1
"Loved Ken, such a caring and dedicated guy. Easy classwork but very interesting. Also, super funny and helpful!",1
Really helpful and has great stories. He will give you his honest opinion so don't be afraid to ask.,1
"What an awesome professor! the only thing graded was 4 speeches, the midterm (which were exactly the same on the review) and the final (which were also exactly the same on the review. it took him some time to get grades back, but he is an easy graded. Great to take for intro to public speaking",1
he lets you get to know the other students before actually teaching the stuff. the book stuff is boring but the speeches are fun. he makes it comfortable and easy to speak in front of the class,1
"She is a great teacher. She is not hard at all. She is very specific about what she wants and what you should expect from her class. This is an easy A if you do the class work, follow directions, read, and study. She gives out a lot of work but its very easy.  You will pass the class if you STUDY and COMPlETE YOUR WORK!! She well help if you ask :)",1
In terms of workload its not hard at all. The 3 agency reports do not have a due date so just get them done when your free. The quizzes and test come directly from his notes and if not in the notes you can just find the answers online. He gives plenty of time for the quizzes and is very understandable. Do the extra credit it helps a lot.,1
Fantastic professor. Lovely lady!  I learned to much about parenting from her. Don't buy the textbooks tho.... she tests from her slides.,1
"Dr. Lewis is a great guy. He really knows his stuff...he is very helpful, and his class is enjoyable. I would definately recommend him to anyone taking CS.",1
"Mrs. Stewart is a passionate, inspired, and caring teacher. I highly recommended for beginning learner because she gave extra credits for bonus works, and the way she taught really helps second language students or students who don't have strong English base, and it's easy to get high A in her class. I got 98 on my class average!",1
"I have my Bachelors now and Monica was hands down the BEST professor I ever had between UIUC and Parkland. She was accessible for help, didn't make you waste time learning things you didn't need, and was thorough. She was very go with the flow and let us make the class our own in that she would give us options for the timeline of things. 15/10 lady",1
I enjoyed this class a lot. It was challenging without being overwhelming. The instructor has great presentations to help learn the vocab words. Some of the activities in the book can get boring but the ones she makes herself are great! She is really picky about following instructions and calls on people to speak. But she is fair in her grading.,1
"Tough class, a lot to cover. Good teacher he knows his thing. ",1
B-O-R-I-N-G !!! Impossible to stay awake in his class... he surely is a nice and intelligent teacher but there is no structure in the course. You can definitely stay at home all semester and just read his power point online...,0
Dr. Maril is my favorite prof I've ever had. He gives you the facts to base your own opinions on social problems without giving his own beliefs. The readings are on the test so if you slack off on reading your grade will drop. He does not use powerpoints or BB so you have to go to class to take notes on lectures to study for the exams.,1
Hes a great person hes just tough when it comes to grading. Theres never a right answer.,1
"One of the best professors at MDC, he truly goes out of his way to help his students. He will give extra credit to boost your grade since not everyone is good test taker. It is for that reason he gives open book and open notes test, and mentions the questions in the lectures. I definitely recommend him.",1
"She's a lovely person and fantastic professor. You get out what you put in. Classes are super easy, as are exams. To learn, make sure you do the work. You can pass having done nothing so everything is up to you. Homework took me an hour a week. She's super helpful and always there for you. You also learn a lot about France.",1
"Erika was one of the worst professors I ever had. She's very rude and only lectures. She showed us really boring movies also and I wanted to fall asleep every day in there. I enjoy history and anthropology, but this class made me question that. Also, the readings were so long and hard to do. Please don't take her class.",0
Mike does not like his students. He acts as though students are idiotic unless they know what he is thinking and he is incredibly disorganized. He has no idea what he wants from his papers and gives grades seemingly randomly. He has ruined my love for literature this class. Discussions are bland and boring and he gets annoyed easily.,0
She is difficult. Only give 10 minutes only per quizzes and it's given every week for sure. She takes off points for the tiny things like if you don't put a degree symbol its like 2 points off. So ridiculous! She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :(,0
"AWESOME professor. I wish I could take him for every math course. He is super chill, I highly recommend this class. He uses Aleks for homework and ebook. 4 exams. He takes attendance every class but it's not strict, just communicate",1
"If you show up and do the requirements, you will get a good grade.",1
"Class grade is based on tests, quizzes, & attendance. 10 written & practical exams. 6 quizzes. One test from each section may be dropped. Overall, if you slack off and don't study her lecture notes, and attend lecture, don't expect to get an A. Ask questions! She gives helpful info that will help you on her tests! She's a decent teacher to take.",1
"Dr. King is a great professor! Though at first his module seemed a bit disorganized, he eventually pulled everything together.  He is extremely helpful in office hours and will talk to you about just about anything. Also, he has a great personality that makes him fun to listen to and he almost always has a tie that relates to the class!",1
"Whoever said Maria isn't respectful must be talking about someone else. I've taken her 3 times and she Is SO intelligent. Depending on the class you take, she is so educated  on topic & makes the class fun. Definitely assigns a lot of work but it's relevant... she is willing to compromise with class sometimes if we aren't happy with assignments.",1
Professor Hunt makes interesting topics out of material that many would find boring. I would say that BL432 is one of the most useful classes I have taken. Due to Covid-19 our class was half in person and half online. It was the one class where I feel that I had the same quality of learning online as in-person. Don't hesitate to take it online!,1
"Professor Hinshaw is very nice and approachable, but I found his class boring and his teaching overrated.  He reads from his powerpoint slides, which makes it useless to go to class, since you can stay home and read them yourself.",1
"Is huge on participation but doesn't have it organized at all. Make sure you just speak aloud like the rest of the people. Don't skip class it really hurts you, you will lose 5% each time and he has no mercy. Make sure to participate even though its really hard since he's really boring.",1
"Dr. Lamkin is super hard. She jumps from first slide to random slides while explaining. Don't take anatomy with 3-4 classes. Requires a lot of reading, understanding and the most important memorizing. If you want an A you should like put A LOT of time studying. Definitely not an easy A. Her labs are extremely hard like her lectures! No extra points",0
goes well beyond material in the assigned readings; often brilliant and original insight; dynamic teaching style; helps students develop interest in the topic; does not waste class time; more exegesis than one might expect from a systematic theology course,1
"She's a super nice professor and the content is somewhat interesting. The only problem I had was that she treats an intro class like it is the only class you have and gives you a crazy amount of work. If you like philosophy and want a lot of readings and assignments, then this is the class for you.",0
"I wish I'd taken this class earlier, because it really explained a lot of things I didn't understand before. She really wants to make sure her students understand each topic before moving on.",1
"Too easy. If you are someone who is wanting to improve on grammar andor their writing skills, do not take him. He plays too many movies in classes, which I find to be a waste of my money I am putting towards the class to earn the credit. He could be rude at times to some. I would not recommend him.",0
Sister Kirkham is easily the best professor I have had so far. She is so kind and caring and allows you to feel safe in her classroom. She has taught me so much through our text book and also through her own personal experience. She is so inspiring and I would love to take another one of her classes if I could.,1
"Is unfriendly and condescending based on mood, quizzes are memorization which dont help with writing or speaking the language. Midterms and finals are from worksheets but even after studying everything he manages to twist the exams so that everything the students studied for werent actually on the exam or were replaced with something else.",0
"This was a good class& teacher but she had that tough,scary act at times that made you want to do all your work. She was pretty helpful but it was also pulling teeth when it came to written assignments. She always said something needed to be change, nothing was ever perfect. & she said she never gave extra credit which i thought was kinda wrong.",1
"She's easily the nicest, most genuine woman/teacher at IU. She wants her students to do well in both her class and in everything else. She is extremely helpful, and she's legit proud of you when you do well",1
Dr. King is not a good professor. He is EXTREMELY disorganized and gets lost in the middle of lecture. The PPTs don't help for studying. He sometimes says random things that only confuse us. Tests are ridiculously hard. No matter how much we studied we scored pretty badly. He's the only one teaching cells so good luck and may you pass the class...,0
"DJB is an amazing professor at UT! She gives incredible lectures and always adds funny stories. Tests are the same across the accounting department, but you should be fine as long as you pay attention in class. Do all the homework and extra practice problems she hands out!",1
"Dr. Ramey is an incredible professor! Every time I left classI left in a great mood. I really enjoyed his class, and his teaching style; he makes you think. If you attend his lectures and read the assigned readings you will do well on the quizzes. If you need help, he and Ms. Funkhouser (TA) will make time for you.",1
"O'Leary is full of fun dad jokes and always lighting up the class with his joy. He's there for support, even bringing in the BARK dog program to class for stress relief. He truly is my homeboy when it comes to chillin. 10/10 would recommend",1
Dr. Cogan is funny and passionate about what he teaches but gives a lot more work than I imagined. I've had a paper/presentation/quiz each week of his class. If you put effort in you will do well.,1
"Which one of you sick mofos gave him a chili pepper?? He's a sweet guy, and a good prof, but honestly...",1
"Monica is the BEST. She explains everything in great detail, wish she taught bio 122!",1
"If you're looking for an easy A, this is it. Just don't miss too many classes or he drops you/ you won't know when assignments are due. No tests at all with only a few assignments, just do them and turn them in and you'll get an A. Lets you leave early almost every class and you watch movies frequently.",1
hes okay buts confusing,0
"She is fantastic. Straight forward and clear. Expects you to know the material from assigned chapters, learn smart and homework. Plenty of in class practice. Exams are tough but will help you prepare for CPA. Wish I could take for all Acctg course. Highly recommended.",1
"i cant stand her! worst professor ever, i would NOT recommend! she pics a few ""favorites"" but stay away from her! your GPA will thank you!",0
This teacher is so nice! I don't know why anyone would not want to take her. She is willing to stay after class to help you if you need help or you can stop in her office. She tells you what's going to be on the test so you can study what you need to study. I would recommend her to anyone. She brings treats for the class at times to. Loved her!!!!!,1
LOVED this class! I was worried about taking this class because I struggle with math. Mr West makes it very easy to understand how Logic works. You must attend every class though or it will be challenging to pass. We hardly even looked at text book. Learned everything from classroom exercises and discussions. ,1
"UI100 is a blow off class, everyone knows it, except for her. She thinks this class is the most important thing in the world. You have at least 6 pages of homework from her workbook every period. She talks about how great of a teacher she is and how the students are stupid for not preparing for other classes. She thinks she's funny, she's not.",0
"TURB 432 was an interesting class, but It was a bit hard for me. We learned about income inequality, transportation & housing issues, as well as cities that are doing well & not so well. There's two tests, four short papers & one long one, + a group presentation project on a city. Get ready to know stuff because he likes randomly calling on you.",1
"Mr Mustari is genuinely concern About covering all material so you can be ready for your next course, he gives you more than enough time to finish homework and quizzes. The one downside really depends on your leaning style mr Mustari is lecture heavy/lots of proof,  no class participation. Overall a great pick in my opinion.",1
"I LEARNED SO MUCH in every class I took from him. VERY, VERY CHILL. Very friendly. He gives us classwork/homework but doesn't grade it. He goes over the answers later in class and MAKES SURE everyone understands. Four tests. Wish he could teach all my classes. I always feel incredibly smarter after each class I take from him. VERY SATISFIED",1
Great professor! Very easy going.,1
Professor Abarra was a very good teacher. He did seem to have his favorites even among those people who did not always show the most respect to him. He really enjoys what he does and conveys that in his teaching. I was scared of statistics before his class and now I'm ready to take it on.,1
"Melissa was very helpful and very accessible outside of class. If you uploaded an assignment and it did not show up on Blackboard's end, she reached out to you to let you know so you could email it to her! Some teachers would penalize you.   Group project. Head's up.",1
"ALI, ALI, ALI, this guy is the real thrilla in Manila, Clear, flexible understanding and fair. He should teach the other Profs at York to be like him.",1
"Lee is a nice person. He's very brilliant but cant explain the material that clear. He tries though and if you asked him about something, he is willing to take time and help you. Easy class overall!",1
I have taken Dr. Hynes for a total of 12 graduate level credits in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling department. He is an excellent professor. His classes are always interesting. He has an excellent sense of humor and engages all of the students. His is readily accessible and very knowledgeable about the subject matter. I recommend his classes.,1
I took her claas and got an A- with little effort. EnvConc Psych was very chalenging though. She's the most kindhearted person ever. I was also her TA. I can't wait to take more of her courses. easy going and laid back.  Her grading is totally straight forward if you do you assignments.  She's young and fun and loves her job.,1
My 2nd class with him (first was 252).  Very tough grader but delivers the goods every time. Take anything neuro from him if you can.,1
Tancredi is a great guy. He clearly knows his stuff very well and clearly loves sharing it with others. He is crystal clear on everything and isn't hard so long as you pay attention. He is easy to talk to and approach and will help you out with anything if you need it. Also an amazing musician. One of my favorite professors.,1
"His english is a little rough, he gets his words mixed up, but in the end...he's not that bad. He test on what he teaches and he gives in class assignments as reinforcement. Easy A",1
Professor Aizura's class structure is pointless and makes it so that you can get a really bad grade by missing classes where he has an in class assignment (20%) and discussion posts (also 20%). It's counterintuitive and he will ignore your emails when you need his answer the most. Class content is interested but the readings are soooo long.,0
"Doesn't go through examples thoroughly. Practice and practice more! The key to passing the tests is know your reactions top to bottom, backwards and forwards. I'm not joking. Half class dropped, many students in there were repeating the course for a 2nd and 3rd time with him. Reading the book helps a lot/homework. Lectures don't cover everything!",0
Attendance is not mandatory but is recommended because it is very helpful to do the tests.,1
"Very demanding, but if you listen closely to his instructions, you will learn alot. Bring your papers to him to look over before the due date.",1
He is a teacher that acts like you already know how to complete this math. I spent most of the class lost. During lectures he talks so damn fast and again acts like we know everything that he's doing.,0
One of the best professors I have ever had. I never liked math but she made it tolerable. Very caring and goes out of her way to help students.,1
"I am a senior and just finished taking this course. It was by far the best course I have ever taken in Iowa. The lectures are interesting, provocative, and force you to think about issues differently. I wish I could have taken more courses from this professor. Students should take at least one course from this professor before graduating!",1
"From experience, I highly suggest taking someone else. Eileen is very rude and humiliating to her students in class. It's happened various times during the term I took it. She doesn't know what she's doing half the time and she doesn't help you, she insults you when you don't know something. Shame MDC doesn't have another Opera Works. professor.",0
"Beba's one of the nicest professors at this school. She's knowledgeable about her craft and imparts that knowledge with a real zest that makes it fun to learn about. Her assignments are creatively-thought out and don't feel like assignments. If you get the chance, take a class with her.",1
Great and interesting professor.,1
"Terrible, Does not want to help you.  He talks down to you if you don't understand what he is teaching.  He goes around in circles and forgets what hes talking about.  Save yourself from this class.  I should have.",0
"English is my second language. Took it as gen. ed. Surprisingly enjoyed it. Mrs. Spearman is an ideal prof. very clear, very passionate, genuinely cares about students' education. If you're someone trying to learn then you'll love her, if you want an easy A wo effort, then forget about taking this class with her. SHE IS AWESOME! I'm very thankful ",1
"Take his class if you want challenge. He knows his thing but he is a tough grader, he grades every single homework and didn't accept the only late homework that I accidentally forget to do. Tests are hard and didn't give partial credits on tests so I screwed up really badly. (could get a B with partial credit but get a D) try to avoid him.",0
"Anyone who says he's a good lecturer, must have had a different prof. He's boring, condescending and vague about things like what's on the exam for no reason. He never recorded his lecture for no reason and never wanted to help us in any way. Snobby and pompous",0
"Quick and too the point, great instructor",1
Nice professor. Very well organized. She would tell you whats going to be on thetest. And very helpful. Just do all her homework and come to class and you will receive a good grade,1
Show up and pass.,1
correction to the previous post.Class is ADMS 3700,0
"Awesome professor! I am terrible at math in general and she made me understand math topics I had failed in high school. Shes very good at explaining things and will take time to make sure every student is on board and clear with what is being taught before moving on. Had her for MAT 111, take her you wont regret it!",1
"would not take any class by him again, he treats the class like a 400 level course. I don't care for art history and thought taking a 100 level course in it would be fine but no. He genuinely does not care that you do well and is not willing to help you with anything. I have other legit classes I had to focus on than ART HISTORY.",0
Every class period was the same and he never seemed enthused about teaching us the material. I was eager to learn about International Economics but having such a disheartening teacher made me resent the course. He's a nice guy but if you want to learn do not take his course(s).,0
Prof. Lane had one of the most straight-forward classes I've had. She makes sure to walk you through/thoroughly explain every assignment before making you do it on your own. She also gives unlimited tries on quizzes and assessments so there is no excuse for bad grades. Do your work and you are guaranteed a good grade.,1
"I had Mi-Sook for the new module-oriented foundation courses for Art majors. The thing I disliked the most was unclear directions-- changed from class to class, and if she misspoke, she would act like that's what she had been saying all along. Also, she was hard just to be hard, not to help. She generalized students, didn't feel like she cared.",1
"Guerra-Pujol is a great professor, he really tries to keep his lectures interesting during class. Overall, this class is an easy A. As long as you keep up with the deadlines and meet the work requirements, you'll be fine. The exam is an open book which is amazing.",1
"The professor used the class as an extension of his ego, funneling all talk through himself, using half of each class to pontificate, and belittling anyone who did not agree with him. He is easy, but nothing is worth spending time with such a character. Learned next to nothing. Very poor professor. Do not take him.",0
"Very personable, he is a bit of a picky grader, but an easy B. As long as you follow the essay format for the three essays that he teaches you in class you will be fine. He literally tells you how he wants each essay written. Interesting enough topics as well. Overall good.",1
"I have had Hersha for several classes and she is hands down my favorite professor at the Academy.  She is always fabulous, is very intelligent, makes her classes actually interesting, and knows so much about the industry!!  If you want a class where you just read the book and take a test this is not it though.  She likes students who participate!",1
He's a teacher that desires each student to comprehend the material. Be on time to class and respect him.,1
"One of the best professors I've EVER taken. Prof. Mangone taught the second half of Genetics, one of the more difficult classes a Bio major will take. I loved his lectures and he was very inspirational. I decided to take his BIO494 class on RNA the next semester and I am so glad I did. He will inspire the crap out of you. I wish I could write more!",1
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
She assigns readings and make sure you read them. She doesn't give study guides or lets you review the hw or tell you what to study. Make sure you go to lectures for attendance and lecture questions on tophat. Screenshot the questions because that's the only time you'll see them. Lectures are beyond boring personally but she's really into it.,0
"Dr. Mehta is one of the best professors I have ever had thus far. His assignments take time and effort, but are carefully crafted so as to effectively teach the material and do not feel like 'busy work'. Beyond this, Dr. Mehta is a genuine and caring person who likes to get to know his students.",1
"Richards is a decent teacher, but this class was HARD & STRESSFUL for me since I'm not good at accounting. I switched my major after this class. The chapter cases were difficult (some more than others) & the worst part is they're due the SAME DAY they're assigned. I hated the LearnSmart's as well. Buckle up; take LOTS of notes & get help if needed.",1
"Don't be frightened by the past ratings. Kaur is very understanding, she made it a point to my class to figure out our needs in order to teach the material well. The workload was not too bad. It was just weekly readings, 3 exams, and one presentation and paper. Lectures are long but everything she discusses is important and crucial to the exams.",1
Unfortunately he is not at all a good professor. he has numerous war stories that dont pertain. Also he will send you emails but will never respond to your emails. Also do the papers that are assigned in the Syllabus. He will not mention a word about them until the last second & not give you the criteria for them until the day theyâ??re due.,0
Danny is great! He is clear on his objective's for the class and gives great feedback without making you feel bad. He always has something good to say and he always has critique. He's hilarious and kind. The class is huge and can get boring when people aren't prepared. But you can learn a lot and the scenes are fun. Focuses on drama and simplicity.,1
"Dr. Jacobson is easily one of the best professors at the college. The workload is light. Her lectures are engaging, lively, and fun. At the end of the semester, you'll walk away from the class intellectually stimulated with a wealth of knowledge that's been distilled from her ability as an instructor, rather than from mountains of arduous homework.",1
"By far the worst and most boring professor I have had here. The lectures drag on for hours and it's essentially a compilation of random facts barely stitched together. The two exams are made up from the books, and the notes in class are worthless and confusing. The lecture is mostly just rambling and videos. Do not take for an easy A.",0
"I loved him! I was in the honors section, so he was my discussion leader and i got to know him pretty well. He's such a sweet guy, bought us all coffee the first week of class. He really cares about his students a lot. He has a lot of real world experience, brought in guest lecturers and we watched films. it was a great class.",1
"You will lose points if you skip his class. But you dont have any choice but to take his class because he is the only graphic design professor, which is infuriating because his sense of design is so off, he thinks textbooks from the 80s are ideal and has no idea about current trends. he still hasnt let me turn in my 1st project!",0
She gets off topic a lot which causes class to be behind frequently and you must catch yourself up. Easy to follow but tests do get harder as class goes on. No homework besides a group assignment at end of semester. Easily accessible outside of class by email or office hours. Very friendly and understanding.,1
"She is an amazing teacher and i really loved the class.It was one of the easiest and most interesting class.i actually learned many things that i didn't know before and she inspired me to discover new things. If you take your time and do your best its easy class to get an ""A"". strongly recommend it. i also took her GEO 101 class and it was easy",1
"Her lectures are pretty interesting, and she always engages the class in discussions about the topics. The only thing I didn't like about this class was the exams, which were on MindTap. The questions were based off of very specific details from the textbook that we never covered in class.",1
"Dr. Choi is such a nice, funny guy! He really makes lectures enjoyable. He explains the dense readings very well. I have honestly enjoyed his class, despite the large amount of course material you will need to know for his tests. He does like to play the ""Devil's advocate,"" though, and get into some pretty tense class discussions. Prepare yourself.",1
"The class was hard, but Dr. King makes an effort to get you to understable the material as best as possible. The tests are tricky and detail specific, but not impossible if you study.",1
"For an online class, this professor remained extremely involved with the class the entire semester! The material is interesting and he really cares that students both understand and enjoy material. This is definitely one of the nicest, best professors I've had! Definitely take this class :)",1
"She is definitely a great teacher, everyone has their own negatives and the only bad thing I could really say is that she doesn't accept late work. The plus side about that is she gives plenty of time to complete the assignments. She is picky in her grading but to give her credit, she does state her instructions for the assignments pretty clear.",1
"Staples is an awesome person, very funny and caring but the amount of work he requires for his micro class is intense. The lab is a super rushed and you have to master so many techniques in such little time. Objectives and study guide questions are due every Wednesday. Its really just a lot of work be prepared to study and be busy all semester.!!",1
"I took her course online for Spring 2016. I'm not sure if it's because I took several years of Spanish in high school, but I found the course extremely easy. My computer also crashed while I was taking an exam, and she let me retake it! Most professors wouldn't, or they would up the worth of your final exam towards your final grade. Very friendly!",1
"Mr. K was fantastic! You can tell he is passionate about art, drawing, and composition. His lectures are filled with rich descriptions of textures or moods to inspire us as we draw. His feedback is thoughtful, honest, and encouraging. If you are someone who's just there for the grade and you don't care about the spirit of art, he may annoy you.",1
"Group project is a huge part of your grade. This scared me at first but I did really well. He was very helpful and offered up his own time to help us get the work done. Really funny and super smart. Also, no final!",1
Brad was awesome. best calc teacher I have had,1
"Mi Sook is a very nice person. She really does care about her students and wants to see them succeed. When your projects aren't done she stresses out. If you suck, she will tell you. You are expected to work hard and you know you earn your grade in this class. It's tough and you have to have an excellent work ethic to pass this class.",0
"Please, Don't take her class. Even if shes the last option because of registration deadline, just wait until next semester She's truly not interested in teaching or helping you to understand the material. Unless you have a gift in the sciences or can teach yourself, you will be wasting your time and money. Please study with a professor that cares.",0
"Professor Fazelpour is very very clear in his instructions. To a T. He does a lot of database work which shows in his teaching style - very exact with formatting. Nothing left to question at all. He does a lot of work with flowcharts and pseudocode, which takes practice to get right, so do the homework and you'll do great.",1
The BEST professor ever! I am not a chemistry type of person but he made me love it because his lectures were very understandable. He's a funny guy and is always there for you to reach out to. People that give him bad reviews probably got a bad grade in the class. I'm not an easy learner. Reviews are kinda like the exams and offers extra credit.,1
"Last semester I took Mrs. Murnighan's Intro to Business class and currently I'm in her Intro to Human Resource Management class. AMAZING teacher! I love her and she's my favorite. She's extremly helpful and always enthusiastic about teaching. We always have interesting, knowledgable conversations and class discussions.",1
Professor Milinovich is one of my favorite teachers at Dominican! He is so engaging and interesting. Pretty easy to get through his classes as long as you do the readings. I learned a ton in his class. He is a wonderful human being and everyone should take a class with him!,1
"This is one of the best professors I had in my MBA program. He was able to convert the whole class into a team whose members would help each other and think ""out of the box."" Students can get a lot out of the time invested in the class. Professor James supports his students in any possible way and gives multiple opportunities to get a good grade.",1
"Goodwin is an amazing teacher. The chemistry series is by no means easy, but Goodwin is always available and willing to offer help. If you are hardworking and do all the work and a bit more, you'll do very well in this class. Would definitely recommend!",1
"Professor Gibson is incredible ! a few homework assignments , a bibliography and a research paper. She wants her students to pass and enjoy writing papers. She is very passionate about writing. Always keeps her students engaged. I loved her class please take her !!!",1
To be honest she isnt very helpful and she can be very rude she gives out too much work and she gives out too many essays and she is very specific on what you need to do would i take her class again nah,0
"Take notes from his lecture slides! Make sure you really understand his slides and if you don't, read the textbook to clarify. Also, go to recitation!! Extremely helpful for practice!! Jasmin can mumble a lot, and he can be very rude so try not to get on his bad side. It became clear who he did and did not like.",1
An absolute sweetheart. I would take her class again in a heart beat. I had the online class and it was super simple and had MANY extra credit opportunities theres no reason you wouldnt pass. Genuinely cares about her students.,1
She was helpful and greatly improved my writing. I had her for legal technical writing. She requires you to put a lot of thought into your work. I cannot recommend her highly enough!,1
"Very fair, gives you many opportunities to pass with extra credit papers.  Will meet with you on her own time to give more instruction.  Expects you to give an effort and if you do you will pass.",1
"She's very rude to her student and talks to them like we're all kids. Almost everyday she come to teach with an attitude and makes rude sarcastic remarks to the class. Need to go to the bathroom? You'll get told you move too much. Want to blow your nose? Don't you'll be ""too loud"". I've never had a teacher be so rude and uncaring than walling.",0
"Swingley talks a lot about feminism in her classes. Even though it's an editing class, many times we talk about other things besides editing during the class period. I thought I was going to learn about commas, semi-colons, etc., but we only talked about how to address each gender in writing.",0
"Amazing teacher.  Awesome personality, so nice, helpful, I could go on and on.  She will only give two exams all semester: midterm and final exam.  Both are take home, open book, open note.  Easy A with such a great teacher.  I'm honestly going to miss her",1
I took the online version over 4 weeks during the summer. He divides the class up into learning modules so it is pretty easy. You have to watch 5 hours of videos and write a paper on what you observed and then you have to observe a classes on your own for five hours. It is not that hard. He's a good teacher take him.,1
He has good slides and does a thorough job at going through them in lectures but does nothing more than that. However this course is fairly easy and if you do all the relevant problems in the textbook you're fine.,1
"Burke is the best teacher I've ever had!  She inspired me to change my major to chemistry.  I've taken her for Organic Chemistry and Advanced Organic Chemistry.  Know the in class notes inside out, and you'll pass any test she gives you.",1
You will be lucky to stumble upon one or two professors like Dr. Cote throughout your college career. Chemistry is the science that aims to understand how all the stuff in and around you works and changes. Cote is the field guide you need on this particular safari. She will take you through difficult terrain and show you the wonders along the way.,1
"This was my third time have Professor Williams. I knew what to expect in his class. SF 341 was my favorite class. I recommend it. You learn about Airport Management, Airport Security, Airport Safety, Airport Inspections, How to run the Airport, and most importantly keep the Airport Safe. If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",1
"The textbook for this class weighs 500lbs and is thicker than the bible. Prof. Raphael is kind and caring, but be prepared for cases that go on for 30 pages and get ready to be asked about every concurrence, dissent and obscure intricacy. The publishers could honestly cut out half the pages in this textbook, the students would be better off for it.",1
My class with Professor Dattolo was an amazing experience! Not only is he a very intelligent professor but his # 1 goal is to have his students succeed and he will go out of his way to help us do that. His lectures are clear and interesting and he always teats us with kindness and respect. He goes HIGHLY recommended!,1
"she is a nice woman, means well, however: she is a VERY VERY POOR teacher. In fact, she doesnt teach. she goes over grammer in the book. explains horribly. responds to every question with: ""IT JUST IS"". though she is very knowledgable (speaks over 6 languages!) she is NOT recommended.",0
"GREAT PROFESSOR. I truly had no desire to take this class but she helped me open my eyes to a beautiful language. She is extremely funny, kind and will help you succeed. Although there was ALOT of work (fitting both ITL 101 and 102 into 1 semester)and it met for 2 hrs 3x/week, I do not regret taking this class in the least. Worth the 6 credits!",1
"The one comment made about Ryner not making it clear how to turn in assignments has changed since 2008. He has to be one of the most comprehensive teachers I've had. He is very fun to listen to, and his is helpful outside of class. A very intriguing gentleman, and I'd take a class taught by him again.",1
"OMG..class isn't hard, test aren't difficult IF you go to class, take notes and read lectures. No, he doesn't spoon feed you material for test, but it's all in front of you. REALLY? You have zero HW, read some, ONLY 3 exams with 25 MC questions and the course is DIFFICULT? Professor IS Hysterical and genuinely interested in the material. TAKE HIM!",1
"Be ready to put effort in. Dr. Burghart is very old school, so make sure you know what you're getting into before signing up. He is from the North so many southerners don't take his tone in the right way, but he means not harm by it. Lots of reading quizzes and lecture heavy, but overall a great class if its what you're passionate about!",1
I have had Mrs. Wedemeyer for two classes and have done well in both. She does talk a lot off topic but is very caring and helpful. Her class is easy but be prepared to read a little. My greatest dislike is that she is inconsistent about picking up the homework. I feel like if she assigns it then she should grade it.,1
TAKE HIM! He has been at Bentley for so long and he cares about every single student. He really is passionate about teaching but allowing the students to have a space to express themselves. His lessons are the most applicable to daily life. He is a rather easy grader if you use course content in the papers and if you apply yourself in class.,1
The course was awesome. Loved the material and the course set up. What was missing was the teacher. No feedback and when we tried to ask questions he would never get back to us. I honestly could not tell you a single thing about the teacher. the course was great but I would choose a more involved teacher to get more out the class. ,1
This class was tough because it was half online and half in class so you had to teach yourself a lot. The material is tough but he tries his best to explain it. He knows what it's like to be a student so he is pretty easy on the class and offers curves. If no one else is left take him he's not bad,1
"Great professor! However, we watch a lot of pointless videos. If you fall asleep in class that's no problem. Just memorized her 16 page study guides and youll do fine. 3 exam, 3 current events articles and 1 group project. You'll survive. Just show up to class. There is no book needed.",1
"The most caring professor!Kind hearted, intelligent, easy-going.Truly the best professor i have ever had!",1
"This man is an awesome lecturer. Comes to class experienced and prepared. His exams are relatively difficult, but he gives students options on how difficult it will be based on how much information about it he will give. Ultimately, the final paper is the most difficult. He looks through it thoroughly. Make sure you take it very seriously.",1
great teacher,1
"He is an amazing teacher! I would recommend him to all! He teaches his lectures by telling a story, it makes time go by so fast and you are learning all the while! Test are exactly from the study guides, only had to do 2 papers the whole semester, he is overall a great teacher! I will take him again next year for 1302! ",1
"Got over my fear of public speaking with Mr. Bassow. He gives constructive criticism and helps to me to understand why I need to do this vs. that for stronger presence, speech, and presentations. Very well organized class with lots of laughs. Had fun in class and left with more self esteem. Best professor I've ever had.",1
"Mr. Tyson is late to class everyday. He only gives tests, no homework. The information from his lectures are what you need for the test but hes late everyday so you miss out on time for info. He doesnt help you out what so ever. I ended the class with an 89.2% and I emailed him twice about something I could do to get an A & he just didnt answer",0
She is a nice professor that will provide help if requested. The whole class she will lecture but she will like to discuss a topic as long as you bring it up. The assignments are not hard as long as you show you participate. There are two essays in which are research papers but she will provide help and exams are the midterm and final.,1
"Professor McKean is my favorite teacher that I've had - ever! This was my first semester at LBCC, but I've taken lots of classes at other schools previously and he blew them all away. McKean motivates his students and always helps you to see where you can improve. You actually learn applicable skills in his class - and it's fun!",1
"Dr. Robichaux is absolutely amazing! Ive enjoyed her class since day one even through covid! Her test are straight from the slides, but you have to study. Its a lot of information, but she word the information in a way the students can understand.",1
"The subject itself is tough here at W&M, but if you need to take it, take it with Humber. He's a good mix of understanding, helpful, and clear, while also being intimidating, disorganized, and genuinely brilliant. You'll learn to love him, but you still might not do well if math isn't your thing. He's helpful and pretty young. Not bad, not bad.",1
"Very nice guy, I came to him when I had a problem with school work and my job. He was very understanding and helped me out. I did not get an easy A, but he worked with me so I could finish. Another one of my teachers wouldnt even answer my emails. Hes great you should take him. He loves history so much LOL!",1
"TAKE HER! She's the BEST professor I've ever had at CNM. I was nervous taking Physics since I had never taken it before. I was overwhelmed the first 2 weeks of class, but thankfully I went to her office and got help. She explained everything to me. She is willing to sit with you and take you step by step. She wants her students to pass. I love her!",1
"Professor Callaway's Ancient Literature course was my favorite class this semester. She is very engaging and passionate about her students. The class is very reading-intensive, but the discussions in class makes doing the reading worthwhile. She is a tough grader on her tree open-topic papers, but she will let you re-write the if you don't do well.",1
"I was at first very intimidated by Professor Shapiro's qualifications, but she is very down to earth and interesting. I was lucky to have her for my fys, because it gave me a good idea of what future classes should be like. She did not treat us like freshman either, which was nice. She expects you to be prepared, and that makes discussion better.",1
LOVED this professor. Easy class overall. You really need to take notes from her lectures to do well on exams. Textbook isn't required and she tells you that. Tests are really easy if you study and she allows a notecard with your notes on her exams. Weekly participation activities that can really help your grade. Two extra credits available.,1
"One of the best teachers at OSU, so nice and helpful!",1
This is an extremely easy awesome boring class!!! The online tests are really easy.  all you need to do is make sure you read over the study guide for the exams.  The exams aren't that bad if you review.  He's an awesome teacher who loves to make lots of Star Trek references.,1
He is a good professor and does care about students since he allows notes on tests and offers 40 extra credit points which is a lot so take him.,1
"Dr. Young is awesome. All homework and quizzes are online. Tests are straight from study guide she gives. Also, gives 8-10 points extra credit on every test just because she rocks. I hate math and got an A, so do whatever you can to get in this woman's class.",1
Saralina is extremely helpful and eager to teach! All of her assignments are useful and the directions are clear. She is very upbeat and passionate about teaching. HIGHLY recommended!,1
"If you need an upper level elective in IT or similar major this is a solid choice. Very reasonable workload, relevant and interesting material, and an overall nice guy teaching.",1
"Professor Stagg does not have unreasonable expectations, he simply wants his students to benefit and learn from the course. Because of this, the course can be challenging at times. If you read the material and stick to MLA format (stickler on this), you should be fine.",1
"Good professor who is very knowledgable about Middle East/US foreign policy. The class is two papers and three exams, all of which are take home and directly connected to the class material. Definitely would recommend taking him for a GOV312L credit, some of the other gov professors are significantly harder.",1
Kildea is one of those professors that you will genuinely enjoy his company both in and outside of the classroom. He is a very laid back and down to earth with a lot to offer. He really goes above and beyond with his students especially when setting up film shoot locations. He is by far one of the best people to learn from--great guy!,1
"She has no problem shooting you down in front of the class. If you don't have the EXACT same opinion as her it's clear she grades you harsher. She treats you as if your an employee and not a student, she assumes this field of art is what your interested in and has no sympathy for you if you struggle with the class. She's a truly heartless person!!!",0
She is really sweet and caring. She is strict certain times but that's reasonable. Gave us extra credit at the end. Always easy to get contact. Tries her best to give us all the things we should get for course. Lovable.,1
Lectures are pretty boring. Makes you read 8 historical books and you have to write essays comparing them. Must go to recitation and depending on your TA you can get an easy a. I didnt read any books only used spark notes and got an A-. If your TA sucks quickly change to a better one,1
"Prof Nelson is soooo handsome! Anyway, this is a really easy class. You're given five chances to score online exams and given at least two extra credit opportunities. Questions to in-class tests are given beforehand and answers to pop quizzes are always revealed during classes. Easy A.",1
She is very understanding! Don't take her online class if you have procrastination though,1
"Had her in my first year of university and I loved her, exams were easy and lectures were great.",1
"Participation is mandatory, so come to class and speak up. The discussions are great. The stories and poems you read in this class are not classics, they are contemporary. So if you're not a fan of Shakespeare and Chaucer, don't want to read Jane Austen.. This is for you. Two papers to pass, and he does grade critically so spend time on them.",1
No Comments,0
"Even thought he does not have much experience with teaching he is very open and communicative to feedback. If you are unsure of what is being asked or need clarification he makes himself available for you. To perform well in this class a strong team is needed with good communication, teamwork and organization. Good luck eh.",1
"I have had to spend a lot of time re-teaching myself because I can not understand a word she says, she seems very nice but I wish I would have known how bad her accent was before I took her class. I am problem solving what she is saying while I am trying to solve the math problems.",0
"Professor was super fun and seemed extremely excited to be teaching the content. Be warned, this class is not for slackers. You actually have to work and make sure to take notes. As long as you do this, you will be fine. The content is super interesting and I loved learning about the crazy stuff out in space! Be prepared to work but also have fun.",1
"While VERY passionate about math, I’d rate him slightly below avg in actually teaching it. Spends a LOT of time going over definitions/theorems, very little (often no) time going over tough examples. HW (10% of grade) req $90 access code (WileyPlus). Weekly group quizzes. Exam Qs are 90% identical to class & HW. Allows cheat sheet (incl on final).",1
"Professor Johnson is a very passionate researcher and a very kind person. You can tell that she sincerely wants her students to succeed. However, she is very specific in her tests and can sometimes ask questions to which answers are only found in lecture. Grading is tough and you really have to study hard and embrace small details in this course.",1
"I think Prof. Lane knows what she's doing. I shouldn't have taken it as a summer course because she has 8-10 assignments due on Sunday. I had a good average, and then the 1 time test dropped me down a letter grade after being at a 96% for 4 units. I'd recommend for fall instead of summer.",1
haha could not get any worse. You're better off taking this class online because you're going to be teaching yourself the material anyway.,0
"Nicest teacher ever. She was very understanding and very flexible. Homework had lots of writing and she gives a good amount of class work and projects. She is pretty clear about expectations but make sure you pay attention when she is going over projects, homework, etc. Usually accepts late work, easy A as long as you do your work.",1
Mustari was a great Professor. I really struggle with any type of math but he is always willing to help and encourages tutoring and seeing him if you have any questions. He was always willing to help me . I am taking him again this semester. He is great!,1
"AMAZING. very clear. reviews the basic so you aren't lost on the easy stuff. very straight forward, honest, and funny. haven't needed to go to office hours but i have a feeling they'd be very useful. let's us vote on which day we can't to take tests. quizzes normally 1-2 questions and very easy. no pop quizzes.",1
"Dr. Grapenthin is lovely. While the class was a little tough, I enjoyed it a lot, and I enjoyed having occasional conversations with her. She's a very interesting person if you get to know her.  I would and am taking her again!",1
Great CF teacher. Take her class if you get the chance. Lots of reading but interesting texts,1
"Great professor. My favorite course at Walsh. The books are enjoyable to read and they make the class interesting & easy to engage in discussion with your classmates. Dr. McHann is very passionate and truly cares about the student. If you read and pay attention, you will do great. Do the extra credit.",1
"Bartlett is my role model. His class is a different animal; nothing like any other class in DMSB. His style is unconventional, in the best way possible. In the beginning you will be intimidated by him. You will come to learn that he genuinely loves his students. Shaking his hand on the last day is extremely rewarding, to say the least. Take him.",1
"BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT!! TAKE HER; SHE'S AMAZING!!!! FAIR, HAVE FUN WHILE LEARNING ANS SHE IS EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE!!! I HAVE TAKEN HER FOR INTRO BUSINESS AND HUMAN RESOURCE! SHE'S AMAZING ",1
"McConkey is such a great guy. Willing to explain things if they aren't clear (but it usually is). He says you need to read outside of class, listen to him, and look at the powerpoints, but you can do okay if you do two out of the three. If you have the chance, take McConkey.",1
"The nicest person ever. He is super invested in the emotional well being of his students. If youre struggling with anything,  go to his office hours and talk to him honestly and he will literally fix all of your problems and make you feel a million times better. Hes mystical i s2g. Also he has two huskies and theyre really sweet. I still hang w him",1
I like the layout of the class. The final is worth 45% of your grade but he is very dedicated and always willing to help! This is my second time taking him and I would take him again.,1
"Probably, if not the best professor I've had at Palomar. Prof Hetrick is very intelligent and kind. He picks interesting topics to study and makes the class as interesting as possible. I took him as a six-week course in Summer & it wasn't too hard. Had to write three papers, three reaction papers, read articles and small sections of three books.",1
"Dr. Stephens is an AMAZING PROFESSOR! Her wisdom, experience, and intelligence is what keeps her as a must-take at Morehouse. If you can get through Dr. Stephens class, you will be well-prepared to think critically and ask questions in other classes. She makes sure that questioning everything you are sure and unsure about is done. GREAT PROFESSOR!",1
"Materials kind of hard but go to class , do all the homework and listen when he tells you what will be on the quizzes and you'll do fine. 4 quizzes and he drops the lowest grade",1
"Super nice teacher. He's helpful, and funny. Just make sure you get to class on time and do your work(which is super easy) and you'll pass. Otherwise you're the problem, not him. I don't see how anyone can fail his class.",1
"If you are actually looking to learn about Cloud Computing, Professor Auten is your guy. I've never worked with cloud computing professionally, but I did receive some job offers after interviews where I had to talk about a ton of Cloud Concepts (Buckets, AWS, Etc) and I was able to explain them off what I had learned from Professor Auten. Great Guy",1
"Take this guy!  He is awesome!  No homework, 1 Test. and 2 3-5 minute speaches on whatever you want to talk about.  He was so fun and funny.  Truly a profesor you can create a relationship with.",1
"MA is the best professor at Clemson, their should be no question! She is great and actually prepares you, but by no means is it easy, you have to do your part! This isn't a good class if you are the type person that its always the teachers fault and never yours. A lot of the negative replies are these type people!",1
This teacher is good at lecturing. Knows what she is talking about. Doesn't care about class attendance. Very relax. Give little extra credits. Summer might be crazy if you take her. She is funny. Not an easy A class with her. I took Dr. Moody for A&P 1 and got A b/c she was easy. Glad I didnt take this professor for 2401.,1
Hard to understand at times. BUT he is very funny and very nice. Always has a smile. Doesn't give out as much homework as other teachers. He is very helpful. He Knows he has a weird accent and doesn't mind repeating himself to help students out.,1
"She is nice, she wants to help you. She does ramble but she does talk about the quizzes and papers. The course has 5-6 quizzes and 3 papers which were easy topics but lots of writing. The quizzes are textbook based but because she talks about them during class",1
"the quizzes are hard because he only gives 20min for 5-6 long problems, but they only count for 5% each(and he drops the lowest one), and you have much more time for exams, which are 30% each. most people are not doing well but honestly as long as you understand material and study your notes you'll be fine",1
Absolutely love this professor.He explains material very thoroughly. Love his attitude. You will laugh in his class- no doubt. Go to his office hours!,1
"She was a great teacher and knew what she was talking about. Sadly, I had to drop the class because it was too fast-paced and difficult. She's a drug/alcohol counselor so she's very inspirational and so kind. She's funny and loves her students. If you love science; take Professor Sieber. You won't regret it.",1
So far the class seems to be not difficult. Participate a lot and youll get an A in participation. Did not do any readings and so far I have an A in the class. Some writing assignments but its easy. Only one real test. Used her power point slides and got an A. Would deff recommend for a GPA booster.,1
"This professor was easily my favorite professor for the JOMC introductory classes. All of her lectures and usage of slides and notes are engaging and humorous, and overall she is a wonderful person. She responds to emails quickly, and the assistance she provides helps me feel welcomed. She wants her students to succeed - and love that. 10/10.",1
Worst professor ever. I did not learn a single thing in that class and he was rude! Do not take his class if you want to learn.,0
"Super-great guy that wants you to shine. Easy to understand and doesn't complicate things. One of my favorite teachers. (a funny guy, too!)",1
"Johnny is amazing, I would highly recommend taking him for any classes that are offered! You can tell that he genuinely cares and wants his students to be engaged. I'm not a big fan of Econ but he really tries hard to make it a class you will enjoy.",1
"Goes over lessons way too fast, does not go over stuff that is on tests. Not very good at explaining things. Makes the lesson very difficult to understand when it shouldn't be.",0
She taught with great enthusiasm. She made writing papers fun. :0),1
"Grace is a very caring professor and sees to it that her students succeed.  She will work with you through any difficulty if you demonstrate seriousness, maturity, and personal responsibility within the subject she teaches so well.  Do not expect to be coddled; however, expect to be supported.  Disorganized at times, so keep track of submissions.",1
"Super confusing teacher. Very intelligent, but her directions are scattered and messy. Lots of reading, but no tests or quizzes. Really nice, but wouldn't reccomend her class or take it again.",0
She is a great professor that gives you clues on how to remember the material. She gives extra credit which really helps boost your grade. She is more than willing to answer any questions. I got an A but I did have to study for it.,1
"Tove is awesome! I took her online intro to bus class and she was very clear and communicative. She provides great feedback and encouragement and it is super easy to do well in her class if you pay attention. I didn't open the textbook once, but her instruction was clear and easy to understand. Take her class if you can!",1
Mr hoover is GREAT!!! he is just a down to earth guy that just sets things out for you in layman's terms. has a very good way of explaining things and you can tell he cares about your success! highly recomended!,1
Professor Mazzouri is THE BEST math professor.  He is extremely patient and goes through the problem step by step in a way that is easy to understand.  Take notes because they help out! Complete your webassign homework and make sure you go to class.  Math is the most difficult subject for me and going to every class helped me out a lot! Take him!!,1
"Choose the other lab professors. She is really tough on the lab exam grades, and gives extra material that the other professors do not. you will learn the material but she is not very friendly or nice.",1
"Dr. Falvo is unlike any professor I've ever had before. He is the kindest, most understanding, and caring professor I have ever had. He genuinely cares about how you are doing as a person before how you are doing as a musician. As long as you're open to it, he will open your mind to a whole new way of thinking.",1
Mr. Wilbrandt was one of my favorite teachers at AU. Was never that interested in ECON but he tried to make class as interesting. Always made sure his students understood the material and if not would always be willing to meet with you. He held study sessions before each test that helped a lot. Tests and quizzes are easy if you put in the time.,1
"Professor Montero is great! You must know her ID's (vocabulary) it is a must. Tests are fairly easy, most of the test questions come from the PowerPoint she uses to lecture and the ID's. I never read the textbook even though she really encourages you to do so and I still did fine. You have to present 2 current event articles. ",1
"I've had this professor for multiple classes, she is really good at what she does. I highly recommend.",1
"He talks too much about himself in class, like way too much. Also, he is not helpful in the lab, and pretty much late all the time. He gives too much HWs, so you really need to put a lot of effort into it. His slides are helpful, but only if you read the book first. Wouldn't take him again, even my grade at the end is not bad.",1
Highly Recommended!! Love her teaching style. Lectures are very straightforward and interesting! She cares and wants students to be succeeded. Midterm & Final are easy if you truly understand the materials. She always responds to emails quickly so don't hesitate to ask questions!,1
"While I was overwhelmed by the amount of projects we were doing at once in this class, it wasn't hard to do well. I really enjoyed class discussions and learned a lot. However, my classmates and I felt like assignment directions were vague and we often had to ask for clarification. 1 exam, 2 group projects, 1 paper, 15 discussion board posts.",1
"Professor Dagenais is one of the worst professors I have ever had. Her lectures are bland and way too long. She also made a 10 page research assignment only worth 28% of the final grade. Claimed that memorizing 64 + artworks is ""spoon-feeding"". Overall a prof you should avoid at all costs, even if that means delaying your required course.",0
"Overall easy class. Do your work on time. Go to class to participate in discussions. Group project throughout the whole semester, fairly simple.",1
"Phil is a great dude and professor. He cares about his students even if he comes off kind of hardcore. His quizzes are hard, so you need to study for them. Everything comes off the board so if you study that you will be fine. He also gives a lot of extra credit.",1
"Clear grading criteria, very interesting class, always happy to go, inspirational instructor, open notes on tests. Straight forward class.",1
"Her exams are too hard. It's really sad that she keeps using her children as science experiments. She thinks italian is the only important language that exists. I learned a great deal in her class but struggled with the exams. She also says things that are very rude sometimes and she doesn't realize it (culture thing, I think).",1
"General Physics at Umass Lowell was hands down the worst educational experience of my life, the professors are inept and incompetent. The lectures don't match the recitation, which doesn't match the labs. The Umass Physics department is the biggest sorry excuse for higher education I've even had the misfortune to be a part of.  F's across the board",0
No Comments,1
Very difficult. you will pass if you memorize the book. Quizes are online and can be taken open book. She talks very fast but if you record her lectures and listen to them it will help a lot. I got a B in her class because of my recordings and trying to memorize the book. her assignments are super duper easy except the research paper. Hard Course.,0
"I am not a psych major but I absolutely loved this class and professor. The topics were so interesting and the prof  has set up everything nicely.  My class had a lot of really great discussions about things that happen to people. I loved every minute of it, and would take this prof again in a heartbeat.",1
She was nice and willing to help  you in class. She walked around to assist in positions with more of a stretch or correct your form. She focuses mainly on legs but all around a good instructor. :),1
"Where do I begin, professor Monahan is the beginning, the end, the one who is many! Get used to that fact. His class was the highlight of my semester and if you do your part you will get what you deserve. He is more than fair with the amount of work he gives, and very understanding that we are all students who have hectic lives. 100% recommend!!",1
"Leung is an excellent professor, he always expect you actually learn something from the class, not merely just getting the grade. Although his exams are hard, you can learn great deal in his class. Also, he will give your extra credit report chance once he notice your grade is in danger. Take his class you won't be regreted",1
"Love the flipped classroom, hated the complainers in the class. Seriously - just watch the lectures and you'll be fine.  Lots of problem-solving in class so you know what you're doing when you get to the test.",1
"I had her for both lecture and lab. She was great for the lectures: her powerpoints and videos were detailed and helpful. With the lab however, she graded extremely hard and did not give helpful feedback. I would not take her again due to this as it brought my overall biology grade down.",1
"Sidenote: If you haven't taken BIO 324 but need to, take these two at the same time. A lot of information overlaps, at least if you take cell bio with Juris. Might as well study for two exams at once.",1
"Is mildly entertaining at times, tries very hard to connect with the students but generally fails at doing so. Assignments are very vague and generally seem pointless, he doesn't really help to clarify them even when asked. He's confusing even though he thinks he's somewhat Socratic or something. haha. Attempts at indepth conversations didn't work.",0
"I took Prof. Casada for DEP2004 online and I highly recommend his course. He outlines everything very clearly, gives a decent amount of fairly easy homework all textbook based, asks that you get involved in just a few discussions and is very understanding. great online choice!!",1
"Professor Kraft is one of the best english professors! I thought his class was going to be hard since I don't like English, but he makes it interesting. Received an A for my first time in an English class. Would take his class again!",1
"I have no clue why students gave him such a good rating. He is a great guy and very knowledgeable but the class is just WAY too much reading and studying to be a 100 class. Be prepared to read every night, hard test, and pop quizzes. He is also a hard grader when it comes to the assignment. He's a really cool guy but be ready to put a lot of effort",0
He is simply the best!!!,1
"Don is very funny, I loved going to his class! would recommend",1
"Have to go to class, quizes every day.  Lectures are a little confusing and hard to take notes for.  Goes the full class period every time. ",1
"Mrs. Mattox is a really nice lady who has loads of experience in the subject she teaches. It can sometimes feel like a high school class but that's what she's used to teach. She does ""reviews"" for the test that are usually all of the test questions so if you memorize those, the class is a super easy A. SOOO many group projects.",1
"Very hard to understand, and very fast paced talker. Hard to follow what she is saying and I cant stand this teacher. I took her on accident and I hated her class. Regret doing it . Do not take her class.",0
"Now that I have become a teacher myself, I find that Prof. Warner is the instructor I most frequently find myself emulating.  His conversational and humerous demeanor make him an ideal professor of communications and his upbeat approach to every class, every day is commendable in the profession.",1
"Amazing professor! This was the easiest class of my life. An easy A for sure and you really learn a lot from this professor who is amazing. We had two short presentations and a final paper and that was it! Make sure to go to class, but you don't have to read any of the books or anything. Just show up and thats enough!",1
"she is really smart and really cute and so fashionable. but i don't really feel like i learned that much in her classes. the reading is great, but the assignments kind of suck. group presentations are pointless and the final research paper is hard to make relevant.",1
"very rude professor, puts everyone down to let everyone know that she knows better than everyone else. Ever met a petty professor ? well now you have. the class itself isn't bad, but her manners are elsewhere. i don't know if shes going through a serious case of menopause, but she shouldn't have to take it out on other students.",0
Learned more in this class than in any other class I've taken so far. She relates the material to life experiences that make it so much easier to remember and understand. Extra credit for working with kids at elem. school.  Extremely rewarding. Mrs. Mattox is one of those rare teachers you hardly ever find anymore. Would be dumb not to take her!,1
By farrrr my favorite Professor at FAU. She is extremely sweet and caring for her students. She actually checks and answers her canvas messages hella quick too . Attendance is not mandatory but for all three classes I've taken she gives extra credit quizzes that basically are the questions on the exam so if you want the best chance at an A show up!,1
This professor is a tough grader. You will have many projects and part of your grade will be through a peer review process. People will decide to take off points because of errors.,1
"Thought having an online class the professor wouldn't matter b/c you teach yourself, but I have never had a more unclear, rude, demeaning professor in my life. Unclear grading along with the worst feedback and no room to do better unless you harass her with emails asking what you did wrong and how to improve and she replies so nasty 5 days later.",0
"She teaches the material extremely well, and is really diligent in helping students out with assignments. Everything you need to do well in this class is contained in her lectures along with some practice problems from Dr. Ryba's website. Definitely take a class with her if you can- she's great!",1
"Dr. Holcroft is super nice, great at lecture, and very helpful! Even kind of foxy for her age haha! Her class does take a fair bit of studying though. Take her if you want to learn and be around a great person. Don't take her if you just wanna BS your way through Biology cuz that's not gonna happen.",1
"Great professor, would love to have him again for other classes.",1
DJB is an absolute queen. She cares about her students and is flexible with scheduling. Any class with her is a good time,1
"Never wanted to take a public speaking class but somehow this teacher made the class bearable enough for me to pass with and ""A"" and actually learn something for a change!",1
I took this class online which I was very hesitant about but I don't regret it at all!!!!! I loved the way the class was laid out and everything was very clear! Mr. Carter is very easy to get ahold of and always lets his students know when he will be out of the office. I would recommend Joe Carter to anyone!,1
"Awesome teacher, very funny also. Sometimes class can get boring but he is very specific and you learn a lot in class. There are a few essays you have to do but he is lenient when grading and gives good feedback. I definitely recommend this class. He is also helpful if you have any questions outside of class.",1
Took him for Numerical Analysis and made an A. Literally DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND STUDY YOUR HOMEWORK AND IN CLASS EXAMS. Your test looks just like the homework and in class examples. You can make a 100 on each of the two test doing that. The final exam is a combination of all of your test. No tricks or curve balls. Study the material given and PASS!,1
"Sister Kirkham is AMAZING. If you put forth the effort you will do great. Her assignments can be time-consuming, but nothing too difficult. She genuinely cares about each of her students and makes us all feel important and heard. She is very inspirational and keeps us all motivated. She makes writing exciting, not a chore. I highly recommend her!",1
"If you're the type of person who loves speaking and reading a lot on history, this is the class for you. However, the exams are all free response, so if you're not good at those and prefer multiple choice, then don't take this class. You have to read the book because he will pick on you to answer questions on the chapters he's assigned you to read.",1
"On a scale of 1-10, I would give her a -0.1. I would go lower but there's not an option to do that. ",0
"What a joy, classy, informative, helpful, very knowledgeable. My suggestin would be follow her outline, sudy what she tells you and you will do real well. She makes Anatomy GREAT! I I would suggest takeing her class, you will learn a great deal. Always helpful. Turely an inspiration. QUINCY IS REAL LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL PROFESSOR. AWSOME.",1
"Yet another great course with Dr. Beckman. I didn't think I would enjoy this class because it is heavily based on class discussions about the readings, but it was interesting and informative. The tests can be pretty hard, but they're all open-note/open-book (NEVER FORGET YOUR TEXTS.)",1
Gave assignments with no direction and everything was subjective grading. You will probably be fine if he likes you but his style is ridiculous and i would never take him again. Was not an understanding guy and it was always his way or the highway.,0
"This teacher isn't bad. He seems like a chill guy, everything you need to know is online. His questions on the quizzes are so confusing but the midterm and final are based off those questions! I wish I took this class in person but yet again it took off my workload. I recommend him.",1
"The class itself was very boring and not enjoyable in very many aspects.  I learned more by reading the material than I did by discussing the ideas with both the professor and the class.  For English majors, a class with her is inevitable.  She may not be the most personable person around, but if you focus on academics, you should be fine.",0
"Took him this past fall semester, no pop quizzes, no open book tests. Test are 2 questions, but thats all you really have time for tbh. Equation sheet allowed. There's homework, but only for practice because it's not graded. Hands out his notes which is helpful so we can focus on the lecture better. This is a tough class in itself, tough material.",1
Professor Bledsoe is a great teacher he is so excited and passionate about his work. He grades very lightly and most writing assignments you can get a full grade on if you just complete them. It was an easy A and I learned a lot about writing,1
"This 10 student class felt more like a 3 hour conversation than an academic class, and that is not necessarily bad. Reading is essential for being able to participate in class and if you do not speak she will put you on the spot. homework was mainly a couple essays and of course the readings",1
"The book was boring, but he made up for that with the class discussions.  Overall, this class was fun.  He has an insane vocabulary though... so bring a dictionary if you don't have a big lexicon.",1
Un cours tres facile si tu ne veux pas un defi. Tres lent.,1
"She took over my math class after our previous teacher stopped coming. She was very nice and helpful, taught better then previous teacher.",1
"If you skip class you would not pass this class. She takes a little time to get used too, and sit in front of the class! Take notes and ask questions! There is so much homework in the class, but it is great because it is a huge part of your grade. So if you do bad on the test, the homework grade will help :) Ask questions too! Good Luck!",1
"DO NOT TAKE!! If you expect to be taught the fundamentals in this intro course then do not take this class with this professor. He doesn't teach. 3/4 of my class dropped him including myself. Knowledgeable and nice person, but he is a terrible teacher.",0
"Awesome, definitely take his class.",1
exams tough. Don't be late in exams. ,1
"I loved his class! Great lectures, easy assignments. The tests were online, open book and open notes. If you listen to the lectures, and read the chapters, the exams are an easy-A! He gives extra credit to replace your lowest exam score, and the online discussion board is a grade booster. My class loved him, if you are in college to learn take him.",1
"1/3 Lecturing, 1/3 Class Group-work, 1/3 Actually Writing. Dr. Aguilar knows what she is teaching and has a special way of making students better as long as they keep up. I took her Maymester course, which was fast, but ultimately finished seeing improvements in my writing.",1
Very inspirational class and professor. Very entertaining and very useful concepts. however her advice and personal experiences really add to the effectiveness of those concepts. She helps you apply what you learn and break bad habits. I've become a more effective student and person overall and highly recommend this class with Sister Kirkham.,1
"Kyle is a very ""cool"" professor, and is able to be on the same level as students. There was A LOT of reading for this class, and the exams were somewhat difficult but not impossible. He is very willing to hear you out on mistakes on tests or his grading on homework. Overall, a great professor, but can be very political in class.",1
"SHE IS A CRAZY PROFESSOR, SHE THINK THAT  THE STUDENTS DOES NOT WORK SHE GIVES A LOT WORK TO DOING FOR EXAMPLE  TWO PAPER PER WEEK, PLEASE STUDENTS DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF DONT WANT BECOME A CRAZY STUDENT",0
Very good professor. Assignments throughout the semester will not be difficult. Discussions are also very close to current affairs. So you can pass them easily. Choose her and you will succeed!,1
"I took this course online and I would not recommend this class to anyone taking it with her . Her exams do not correspond to her powerpoint lectures online. There would be a minimum of 2-5 questions that relate to anything that she has taught us in her online lectures, thus making her exams tricky. Take her seated course instead.",0
She really does care about her students but her tests were confusing as hell. One of them was nothing like the review for it. You do many problems out of the book in class to try and help with understanding the material. Go to class if you want the attendance points (free points). This class left me frustrated many days.,1
Make sure you do the concert report.,1
"I usually wait until the end of the semester to review teachers but so far, Alice has been the BEST online class I HAVE EVER TAKEN. She is helpful, friendly, understanding, and responds to emails lightning fast, even at 12PM. It is clear to me that she cares about her students and genuinely wants them to do well and succeed.",1
"Mr. Hoover is the ONLY accounting teacher to take for Principals of Accounting I and II. He explains the material in a way that is easy to understand, and has the patience of a saint. If you don't understand it, ask!! He will go over the material until you get it.",1
Very fair grader. Had 15 graded discussions and two 1 page reaction assignments you picked from Cisco Library. Had 4 tests and 1 final. She prepared you by handing out pre test that if you did with effort most of the material was on the tests which were all multiple choice. I got an A . Put a lot of time into the pre-test which were 80-95 questions,1
"I would not take Professor Aguilar again only because her lectures are not really lectures she speaks about the reading but she tends to go off topic a lot. If youre not much for writing papers do not take her, she only has about 4 assignments and theyre all heavy graded and really long and does not take late work. A lot of research is involved",0
"Awesome professor! If you go to class and listen you will understand material. I barely studied just the night before the test and ended with over a 100 due to extra credit. Super interesting lectures too, highly recommend.",1
Amazing prof. The final exam was really creative and interesting.,1
your grade is only based on quizes which you take once a week. the tests are worded differently then he teachs so studying does not help a whole lot. he makes you spell hard words on the quizes. he is dull and boring. do not take his class if you have the option!!,1
There's a lot to learn and Professor White will take the time to explain it for people who want to work for their grade. Her lectures are awesome ,1
gives precise information. Gives clarity however sometimes gets sidetrack and talks about non related subjects. Also portfolio work is not credible. Great inspiration but deadlines of assignments are hard to fulfill in matters of short timing.,1
"The best part of this class is when it's over. This class is almost too fun. He uses puppets, imaginary competitive juggling, log throwing, and mustache growing to show how invisible neutrinos are the real cause of his headaches. He also once arm wrestled a bear to raise funds for cancer. He is truly too good to be a chem 101 teacher.",0
"I go to ODU in Norfolk and had Professor Shapero her first year here. She was terrific; I had to retake 211 after not getting a C the previous go-round and she was great. She made it easy to talk in class and she helped me improve tremendously as a writer. Class is easy and stress-free. Papers aren't hard, little hw. Take her.",1
"This course had a very applied approach. It was based on group work and presenting solutions to real life problems. Ed offers good insights into the field of I/O Psychology, especially the I side, and this is very enriching. He is also available outside of class if you have any questions. Overall, great experience!",1
Tests are much harder then other chem professors. Shes okay for lab but avoid taking her for lecture,0
"On of the best teachers I've had so far. She is very knowledgeable and eager to help her students learn. Her class can be a bit hard, but she is always willing to help you.",1
He cares about the students.,1
"Funny professor! Fun lectures. He was recommended by my sister an friends who still remember him, even years after graduation! ",1
"If you want rote memorization and an Easy A, don't take his class. But if you want to be challenged like a college professor actually should challenge you, there's no better prof. Discussion based classes where you delve into the deeper meaning of the words on the page. Be prepared to read and have original thoughts.",1
Soh is a really great teacher and takes some time to get used to. She is accessible and will help you in any possible way she can. I learned so much from her class and feel really prepared with my lessons and knowledge of literacy. While at times the class dragged on the information was important and I wouldn't want to take it with another teacher,1
Such an amazing professor! Super nice and caring towards her students. Very good at explaining concepts. Make sure to take good notes from the lectures and readings for the quizzes. Only 2 main presentations that you have to give and one is a partner presentation and the other is part of the final project grade.,1
"Kildea is one of the coolest dudes you will ever come across! He is absolutely hilarious, intelligent and driven. I really enjoyed his class and his feedback really makes you stronger. His hard work also paid off because he is now the chairman of the communication department and he is a great guy to know in terms of jobs. Stay in touch with him!",1
"Dr. Simerka is a brilliant professor. She really knows about what she teachs. If you are one of those lazy students that believe that it is not important to show up to class and do not study, DON'T TAKE HER. If you are one of those students willing to learn, don't put atention to those bad comments about her.",1
He's a great teacher. His tests are more than manageable if you pay attention during his review sessions. Homework on each chapter and attendance boost your grade.,1
"Not clear, unapproachable, isn't coherent. His tests aren't feasible. Tests are based off of his lecture notes if you can even call them lecture notes. Instead of being objective in the material he is teaching he likes to throw in how he sees the topic. This class isn't convenient for visual learners.",0
No Comments,1
He goes to fast and it's hard to follow. He seems more like an honors math teacher than remedial. Only take him if you are good at math.  He gets really intense when he is working on problems on the board. Nice guy ,0
Every review on this is basically a lie. It is 2 months into the semester and not even the final withdraw date yet and 1/4 of my class is gone. If you cannot teach yourself stay away. If you go to him for help he will get annoyed if you don't understand the material. Always cancels office hours. More than half my class is failing with like a 50 avg,0
"Very very hard! Try to avoid her econ 490 class! Her 300 classes are fine, but 490 is totally a nightmare!",0
Absolutely amazing! Love her!!,1
"I had to retake 201, and I am so glad I choose him the second time. Literally one of the best professors this school has, and I've learned so much.",1
"DJB is the best! If you have to take ACC 311, TAKE HER! She's hands down my favorite professor at UT, would take her again if I could. The material is challenging but she truly cares about her students so if you're struggling go to office hours. She's super sweet and approachable.",1
"He is a really good professor for REL 102. His lectures are pretty interesting, but attendance is not mandatory. There are a lot of online quizzes before class. The tests are sort of easy... definitely study more than just the review quiz he gives on blackboard. Would recommend him for students who want an ok grade and want to learn about religion.",1
"High expectations, but I have learned a great amount of information pertaining to civic engagement and the structures of the United Nation.",1
"I enjoyed Ms. Olson's class a lot. She was a very interesting teacher I have ever met! Her tests are not easy, but as long as you pay attention in the class and take notes, you will pass. There were 3 exams and 2 assingments. She has a sense of humor and I really loved her class, so I definitely recommend Ms. Olson to everyone.",1
Great teacher!  He cares so much about students! Impressive personality too!,1
I took him for Concepts of visual arts. I would recommend him it is hard to get an A which is ridiculous because it's art.  I had a friend that showed up to half the classes and still got an A. As long as your a good writer you'll be okay. You don't have to show up every day. Looking for an easy B take him.,1
"May be the odd one, but I've little praise.  Grades good students hard and allows some less brilliant ones to slip through with an ""A"".  I know students who are better grammarians.",1
"The content is interesting but gets spoiled by the teaching. All the material assigned as reading is recovered in class in long-drawn-out ways. The rhetorical style is boring, causing most students to get sleepy until being cold-called in the middle of a class to answer a specific question. If you do a lot of work you'll do well, but it's a pain",0
"Soh is a great teacher. She really knows what she is doing. I learned so much from her this semester. While there is so many things to do for her class, so stressful at times, her energy, humor, and personality make things easier. All assessments are kinda overwhelming at the beginning, she teaches well and makes you feel confident about them.",1
This class isn't exactly difficult although at the end of the semester you are given a news article essay. After waiting three weeks for a grade I was given a 50% after emailing professor Baltodano he was extremely rude and it almost seemed as if I bruised his ego. I ended up falling by .7%. That's right point 7 percent.,0
"Hybrid course, the days we met in class, we would only go over homework, homework was also difficult. Have to study weeks before test to pass. Try to avoid. Have to use book and program to pass.",0
"Professor McGlynn is honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. I've wanted to be a teacher for years but just like many people I doubted myself at times. After taking her class, it reignited my passion for teaching and reminded me why I love this. She is immensely informative and experienced. I am taking her again!",1
PSY1102 is a self teaching class basically. Prof doesnt do much tbh but shes very kind and accomodating. I once had internet trouble and missed my quiz and she opened it again just for me which is very nice. Bad thing about the course is purchasing the textbook (which is a must) from tophat and its expensive. Lectures are short-uselessjustreadbook,1
He uses his own material that is easily accessible. Exams are open-book but it really won't help because the problems can be really confusing at times.  Key to success- keep your head  and follow your instinct,1
"Wow for a 4 unit class she sure was a tough grader! ALOT of writing in the class, there is no getting away with writing something quickly-- grammar and thought is necessary to get high marks on analysis. There is a lot of work to do in this class, so if your not prepared to budget time there is no chance in doing well. ",1
Was very helpful and understanding. The class is kind of unorganized because he puts up a syllabus and then an updated syllabus. This is a required course for the cob but I am not sure what the point of it is? And we had to do an MS Office Access project... I took MS Office 1 & 2 in high school and never had to use it so it was really pointless.,1
"Mook is a funny guy, he gives lots of homework, sometimes every class, but does this to establish a stepwise pattern of understanding. He is very forgiving, as the large workload results in a lot of dropped homeworks/quizzes. To do well in his course you must spend some extra time to understand all of the material, but its 100% worth the effort.",1
I was able to understand his lectures but his labs were pretty difficult for students that just learned about operating systems. His tests are extremely hard and based off only on lectures so take very good notes. Grades hard on labs. Overall just study your butt off and you'll pass the class.,1
He basically just takes the textbook and turns it into a slide show.  You do not have to go to class.  His lectures put me to sleep.  He is strict no electronics in class.,1
"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",0
"Taking him right now, always makes time to help me on my essays.",1
"Kelli was great, lecture is inclusive and encourages students to participate. Slightly easy grader, as long as you do the work according to the standards. She's young so it can be easier to relate with her. However, if no one participates in class, lecture can be a strain and she can get frustrated.",1
"She is a super neat lady, and as long as you are willing to put the effort and time into your work you will definitely do well.",1
She is very  disrespectful and very unprofessional and unorganized .,0
"Mr. Hayes is a wonderful professor and human being! I always liked psychology, but now I love it. He does not just teach a class, he introduces you to the world of human behavior. He works for the good of his fellow man and not just a paycheck. SVCC is blessed(and should feel honored) to have a staff member of this caliber!",1
"This professor does not know what he is doing in a classroom. Do not for the life of you take this class. The material is extremely simple, but the way he grades makes it very difficult to get a good grade. Be prepared to teach yourself.",0
"She knows her stuff...that's for sure. However, classes and discussions were very dry and dead. I sort of didnt know what I was doing there after a while.",1
"Dr. Lyall is informative, knows how to reach students, and makes difficult material accessible. The homework is easy and he's very reasonable and approachable. It's great to have a counseling professor who ""walks the talk"". He actually works in this field and what he teaches is based on experience, not just theory. Take his class! He's excellent.",1
"I agree with the previous review -- Miller is NOT hard, you just have to do the work.  He's willing to help you whenever you need it and he cares about his students.  He does NOT, however, spoon feed it to you.  You have to be willing to do some critical thinking.  He really cares that his students learn to THINK.",1
This software class is very paper heavy. We take tests and quizzes using scan trons and do homework via paper labs. Also be prepared to keep track of your own grades because he never posts the grades online. He would give us our quizzes and tests back for a few minutes and then make us give them back to him. Good luck learning.,0
"Horrible attitude towards students, demeaning, and insulting. Could not wait to get out of that class.",0
"One of the best profesors I have ever encountered. Think Socrates in style and Aristotle in practice; Prof Werner is a pure educator and from the beginning of his first lecture, you'll know you are in the presence of a true philosopher.",1
"You may want to throw a test rock in before entering her office. Sometimes she's great, helpful, interesting; sometimes she's stark raving mad (I mean ""Yellow Wallpaper"" mad).",0
"She's knowledgable and can make any class exciting, even when it's on the Old Testament, which is often considered dry subject material. Yes, she is a tough grader, but her assignments are not difficult; for example, you might wind up with a B+ when you figured you earned an A. She can be funny and makes you think. No complaints here.",1
"Great lectures, loved to learn philosophy through Jorgen. Make sure you attend the lectures; they're the most important part of the course. If an option for a smaller class is available, take it. I was in one of his larger classes making it harder to participate in discussions. But it was still a great course and extremely educational.",1
"She's amazing and very interesting to listen to. She is very passionate about the work she assigns and picks books that almost anyone could enjoy. I really don't like reading too much, but she managed to make it interesting!",1
"I took Yonn's class in the online format, therfore, my analysis of him as a complete teacher isn't the whole experience, however, in the online format, the workload wasn't bad. Essay were kinda of long but do-able. He seemed to be a tough grader in comparison to other teachers at UW-T. videos were available to give further definition for clarity.",1
Amazing class ! He is understanding and his class is interesting ! Would recommend. I didnt think I would enjoy it because it was my first semester and politics you know . But I was not disappointed and it ended up being by favorite class lol,1
"Great teacher, exams get harder as the class progresses, exams are definatelly challenging but no extra credit or scalling seen yet. I would say take the class if you have hard time with economics, great teacher but no group work at all, and you dont really know people in the class. sad...",1
"This class isn't an easy A but it's not hard. There are usually 3 assignments/week but none of them take very long. There is a 15 hour service project that you have to do to pass. That's the worst part from this course. You can skip ahead on the assignments though and finish early. Interesting material, not too boring. You do need textbook.",1
"Professor Freed is an awesome teacher. The novels she picked to cover have all been published fairly recently, and they're all great reads. There are three in-class essay exams, 10 ""optional"" experience points (they're mandatory; you just get to pick what you do), and the final. She is a VERY tough grader, though, so don't expect an easy A!",1
"There are better ways to get humanities credits, it was a waste of time.",1
"By far the best prof I've had at Rutgers so far. His book of notes is extremely helpful - study that + old exams, go to review sessions, you're fine. He keeps you awake in a difficult class",1
"My favorite professor I've ever had! This class was so interesting and educational. You DO have to show up because you won't pass the exams if you don't have good notes, but honestly I was *excited* to go to his class. There is a reason Jorgen is rated good; he is passionate, honest, and inspiring.",1
"Dr. Ramey was a very effective lecturer. I expected to learn the basics about each ""world religion"" but he set the class up in a much different way. While you do learn about many different religions, the class is more focused on analyzing others representations of those religions. An easy class, as well as a good class. Dr. Ramey was awesome!",1
"I had a great time in his class and learned a lot from him. He's a pretty free spirit and open to suggestions and new ideas! Ask him about some of his art projects, they're really cool. He got me really excited about process art!",1
Glen is the man!! You don't get much better than Glen.,1
"She was a great teacher! She made sewing really fun and interesting for me. But if you miss one day, it's easy to fall behind. ",1
"She is a sweetheart but stern in her class. You will work for an A, and she is very clear about the outcome of her class. She will answer any question, half of the class is online and quizzes are open book online, don't miss the deadlines because the system will close it. Two easy essays a specific topic, prepare to speak (timed) in front of class",1
"I don't understand the complaints regarding the regular quizzes. Very light reading and paying attention in class is all that is needed to do well. I didn't like the use of jblearning labs. I, and any peer I talked to felt like they were needlessly lengthy and generally not that helpful. May be easy for the professor, but they felt like a waste.",1
"Decent professor, sends all assignments and answer keys by e-mail, but mostly mirrors the textbook and doesn't speak loud enough during lectures",1
"Qualls is a great professor who really cares about communicating to his students the information and teaching them how to approach history as a discipline. Hes a tough grader but will improve your writing and youll strive to produce a better paper. Very accessible out of class, and his enthusiasm for history is contagious! Class was never dull!",1
"You need to read so many books in his class, even the blogs and wikis are easy but you need to take them every week. His test is not easy for those people whose main language is not English.",0
"I am not good at English, and I got an A.  He is lenient with grading, no tests, just responses from stories in the textbook and essays.  The final is take-home.  Great class,  I'm a better writer because of this class.",1
Very nice professor who helps you succeed! I would recommend.,1
Amazing professor. This man actually cares about his students. He accepts all opinions and has very interesting things to say. Death and Dying was one of the most memorable and interesting classes i've ever taken. Some of the things that Prof McLaughlin said changed my life. Thank you,1
"His lectures are off his power-points, so although he doesn't take attendance you should go if you want the information! What he teaches is what is on the test, no surprises! He randomly does in-class assignments in class, so go to class! He is always willing to answer questions and clarify the material for you! I would take more classes from him!",1
Mrs. Martins internet English class was excellent. I was weary of taking an English class over the internet but she made each discussion count as though we were all in a classroom. I took her Humanities class and I knew she was a fine teacher. Her lectures are in-depth & easy to follow. 1hr/week of writing(+study)& you will pass w/flying colors!,1
If you really want to learn calculus and are willing to give your time  Mrs. Liu will meet with you and help you understand.  She provides an awesome final review for the online course. Highly recommend her.,1
"This class is focused on Shakespeare, but especially so on how Shakespeare is translated into film/theater. Nonetheless it was still really enjoyable, the texts were great, and we got to read plenty of scholarly essays on Shakespeare as well. His lectures are pretty dry though. All around an interesting, yet tough, class and a great guy.",1
"A pretty easy teacher, IMO.  A lot of people had trouble with her however.  She really means well and I don't recommend taking this course if you don't have any musical background.  Could have made it only slightly clearer, but there was tons of material to go through.",1
"Not as hard to understand as most seem to be saying.  She does a ok job at explaining, although she sometimes misses the point of some questions all-together.  Of the other calculus teachers at Shepherd, I would recommend her the most.",1
Has a great way of keeping the classroom fun while covering course content!,1
"Professor Tulin's online class was good. Since we were online, he had all of his lectures prerecorded, and all you had to do was write a response every week and do a group project every week. Not too overwhelming.",1
"Pretty good prof, is very clear about how grades work and gives study guides for exams, she tries to crack jokes a lot that so once you get over that she's not that bad, offers bonus points on exams and lab quizzes, overall if you STUDY and PREPARE an A is easily attainable",1
She is by far one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Not helpful and doesnt seem to care that students have other classes than hers. I work part time and do school full time and I worked so hard in her class but she leaves her students out to dry. She seemed more interested in seeing her students repeat her classes than seing them be succesful.,0
"Cool guy, weird sense of humor.  Hard subject for me, but good teacher for it.",1
Professor Joyal made class so much more enjoyable and takes a humorous approach at teaching which ends up making things easier to retain. Marking is extremely fair and when you lose marks he is clear in giving feedback so he can give you a better mark next time. This gem marks in green pen because its less aggressive than red pen! :),1
"She gives more time to complete quizzes than other instructors, she NEVER has trick questions, she is fair, her lectures are engaging and have a lot of class interaction. Students MUST do 15 hours of service learning in order to pass, it is best to get it done in the first half of semester. Homework takes very little time to complete.",1
"Expects you to study and be able to apply, in a scientific manner, what he goes over in class. Very willing to help. He actually goes above and beyond what any other professor at VSU does in the way of helpfulness. Very approachable with a calm demeanor. TAKE Dr. Anderson. Guaranteed you will learn!",1
Fantastic class. Midterm and final can be hit or miss (because you might not be able to figure out how to do it!) but plenty of potential bonus marks.,1
"he is cool. just learn 50 artworks for each exam, write two papers and you will have a good grade.",1
"Honestly, best professor Ive had in Daniels and Im not even a fin major but would totally take another class with him. His notes are great and I really enjoyed his class. He was the most understanding of covid and he really cares about his students. Hes the best fin prof and he made a relatively difficult topic, simple,and easy to understand.",1
"He's an excellent professor. This class is easy, but there is A LOT of work per assignment. If you just do what you're supposed to, you'll make a B easy. It is group heavy, so make sure you address any issues early.",1
"With the workload you would think this was a 300+ level course. She is also always emphasizing her grading system (which is a harsh system) I personally would not take her again. Dont think its easy just because its online, that isnt true at all. Take a better Professor and get the grade you deserve",0
"I understand that there are professors that give pop quizzes, but this specific professor takes off points for the little things & that really affects your quiz grades and also test grades. You would need to study really hard for this class or you will not pass. Many people have failed her class last semester. Be ready to study hard if you want it.",0
WAS THIS A READING CLASS OR LEARN HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS CLASS? I FEEL LIKE SHE ONLY TEAHES US HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS NOT THE MATERIAL; BUT THATS JUST ME AND THATS GOOD I GUESS; OH HER GRADING WAS PRETTY RIDICULOUS TAKE HER YOU WILL SEE,1
He is a nice guy but his class is difficult. You have quizzes from the book every week and he expects every student to participate in the discussion. You are graded for participation. Sometimes his grading was very hot and cold. He didn't ever have anything good to say about my discussion posts and left long messages as to what I didn't do right.,0
Hard grader (very hard to get a A on anything). Teaching style is very dry and makes it hard to keep focus and learn from lectures. Troys to cram too much information into such a small amount of time.,0
"As a person Im sure professor miller is a great dude, but as a teacher. He is so robotic its hard to learn. Before the corona virus, I had an A+ in the class and was able to find the class easy because I had people around me to help. Now during the virus he puts these videos on YouTube (khan academy like) and expect us to learn this. Bad teaching",0
"I cannot say how Dr. King is during in-person classes, hence my rating instead of 2 instead of 1. I can tell he is passionate about the subject for sure, but Dr. King ended up just assigning textbook readings instead of doing much actual teaching, leaving you to teach yourself. Perhaps it'll be different once classes are in-person again. Hard tests",0
"very caring about students, but the class covered the very basics, not difficult if you do the work, which is quite little",1
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
"Abrams is one of those professors that only some students recognize as brilliant. Its easy to tune him out and get by in class, but if you actually take him on and/or have any kind of interest or passion for whats actually going on in the working economy and how it impacts humanity, I would highly recommend any of his courses. Mans a bright mind",1
Very unorganized and difficult to understand. He can be very intimidating. His tests were confusing and somewhat unrelated to the emphasized topics in lecture. He has cool ties though.,0
"Hot, ness! This class was more interesting than I expected. If you cant get an A in this class, its because you made no effort. Very reasonable. Don't be rude in class.",1
"COM 408 is the capstone class for COM majors and it is a really hard class. But Mark made it very clear. He loves what he is teaching and knows the material so well because he loves teaching it. He is a very hard grader, but if you show up to class and work through the lectures with him everything is extremely clear.",1
"Sarah never taught an easy course, but they were all a lot of fun and very informative.  She is a true gem at Nebraska Wesleyan!",1
His very good i like his classes,1
"Unfortunately I didn't get to finish this class, but the teacher was completely understanding and honestly a kind heart, this teacher is very approachable! If you have any issues she is for sure to listen and help you any way that she can. Highly recommend. Class work was extremely easy and not that hard.",1
Each test is only 10% of your grade and there are 5. None of it is cumalative. Paper is super easy and is 15% and homework is 25%. I made an A+ with C's D's and B's on my exams. She's hot also.,1
"Awesome professor I would def recommend his class. I learned a lot. The only thing is that you have to video tape yourself in a counseling session, but its pretty easy!",1
"Dr. Liu is an AMAZING professor. If you're taking COMM3353 with her, you won't regret it. Each assignment has step-by-step video instructions. She gives you feedback and if you correct, you get FULL credit. Assignments are lengthy in time so you do need to set aside time for them. Overall, love this class and appreciate Dr. Liu a lot.",1
Dr. Shine is an excellent example of what all college-level professors should strive to become.,1
"I had the Senior Seminar with him. He is one of the most difficult and demanding professors in the department, and his expectations seemed to be different for every student. I think he ruined history for me.",0
"Johnson is very opinionated. Her opinions are clear on whats right and wrong, the class isnt based on truth, its based on her own moral objections of right and wrong. At one point she even threatened that if we didnt like it, we could take sociology with the other instructor who shared and would also voice the same opinions.",0
Great professor! Very lenient. Ready to help at anytime. You won't feel as stressed as you would with other COSC professors. Read the textbook and you'll be fine for the exams.,1
"I started out incredibly disgusted and discouraged by Prof Fowler's unclear, rambling style.  However, after a few weeks I got the hang of it, and the material wasn't that hard.  About 30 of us  got A+'s on the midterm, and who knows how many got A's.  You'll do fine, just read everything for the passage IDs and get a helpful TA!",1
Ron is the only reason I'm taking an 8am next semester. He is hilarious and keeps everything interesting. Book discussions are a big part of the class but its not hard at all! I loved the class. Favorite class I have ever had.,1
He's a great prof but too bad the course material isnt always interesting. The grammar section can be quite tedious,1
Having studied under Dr. O'Gorman I can guarantee that he is an expert in his craft. I can personally say that he is someone more than worthy of your time and I hope that I can cross paths with him once again. If you sat in one of his classes you would understand. He has a wealth of knowledge despite being callous but because he's that smart.,1
"Hybrid class PROS: friendly, no lock down browser required, sends weekly reminders, clear grading structure, will excuse absences, doesnt mind if youre late, Hybrid so all quizzes/exams are online, free e-book, CONS: DOESNT ALLOW MAKEUP, no extra credit, ALL assignments due at 8PM, quizlet is of NO help, get ready to google ALOT or read,",1
There is a midterm and a final and they are mostly comprised of the quizzes. Make sure to review the outlines. The quizzes have very specific questions and little amount of time is provided. There is an assignment due every week. You have to really WORK.,0
He's a great professor and really helpful in office hours! His tests are like the examples he gives in class and in his review book so make sure you buy that,1
"She's a good teacher. I didn't mind having her, but she always had a lot of homework. She is very lenient on the homework though.",1
I had him and he is very aggressive when it comes to the students; he uses his power to destroy the student.,0
"This professor does make the occasional mistake, but she knows her stuff and wants everyone to do well.  This is a VERY EASY A if you go to lecture and do homework, even though lecture is extremely boring at times.  I studied for less than 2 hours total for the final and aced it.",1
I really enjoyed his classes and sense of humor. He made learning about criminal justice fun and I'd gladly take another one of his classes if he still taught.,1
He is a great person and teacher. You will enjoy every single class.,1
"Janet Elliott was absolutely fantastic. Her notes and lectures were clear and easy to follow and they prepared you well for each assignment and exam. If you are taking CH E 243, definitely try and get her as your prof. She truly wants her students to succeed and does an amazing job.",1
"Attendance is mandatory, taken every day. There are only 3 big grades: midterm, a paper and the final, so don't mess up. No other homework. Make sure to take notes and pay attention to his lectures. Reading of primary and secondary sources required. Very passionate about history, interesting lectures.",1
"I attended Meghan's Organizational Behavior class at Webster university Spring 2016 and it went very well. We had group activities, paper presentations, and real time case studies. Overall she is very helpful and smart professor.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She has a complete disregard for students that have questions, or do not understand what she is saying. She jumps all over the board without explanation. If this is your Major you might be okay. My favorite comment from her ""You already know this."" Everyone has done this before. When we tell we haven't she skips it.",0
"Unless you are a favored student, this class will ruin your life. Professor refuses to assist struggling students both in and out of class. Will mark you wrong for getting the correct answer because he doesnt like how you did it, yet wont help you do it his way. AVOID",0
I adore this woman. She cared so much for all her students - would reexplain as much as needed (she would bake for us too). Only class I would actually take at 8am. Good amount of homework in the textbook but we would go over it every class. Test/quiz questions taken straight from the homework exercises. Gives 1/2 and 1/4 credit on tests/quizzes.,1
"Tests are very similar to homework problems, just do the homework problems he assigns and have a basic understanding of thermodynamics and there is no way you shouldn't get an A.",1
Please take her class. Attendance isn't required. She gave out multiple choice reviews that were EXACTLY like her tests. The lectures are painfully boring but it is hard to complain when the class is that easy. She is a very nice teacher and will eagerly help you with questions.,1
"Metzl teaches at Vandy now. Incredible professor and super interesting class. The guy is so interesting and does so many incredible things outside of teaching, and his lectures are hilarious. It's not much work, no final, and the final project is something that everyone loves engaging in. 100% would take a class with him again. MUST TAKE!!",1
Hes quite funny and charming. I was never bored in that class and thats a first because Im not one to enjoy a history class. As long as you do the readings and pay attention during reviews youll be fine.,1
She is laid back and easy going. I loved her class. I hate ging speeches and yet I wanted to go to that class.,1
"Really good teacher, I enjoyed my time in class. He makes it interesting and you actually learn material by attending class. He's very helpful and fair in his evaluations! Definitely recommending him.",1
"This prof is mediocre at best. He drones on and on about only vaguely related topics to class material and it feels like he just yells at us to read random books that he likes. He isn't the worst prof I've had at WSU, but he definitely isn't the best. I find it very strange how many awesome reviews he has saying almost the exact same thing. Hmmm...",0
"Dr. Anderson was the best professor or teacher I've ever had. He made 7:30am doable, and helped me relearn Latin after a rough semester. He does take attendance, so don't skip. The tests were easy and he gives many quizzes to help your grade. I would take him every semester if I could.",1
"While she is not the easiest grader, she is a wonderful professor. She is very knowledgable and you will definitely learn a lot from her classes. I've taken two classes with her and gained a lot from both of them. She also always grades fairly. She's  definitely my favorite professor so far.",1
"Beverly is an excellent teacher. I loved her class. She does not teach from the book, it's all from lecture, therefore you must take extensive notes. .  easily remembering the material. I recommend her to anyone.",1
terrible,0
Outstanding.  Unbelievably helpful and one of the friendliest professors on the planet.,1
"Professor Gibson is a must have professor. She truly cares about her students and will help you anytime. The class has clear assignments and only like 3 major grades. All you need to do is pay attention,participate,and do your work.",1
"Great Professor, there are no exams, just weekly quizzes that you can re-take as many times as needed until the due date. We had 3 ""projects"", they were time consuming, but very easy.",1
"She is literally one of the nicest professors I have had. In the beginning of the semester, the class was boring but then she grew on me and is such a sweet woman. Take her if you can!!!",1
"Hands down best prof at Bentley. He absolutely loves life and accounting. You would be crazy to even think of taking anyone else. Class is 50% exams (midterm final) which are challenging, but the other 50% are easy assignments that are easy 100s if you put a little effort into them. Study for his weekly opportunities.  ",1
"I found the class to be very monotonous and dry, but it had more to do with the material than with the prof. I thought sessions got repetitive at times and often went much longer than seemed necessary. The tests were more challenging than I anticipated, but I also scored better than I anticipated, so he seemed fair. Read your book/handouts!",1
"He gives you a good presentation and you have some time to use your note during the test. However, there is a lot of pop quiz during his class and you cannot use your note on that. His grading system is different. He doesn't grade based on percentage. he grades on based how much points that you get",1
Easy A good professor group project at the end no cumulated final only grades exams and group project and gives points for attendance,1
"this man is the best teacher i have ever had, not the easist, but the best. this subject is not easy, he gives you the skills to find the answer through thought if you have a hard time thinking i dont recomend him. or this subject for that matter",1
"She is a very nice person and accessible during office hours... but the tests were very detailed and there were no study guides. There were days for review before the test, but that was just used to go over the notes one more time. She is very picky about your work and if you skip a lecture or lab - I have no idea how you could pass.",1
"Fair grader, nice guy, but never bothered to learn my name. Kind of discouraging when the class is so small. ",1
"I enjoyed the subject and the fact that the class was discussion and not lecture based. Not much reading but there are quizzes every week and attendance is VERY mandatory. He does not give out a lot of papers, only a midterm and final as well as small email hw assignments.",1
"Daniel Baker is one of my favorite professors here at Delta, he is really caring and funny and cares a lot about this work. There are test and quizzes every week on the chapter that is being taught but they are not that hard. The reading is kinda heavy so be prepared. You have a test every 4 chapters so pay attention. Highly recommend him!",1
Quizzes everyday and is a tough grader. Her tests are very hard and her tests / quizzes are worded very hard. Don't take her you will hate that class and she makes it so much harder. HW every week and her lectures are so long and boring but you have to stay to get points for the quizzes.,0
She was very well organized with her lectures and her slides. If you missed class she would always record the lecture so you could easily access it. On top of that she would also make extra videos so in case you didn't understand the lecture you could watch those. She gave plenty of extra credit opportunities. A Very Kind Prof. overall *chef kiss*,1
Good communication and stayed involved with good feedback.  Do readings and exams weren't hard. Large PowerPoint project at end of class which wasn't hard but takes some time to do. I am looking forward to the next class I have with her and would recommend her. If the workload is too high then maybe you're not ready for collegiate work.,1
He's a bit disorganised. He makes a lot of jokes and is really easy going. Assignments don't have a set due date. He just expects you to turn it in by the end of the semester.,1
"For COMM 301:1 big paper at the end of the semester (comparative analysis) 3 tests the whole semester. gives u studyguide, everything she wants is super clear. no attendence policy. great sense of humor! take this class!",1
"Overall she's  a great teacher. Read the directions carefully and do your reading and you will do fine. Take good notes and study, tests are hard. But show your effort and you'll get a good grade. I was easily able to reach out and ask questions and get clarification. Her interactive online teaching style was better than most!",1
"Took an online summer class with Professor Hegbloom this year. I never reached out to her, so not sure how accessible she is. A lot of reading and a lot of papers, BUT she gives very clear instructions on what she wants. Read the material, follow her instructions and you'll do well! Just FYI she is a later in the semester grader.",1
Never responds to emails. You can miss one or two classes in the beginning. But do not miss in the end that's when the big assignments are. The final and the midterm are fun. you get to design them yourselves. If you miss too much class she is not very helpful and does not care whether or not you pass.,0
Mrs. Young is so sweet and overall a great professor. Do the practice tests to help prepare for the real tests. If you do the homework youre probably going to pass.,1
He is super nice and helpful. I liked how he was always available if students had any questions about the essays. He is one of the most approachable teachers i have met so that made it easy to be successful in class.,1
"Professor Stevens wants her students to succeed, but she doesn't coddle. I can't see how an in-person class is better than the online class because Prof Stevens is so thorough. I always knew what was expected, and I was always reminded each week what was due. Alice is a gem.",1
Dedicated prof.  Knows his stuff.  My favorite prof in the J-school so far. ,1
"Bremer is a chill professor, however, exams are extremely difficult for a 101 class. He expects you to know everything, and I mean everything. Tests are 50 multiple choice questions and 50 points for short answer. Pass or fail, it's up to you, final is the easiest. Gives breaks and puts on relaxing music. Do the extra credit and well on lab quizs.",1
"Professor Kathleen is an awesome artist and instructor. She cares about her students, very understanding, and takes every chance to give better instruction or clarification. She not only teaches how to draw, but also the thought process as you draw. Highly recommended.",1
"16 online quizzes, 3 writing assignments, 3 tests. Tests are half from quizzes, half from lectures. Ease is subjective, but at least he?s consistent and straight forward. He?s extremely talented as a lecturer and he?s very very knowledgeable and fair as well. He?s also very objective and funny. He?ll keep your interest.",1
"really nice guy and open to trying to clarify any confusion on topics during his lectures which I found out not all profs are willing to do (would rather you ask in office hours or after their lecture). tests are pretty easy as well for the most part, and tests mostly on concepts rather than math and equation heavy questions (only a few per test)",1
"She is a terrible Accounting teacher, she reads straight off of the powerpoints and expects you to write out entire balance sheets on a blank piece of paper with no help. If you're going to take this class then go to every single PAL sessions because she is awful. She doesn't answer any questions without being rude and freaking out at the student.",0
"Vance makes it seem easy when he lectures, but you are totally unprepared for the test unless you thoroughly read the book. And, with the way he teaches this class, they should make the income tax class a prerequisite. If you don't understand income tax really well, it will be hard to get above a B in this class, no matter how much you study.",1
"He knows everything, in every subject area--even other professors admit it. Can be pompous but his breadth of knowledge can spark enthusiasm and inspire students if they're willing. Witty, always keeps class interesting, and is understanding if you don't have a serious music background.",1
"You have 4 tests and then a comprehensive final made by the marketing department. There is a large group marketing project that you work on through the whole semester. Tests were hard for me, either you have the correct answer or you don't. Some questions were made to confuse you. Know the vocab and essential concepts. Lets you have a note sheet.",1
GOOD TEACHER. I LEARNED A LOT.,1
"Very good professor.  She grades tough, but she knows her stuff and will require that you learn it to.  She responds to questions and is definitely fair when grading.  I highly recommend her as a professor.",1
"Dr. Strange is a very knowledgeable and entertaining professor. Class is interesting and often hilarious. I didn't find his tests particularly hard, especially since he offers bookoos of extra credit for showing up to lecture. If you have even the slightest interest in the outdoors, then I highly recommend FWF 250.",1
"Great teacher, give this man a raise! Luigi Bless!",1
She is va very tough grader!,0
"Great Prof for meteorology. Gives clear feedback on your assignments, the tests are based almost exactly on the lectures and slides. Assignments are challenging but fair. Likes what he does!",1
Amazing professor.,1
I took her 'cause she's hot.,1
Essex county college need to put this professor full time he's very good i did not like math before because of him i can say I'm very good at it . very best professor ever i will have A for math 100.,1
"Loved her class. I could've gotten an A but I didn't turn in some assignments. Very easy to pass. Just read and turn in the assignments. Honestly, you cannot fail.",1
"Best Professor Ive had yet! He will always reply to your email (which is hard to come by in WSU). He will give you an A if you show effort and don't BS the essay which speaking of, he will proofread and revise your essay to the point of perfection. Overall, this guy makes a somewhat dry subject very fun and engaging.",1
"I really enjoyed Sexuality in the Americas.  The readings are engaging and his lectures are focused and helpful to use on the assignments.  He really rewards creativity, which is a nice change from most mundane history classes.  He's also really interesting as a person, so I'd definitely recommend stopping by just to chat!",1
"Excellent Teacher!  Very enthusiastic about teaching.  Exams are tough...mostly application questions. Understand the concepts you are reading in the book, don't just memorize.  The class moves at a very fast pace. Plan to spend at least 12 hours a week studying.",1
"Quiz every week (VERY EASY), midterm/final (VERY easy), 2 discussion posts, 1 group project/powerpoint. Group project is fairly easy, answer 8 questions in group of 6. He is an easy grader - meet the required word count and you will pass. Overall a very easy class. Do the simple work and get an A.",1
"Don't take this course online with Tabea if you're expecting it to be easy. She requires 2 weekly forum posts, on top of biweekly self-reflection journals. From what I can tell, she's a good instructor, but that doesn't matter much for this course online, take it with someone else online if you can, or her in class would be good too.",1
"Helpful, interesting, and reasonable. Deb was able to make a dull subject (advanced grammar/writing workshop, really?) interesting and even the grammar review wasn't bad. I wish more professors at Duke were like her. Take her class, you won't regret it.",1
One of the clearest teachers I've ever had. Makes the lectures interesting and is a nice teacher. We have one ten point hw assignment a week and 4 tests-which she replaces your attendance grade on the lowest one. Final is only over one chapter. I would take her again,1
"Loved the Shakespeare course. The readings are lengthy and difficult to understand, at first. You'll learn how to decipher Shakespeare like a pro if you do your homework as you should. Dr. Ryner has a great personality, and a true passion for Shakespeare. If I could, I would take another class from him in a heartbeat. Tests aren't the easiest.",1
"This class by far the worst class I have taken at Troy. There is no study guide and the information on the test is confusing. The instructor really does not take time out to help you in the course, my advice choose another instructor.",0
"Proffesor Valltos is a very fair grader. Goes directly from the rubric and is very accomodating, just as long as you communicate. The weekly post are extensive (usually 6 questions to be answered in one post) but a requierement. Also, the final is BRUTAL! It definitey takes allll week to complete with lots of research.",1
Mrs. Noland is very merciful when it comes to grading and getting assignments done. One thing that I like about her is that shell nod and mouth to you Good Job when youre finished saying a speech. Shes pretty encouraging and honest when it comes to the end of speeches. She also does a few class games that really benefits public speaking.,1
I took both of his art history classes. I love his class. He has traveled the world doing archeological work and has seen many of the pieces of art that he covers. He has amazing stories and you will never be bored. ,1
"Mark is such a freaking sweetheart. 308 sucks regardless of who you take it with. Mark Believes in his students, and is extremely passionate about what hes teaching. Hes very funny and possibly one of the sassiest professors I've ever had. YOU GO GLEN COCO.",1
"I don't know why so many people have Dr. McCartney so highly rated. If you have her for Tsem drop it, hardest class I've taken ever. 5 mandatory novels to read and she assigns so much work that she can't get it graded and returned. Aweful class all around",0
"Don't understand all the bad views on here. It's a hard subject, but he makes the class as painless as possible. Some studying is required but that comes with the subject. You can tell he's really passionate about what he teaches, and he gives a very generous curve at the end of the semester, along with dropping the lowest test. Pretty cool guy.",1
"Mr. Robinson is a good instructor. You do have a lot of group work to do. However, I guess that's what social work is about. If you come to class, you will pass. He doesn't take late assignments at all. I enjoy talking to him outside of class. Very knowledgeable. People need to stop hating on him...period.",1
"Excellent Professor, the textbook used gives students a perfect insight on how essay's should be written. She gladly revised all my essay's. Don't listen to the bad reviews below. She is very friendly, productive way to spent my Saturday mornings. I Would highly recommend her! Two Research Papers Two inclass essays and 10 Journals. Simple layout.",1
He is the best.,1
"DJB is amazing. She makes class super entertaining and worth going to, she is always available and makes extra time to help students and makes every effort to get to know you on a personal level. She explains concepts pretty well and is flexible for homework deadlines. You can't go wrong with DJB, an absolutely solid choice for 311.",1
"He's not difficult. The problem I had was his inability to communicate. I would wait many weeks to hear back on emails and phone calls. He grades slowly. By the week of finals, he had not posted some grades from the first weeks of school! I had no idea where I stood in the class, grade wise, and it didn't help that I couldn't get a response",0
"Danae is a professor who is very passionate about what she teaches. In other courses it often feels as if teachers are only there because they couldn't get a job in their respective field so they resort to teaching, thankfully not the case here. Make sure you do all the readings and participate. If you're struggling make sure you reach out for help",1
"The lectures are booooooring, all she does is read straight from some powerpoints that come with the book. The class is easy and so are the test just learn the vocabulary. She is a nice teacher but needs to make her lecture MORE interesting.",1
I usually always fail history but for the first time I understood and passed history with an A. Her lectures are really well written and she makes the content easy to understand. As long as you pay attention and you do the homework youll easily pass the exams. I would definitely take her again.,1
"I never ever want to have him again and I recommend that people don't take him. If they  take him then they are wasting their time and money. This guy does not even teach, all he does is keep talking about different topics.",0
"Dr. Anderson is absolutely the best Latin teacher you could hope for. He emphasizes that he is there to help you. If you have any problems with the translations, he takes the time to go over it with you. Regular quizzes, but you'll know what to study beforehand. Make sure to do the translations regularly, and you'll do well.",1
hard class.,1
"Gives every resource needed to pass the class. Print his notes out show up to class follow along in the notes and pass, its that simple. Provides a study guide almost identical to the test which is super helpful. Don't need the book if you buy the access code for the hw you should have access to the book there, but the notes are all you really need",1
"She teaches really fast and when you don't understand something, she'll be like ""WHAT?  what DON'T you understand?""  A little confusing at times, but she'll help you.  A little short tempered.  Her tests are alright, no trick questions.  She emphasizes on the stuff that's going to be on the tests.  She makes you practice the problems a lot.",1
I have taken several courses with Williams. Relatively difficult courses. Must attend classes. Lots of pop quizzes.,1
"Great Prof. Tries too hard to be friends with students but overall, effective, understanding, and dedicated.",1
"This is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is a great teacher and really makes you understand the topic. Didn't read a single chapter of the book and passed the class easily. Take her,she is awesome!",1
I had him for lab. Really nice guy. Very helpful. His drawings kicked ass. He has the best hand writing on a chalkboard!,1
"Kyle hetrick is the best English teacher I have ever had. He kept eng 100 interesting with current topics and interesting information. I learned a lot in this class, not just English either. I am going to try to get him for my next English class.",1
" very energetic women & makes class interesting, when it comes to grading (esp papers) extremely hard.  her hand writing is worse than a doctors. She will give feedback all over papers, but its illegible.  I went to office hours and she actually turned me away because she had 2 students coming at the same time. Makes EASY quest impossible to answer",0
"Mr. T was one of the best instructors that I have ever had. Very caring and straight forward. Realistic about expectations in his class. Rather than sit in class writing notes for lecture, he worked problems out to give us the practice. He also gave quizzes every class that were used towards extra credit. He's an awesome teacher!!",1
I had Professor Dattolo for Spanish I and 2 and I am am glad I did. Not only did i learn so much from him but he restored my belief that there are still professors at WPU who really care. He is clear in his explanations and if you ever need extra help or advice he is always there for you. I wish more professors were like Professor Dattolo!,1
"Alan is an amazing Teacher, as an alumni I can still reach out to him  for career advice .",1
"Solid professor, fair grader, and always willing to go through the complex proofs.",1
"Hes a good professor, very patient and explains concepts well. His biggest con is the way he grades. He takes points off for the smallest things: he didnt like the way you wrote a symbol or you skipped an obvious step. You can have every answer right and still get a B or C",1
"He is so awesome. A great teacher but he is also such a caring and nice person and is always willing to help. I miss having him as my advisor since I changed majors; he really, really helped me. ",1
"It's extremely not true that she'll tell you exactly what's going to be in the test/quiz. She will only tell you which chapter to read. But, she's helpful. You may not understand what she's explaining in the class because she's a foreign professor from Saudi Arabia, if I'm not mistaken.",1
"Shes nice but its very hard to stay alert in her class, the way she explains things makes it complicated.",1
"A very caring and happy professor. Puts real value on the grades his students get and their well-being. If you don't get a good grade the first time on a paper, he'll sometimes let you submit revisions. Class participation matters a lot, he takes note if you come in late too much or obviously didn't read.",1
"This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not know how to teach. He will lecture the whole class on random information and then give you a pop quiz that doesn't even have to do with anything you learned. He doesn't post any grades. When checking in with him to see what my grade was he said ""I don't know calculate it yourself.",0
Professor Swint is a great and fun teacher! Class is not mandatory but if you go and he gets to know who you are he will def. help you out with your grade! I don't really like american gov. but he makes it as interesting as he can! Take his class!,1
I was so lucky to have him as a professor. This was his last semester in the B School. I learned so much. He always made us feel like he cared. Now were stuck with professors with no real experience. Hes a legend.,1
"Professor Amey means well, but he tends to talk for what seems like hours and you never know what exactly you need to know. The only things you are graded on are pop quizzes, usually once a week, assignments that you get full credit for just by handing them in, and a final which is essentially made up of questions from all the quizzes.",1
I should have gone to this site before I signed up for this class. This professor was very difficult. He didn't explain things very well and made you feel super dumb if you didn't understand something and tried to ask questions (even though he encourages questions). I understand A&P is hard.. but he was RIDICULOUS! Threatened extra credit too much.,0
He is on of the best instructors in the Biology department. He makes lectures interesting. He relates the topics to real life work fields and he is willing to work with you to make sure you understand. His exams can be difficult but he is very fair. You have to attend class and participating helps you pass the exam.,1
"Terrible professor. There are blatant discrepancies between explicit policies on the syllabus and feedback on written assignments. Quizzes are based on minute details hidden in dense, utterly boring readings. Do NOT take this class hoping for an interesting perspective on Islam--his teaching will make you never want to touch the subject again.",0
Insanely demanding. Miss Pillai is really strict and she will call you out if you're not doing the activities or look distracted. She has very helpful Powerpoint and her knowledge of French culture is impressive but she could be friendlier to make class less stressful.,1
I took him for all my accounting classes at NOVA. Loved his lectures and explanations. Since the classes are usually small he is very open to questions and will take time to help you understand. As long as you pay attention in class and do the homework the tests are incredibly easy. I would definitely recommend over all other professors.,1
"I took her online nutrition class. Really easy! Every exam and quiz has no time limit and you can take each exam twice. If you have a question though, don't expect too much help. She often refers back to notes or asks you to google it. Rarely had any questions though. Course was very easy. Make sure your grammar and spelling is correct though!!",1
This Professor is incredible! He truly brings light to learning. I almost wanted to give up from burnout and he brought back my interest and love for learning. Truly a gift or the academic world.,1
Best Professor I have ever met. Super nice and friendly. Easy A!!!,1
"Dr. F gave great feedback and was easy to get in touch with. Quizzes were straightforward, but discussions and essays required more effort.",1
"Great professor! Very chill and reasonable. He works with you if you need help, and he is always accessible. He is just a very understandable easy-going professor whom I would take again. His class was always thought-provoking and interesting. He guides the discussions but always lets the students lead. Put effort into the papers and you'll pass.",1
"Dr G is a great teacher!  He really knows his stuff and wants you to learn.  If you are struggling because chemistry is hard, he is very accessible for help.  Also lots of opportunities for extra credit.  The homework really helps with mastering the material.",1
"Great teacher. NOt any easy A, you have to study, but if you do not get A, there is something wrong with you. Ask for help. He will always helplp you!",1
Love Venus he is definitely one of my favorite professors at Gordon. Such a good personality he has dark humor but he is very funny if ur into that. His work is not hard had a lot of quizzes but there easy I came to every class and did all my assignments so Im sure I will b finishing with an A. I would definitely recommend him to anybody,1
"Can be intimidating, but a great professor.  Expects you to work hard, and is clear about what she wants.",1
Hes ok! Sometimes his mouth cant keep up with his brain.,1
I absolutely love this woman.  She is vibrant and interesting and makes me want to try harder....I wish she was my mom :(,1
"I didn't enroll in CS 146 but I go to his class for my own interest. He teaches materials that are a lot different from CS 136. He didn't teach C at all in the lectures but he stick with Racket and taught us some compiler and assembler stuff. It's pretty hard to understand in first year. He is an amazing prof, funny and very smart.",1
"Tests are hard, you must study everything in the book. Final is nearly impossible. However as long as you do every assignment, and do well on tests throughout the semster you will do fine. Just remeber to STUDY, STUDY, STUDY!!!",1
"Wonderful professor, loves history and have a quirky fun personality.",1
"Professor Schuster is passionate about teaching history and it helps make the class exciting.  He wears ties but comes off as casual--don't let this fool you!  He is actually demanding about things like coming in on time, being formal in email messages and proofreading your essays.  He is young but he is very ""old school.""",1
"He is super unclear about what he wants, and the office hour doesn't help at all! The only thing you can learn from is the class note. The lecture is useless. Definitely hard grader. Deduct points with no reason! Ridiculous project at the end of semester that no one knows how to do",0
"She's awesome caring and talkative, very nice!",1
Excellent teacher. Well organized. Great literary selections. Fun projects. Just show up and act interested in class and you will do great. He provides lots of time during class to work on assignments. He loves English and wants student to do well. Great teacher.,1
Excellent teacher.  Does NOT try or want to be tricky.  Is available more than her posted office hours.,1
"This guy is the best teacher. Explains everything, ready to help you, lets you do the quizzes if ure late to class. Always talks about the nerd honour badges, haha, gotta love this guy. Best nerd ever.",1
She doesnt actually teach. She just talks about her personal life. Regularly late for class. Very unclear with grading.,0
Sammons is a really easy going professor who is not strict at all when it comes to essay deadlines. Attendance is not mandatory but what he talks about in class he expects you to incorporate them in your essays. I would recommend Sammons to anyone who struggles with english. He also wears a Santa hat when its around Christmas time!,1
"Prof. West is an awesome teacher! I didn't know what to expect when I took this course as a math alternative, I'm glad I did! The shock factor is there, don't be surprised. His teaching compels you to want to do your homework. I would recommend this Instructor. So much covered in each session, don't miss a class.",1
Really great guy and passionate about what he does. Very lecture heavy class though.,1
"This was an independent study physics simulation. I hope this doesn't look like a bad rating, cause Duba is awesome. It's just that he was the guy signing off on the project, no real teaching or direction required on his part. I'm really thankful he let me do my own thing.",1
Can't recommend Prof Washburn enough! She is amazing! Lovely lady! ,1
"Dr. V is a very good teacher, she is always open to help if you don't understand things. Homework and quizzes are online and factor into your final grade. Study more than just the study guides given for exams and you will do very well. Do not skip class because you wont be able to get the powerpoint notes. I would definitely take her class again!",1
"Doesn't respond to your emails and is very unclear about what hes expecting on exams ?s and in homework assignments. The absolute worst teacher I've ever had teaching an online class(and I've taken 6 classes no prob) , and supposedly he never even took a class on campus but still can't create an online class that operates smoothly and efficiently. ",0
He is very straightforward and the homework is relatively the test. His class is relatively easy and he is a comical and nice professor. Slight accent but very easy to understand and if you participate he will help you.,1
"He is a very good lecturer, but his homework and tests are very difficult.  He does consulting work in addition to teaching, so he is impossible to reach if you have questions or need help.  He is very nice and helpful if you can catch him, but good luck!",1
"Dr. Creed is the most dedicated professor at CofC, hands down. He is highly intelligent and will make sure you understand what you need to improve on in his class. I struggle keep up with his class but he is an amazing professor. He is extremely accessible. As long as you work with him, he will work with you. 10/10 recommend as long as you work!",1
She is fun to listen to and makes me want to go to class. She is polite to her Students.,1
"He is a really good teacher. Besides improving and getting comfortable speaking in public, he teachers life lessons! Ex: compassion and respect. Only had 2 take home tests, open book and notes. Sometimes the class requires a lot of work for the tests and researching for speeches. No work IN class and easy to make an A in. Awesome and fun class",1
"Great teacher! Has a sense of humor and brings food in for his students sometimes. Passing this class without studying every week for the quiz is difficult, so just study before the quiz. All of his lectures are posted on D2L so if you miss class you will still know what is going on.",1
His class is useless. talk about things he enjoys talking about not what students need to know. One of the worse prof I had.,0
"I loved Pat McKean! His connections in the journalism world are incredible and we had some amazing people come in to talk to the class. There is a lot of writing outside of class as well as in-class assignments. But none of it is crazy long, and it's all straight forward. He gives great writing feedback. I recommend him!",1
"Took an online composition class with him, quick 6 week course. Seemed nice enough when I had to email him but didn't follow syllabus well. If you can do your own research to understand the readings you'll do fine. Most assignments were graded just for participation so it's easy enough to pass if you just do the work and follow his instructions.",1
"Overall really nice guy and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. However, the final project was extremely vague from start to finish, he doesn't post his lecture slides online and talks extremely fast so it's hard to keep up. On a good note I did learn a lot about marketing.",1
Great prof!,1
"this class could be aggravating at times, not because it was hard or had too much work but he gives pop quizzes very often. However, as long as you read and keep up on work you'll be able to get an easy A. As for assignments, as long as you pass something in you get full credit for them. Also be prepared to take a lot of notes.",1
"Rizzella recognizes hard workers when she sees them and is an amazing resource. She is tough, but if you seek her out for help/explanations/ideas, she is a fountain of knowledge. She rewards good, solid effort and thorough work and appreciates when students are clearly interested and involved in her classes.",1
"Lots of enthusiasm.  Excellent knowledge of subject and examples given are awesome.  The only professor that graded things quickly.  14 easy, 10 point assignments to help your grade.  Offered extra credit.  Made classes fun.  I would take her again.  Best marketing instructor at EMU.  Stellar",1
"1.)  Not interested in teaching the class,  2.)  Did not follow syllabus,  3.)  Was not prepared for laboratory experiments, 4.) Had low expectations of students in the class,  5.)  Good at explaining difficult concepts in a simple way.  I estimate that 95% of what I learned came because of my own studying, not because of the instructor.",0
Second time taking him and I am now a sophomore class of 2017 and plan on taking him for the rest of my years here at Kean! He gives lots of opportunities to make sure you pass his class.,1
Her lectures are a regurgitation of the textbook. Instead of explaining proofs she writes duh on the board and moves very fast through material. Tests are extremely hard and she encourages people to withdraw. The only way to do well in this class is if you have seen this material before. This is my 4th math class at Duke & by far the worst.,0
"She is an amazing teacher! She was so easy and I really learned a lot. The test are identical to the review, so as long as you show up to class on the day of the review and memorize it, you'll make a 100. I never made below a 98 on anything in the class. And we got out early everyday.",1
"Her lectures are long, dry, and boring. She is knowledgeable, however; she lacks structure and clarity in both the lectures and exams.  In her Japanese history class, the exams are heavily influenced on Japanese names and terms versus historical events. 60-200 pages assigned to read per week. very tough grader. Waste of time and tuition. ",0
Great!!!,1
"I recommend her. I've never understood philosophy but she explains things really well. Leads great class discussions. Covers everything in the book so not much of a need to read. Hard grader but if you're having trouble, go to office hours. Over-explain things in your tests. She wants as much info from you as possible and won't assume your answers.",1
"I have had Professor Sumi for financial as well as managerial accounting. I am an Automotive major and these were required classes. Sumi is hard for those who do not come to learn, she will not take disrespect but is one of the nicest people out there, she makes me understand accounting through industry related problems. SHE FORCES YOU EARN IT.",1
"There seems to be a lot of negative thoughts on Meryl and her class, but those of you considering taking her class SHOULD. I signed up for her class last minute b/c she was the only one with room left and it was the best thing I ever did. If you do the work and show up, you'll get an A. Shes understanding, just communicate with her. Shes the best.",1
"I absolutely love Professor Reisinger. She keeps her class engaging; that being said, participation matters. Her grading is very fair, and if you meet with her outside of class, she will help you do well. I def recommend attending office hours or meeting with her before assignments are due. Overall, a genuine teacher who cares about her students.",1
"Read word-for-word from Powerpoint so didn't really teach the material. Tests were extremely difficult in comparison to her level of teaching and included trickily worded questions. Was very vague when it came to project instructions and would then grade very strictly, claiming aspects where missing that she didn't ask for.",0
"Professor Terrenato was hands down my favorite professor this term. He is knows his stuff, is really fun to talk to at office hours, and his lectures always made me laugh at some point. I know archaeology isn't everyone's cup of tea but if you are even remotely interested take his class. You will not be disappointed. His exams are not overly hard.",1
terrible because he focuses on side stories and not actual content,0
"Best prof I've ever had. He is amazing. So smart and funny. He's not really tough on attendence but there is a quiz almost everyday over the reading. Not hard if you read the bible. I've learned so much about the New Testiment because he knows so much. Great man of God, I wish I could a class with him every semester",1
"If you work hard you will not have problems with passing this course. The professor is willing to help, very responsive, and explains very well the material. There is 3 homework, which reflects what he wants you to know and what it's coming on the exams. Do and study the HW! If you really want to learn about Database, take this class with him.",1
Ok she is a tough teacher but unless you are one of her favorites and she does have favorites you will not get any positive feedback from her. She will knit pick you to the point that you can get a note out of you. She'll make you so mad that you'll want to punch her. She can be extremely disrepctful to you infront of everyone!Take someone else.,0
"I had Kim for lecture and lab. She's amazing in lab, but dismal in lecture. She would go off on tangents, then speed through the remaining slides expecting you to understand everything. Her final was filled with mechanisms she told us about last minute. If you try to get points back, don't expect her to be nice. Hard HW. Very unprepared for 3020:/",0
His class average was a 49 till the last week. the entire semester I didnt have above a 76 till the last week of class and I had the highest grade.,0
I loved the professor but not the work until we reached the last week of class and sister Kirkham addressed the amount of work that we did. She said that she knew that we did a lot of work but that was only because she knew that we could handle it and rise to the occasion and that changed my outlook on the class.,1
"I have loved History my entire life. Taking this class made me doubt that love on multiple occasions. There is way too much reading for a gen ed. I had to spend more time on this class than I did on the rest, lowering my overall grade. He also seems to think we're all below average students. And I'm pretty sure History is more than Social Mobility.",0
"This is a very difficult class, especially if you had no French experience in high school. Do your homework, do her little extra research projects and extra credit assignments.  Try really hard to practice speaking French (you never practice in class, only get graded in class). This class will become your life.",1
"I had Bernadette for PSYCH 1A online and it was a very pleasant experience. She gives detailed instructions and is available through email to clear up any confusion. No pop quizzes, multiple tries for at least 3 of the tests, and quite a few opportunities for easy points or extra credit.",1
"Craig Meixsell was tough to deal with. He did not know the new department system, had poor time management, dreadful lectures, and graded very harshly in a ""his word is law"" manner.  If you know little about computers, take another professor.  That being said, you can pass with a high grade, but it is solely up to you to do it.",0
"Dr. Kim is likely the sweetest lady on this earth. Sit up front. Laugh at her jokes. Make eye contact. If you are focusing, you will understand her accent. Saying you ""can't understand her"" is a copout. Be motivated. I took her for Org Chem Lec and Lab and got easy A's in both. Dig into her power points and do her study problems. You'll do fine.",1
"I have no idea why Professor Warden has such a bad rating. She's my favorite professor at this school. You have to be willing to put in the work, but she is willing to help you as much as she can. We had a quiz on most Fridays, but they were only 5 questions and super easy. I LOVED this class. I wish I could take her for all my English courses.",1
amazing woman. she truly loves english and teaching. love love love,1
"Might be the worst teacher I have ever had.  This is by far the most difficult class I've ever taken and it is only because of the professor.  Looking back at the semester, a fish could teach better than she could.  She assigns ungodly amounts of homework and does little to help us understand the material.  Outside help is the only way to  do well.",0
"Mr. Bassow made Public Speaking very fun.  Even though I had taken a Public Speaking class before, I really found I had learned a lot. And if you take his class,enjoy it and as the man himself once said , ""Remember to breathe!!""",1
"She makes physics FUN! Very energetic, especially for a 7 am class. She gave opportunities for extra credit.  Test where from the study material given by her.  Really cares about the students. If you are looking for a fun-filled, educational class and to learn about physics, take this instructor!!! You will not regret it.",1
"Professor Nelson overall is nice. She can be a little demeaning sometimes when you ask questions. I liked that in her class we got to choose what 5 homework assignments we wanted todo(all reading and answering questions). Her exams are very easy if you read, and she does offer 2, 20 point extra credit assignments. Easy A!",1
"Take this class for your Cultural Heritage 1. Steve keeps discussion interesting and relevant. He is open to alternative viewpoints and everyone is made to feel like they have something to contribute. We don't just talk about the Greek and Romans, we talk about how it relates to today. Class is lots of fun> he's a fair grader and really nice guy.",1
He really cares about his student and he guides you through he work and he always review before a quiz or test,1
"Makes you work for grade but very easy to contact, clear methods. Lots of assignments over all but helps you understand the lessons. 4 oral presentations, quizes after every chapter and tests. Some group tests. Go to class and do the homework. Very nice and very understanding",1
"Dr. Wilson has a poor knowledge of the information in the course. She often asks the class questions that she does not know the answer to herself. I do not recommend her as a professor. I would rather skip her classes and read the book myself. She swears by her lecture notes but they are useless, and do not correlate to info on the tests.",0
Very arbitray in his grading and is boring in class. AVOID if at all possible. I didnt heed the advice and now have this as my worst class in my CAREER,0
Great professor. Probably the best I have had during university. She cares about her students and is always willing to help. So enthusiastic about teaching the material. She makes everything very clear and really wants her students to succeed.,1
"I took Spanish for 2 years in high school and passed with A's and B's. So when I had to take a language for my degree requirement, I thought Spanish would be a breeze. Boy was I WRONG! Even with my prior knowledge I was confused and he moves very quickly. SO MANY ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS. He takes points off if you don't show up (even when you are sick)",0
Good. Helped me with my essay,1
"She reads from PPT and cannot answer simple questions unless she given time to flip through the text. And if she doesn't know the answer, which is often, she will ask the students what they think of the question and move on.",0
GREAT professor! She is so sweet and willing to do anything for her students. Very easy as long as you do your work. Such a great 3 hour class. I would definitely love to take a class with her again.,1
Abdallah is a fair marker and a phenomenal lecturer. I've thoroughly enjoyed all the courses I have had with him.,1
"Genuinely loved Luis' class. I'm not lying when I say prepare to read. Very creative assignments, and loved working with my group. GREAT, DETAILED feedback on assignments. Luis is smart and knows his stuff, however his lectures can go off on tangent, so be prepared for that. Regardless, one of the best professors I've had so far.",1
His like so like gr8 like I've learned like so much from him its totally like LITTTTT,1
"Professor Miller knows his cardiology stuff.  Write down everything he says during lecture even if he doesn't emphasize it because it can show up on a test.  Use outside materials to help learn the material because it can be difficult.  Show up to class or get a poor grade, its that simple.  He's a good guy and tells lots of cool stories.",1
"Elizondo is a tough professor, she won't hand anything to you, you have to earn it! If you want an easy class take someone else, if you want to learn, take her! It was a challenge, her anatomy class but I loved every class, always learning, she answers questions if you ask. Lecture tests & lab tests are challenging but study and you will be fine",1
Never taken class with him but hes definitely hot,1
"She's a great person, but she gives way too much homework.  Final consisted of a group project, a portfolio, an entire essay (you have to do 3 other ones throughout the course) and an interview with a professional that you have to track down yourself. On top of that, daily homework and reading assignments.",1
"She is a lovely professor. She can be easily disappointed, so be appreciative and don't disappoint her; her standards are high, but reasonably high. Ask questions AFTER reading the material. If I had to give positive criticism about her it might be she could cover the basics of each chapter better. BUT THAT'S WHAT OFFICE HOURS/APPOINTMENTS ARE FOR.",1
he is a great professor who is great with lectures and knows what he is doing.,1
"Probably my second favorite science prof ever. he is so passionate about what he does and is so inspirational. and he really cares about his students. if you have a chance to take a class with him, DO.",1
He pulls down your course off the D2L before you know your final grade without any notice. I was new to D2. I contacted his boss and the Dean. I scored a couple 80s on the quizzes but mostly 90s and 100s. I scored a 98 on the final exam and I still got a C. I was stunned! He doesn't return emails in a timely manner. I DO NOT reccomend this guy!,0
"Mrs Bolt is not a teacher you want to have for an online class. Only responds M-F to email, good luck if you need to reach her otherwise. She expects a lot of homework and there are lots of different due dates. Tests are open only Sun-Wed, and most homework is due Friday at midnight. I wish for an online teacher she was more involved and willing.",0
This class will take over your work-life. Way too tough of a grader.,0
"Professor Arnold is one of the best, most knowledgeable professors at CSUB.  Was her class hard?  Yes.  Did she ask for anything we couldn't do?  No.  If she seemed tough it was because she wants us all to be awesome teachers.  There is a reason she was Teacher of the Year in Kern County.  I HIGHLY recommend this course to any future teacher.",1
"Amazing professor!  Grade was made up of midterm, final and one, giant paper.  If your undergrad is in Psychology be ready for an in-depth review!",1
Stone cold pedagogical excellence.,1
Very interesting.  I am glad I signed up for her class.,1
"Accounting 1 was tough for me but he explains it well . He's a fair, if not generous grader. Nice guy all around. I would definitely recommend.",1
"your grade is basically only based on the midterm, final, and one paper. there are also 5 discussions, but those are only worth 2 pts each. she doesn't teach out of a textbook or post any slides online, so its best to go to class yourself and pay attention the whole time to take good notes. she's very passionate about her teaching and is very nice",1

"I can honestly say he is the best prof I've had so far. He is approachable and always happy. He makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Only class that can capture my full attention because the material doesn't seem too intimidating when introduced by him. Exams were fair, and the ""curve"" is very generous.",1
She is marvelous.,1
The best Teacher you'll ever have,1
He is a good teacher.,1
"Such a great professor, her classes are never boring. There's two group projects; one is a book cohort (purchase a book, meet with a group, do some assignments), and the other is a kindness project. There isn't a lot of assignments, but the majority of work is the group projects. This is a great class, very entertaining and educating.",1
"Professor Hutton was a very tough grader, It was very hard to fix what she wanted on the rubric because she was not very specific on what she wanted she also quizzes you on what she likes. (EDU 104)",0
"Honestl dont know how people even rated this man nicely. Literally his lectures are way longer than needed to be. Everything they talk about honestly doesnt help, just do it for the pop up quizzes but wont help for exams. For exams you really need to do a lot of practice problems from the textbook, not from his recordings. Really rude, and arrogant",0
"Really great teacher and class, this class basically takes you through your personal issues relating to your past. Lots of writing but you write casually. She cares a lot about helping you. One of the hardest things is answering questions you might not want to have brought up. I think the class can really help if you pay attention to it.",1
"Doesn't explain his lecture slides well. TRies to be funny in class, but the only thing funny was our grades when we get the results back. Lectures are unclear, quizes/tests are ridiculously hard, avoid if u can.",0
"Lesley is, by far, one of the best professors I've ever had. She has an adorable, quirky disposition, is very passionate about photography, and is SO helpful to everyone. She is very well educated in her department and has inspired me to be a better photographer. I DEFINITELY recommend taking her. You'll learn a lot and have a blast!",1
"There was lots of homework for me because I took this class as a flex. I previously sucked at math and this class helped me be above average in solving algebra problems. I usually got C letter grades in math and thanks to the caring teaching the professor had with all her students, I passed with a high A and am ready for more math!",1
not useful,0
"she's a lunatic, whatever you do, DONT take her class. She's more uptight than a high school teacher. Counts 2 tardies as an absence and 2 absences and she will drop you from the course. Also, she is the LEAST understanding professor I have ever met, she went over on class time every class and made multiple students late to their next class",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU DON'T NEED TO! At first she seemed really cool, but come to find out there's homework EVERY WEEK, You have to type a 500 word journal 6 times out of the quarter, which is a drag. Has two midterms and a final. She has study guides for it btw. You Also need to participate or you won't get any participation points -.-",0
"This class is lecture heavy and a lot of notes. He did provide the book however, so its not necessary to acquire a book although I did. The quizzes are all online if you dont know the answers to them, but I strongly advise you read the chapters are there are discussion boards. The final exam was all on Quizlet and it was open note. Easy A.",1
I do not know where to begun because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps in class and can't teach.,0
This professor is a terrible example of what college will be like.  She doesn't tell her students when assignments are due(and they aren't on the syllabus)and then blames them when work isn't done. She also favors certain students and gives them extra cred for running coffee to her. Complaints have been made on her evaluations but PHSC does nothing,0
"Pretty good teacher, but she teaches straight out of the textbook. Honestly if you just read enough you'll be fine. Her lectures kind of suck, and she gets annoyed when people don't participate, but as long as you read the material the tests are a breeze.",1
"Took this as a mini-term Spring 2010 (online.) Easy class-only problem I had was the teacher took forever for her to post my grade. She also grades very easily especially on the EASY 8-page paper, which is NOT as hard as it sounds, just a paper about how times have changed on certain topics..like foster care or homelessness-you choose the topic.",1
"One of the best professors I've ever had, I hate history classes but she actually made me interested and kept me awake. What makes her such an amazing professor is you can just tell how intelligent and passionate she is about what she's teaching. Highly highly highly recommend her!!!",1
"Julien loves to teach which is evident through the fact that he makes sure the entire class understands everything before moving on. He will always take the time to help you out no matter what it is, and will make sure you do well if you want to. Show up, do the in class games and take time for the project and its an easy A.",1
"There are 4 tests for the semester. Each are worth 20%. He told us to use the study guide for exams, problem was that some tests were a replica of the study guide while other tests were nothing like the guide. During the lecture he runs through the problems quite fast so pay attention. Lecture was a bit confusing so you might need to teach yourself",1
"Loved this teacher! Very brutally honest about field and studies, but very thorough on material. Tests were essay take home, BUT about 10 questions with 10 detail questions each. Very time consuming. Overall great class, great proffesor.",1
"Phenomenal teacher, took her for my calc 1 class during the summer and it was much easier with her as the teacher. She makes sure you understand the formula, constantly asking whether you have questions or not. If you do have a question she will happily answer it with a response that often makes the issue go away. Would recommend to future students",1
"Master Fu is an absolute dear; wise and gentle-hearted; humorous, both inentionally and unintentionally; may not impress you right away, but with your heart in the right place you'll see the beauty of John Fu.",1
"TAKE JUAREZ! he's sweet and simple! funny and definitely works with you! his exams are straight to the point, theres a few writing assignments and pop quizzes for extra credit. but overall a passable class. one of my fave professors by far",1
"Great class, great professor. Class was interesting and easy to sit through. He's easy going and gives great feedback on papers. I would definitely recommend him to anyone taking an English class.  ",1
He's not an easy professor. He will call you out during class if you or not paying attention. But you will learn a lot about history. Highly recommend.,1
Books chosen for the class were very interesting and insightful but can be a large work-load for some.,1
"Dr. Mook is by far the most approachable and funny Professor I've had to date, but he is not very good at teaching. He doesn't write anything down during lectures, but rather just reads off of his PDF notes (which aren't very good). Generally the course is pretty easy, but there are times where you will get frustrated with his inability to explain.",1
Very fair but critical. She helps you to understand the basics of nursing research so you can be successful and critical.,1
Passed Accounting 2 with an A again. The study plan on MyAccountingLab works along with going to class and listening to her explain topics and material we are learning. Excellent teacher. ,1
"Very, very hard class. Prater expects a lot out of you. You will learn more in her accounting class than any other teacher. You have intense homework assignments but they will prepare you for the exams. There are a lot of opportunities to bring your grade up with in class assignments.",1
I LOVE DHAVAN.  MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR IN DEPARTMENT AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE UNIVERSITY.  LECTURES ARE REALLY ORGANIZED AND HE POSTS STUFF IN ADVANCE (USUALLY).  TESTS ARE FAIR.  HE IS AWESOME,1
Her class starts with meditation and ends in fulfillment. She inspires you to read and ensures your participation through online and in-class activities. Her projects prepare you for upcoming challenges. The 5K you pay for her class is easily worth 50K in uni itself and over 500K in career. Money can't buy you a better class and a greater mentor.,1
"Stevens is a solid engineering professor. He has a tendency to speak in a monotone, but he does try to insert some humor into his lectures, and he knows the course content very well. Spend some time getting to know him, and you'll be well rewarded.",1
He is a stickler about deadlines..,1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. -1/10 for me.",0
"Her tone is always condescending. Especially since shes smiling 24/7, even when irritated. Her instructions can be extremely vague but then she's very specific about what she wants from you. If you miss class then that's at least 3 grades going in as a 0 cause she'll put the report that's due the next week in as a 0 as well",0
Very uninspired. Reads straight from his handwritten notes. Seems like he is just going through the motions. Unfortunately many students have to take at least one of his classes. Gives pop-quizzes? Seriously are we in grade school?,0
"Easiest Bio course given at UD! Never went to class once and I am overly cotent with my grade. He's pretty boring and have a monotonous voice but attendance is not required at all. He's not one of those bio teachers who tries to trick you, his questions are straight forward. I wish he taught more Bio courses.",0
"Dr. Napolitano was a great professor to have. Although his tests were hard, he really teaches the material very well. The background that you need for this class is very poorly taught and he makes sure we strengthen the fundamentals. A lot of deep level learning.",1
His personal experience aligns nicely to the class and ties with the textbook. He encourages class discussion which makes this class so much better.,1
He is a great professor!!He teaches you about the reality of life. His stories were amazing and his exams were mostly from his power points. He get's the class involved and ask you questions that makes you think twice about what you can do to make a difference in your field.It is impossible to not get an A in his class.,1
"This woman is the most positive person alive and it's contagious. Also, she'll help you rationalize any horrible thing you do in your life. She's so much fun and she made me actually look forward to Monday classes.",1
"Mr. Molnar is easily one of the most helpful professors I have ever had.  He was more than willing to meet with you to discuss your work.  I came into this class expecting to pull of an easy A after breezing through 161, but I was brought back to reality.  He expected nothing but your best and as a result forces you truly improve your writing.",1
"Imagine the perfect cross between Mr. Rogers and Tom Cruise, that's Prof. Wellborn. He is mellow but loud, clear and energetic and listening to his lectures is like watching a movie. half of my in class life since middle school has consisted of desk napping until his class because he neatly embeds extra loud passionate bursts into his lectures.",1
"He was a very nice man and he knew his subject very well. However, this class was almost four hours long. He was not a very engaging professor to sit through a four hour lecture under. You will learn the subject if you pay attention, but I struggled to pay attention and stay awake during his class.",1
"Very helpful teacher.  Soft spoken, organized and prepare class lectures. Goes over homework problems. Doesn't always teach from the textbook, so for some chapters, attending class is important.  He explains things several times in different ways if someone is confused.  Gives extra credit on tests and finals.",1
Mr. Hayes was great ! No matter what I needed help in he was always there to lend a helping hand!!,1
"She is a wonderful professor who seems to care greatly about her students. The class has a lot of reading assignments and essays which are very time-consuming. She is a very tough grader and has very strict deadlines, but allows students to rewrite their major essays in order to attempt to get some points back.",1
He's gonna weed you out at the beginning,1
I LOVE this prof! She has inspired an interest of anthropology! She is very interested in the material and very passionate about it. All readings were interesting. Attendance and participation are very important to her. Tests are pretty easy as long as you follow the study guide she gives you. Take this class. Very interesting!,1
"She was  a good teacher. Used to go around class to check whether students were doing in-class assignments and help us if we had any questions. Never used the book. Her accent was a little distracting at times. I took her in the summer and got A, but I also had a good background in calc.",1
He is a great professor! He really enjoys teaching and is very clear about what you need to study. His tests are tough. Homework and other activities keep your grade up. Highly recommend taking him for Spanish!,1
She is very boring and does not know how to work a computer.,1
"Professor Holliway is a solid professor. He does get back to you except on the weekends, and if you send him another email after a day or two of no response, he will get back to you. In psyc, lots of reading, but other than that, I am on the path to a fairly easy A.",1
"Was very unclear, and not very willing to work with her students",0
"She breaks it down well enough to understand, cares alot for her students.",1
Someone with such a lack of respect for American students should go home to whence they came.,0
"Dr. Amundson was a great professor! She gives good lectures that keep you interested. You have to do a fair amount of papers, but none are too demanding. Two books are assigned, wrote a 200 word paper on a chapter or two due every Friday, and a discussion on those chapters every Friday. A book report on each. Tests were not challenging.",1
Sanda knows how to design and she's wonderful at that. However she doesn't teach well. She gets mad when students aren't getting it yet we just spend the whole class critiquing and repeating ourselves. She made it clear from the beginning that this class is a lot of effort and time. Not for the unconfident people.,0
"Took creative writing with her. Great class if you're interested in spending some time working on your writing. She's a very hands off teacher, she lectures a little bit but mostly just facilitates the collaborative workshop process. She has foxes on her screen saver in her office.",1
"Dr. Baumann is very unclear with what he is looking for on assignments. Even if you answer a question correctly, he will mark off points for not including every detail he is grading on (even if you are not given a rubric). I would recommend taking a different professor . You might do poorly due to his grading, even if you know the material.",0
Useless teacher - I had her class and wouldn't take it again!!!,0
"Attendance is a must, but not mandatory. If you attend class, it's an easy A. If you need extra credit, he gave it out twice to those who attended class (before a holiday/break or when class was sparse). 2 papers, 3 exams and some section work. Overall good prof, just need to pay attention and ask questions if you get lost.",1
"I liked Professor Aizura. He's a good person and pretty funny. However, I did not enjoy the structure of this class. I thought it was pretty confusing. You aren't graded on a lot, so the things you are you actually have to do well on. There's a ridiculous amount of reading though.",1
"Lots of discussions where you make your post then reply to other students' posts. Flexible deadlines where due dates might change, but nothing unreasonable. He provides excellent feedback. I think he'd be a great prof to maintain a good relationship with if you plan to continue in the cinema field.",1
"Nice guy but good luck learning anything from him. I've done well in Calc I and II so general physics should be nothing, right? Almost too simple if you're a science major and his explanations and ways of doing things are so convoluted and hard to follow it makes getting anything out of it difficult.",0
"No book needed, I purchased my coloring text book and never used it, instead I focused on the reviews youll see online throughout the course. Make flash cards and STUDY STUDY STUDY! Those flash cards and you will make As on all of them.",1
"phenomenal professor & person, def one of the best at ucf. he's so funny and caring and the course material is engaging and worthwhile. test material is mostly off his powerpoints but not hard at all. fun class to go to & he pays attention to how much effort u put in attendance only mandatory a few times not always but go anyway it's worth it",1
"Fun class if you are an engineering major.  Easy class, but sometimes boring.  You have to attend class and do the homework, but it is really easy. one paper with a presentation the last week of class.  If you like your grade before the final, you don't have to take it, your grade does not change!! Find another teacher that does that.",1
Took this class online. Each week we had to read a chapter and answer a discussion board. Provided reviews for midterm and final exam. Had to write a paper as a project and it was based on the reading. Professor is quick to respond and gives helpful answers to your questions.,1
"Tatyana is amazing. She is clear and does a good job explaining accounting. The class itself is difficult, but she makes it easier and even offers extra credit. I recommend showing up every day even though attendance doesn't matter because it will help with the homework and exams. She is very nice & helpful and cares. One of the better profs at FS",1
"I haven't taken a math in over 20 years! Plus, math is hard for me. This teacher wants students to succeed . She gives plenty of opportunity to understand math. She is very patient. She took the fear of math out of me. Always encouraged everyone in the class. I would definitely recommend this teacher to anyone!!",1
"Professor McCullough is a great teacher and she really does a wonderful job of making sure you understand and are prepared for the exams. Just a daily quick hw, makes the lectures really short which is great. I'd recommend her to anyone, and I'd retake her in a heart beat. Real gem of a teacher, take her you will do great!",1
"Professor Lusk is amazing. If you have to take psych, take her. She is so funny and she understands that students have families, jobs, and other commitments that interfere with school. Very understanding. No quizzes, only a few tests and projects that aren't hard if you read the book. Great educator! ",1
"Elementary Logic is very much like Algebra or other forms of math.  If you do not enjoy math or are not good at math, avoid  Elementary Logic.",0
"Just reads from the text book, there is no outside of teaching except for him to talk about his political views and finance world. The class is Federal/State Taxation which is not being taught what so ever! AWFUL TEACHER, BEWARE",0
"Though Dan has a tendency to critique harshly as a project progresses, he is often considerate of effort put forth and reception of suggestions when grading. Overall he is extremely kind hearted and just wants to see you improve. He does tend to be a bit old fashioned in some design aspects.",1
"Prof. Hess is kind of all over the place. She tends to forget things a lot, and is very unclear about what she expects in essays and in projects. She doesn't have formal instructions for her assignments. She doesn't use Titanium and doesn't post grades. We used the book every day in class. 2 in-class essays, 2 take home essays, 3 exams.",1
The first and the best professor I have ever met,1
"She assigns a lot of readings, but you don't necessarily have to read them all to pass the class. Overall, I think she fit in a lot of material in a short period of time, and I felt like I learned a lot. However, her instructions for assignments could be confusing, and we had to ask for clarification of expectations a lot.",1
"Great teacher, super helpful and really nice. There were a lot of projects but if you followed the rubric then he was a pretty easy grader.",1
"Any attempt to be personable with her goes ignored. Assigns more than other lab professors without taking into account the added time they take. Exams are set up by assigning a random animal and applying concepts to that specific animal. Which in theory sounds great, but she gives you no direction or resources on what she expects, hard to succeed",0
"While a nice enough guy, Professor Bullock makes it extremely difficult to get any grade above a B. That being said, I was able to write all of my papers early in the term and because of that did not have any homework for the second half of the term. He genuinely cares about his students, but be prepared to sit through extremely boring lectures.",1
Awesome professor!  She really wants you to learn.  Prof. Clausen takes the time to ensure that everyone knows the material.  She does cold call but gives you the questions before class.  Take her!,1
"He is HORRIBLE! Do not take this class! He has a syllabus, but no due dates, and he expects you to submit things on time. Then he does not remind you if something is due.",0
"Dr. Jaime really cares & wants his students to learn the concept and enhance their skills, always responds to questions, in-person, at office, by e-mail and we had this GroupMe where he helped us a lot. One best thing he did for us was reviewing whole College Algebra and Trig. before getting into Calculus which paved the way for us to learn better.",1
I took two classes with her before and  I am taking another class with her in fall. She is so nice and relaxed and grades very fair. Some of the reading's are long but she explains and brings in things I am interested in. I like philosophy and her accent.,1
Please skip this class if possible. There is absolutely no communication or organization throughout the quarter. The poor TAs were always struggling to catch up with the professor and I never knew what was going on. The lectures and exams are extremely intense. He's very passionate but not the best professor for an intro class.,0
"If it is your goal to learn the science of nutrition, do not take this class - with this professor. Expect to find all of her test questions searchable on Quizlet (even the online midterm), and to be blindsided for the final. Personally, I know a lot about nutrition - A LOT, and I hoped to learn something here. Nope. She is a robot, sadly.",0
"Professor Holt is a very smart teacher. He encourages discussion amongst his students and then moderates the discussion (pointing students towards the correct interpretation). Has a clear and definitive understanding of his material. The classes sometimes get boring because of how student-driven they are, but overall great professor and class.",1
She does a great thing with test grades where your lowest test grade is replaced with your attendance grade. I absolutely loved her and she made me enjoy a subject I wasn't interested in. The tests aren't bad if you study and take notes. Just come to class and pay attention and you won't have any problems. Absolutely loved this professor!,1
"I took MGMT 374 & 478 with him. He's definitely a hard ass, but he means well. He marches to the beat of his own drum, is unorthodox in his teaching compared to the rest of the business school, & doesn't believe in textbooks. He pushes you out of your comfort zone so that you'll actually learn something, & I'm honestly grateful to him for it.",1
I had Professor Dattolo for Spanish 2 last semester and he was amazing. He is very intelligent and his lectures were organized and very easy to follow. He would go out of his way to help us and his respect for his students was greatly appreciated. If you take Spanish 2 be sure to to take Professor Dattolo,1
"Dr. Xing is a great professor. Most importantly, she cares about her students and wants them to be successful. Push she is very accommodating. The materials is tough, but she tried her best to make students learn. As long as you put the effort and do all the work, you will get good grades.",1
"Great class, great teacher. Planning to take her for nutrition next cuz I like the way she organizes the class, you always know what is expected.",1
"Fairly easy grader on assignments, test maybe only 25 multiple choice but they are not easy. Doesn't teach at 101 level, he thinks you are already a master in geography. Can easily pass with a C and never attend class because he doesn't take attendance.",1
"If you like macintosh then you will do fine in this class.  if you think it is an inferior, overpriced product you will not succeed in this class.",0
"She makes chem so fun! Explains things in an easy, but not juvenile, manner. Would definitely recommend!",1
"Best Professor Ever, Very interesting class and He definitely knows his materials",1
"This is a relatively harder course to take online, but if you read all the material presented and do the weekly assignments, it makes testing easier.  Questions are specific (attention to detail is important), so get use being able to answer the Where, What, When, Who, and How.",1
great teacher!! highly recommend him nice very helpful.he wants you to be original with your work!,1
"Dr. Grapenthin is amazing as a piano teacher, despite her focus being organ. She is there with you every step of the way, and is very understanding of anything that comes up. She works with you no matter what your level of experience in music is, and she attunes the class to where you are. I could not possibly ask for a better professor.",1
"I'll bet I can figure out who you are.  Dude, Mr. Haze is totally NOT Lazy.  He is one of the hardest working instructors at the college.  It is true you cannot always find him but he is constantly working.  We get room to sink or swim. I learn a lot from Mr. Haze",1
"If you go to him with a question, prepare to feel insulted, belittled, and still not have a clue whats going on.",0
Mr. Watkins is one of my favorite teachers at NOC. he makes learning about other countries fun and educational.,1
This man is very sweet but very out of touch. Online teaching is definitely not his format of choice. He rambles a lot and I found myself doing better by not attending lectures.,0
"There was a midterm, non-accumulative final, and 1 paper. The paper is the only thing you need the book for. I didn't touch it for anything else. There are routine in-class quizzes every 2 weeks or so. It's a straightforward class, but the material is very interesting and he teaches it well.  He's an intelligent, humorous, nice, and respectful guy.",1
"I took this class as a session A so it was very fast paced. Every 5 days there was discussion posts, a quiz, and a 'media critique' due. There would be a few readings per module and videos (some videos are documentaries so don't wait until the last minute to watch them). The media critiques are 250 words minimum and quiz are around 15 questions.",1
"While the professor provides students with an extensive number of assignments which can be overwhelming at times, I found a drastic improvement in my writing abilities over time. My quality of work and ability to challenge myself has also increased in capacity.",1
"i'm taking this course now. yes, lots of reading--and writing, but the stuff is very interesting. i'm learning about things in our country/society no one has ever taught me before. the best class i have taken at wsu.",1
Be prepared for A LOT of work. At least 4 quizzes a week along with assignments and research projects. One week alone we had 6 quizzes and 4 assignments that were not simple. She will help out with resumes and internship questions which was good. Other than that you need to dedicate much time to this class. Look for books online-they are expensive!,0
"He makes you work ridiculously hard for an A, and all of the comments he writes are 100% illegible. I went to his office hours and he could not even read the comments he wrote on my paper. He also gave me a B on a paper because he thought I used an incomplete sentence and then he realized I didn't but  didn't change my grade. He's a nice enough guy",0
"This guy is my favorite polisci professor I've had at CofC. He lectures with little visual aids which is difficult for a visual learner, but he will make himself available to you whenever you need and as much as you need. Super cool and very knowledgeable. Class is a lot of reading and hard tests with a 25 research paper due during finals",1
"He makes you read novels that have nothing to do with sociology. Class was basically created so he could tell you about his life. Hated every minute of this class. I could write an bio about this man and probably get 99% of it right. Avoid taking Maril if you can. If can't avoid, expect a B or lower. He thinks an A+ or A is perfect so wont give out",0
"A challenging class,but for the thoughtful student, a life changing class.",1
"One of the worst professors I've taken. Mocked students who ""should've learned the material in grade school"" and was often unwilling to explain calculations in class. Cancelled Friday classes without making up for the time lost and seemed perpetually unhappy. Tests were 2-3 problems and significantly different from homework and lecture problems.",0
"she is a very good professor, she loves nature so get ready to be all about nature. not to much work. you will have to buy a text book for her class ""the blue book"" - $20 dollars.",1
Awesome professor! Clear rules. Tests are easy if you do the homework.,1
"Literally the best professor I have ever had.  Took Alex for Calc 1 & Calc 2, and she tought me so well that I tutor others using her lecture style.  She presents material so well that an idiot could understand it.  Her homework is hard but she spends HOURS outside of class helping students.  Sacrifices PHD work to assist students. A+++.",1
"Professor Juarez is the best! He knows how to teach and I learned a lot in his class! Take him! We had two papers, three exams, three discussion boards, and attendance matters! Also, he is funny!",1
She moves way too fast but she does give the opportunity to ask questions. I studied hours for each test and I couldnt get an A in this class. She takes points off for everything. She gives study guides but her test questions are different than the study guides and her expectations are always unclear. Shell find any reason to take off points,0
I had her a few years ago.  Really nice and easy going and fair.  I learned a lot.,1
"Took this in first year, as I needed an English credit. She is a part-time prof, who is a tough grader. She certainly makes you work for a mark, and quote on quote, does not hand out A's. Ever. That being said, she is available to help when asked. This is a friendly reminder to not call her after 10pm. I'm sure she will let you know why.",1
"great lectures and great character as being a biology professor, I am personally a visual person and she uses great videos and other sources to support her detailed and simple presentations that keep you intrigued. Never been a big biology fan but she made me love the class.",1
"Great professor I highly recommend her. I  had a wonderful semester. For those of you that plan on taking child development 42 I just want to say that the class sounds difficult at first,but do not panic. Honestly it was the easiest most fun class I have ever taken.",1
Prof.Parker is very sweet. I was sick the first 3 weeks of this on line class and was unable to do a lot of work. She was very understanding and willing to help in any way possible. She always took my calls or answered my emails. Her husband even helped me one night with math questions as well. I thought for sure I was going to fail but I passed.,1
He is extremely helpful. I really enjoyed all of his classes.,1
"I LOVED Dr Kumari. She truly allowed me to love economics. I loved her discussions as they were real time and so interesting. I talked about what I learned outside of the classroom. This class is a lot of work but she is a fair grader. I took her both microeconomics and macroeconomics. If youre excited to learn , she is the best!",1
"Very nice professor! I was kind of hesitant about taking her for ENGL 1301 but so happy I did. Before school even started, she sent us the course syllabus and a list of all the assignments and when they were due. She does lecture a lot but it's mainly out of the book. Please buy the book for this class. You will need it! Also, study for the quiz!",1
Professor Buchanan is very thoughtful. Even though this was a 9 am class he really tried to make the students laugh and is overall really kind. His lectures are simple but they work really well,1
Great professor who is well qualified. Very informative class and I am glad I took it although my passion does not lie in accounting.,1
Prof. Humber has very difficult tests.  The good news is that they are all curved.,1
"A dope professor and is really understanding. Gives good reviews that reflects the test perfectly. She gives out extra credit and extensions if you need it. 10/10, cant complain.",1
"Jiming is one of the best ITM professors at CSUEB. His exams are tough, takes almost the whole class period to finish the midterm and final, but he allows you notes full page front and back which helps a lot. Show up to classes because he gives 3 quizzes unannounced and drops one of them which is 20percent of your grade.",1
Great personality and makes class entertaining. I'd recommend his class. Take notes in class and study them and the homework problems.,1
"Carolyn is amazing. She is extremely nice and welcoming to her class. Just come to class and do all the essays, quizzes, homework, and classwork and even if you do poorly you can get at least a B-. She also remembered me when I ran into her which I feel a lot of teachers can't do. I would recommend taking her class, it's fun and you still learn.",1
"Professor Olssen is a solid professor, but a tough grader. Guidelines aren't as clear as they can be and comments aren't very helpful. She is, however, a very nice person.",1
"His tests take forever. There is little multiple choice, it is mostly short answer and essays. Be prepared to write a lot on the tests.",1
"Very knowledgeable and has accomplished much in her scholarship. Makes every attempt to engage the class, usually with success. The work-load is heavy, but manageable. Both classes I've taken with her have been valuable experiences, and I would recommend her as a professor. She's very understanding, and willing to hear your concerns.",1
"Honestly, easy A if you remember to do all the assignments on BB... which is (not an exaggeration) over 500. At least 5 homework assignments A DAY. Miss something, flat out zero. Is not lenient whatsoever, not even during these tough times. Not empathetic at all. Email her? Expect a response a week later, or no response works well for her too.",0
I enjoyed the class the class a lot. Learned a lot of new things. She is a pretty good prefessor. Highly recommend her.,1
thanks for being a great teacher.,1
"DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY.  She gives her lectures based on her own notes. Keep your notes organized and you will be fine. Smart woman, she knows what she's teaching. She uses her own PowerPoints, shares her personal stories that relate to the topic, and she presents us beautiful quotes here and there. Great 3 hour class. ",1
"I only have 350 characters so here's the take-home point: She is EXCELLENT- the class is difficult even if you think you know computers well. It's a lot of work but her grading criteria and assignments are very clearly listed and done in great detail. She puts a lot of thought into her course. Read her posts, do the work, get the A. End of story.",1
"I would not recommend Prof. Ehring to anyone. The material he uses in class is not his own - you can find the PPTs on Google. He reads directly off the slide and gets bored teaching (he announces it in class). Syllabus is not downloadable, was not helpful when I asked for it, grades are not clearly communicated with you. Stay away!",0
I took this class online. Soooooo much work! I mean I get it it's college but we had 2 or more quizzes every week plus an assignment on top of that. Quizzes only worth 10 points of total grade. A lot of group work too. Would not take another class of hers,0
"BEST PROF EVER. a heart made of gold, knows a lot, dumbs things down, a lot of work but a very fair grader, a prof you will forever want to keep in touch, makes an end of semester dinner for everyone during finals. just AMAZING ",1
This professor is spastic and overworked. She does not reply to e mails and has no office hours. Her lectures offer no help on how to teach science and she is often side tracked with off topic stories. She grades hard on senseless things like reflections. Her assignments are not clearly defined. The class was not relevant. I was disappointed.,0
Professor Bonner has to by far be the best teacher or professor Ive had in my entire life. I took him for Calculus 1 and he really cares a lot about the student. He is extremely thorough and responds to emails within an hour (within reasonable work hours). If I were to stay at Cerro Coso I wouldve taken him without a doubt for following classes.,1
"My writing actually improved while taking this class, and I have gotten compliments all semester from other professors on my writing skills. Uses positive reinforcement and praises student for content as well as writing. Tries to make the students feel more confident in their writing. She will make you read aloud but gives extra credit. Loved her!",1
"Lectures are boring and monotone, do not give specific grading boundaries and guidelines. However, she is easy to reach out and you can chat with her easily in office hours, she is willing to help you out. Overall, I would not recommend anyone to take this course unless you hate math.",1
Be prepare to participate.... he takes participation very serious. You get a grade every few weeks for participation. Do not miss class because he will take points off. You need the book for the class. He is very passionate about what he teaches.,0
"Great professor, very knowledgeable and complehensible. His teachings are very helpful. I enjoyed his class a lot.",1
"She is an amazing professor! She is very helpful. Whenever I had questions, she answered them and made sure that I wasn't confused anymore. If you do the work, and come to class then you will be fine.",1
Best professor of my first semester. Exam was such a nice break because he made it very easy.,1
Very tough class.  Susan is fair and will help you if you ask.  Do everything verbatim from the book and you'll be fine.  It's a law class so if you're looking for easy keep looking.,1
SHE'S OK WITH THE ASSIGNMENTS,1
"Participation definitely matters in this class but if you simply talk once or twice, she'll give you full credit. Peters is a tough grader but is very reasonable at the same time. She follows the syllabus very closely.",1
My first day of class I was a bit worried bc Peggy seemed super strict while explaining the syllabus but she's an awesome professor & the class was a breeze. She's also very helpful with anything if you just ask. I would definitely recommend her.,1
"Poorly prepared, makes exams unneccesarily hard with picky/tricky questions",0
Derek is an awesome professor. If you get the chance to take him definitely do it. He's super chill and super funny. Tests make up most of your grade but they are not to bad.,1
"He is awesome, he allows notes on tests and quizzes and is willing to go over problems that students don't understand. Go to the math lab for extra credit it will help you! Just take him no questions TAKE HIM.",1
Multiple choice midterm and final. Health history interview paper and video physical assessment. All doable and clear instructions. Good communication. Enjoyed this class. Wish this prof taught other classes I needed.,1
"Charlie is one of the greatest. He is just one amazing professor. Always around to help you if you need it, and his sense of humor is fantastic. Take any class with him. You'll love him",1
No Comments,0
Yikes. He's super passionate about what he teaches and will give you help if you're very specific about what you want but nobody did any of the reading. The quizzes (which you must check the syllabus for) were easy if you went to class. It's hard to not get an A and you'll come out with interesting info but he talks through videos which is annoying,1
"DR. G IS AMAZIG. HE MAKES SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS BEFORE HE MOVES ON. HE GIVES WORKSHEETS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE EXAMS. HE MAKES FRESH COFFEE EVERY MORNING AND BRINGS TREATS ON EXAM DAYS. HE IS HONESTLY VERY KIND AND CARING. IF EVERY TEACHER WAS LIKE HIM, THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE.",1
"I love Professor Lusk! While her classes tend to be pretty lecture heavy, I generally don't get bored listening to her. Her lectures are honestly quite thought provoking and interesting. She tells stories that make her lessons pretty applicable. Don't skip her class, I relied a lot on what I learned in class for tests. Also she grades pretty easy.",1
Loved this professor. She had clear criteria of what she wanted. She deeply cares about and loves history and teaches like it. She tries to find cheaper textbooks to save money. She also will always listen to you and try to work with you if something is going on. She's a great professor and would take again.,1
"easy professor, get him if you can",1
"I really enjoyed DJB as a person, she is funny and kind. I recommend going to her office hours before tests because they are actually helpful reviews and she will give you practice problems. I thought the class was difficult but thats not really due to her teaching but rather challenging material. Warning, she will cold call on you in class.",1
"Only thing I really hated about having her as a prof was that she didnt let us have laptops out during lectures. Overall as long as you pay attention in class and MEMORIZE the study guides (they're basically the same as the tests), you'll do fine. She's not a super hard grader on papers but she has a lot of little things she's picky about.",1
REALLLLY easy class. The teacher gave off a weird vibe like she didnt really want to help me but she answered all of my questions and was perfectly fine. I didnt use the textbook and BARELY made an effort and I got an A,1
Amazing.,1
"Would definitely not recommend her to anyone. She gives out a lot of assignments, papers every week, takes weeks to grade them, its November and none of my papers have been graded from the first month of school yet. She goes off-topic a lot, never responds to email, would never take this class again.",0
"She has a very high energy level.  If you're not sure about poetry, take this class.",1
"Prof. Doherty was great. Anatomy can be a tough subject, especially over summer but he made it less stressful and actually fun to learn! He lectures and has lab so pay equal attention to both and participate during lab by asking questions and involving yourself in the material; you'll learn and understand a lot by doing so. Would take him again.",1
"Disregard your textbook.  Bailey tests purely from his notes and what was said (or what he thinks he said) in class.  If you study from his notes, your test scores should be adequate.  He prides himself on his small pass rate.  My class started with approx. 24 students.  We ended with 9 students.",0
"This was the worst professor I've ever had! not only is he completely unclear about his assignments but he has absolutely no regard for anyone's privacy and he will tell your business to the whole class. His grading scale is ridiculous and between his monotone lectures and his rambling on about unrelated topics, I found myself frustrated daily!",0
Awesome teacher. Explains really well. Laid back but makes sure the students get the topics he's teaching.,1
Loves him some rubrics. Cool guy. Learned a lot.,1
"Pretty easy class, easy homework, and easy exams.  Nice woman, but she is technologically challenged.  Funny somtimes, but it got annoying.",1
An amazing character! Understanding and very generous- one of my favorite profs,1
she wants things done her way or youll get a low grade.,0
Not many assignments and attendance in mandatory.  Also is a very hard grader. Sometimes he sings and class is entertaining but most times its just lectures. If your going to take the class know what your getting yourself into. ,1
"Lectures don't make any sense. Rubrics for projects and study guides are extremely hard to read and make sense of. Exams are hard if you don't study and go to class, but she takes questions off that the majority get wrong, which helps",1
In all honesty Ted is a nice guy but a terrible teacher.  He struggles to explain the material and makes it very challenging for students.  To survive in this course you have to teach yourself the material in order to succeed.  ,0
"lots of writing, but its not difficult writing in fact sometimes its fun.  not much reading- def. bearable, class discussions can be fun and sometimes he likes to have discussions not relating to anything pertaining to class so its a nice break, helpful and understanding, nice professor",1
"This was a very relaxing language class. You follow the book closely up to chapter 7, do homework online, and quizzes in the testing center. Adrian is always willing to help students and even will cut time out of the end of class to help you. If you are a good self learner, study the material, and don't cram the night before you should be fine!",1
"She's awesome. She has this crazy bubbly personality and she's really cool, making the class feel calm. She's a good teacher, really good at explaining and coming up with all types of examples. She will definitely make you work for your grade. She knows what half-assing is. Quizzes are easy if you've done the work. Def have to go to class tho.",1
Professor Massnick is an amazing teacher. Her lectures make sense and they are very interactive. Her tests and assignments are very understandable. And she is a very understanding person.,1
"She's very nice, and the homework is incredibly easy. But she's incredibly unclear about what she wantsexpects, which can lead to missing a deadline because she wasn't clear about the deadline, and she refuses to take late work (except of course when she doesn't). Nice, but not a college-level teacher. Lots of youtube music videos and an easy book",0
"Overall, my online class was pretty straight forward. The only thing I didnt like was how we were slapped randomly with an extensive assignment and a final about something we wrote two posts about. If a study guide was given, I would have liked it a bit better.",1
A lot of reading!!! This class has 2 sections and Prof. Yankwitts taught the content section. She is very caring and understanding especially because of COVID 19. She tried to make online class more doable for everyone by coming in with tiaras. She goes through everything and gave extra credit opportunities. I would def recommend her to anyone,1
"Had a hard time getting through the readings when i took his class, however looking back on it and re-reading some of the things we went over in that class. Dr. Allen really did open new horizons of thought. ",1
"wow, who would've thought a class called Intro to theatre would require you to experience...*gasp!* THEATRE! how shocking! She's a great woman to work with and a good teacher who KNOWS costumes and you'll learn a lot.",1
"I found her lectures to be quite interesting, she likes engaging with the class and I enjoyed that. Exams weren't too difficult as it was mostly based off of the textbook. If you miss a class you can usually make it up by reading the text book to add to your notes as her slides are pretty vague.",1
"Online hybrid class - You read 2 chapters per week, and meet up once for a quick review, then you take a quiz. It is very well coordinated. Grading is test heavy. As for the instructor, she's very attentive & sweet. She'll comment on nearly everyones post on online discussions. You'll be in good hands. Personality wise, she seems pretty neutral.",1
Open to feedback on how things can be improved while learning online. No trick questions on quizzes or exam.,1
"I loved her teachings. I had her for a hybrid course so there was a lot of submitting and papers but they were very interesting because they had to do with children. Also be prepared to present a lot. It was kind of exhilerating to present and I think it helped a lot of my classmates', as well as, my own confidence in front of adult crowds. ",1
"Gives Good Notes, Lots of online Homework, Preclass quizzes also online. Tests and in class quizzes can be a little tough. Overall a good choice. I struggle in math and recieved a B.",1
"Very knowledgeable and approachable. Two tests, provides you the topics you research the answers and then provide answers in your own words. one presentation and it was on a topic you choose. She makes the class fun and interesting.",1
Very strict professor AVOID him.,0
"I love Professor Swartz. He is probably one of the best professors I have and ever will have. He was always there to answer questions, but instead of just giving you the answer, he makes you work for it so you learn. Sure he grades tough and he is not the nicest at times, but I learned so much about Chemistry and Chemistry Lab from him.",1
"Super nice and caring, very approachable. Quite a bit of group work, often overlaps which can get overwhelming. He's a vague with his project instructions. 1 midterm, no final, 1 group presentation, 1 group paper, 1 group bargaining exercise, 15 discussion board posts/accompanying reflection paper. Do the reading/watch the videos and you're good.",1
No Comments,1
Mr. Wilbrandt truly understands how to teach the current generation. He uses relevant examples in his power point slides and is great at relating to every student. I visited his office hours several times and he was always looking to help. Class is not mandatory but he gives bonus points for going on random days. Best teacher I have had at Auburn.,1
"Dan is an awesome guy.  He's very helpful with ideas for projects.  You definately want Dan for studio, great prof.",1
"Jon is the best English professor at Shawnee. He curses quite a bit but class time is really fun. There are a lot of in class writings but it made me a better writer. He grades your essays light, but with good comments to help you improve. 10/10 recommend Jon, he truly cares about his students and will help you with anything.",1
He is good,1
A great prof thats like to teach and is very helpfull.,1
"Dr. D'Sa truly cares for all of his students and it shows in the way he teaches and makes sure that everyone understands the material. Unlike most classes, he actually relates the content to real life. There were 3 easy tests, a final, 10 short homeworks, and a short case study.",1
Mrs. Clark is a very dedicated professor and I can tell she really cares about the students success. I didn't pass her class the first time I took it because I didn't show up much and didn't do most of the homework. I dicied to take her again because she was a really helpful teacher and I'm passing you just have to do the work,1
"Wonderful teacher and very set in her political views, but still understanding of other peoples views. Also very helpful and will help you with making up assignments, or fixing your grade. Overall loved her class and would take one of them again!",1
"Prof. Miura is probably the easiest teacher I've ever had. I had him online, so his lectures were incredibly boring. I probably missed half of the lectures (he didn't take attendance), but I just go back on Panopto and set the lecture to 2x speed and I'm fine. 0 quizzes, 4 homework assignments for the whole semester, 3 exams, including final. EZ",1
"Great professor. More personal than most, and really gets to know you. Interactive and keeps the class moving. No need to watch the clock",1
one of the best Education professor . I take 2 EDU class and I would like it again.,1
"This class is pretty straight forward and easy if you do the work. Weekly quizzes with all answers in the book, test werent to hard but reccomend studying a little before taking them. Weekly videos that are short and easy to watch. Occasional discussions. Nothing in the class is too hard everything can be done. Really nice and friendly teacher !",1
"Amazing, intellectual and inspirational.",1
"You go to class listen take really good notes because his powerpoints have only pictures. Study guide has 25-30 words and 3-4 essay questions to study. You must know date, definition, and how it relates to history. Really easy. A on both midterms so far and a B on essay 1. I go to his office and he answers every questions clearly.",1
"She is really hard to understand on her video lectures. Also, she often times works on the homework in her video lectures and gets the question answers wrong.  That's worrisome. She takes forever to upload her video lectures. Really nice person, but not the best professor. If you don't like doing HW and quizzes last minute do not take her. ",0
"Lois is a great teacher, I wish I could have her again for a political science class. The class was easy to understand, I would say the only hard thing were the essays for the midterm and final. If you go to class, cite your work and try to have an open mind you'll pass.",1
"You need a book for his class, he asks you stuff from it everytime, attendance you lose one point everytime you don't come, overall he was easy, 6 tests all together, one study paper 3-5 pages, he has a good sense of humor, and overall it's an easy class, its basically common sense, i got a C, but I know if i studied more I would of done better.",1
"I won't lie: professor Lowi is a pretty hard grader, and she gives a large amount of reading.  Nevertheless, she is extremely smart, and knows a ton about politics.  Also, she really is a nice person.  All in all, her class is quite challenging, but I enjoy it and am learning alot from it.",1
"Great teacher. Explains things very clearly and is willing to help anyone outside of class. Material was hard for some people, but if you pay attention during class you should have no problem. He also gives lots of extra credit, I ended up getting over 100% in the class.",1
"The best professor I will probably ever have. I personally had to change to P/NP, but if you do your work on and over time, you shouldn't have to. The class is hard, but Vutha makes it really easy to understand and he's very open and easy to access. He has reviews before every quiz and exam and is always willing to answer every question. Test heavy",1
"I love having him! He's always very chill. His assignments aren't worth a lot individually and are usually pretty straight forward, but they add up! Make sure to keep up with them. Very easy to get an excellent grade in his class. He reminds me of a teddy bear too lol but that's beyond the point. Would recommend!",1
"Professor Hurley is the quite possibly the best teacher and best person at Massbay. A solid portion of class is spent on him telling hilarious jokes and life stories, and he still manages to cover all the material with time to spare. 2 take home quizzes, and 2 exams, all of which are open book and are a breeze if you've kept up with the homework.",1
"This guy has placed me on the path to success in the TV/Video industry! The most helpfull person in the school. I cannot believe anyone who takes honest critique from a good teacher a problem. If you are one of them, drop out of school, and allow the rest of us to learn from him!",1
"Amy is such an amazing instructor! She is very flexible and understanding. Amy makes sure her students do not have any unanswered questions/concerns. I LOVE her classes, and look forward to having her as a professor in the future.",1
"The professor had many students that found the material challenging and does not try to explain the material thoroughly. I attended his office hours and even that was useless. He told me because Im not doing so well, that I should try again next semester with a smile on his face. I would not recommend taking his class unless you already know the m",0
"This guy is totally cool....if u get the chance to have him, youll love him.",1
"Professor Willmore is fine at teaching, but the amount of assignments we have online (during Covid-19) is ridiculous. She cares more about the specificities than if youre actually learning the material. You can definitely tell she cares, but I took her class in an extremely difficult time of my life and she was less than understanding. Id skip.",0
"Her lecture isn't necessary to attend. She really just confused me more than anything. Go to the review session the week of the test and she'll tell you everything you need to know. Plus her tests are online and open-note. She also offers a lot of extra credit. She's nice and helpful enough, but I got by on just her review sessions.",1
"Awesome instructor. Very understanding and helpful. Makes learning Accounting easy if you listen sharp and ASK QUESTIONS. Isn't big into tests, and cares about what students are learning. Funny, but doesn't suffer fools gladly. His lectures are down to earth and easy to understand. Worth taking F2F class rather than online.",1
"I had Mel for British Lit and Detective Fiction. I'm at WSUV now, but let me tell you- I MISS HER! She is one of the best professors I've ever had and I really wish I could still take her classes. She's an awesome woman who's a blast to be around and really knows her stuff. I learned more in her classes than I have in any other English course.",1
"I believe she is the best teacher. She gives so much good feedback and resources to help out. The only issue the material used to learn online. The material is very dry and hard to understand, making the homework harder. Thankfully she does provide other resources to learn.",1
"His class was the best online class I've ever had and I've taken alot. You do have to do the work but his grading is very fair. Even though it is an online class, he is friendly and gives you feedback on your work which I appreciated. He did have different due dates for assignments but it never changed which was nice.",1
She's a real gem. Loves to joke around. Allows you to have a note card as a cheat sheet on tests.,1
"Couldn't ask for a better teacher. Clear, helpful, gives Extra credit and down to earth. What more can u want?",1
There is nothing that is needed to said about her beside this --> TAKE HER AT ALL COSTS. She is the best professor I have had in college so far and truly cares for her students. DJB for president!,1
"Dr. Keeling is one of the best teachers at CNU. I have taken her for both children and adolescent literature. She. Knows. Her. Stuff. But while her knowledge on the subjects is fantastic, her real gift is facilitating class discussion. Nothing feels forced for the sake of participation. You will walk out of each class having learned something new.",1
"Difficult, but worth it.  There is real insight to be had in the lectures, which are highly structured.  Contrary to popular opinion here I found him to be pragmatic if he found the majority of students hadn't prepared well for class, in that he could adjust on the go to ensure clarity.  If you can dedicate the time, take his classes, it's worth it",1
"This teacher was not very accessible. Her answers to questions were not clear, and I had to have her clarify most of the time. Since it was an online class, I could read other students' frustration with the same issue. She also took a long time to reply to questions.",0
"Class consists of 5 discussion boards, 4 quizzes, midterm, and the final exam. There are 3 agency reports you have to get done by the end of the semester.",1
"Dr. Mueller employs a workgroup, experience based, workbook method in Ochem. It does not work. He doesn't teach. The class is absurd. I am getting an A in the class but only because I study the book and other professors notes. You do not learn much in class. He also comes over quite arrogant.",0
Professor Mazzouri is great!!  He is patient and makes it easy for you to understand.  Make sure you attend class and complete the webassign homework.  If you have questions he will take the time to answer them.,1
Awesome,1
"Very easy class. Tests are easy, presentations are graded easily. I love the way he spoke although half the time I didn't even listen. Great class though, you can learn a lot and it's an easy A.",1
Prof Smith is very good at guiding discussion in her fiction courses so that feedback from other students is actually helpful. Tough on grading. She expects the student to take charge of their own involvement in class and you get out of it what you put into it.,1
"Great professor. Absolutely loved his course. Was an honors seminar, so a lot of reading and writing. Really understanding and caring professor who only wants you to learn and succeed in his class. Make sure to participate a lot!",1
"I've had Dr. Searfoss twice, and I like her. She cares about her students and brings food to exams. This class is not easy; you will have to read and study. Exams are 80 % of your grade. I did very well, but I read, studied, and did homework. Wasn't bad for me. Overall, this class is alright, and I like Dr. Searfoss.",1
I had SOC201 with Hallett and this course was a small class and was project based. We got into groups the first week and the rest of the semester was working on the project with a little bit of homework. The material was not difficult and her lectures and notes were helpful.,1
Li is SO nice and very knowledeable!,1
"Good prof for Religion.  Took online, quiz and writing assignment due each week.  Midterm and Final are both essays, which combined make up most of your grade.  Reasonable grader, and pretty clear on his expectations.  I would recommend taking this class with him.",1
Fred definitely kept it interesting . I actually remember some philosophy 30 years later.,1
"Dr. Viriasova is very clear with what she wants. The amount of papers is daunting, but (I can't stress this enough) go see her during her office hours. If she knows that you're putting in the effort and want to succeed she will help you succeed. Even if that means writing papers early, it will pay off. Her extra credit assignments definitely help!",1
"Great prof, extremely smart and wants students to learn. Hard course, but interesting. Also, to the other commentator, cheating is ILLEGAL and immoral, so it would make sense a professor would be serious about it...also, your Mrs Doubtfire comment is tasteless and offensive.",1
TAKE HIM for macro IF CAN!!!!,1
"The best Poli Sci professor I've had at State. The way he synthesizes his lectures and the readings into the course material is unreal. Lectures are engaging and interesting every class! Tough grader on the papers no doubt, but beyond the papers and attendance, not much else work-wise. TAKE HIM!",1
Monica really cares about her students success. Course content was difficult but she has a way of making the class fun and lecture easier to understand. Take her if you get the chance,1
"Prof. Wike is a very knowledgable prof! however, the material is not as easy to grasp if you aren't an education major. The majority of the class gets B's. If you're ok with this, take the class. Lots of reading, but overall GOOD class! 3 quizzes, 2 papers, a group project, and a final!",1
"Overall a great teacher. She offers so much extra credit its impossible not to get a good grade. The content itself is really hard, but she understands the struggles that we go through as students and is willing to talk.",1
"This class is hard, but it is extremely rewarding. Dr. K does everything to help you understand what you are confused on and he is ALWAYS around---seriously. A great professor to take a course from and a great person. Go to class.",1
"Fran is a wonderful person- very helpful and nice. Because of this, the difficulty of her classes can be underestimated.  I took orgo with her and thought she would be easier than Terry, who is wonderful but definitely a hardass, but she was harder.  She's really accessible and understanding if you go to her with questions though-",1
"I took an ELI course with Professor Parker and she was extremely helpful. It's not an ""easy"" A, but what part of college should be? It's math and it requires some learning. She is responsive and explains things so students understand. I'd take her again in a heart beat.",1
"He is such a great professor that I would swallow anything that he offers, and I mean anything.",1
"Special Topic: Discrimination in Language. Barrett's first year at UK. Very knowledgable about social linguistics, has done research.  Kind of quirky but once again, can explain everything pretty clearly.  Tests not that hard, gives study guides.  Group project at end of semester. Hands out lots of dittos for you to follow in class, helpful.",1
"Turkovic is one of my favorite professors to this day. His tests are only essays, but he gives you unlimited time to take them & gives you all the information you need to get an A. He makes you think and that is the whole point of his class. The only history class I've taken that encourages you to connect the dots not just memorize facts.",1
"Terrible teacher! He made everyone in the class hate math. Worse teacher ever, if you have the chance to choose do NOT take him. He thinks he is funny, and his jokes suck.",0
"REALLY funny, savage but respectful, very funny, super easy to talk to, very understanding, genuinely interesting (it is honestly hard to be bored during class), amazing speeches",1
"This was a great  animation class. Kathleen's demos and lectures were inspiring and she really cares about helping everyone to achieve their best results. She's an animation pro and knows what it takes, is willing to share her knowledge and skills, our school is lucky to have her. Grading was fair and feedback was  always kind and helpful.",1
Liebling is the BEST lab professor you can get. I missed 2 labs and he still gave me an A. VERY understanding and goes out of his way to accomodate your needs. The field trip is definately worth the extra credit-- and so are his drawings!!,1
"Jon is a very funny and witty guy. He understands that his classes are generally required for a major, but with little relevance, so he tries to make the class as engaging as possible, with several opportunities.",1
I took the adv SummerA  6 weeks long. We did 3 chapters a week- watching 3 hours of lecture per ch. & doing a hmwk & a quiz for each ch. HmWk took me about 2-4 hours each you can redo them to. Quiz took about 90 mins each. Prepare to spend 15-20 hours a week for the adv 6 week course. Great lectures! Responds to questions. Do the work and get an A.,1
"Either you will like him or hate him.  He is a good guy, you can always get help in turner labs.  The computer lab monitors will help you.  Just make sure you show up for class on time and don't miss the class!",1
Unable to understand him. I would say you should go to class because every once in a while you get important equations necessary to do well in the class. however most of the time he spends the entire class teaching the unnecessary theoretical ideas of topics. find a tutor for this class and pay attention to recitation otherwise will fail. ,0
Dr. Lafferty webcourse was a great course in Public Nurse. I would definitely take it again. She wasn't too verbose in her explanations or did she inundate you with extra information necessary as this could be receive as fluff trivial. I don't need trivial information. I need info that will further my knowledge in nursing that is applicable.,1
"Dr. Grange is very intelligent and is a well respected financial planner.  He wants his students to succeed which is why his course is so difficult.  Listen closely, because he has really dry humor.  Make sure to read the book and go to office hours.",1
Very approachable. 4 homework's and 4 tests. Take this teacher!,1
"Great professor and grades very fairly. As long as you do your assignments, its an easy A.",1
"prof. Hartman is one of the best professor I've ever met. He's really inspirational, gives a great feedback and always help you. Take a class with him: you will learn a lot, especially on how to think.",1
"Logan is. He is efficient, most organize, yet flexible. He plans out the whole math course very well. If you stick to his schedule and practice your home works and study guides you will do well. He is also very kind and humble. I enjoyed his lectures especial his professional personality so much that I never miss a single lecture in his class!",1
Reisinger is the best French prof I've ever had. She's a hard grader but is always willing to help and tries to make class interesting. She gets to know her students and is friendly.,1
Best prof ive ever had at ust. lets you out early sometimes and makes time fly cuz shes super funny and nice. teaches you what you need to know and does not waste time teaching unnecessary material. does everything in her power to prepare you for the tests. if you need to get span requirement done with take her ,1
Prof Regan is the definition of teaches by the book. Homework and classwork assignments are direct readings from the book. He speaks very clear which makes him easy to understand. He also calls on random people during review to get see who does and doesn't understand the work. Test are not overly difficult but require practice(HW and CW) to pass.,1
"Erin Griffin is hands down the most incredible professor I have had.  Always helpful, extremely brilliant, and knows exactly how to articulate complex information in a way that anyone can understand.  Her exams are taken directly from her power points and she is extremely organized in lecture, and the lab.  I highly recommend this professor!",1
"want an A? listen up. For lec exams (3 + final) study off her powerpoints! Use the book, hw, or reviews for extra help IF needed but don't rely on just these. For lab exams (4), study off EVERY display that is out in lab (take pictures!) and study off her interactive ppts. take advantage of extra credit (& attendance points) or you'll regret it!",1
"I enjoyed Dr. Krueger's online compensation class. I would definitely take another course if she offered it. 5 tests, one group project at the end and a few discussions. Very manageable workload, she set clear guidelines in the syllabus and was always responsive to emails. Great professor.",1
"For a level 100 gen-ed class , she treats the class as if it's a level 400 class. I had more work in this class then in my upper-level major courses. There is little to no clarity on what is expected from you and the materials that are needed. If you need help, don't ask as you will only be ridiculed for asking. Godspeed to all who take her course.",0
"If you are a favorite then you will be allowed to make your own rules, if you are not, then you better get it right! If you are not experianced in art...DO NOT TAKE HIM! b/c you are teaching yourself and then getting in trouble for what you did wrong",0
"She is a sweet woman but a very tough grader. She is big on punctuation as well. During the summer there are 3 quizzes and 3 papers. She has like 30+ years of writing experience and grades you like you should too. She is accessible out of class, but she'll briefly read papers and mark very differently when she grades you.",1
"She obviously did not want to be teaching the course, her attitude to the students was dripping of condescension and a lack of respect.  The material was interesting but presented slowly and the class was often unbearingly boring.",0
Awesome professor! She makes learning  fun and is always there to help her students. I recommend anyone to take one of her classes.,1
She grades attendance. Need to present a few times. We had one test and the final was a group presentation which was easy.,1
"Ryan is hilarious. He gives his very honest and blunt opinion on EVERYTHING. Homework assignments are easy As'. Go to lecture because he doesn't post them online. The tests are half lecture/ half book and pretty simple. He grades group projects harshly, but they are more about the concept than the presentation.",1
"Your average try-hard adjunct professor at first..  Teaches off of ppt's  and justifies it with essay test questions. But he is very spiteful. I received A's and B's throughout the whole semester, but when I had to make up ONE test for a family trip, he made sure that I received an 89.4 for the course despite my effort. Pass on this bitter old man.",0
Schuster rocks the power point.  I saw he has a beard now.  It does not rock.,1
"3 exams - 50% from lectures, 50% from online quizzes. The online quizzes were not hard, in my opinion because you could find the answers ONLINE! The exams were kind of hard though. No use to go to the lectures because he posts the notes online, but he makes a big deal about it when he sees that no one is coming. He's really knowledgeable though.",1
"Can't work ahead, which is super annoying, because I could have been done in three weeks. Simple stuff! Overall: take if you want an easy A.",1
Did not seem to show much enthusiasm in teaching her class and gives large amounts of homework with out properly explaining the lessons clearly.,0
"Dr. A is a very passionate professor. She grades fairly; as in if you don't put in the work, you won't receive the grade. If you aren't interested in the class then you may not like her, but she is a great teacher.",1
"There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. I took the summer course for this online class. It was really hard to keep up the work. My suggestion is getting help from the tutoring center.",1
"Took Eng 114 and he's a really great professor. Pretty easy, finishes class early all of the time. Essays are easy and relatable. No final and optional essays at the end that help boost your grade. Super great class and never rushes students. If you need to re-edit your essay last minute, he gives extra time with no penalty.",1
No Comments,1
"She is kind. The way she grades is terribly forgiving of missed assignments (drops the lowest score of one quiz, one exam, one deliberative democracy, and the clicker question formatting is forgiving as well). Easy to pass, but an A is something you need to have dedicated study time for. She is easy to follow and sticks to the slides for grades.",1
Very specific with requirements and expectations. Tells you first day of class she does not require attendance but informs you that you will not pass if you do not attend class; specifically lab.,1
"He is very helpful, and make sure that you understand before moving to another problem.  He does have early morning meeting it wouldn't be best to take in the morning.  If he miss a lot of classes he still give you the material even though he haven't went over anything.",1
"Terrible. Unclear lectures, exams too long, no sense for basic things like class prereqs/posting homework solutions before exams, talks too much about how simple the concepts are/how everyone should get them (several times/lecture). Homework was lectures ahead of us conceptually more than once. And all this was *before* classes went online.",0
I personally hate this class. The layout of the class is Horrible.,0
"Since this is an online class, the large amount of reading and discussion posts were expected, however, I did not expect to receive low marks on every discussion post. On every post she comments for me to ""watch my grammar"" but fails to give clear examples. Her expectations seem so high that they are unreachable. 0/10",0
"If you show up and actually try, you'll pass with flying colors. She really had trouble with using canvas properly (like making our weekly course overview as an assignment) and by the end of the semester, I had about 10 missing grades. Other than that, she was ok, but I didn't enjoy the class.",0
"He does a good job, is helpful, and easy to get along with.  He expects the students to carry their own wieght.  I guess that must make him bad.",1
wonderful woman a descent class,1
He is super funny and talks about his family all the time. Make sure you read everything he tells you to read. You need the text book,1
Professor Aragona executes her lessons in the most organized and straight to the point ways.. She's an amazing professor who offers her assistance and makes contacting her very easy.. I've taken several classes with her and strongly recommended her as a professor!!,1
"Birxy, 48 year veteran on campus. Understands Canisius politics and who to avoid. Grooms you to be in the same league as him, above every one else!",1
He is simply awesome.,1
horrible teacher. ,0
"I really wish there was a tag option that says: DOES NOT CARE. I reached out to her several times throughout the semester, received a response 1 in every 5 times. She doesn't care about her students whatsoever and an all around horrible professor. The idea behind her extra papers is fine, but she gives you nothing to go on. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
"Great guy, awful subject. The class isn't easy but it isn't hard, plus he's fun to look at. 10 quizzes, and very test heavy. You just have to study, and he bumped my 88% to an A.",1
"Loved Mrs. Hutton! She cares for her students and their success. However, she makes you work for your grade, HW every night and tests about every 2 weeks. The tests are very confusing; they are filling the blanks (10-15) & 3-4 short answers. Other than that I loved her personality & the way she teaches to the point Im now taking Special Ed with her",1
my favorite professor so far. lectures are long lots of class time just talking can get a little boring but def worth it.,1
"Hes pretty funny and give good detailed stories in his lectures, the class is really just notes you get 4 test and no final and get to drop the lowest grade. Theres no homework and no quizzes no classwork either. its quite nice",1
Me. Nelson was really nice and he was very respected by students. He understands you're situation if you're late and his class lectures are interesting. It was a pretty easy class and I would definitely take his class again,1
"Took her for lab.  Big mistake, she was all over the place. Did not cover material well at all. Most of the learning I did on my own. She seems smart and well informed however, maybe should practice how to teach a class.",1
Not a very helpful professor... but not horrible. There certainly are worse professors. I feel neutral or indifferent toward the class and professor.,0
"Allen is a cool guy, lectures really boring though he just talks the whole time hoping somebody will ask a question. Gives a few exams that are blue book style but pretty clear and fair. Assigns four books but I doubt anybody reads them he explains them in class. Decent class for a GenEd easy A.",1
"She is the best! The sweetest lady you will ever meet. If you just pay attention, show up, don't break he rules, and do the homework you will get and A. Take her!",1
"Dr. Watts is a very kind, passionate professor who wants students to develop and advance their writing skills. It was a joy to take her class. She introduced interesting lecture topics and encouraged classroom discussions.",1
"When he gives you the rules, give them back to him exactaly as he asks for them. Do not get fancy. He prepares you for the bar, you need to pay attention. IRAC is everything in this class. DO NOT- skip the read and brief portion of the class.",1
"If you are looking for an easy A, don't take the class. She is an amazing teacher who prepares you for future medical programs. I would say this was the one class that I actually learned from. She will go above and beyond to help those that want to learn, but if you don't to learn, don't bother sticking around.",1
Expects a lot but is really knowledgeable and you will learn a lot from him. A bit tough but fair.,1
"Hegner is really more than what I had expected after checking rate on this site. She makes class very easy and interesting, let us go early (almost 30 minutes everyday).  I wanted to take her again, but she is not gonna teach ACCT 311.  I can say that who do not learn from this class, cannot learn ever.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED professor.",1
"Some of the movies required to watch are fantastic films, while others are unbearably boring but are usually short anyways. If you are thinking this is a class about cinema, turn away now. It takes examples of the setting of movies and goes in depth of the real life sociopolitical aspects of these settings. Boring class, okay professor.",1
"I have taken other courses on human rights, and after taking this one with this professor, it became clear that the other courses were taught by amateurs. This course will change the way you look at the world. Do not graduate before taking this course!",1
"Funny helpful passionate. If you want an easy pass or need a study sheet with everything that will be on the exam, take another professor. Goes through chapters quickly, go to office hours if you need help. Ppl that didnt do well either didnt understand or were just trying to slide through. If u need ur hand held like a baby, Lamkin is not for u.",1
"The majority of your grade is made up of tests, but don't let that scare you. Professor Newcomb prepares you for them, and the reviews he gives out for the tests are extremely helpful. He is an extremely fair grader, and you should be able to leave his class with a good grade, even if math isn't your strong suit.",1
"i took her summer class and so every week we did a report, and we had homework everyday. its sooper doable but you have to do all your assignment in order to keep your grade up. but shes very nice and very friendly and will make the class intresting.",1
"No textbook, all readings were online. Lectures can get boring to some. Very detailed and encourages discussion in class. No midterms/final, just 3 papers and SONA. Follow the grading rubric and you should be fine on the papers.",1
"Took him for lab and he was a good professor. His notes are easy to follow and he draws lots of pictures to make things easier. He's always willing to help you but he doesn't always respond to E-mail, so go and see him during office hours. The final powerpoint project was easy and interesting. Defintely take him for lab!",1
"If you want to keep a healthy state of mind, stay away from him. he expect you to know everything. in class very easy examples to solve, on the test, nothing similar to the lecture.",0
"I can't stand all these FIN majors trashing Ted Kim (I am ACC/FIN). Not the best at explaining things, but caring and will try his best to help you. So many fools in my class waited until the last minute with the project. If you wait until 3 days out to complete a 40+ hour project, you will be in trouble. It is not Ted's job to force you to work.",1
My kind of professor. Always ready to listen and help. My only headache with the class was too many weekly assignments. I just couldn't cope attending classes and working two classes. But the professor understood my plight and worked out alternative deadlines for assignment submissions with me.,1
Good Class. Great Teacher!,1
"Hard class for no reason. Great professor, but for the exams there is barely any time to look it up in your notes or in the readings. ALWAYS writing for this class. If I didn't have to take this class for my major I wouldn't. Liked this class at first a lot, until the first exam. Good luck.. it's so much not useful, non applicable info for PT.",1
Best professor I've ever had. He's very clear and consistent. He has a lot of knowledge of the field and is an amazing teacher. He gives great feedback which helps you improve in the future. He is more than happy to give advice if you are interested in pursuing a job in the criminal justice field. I will take any class he teaches in the future.,1
The written portion of the exams will be those random videos during the lecture so if you didn't remember it you probably won't get a good grade on that. The multiple choices are usually easy as long as you study. He made you buy Packback and MyEconlab which is also kind of expensive in total. But it's not hard to get an A if you study.,1
"A unique theologian with a modern process theistic twist. Tests are usually just essays but he grades well. Very inspiring, eye-opening lectures. A passionate guy with a good sense of humor and heart.",1
"This class is tough.  Homework is no cakewalk either.  SHOW ALL WORK ON TESTS, I didn't and paid the price.  Seems like many students did very poor on the first exam, below 50%.  You just got to work hard and ignor him if he is talking down to you.",0
The most interesting individual I have ever met in college! Intelligent and charismatic in every way possible. The best professor I have ever taken at USC oR anywhere. Hes intimidating but loves his students.,1
A great and fun class really helps her students get over their fear of public speaking tests are easy doesnt have time limits on speach only upto 5 minutes would take her class again.,1
"Really great professor, one of my favourites. You print out his notes from the D2L page, and you write answers and notes on them in class. Amazingly simple format, I do wonder why I haven't seen other profs do it. Go to class. You actually do stuff, and it helps a lot. He also gave old midterms to study with. Would take again in a second",1
"Really really nice, easy to talk too. every teacher should be as approachable as she was.",1
Does not seem to understand the material during lecture times and does not go over the material to make sure you understand. Not the best professor!,0
"Obviously a very smart man, but he showed up to lectures late more often than not and was unprepared for them the vast majority of the time. Taking this class over the summer with him was probably a bad idea, considering the pacing and that he was hardly ever available outside of class.",0
"His class is not for ""average"" CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you're forced to take him, Good Luck!",0
Class was so easy grade is based on tests only pretty much and the one easy project. I didnt even read the book and still got a's on the tests,1
"I took his MATH40 online course and really enjoyed it. His videos are clear and concise, and so are his expectations. Participation in the forums is mandatory but he responds more often than not and is quick to respond. I plan on taking his MATH60 course as well!",1
GOOD,1
"Really great class, I actually learned a thing or 2 and would recommend it to everyone. There are only 3-4 exams but she provides a study guide. There are 4 speeches but theyre all really easy and she even helps with the outlines during her office hours.",1
"My other absolute FAVOURITE prof McGill!! A MUST take :) It was genuinely the most rewarding class I've taken in university. She is *so* invested in her students and their work, I can confidently say that taking her class changed the way I approach research and write academic papers for the better. I would take her a 3rd time if I could!! A+ prof!!",1
Professor Crowley is really good. Only those students that say she doesn't teach obviously don't go to class and or don't pay attention and try to focus on their phones. She's got tons of field experience actually doing mental health counseling. She just doesn't lecture theories she's lived it. Very good class!,1
"Dave is one of the funniest professor I have ever had, but still has a handle on the class and on the subject. I look for his name every class I take to see if I can have him again. A must take professor!",1
"Mrs. N is a native speaker and definitely knows Span very well, but she is a PAIN. She has many unnecessary rules that she will not negotiate whatsoever. The Span dep. is using a new book this year that is truly AWFUL. The online homework is full of errors but she will still not give you any extra points to make up for these program issues.",0
"I had him for my horticulture lab 161. He was amazing, especially since i don't care much for plants. If you took notes and studied them for the weekly lab quiz you would do really well. He didn't do any trick questions and you could understand what he wanted clearly. I passed the lab with an A and the whole class with him and Smith with a C.",1
"Cramer is very passionate about what he's teaching. This is a hard class and requires good note taking, attendance, and focus. Super nice. Interesting class.",1
Okay first of all YES Allan has a GREAT review. Does that mean taking his class you automatically will pass ?? No!!! You still need to study and do the Hw even if it's optional! So many students took this class and wasted seats hoping for an Easy A. If you're lazy take a different prof that will push you! If you're LAZY don't bother wasting a seat!,1
"Qualls is very interesting and insightful in class, but grades with a vengence. He is an extremely hard grader at writing. Overall he is a good tracher and a good person, but this class is not for slacking off.",1
Worst WRC professor  ever. never explains always talking about random stuff. doesnt grade essays untill 2 months later. avoid her at all cost. her ratings were higher when i checked they must have been bs.,0
Sure there's a lot of reading and the papers take forever to write. It could always be worse and how else would he be able to test students in this class? Have them read a bunch of research papers and give them a multiple choice questions? He's not a hard grader and is very professional and caring. Overall it's an easy A if you do the work,1
Though he is a nice person I hate his teaching style. I prefer teachers to teach us the material in class and then go home and read over what we learned about in the book. He expects us to read first and then he skips around the chapter without really talking about any topic. He grades hard and doesn't give very good feedback either.,0
"3 main stories you have to write, 2 blog posts which is part of a group project, a mini-newscast (easy) and quizzes make up your grade. Nan is a very tough grader but really makes you work for it! It challenged me to be a better writer and I learned so much. She knew what she was talking about. Overall I loved this class, just be prepared to work",1
"the only teacher that gives multiple choice exam on science subject, no partial credit of course.",1
"I literally learned nothing in this class. He only talks about himself and is very narcissistic! I got A's on every quiz,essay, and the final and yet he gave me a B! He makes up his own grade for you. If you're major involves social work or sociology do not take him because you will not be prepared for other classes. Easy but does not grade fairly and you learn nothing!",0
This is an online course.  The semester is over and there are still unanswered e-mails that need a response. Not a good communicator at all.,0
"Her lectures can be pretty vague - often they are based around literary-philosophical concepts such as 'form' and 'nature' that are not very well-explained. As a result, it can sometimes feel like she is talking in great detail about something that nobody (even the TA's) have a grasp on.",0
"I really enjoyed his class. He is so far the best math teacher I've ever had. He makes sure you're on the same page as him both in class and outside of class. All of his assignments are on mathlab and as long as you understood the material in class, it'll be easy. Fair amount of hw, quizzes and tests. I would most definitely recommend him!",1
"He seems that he has a lot of information, takes his time in the lectures, side tracks a lot.  He has good stories, but he really doesn't get to a point. Attendance was not mandatory because it was an iTV class but you had to email him the homework. He DOES NOT collect the homework AT ALL!!! the quizess were okay. but i won't take this teacer again",0
she is just great!!,1
"Great Guy. Easy class IF YOU DO THE WORK. Have to show up or you WILL fail. Easy and laid back guy. His T.A. was a great guy too. Class was easy and group projects as well. No quizzes, tests, or anything. just homework due each week. Meet once a week which is nice. Willing to talk and tries to help to the best of his ability. Wants to see you pass!",1
"Professor Landrum is an amazing professor. He teaches you how to truly view a film. However, be forewarned, you will read an entire book each and every week. You will be quized twice a week. You will also watch the novels adaptation every week. An 8-10 page essay along with a group adaptation is due right before your final. Do not fall behind.",1
"The qusis are onlain, and also, she gives lot's of extra greed.",1
Extremely lazy.  Worst teacher I have ever had.,0
No Comments,0
You should not take HUMAN101 as an online course because you will not have enough time to absorb the material covered. La-turner had no problem letting the students know that he did not like teaching this class online. I think if I had of physically attended the lectures I would've enjoyed it.,0
Awful. Not recomended. Too much reading for 3cr class. Books expensive. Feedback either harsh or just not helpful. Getting an A but didn't learn anything. Isnt even teaching sociology. Teaching philosophy. Actually hurts my education since I now have to teach myself classic soc theory (which is what I paid for with this class).  Never taking again.,0
This professor treats students as adults. If you do not go to work you do not get paid - so go to class! She provides a Ruberic with every assignment so you know exactly what to do to get a good grade. She is caring and understanding.,1
Professor Dunham truly wants his students to grasp the course. He is respectful to his students and does not hesitate to answers questions with clear and simple explanations. It is as simple as doing the work and you will get the grade. I would definitely take a course he was instructing again. Thank you Professor for caring.,1
"Soh is a great teacher. While she is so knowledgeable in language development, she is humble and personable. You get to work with kids using robotics in addition to other reading and writing stuff. I would recommend her.",1
"Terrible professor. Wants students to communicate with him, when you do, if you are incorrect or reflecting a difference of opinion, you are berated in front of the class. Goes off on irrelevant tangents for lengths at a time and then complains that the class is so far behind. His study guide is in his own verbiage so it is difficult to research",0
"Amazing class, I learned in 5 weeks what many teachers struggled getting through to me over multiple years. I've become confident in my writing and actually enjoyed homework for once.",1
"One of the nicest professors I have ever had. She is so kind, so fair, and really wants to help you as much as possible. Her grading criteria is extremely clear. Some have been picky about her toughness on APA, but she is transparent about that and gives you all of the tools to help. Take her, seriously. She is really, really sweet.",1
"First half of the semester is a few books to read and a review on one. The rest of the semester is a 20 page paper. Also, include a short presentation on the paper towards then end of the semester. Do not wait until the last minute. He is very respectful and is intrigue on the research that goes into the papers. He heightens your knowledge of hist.",1
"I liked Dr. Stoner. His lectures were clear, but there's a quiz at the beginning of every class. I wouldn't say it was the most interesting material. His exams suck. I think it was the final that there were multiple choice questions and THREE essays you had to write. He was a tough grader on my term paper too, but he's ready to help if you need it.",1
"If you enjoy hearing the word ""um"" incessantly, this class is for you.  Prof Miiler is a terrible teacher.  Don't let her nonsense critiques of your papers fool you...she honestly doesn't know what she's doing.  If I were you, stay away!",0
"EASY class...all you gotta do is read from the book, tests are straight forward and simple. Theres writing assignments but they are easy because the book helps alot. She is very nice and understanding. I liked her alot and had her for two history classes.",1
"This is my first review on this site. The professor was THAT awful. Take my word for it and DO NOT take this professor. If you are thinking of dropping his class DO IT NOW, I regret not doing it. He's awful at teaching to be frank. He does not explain the topics well. He will write out answers without showing steps or explaining the foundation.",0
"This class was just one big group project. The hard part is collaborating with your fellow classmates to create a study. But Buchanan tries to make the class fun by making jokes and creating power points that make it clear what he expects you to do in your study. Overall, I would take another class with him.",1
DO NOT TAKE. She replies to concerns but Im warning you to not take this course with her. Honestly the hardest Ive ever taken and constantly felt stressed. Does not give you more time to finish work and does not give any considerations at all. Had to pay for 2 platforms which is really pricey! Just dont take it and do yourself a favor!,0
Worst professor I ever took this semester I'm failing her course at the moment and I don't know if I could still pass! Very disorganized and difficult to pass I will never take her again!!,0
"Rachael Smith was my favorite teacher this semester. She gives out extra credit, provides study guides, lecture outlines (which really help with the fact that she doesn't use visuals during lectures), and the TAs set up study sessions for students to help prepare for exams. i will say that she does grade the papers pretty harshly",1
"Mrs. Sundberg refused to accept my final paper, although it was complete in full, which granted me a 42% overall final grade.",0
She's very enthusiastic about teaching. She encourages everyone. She's very respectful and she's a great teacher. She thinks outside the box. She was different from most professors and that's what I liked about her.,1
"Dr. Smith does assign a lot of homework, so if you dont want that in your life, pass. But, the homework was for the most part incredibly easy and took about 10 minutes every time. Her lectures are great and she likes to have the class talk in her lecture. She has exit slips every day, so be sure to show up!",1
He was very clear. The testing was fair. This doc is sexy.,1
"I have had Dr.Kelen in multiple English classes and have had great experiences with her as a teacher. Her classes aren't exactly full of energy, but she has a wealth of knowledge about anything and everything you want to know about English literature and composition. She grades tough but that's to be expected in a college classroom.",1
Brother Fawcett was a great teacher. He was understanding when I completely forgot one assignment. I know he would not allow you to miss a lot but he was understanding of the one. He also asked me to send one again when the file came over in the wrong format. He is not like most professors that are heartless and show no mercy.,1
"Great professor, really knows what he's talking about, and really passionate about what he teaches. He tends to enjoy telling stories, but he's really interesting to listen to.",1
Best english teacher in ASU.,1
This man makes my life worth living.,1
"Amazing teacher, he knows his stuff. Hes the type that wants you to succeed. He will tell you life stories that will help you in all aspects of life, not just your career. Definitely take him. Sit at the front and listen as he will give you golden nuggets.",1
"HORRIBLE! I could not wait to take Spanish but after her class, there is NO WAY that I am taking Spanish 2. This woman cannot teach. Talks a lot yet says nothing. If you aren't willing to eat,breathe and sleep spanish 24 hrs a day,then don't take Fletcher's class. This is THE ONLY CLASS you will have time for.Don't do it.Take Sign Language instead.",0
"I agree that Dr. Childs does NOT know logic. If you have her for a logic course, I advise you switch, she makes it more difficult than necessary.",0
An amazing professor and even better person. So interesting. He made me think about things I would have never considered. Loved him and his class.,1
"Tough grader, not helpful at all. Class moves very fast pace. Unless you are already familiar with accounting do not take this class. She expects you to know what you did wrong.  I think she has been teaching to so long she forgets some people are new to the accounting field.",0
"ECO300 Lecture was online while there was an in person lab component. The class consisted of not a lot of effort from Bremer. You basically read the textbook then did a module which ended up being 4-8 pages, and they were due every Sunday. He would then give exams maybe once a month online. The exams were given without feedback from the HW",0
"He is very nice, love talking to him. He will never fail you if you put efforts. also funny. Will let you make up papers. usually 2weeks per an essay. He helps you with intro, body and conclusion. try to get all 90+ on his paper, you will not have to take the final. Very understanding, will not mark you late.",1
Mr. Smith was a very good instructor.  I was  not looking forward to taking Chemistry and had put it off as long long as I could but he ended up being a great instructor.  He made the course fun and enjoyable.  Even when he had moments of b mad scientist.  He's super passionate and really wants his students to succeed. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM!,1
"This guy teaches the class as if we're professional accountants. He moves way too fast, tip-toes around ?'s when u ask them, he is very stuck up and condesending. The material is hard enuff without this fat idiot speeding thru the material and making u feel like an idiot when u ask ?'s. He also sweats alot during class,do yourself a favor AVOID HIM",0
I passed this class without learning anything. Prof does not respond to emails in under a week and takes weeks to a month to post grades. This coupled with errors and unclear information in chapter notes etc makes it seem like she doesn't know enough to teach or simply doesn't care about her online classes. I am disappointed that I paid for this.,1
"Unfortunately, this is Dr. Strange's last semester teaching, so this doesn't really matter. However, he's an awesome professor! Hands down the most knowledgeable in the field of fisheries. His lectures are entertaining and relevant. He always has funny stories that make the information more relevant to your everyday life. Truly inspiring!",1
"Good professor, but felt like I did not learn much reading, but learned how to follow directions instead.The class is easy though as long as you do the work you should pass with a B. I would take her again.",1
Great instructor... loves to teach... you can see that in her lectures.. very knowledgeable.... some test take home... but are tough... that's ok because... she is a great motivator...,1
"Lisa's class was very interesting, and she made all the assignments relevant to the field.  She was not very clear with any of her instructions, however, and she confused you even more when you asked for clarification.  She is very knowledgable in her field, but has a hard time teaching that knowledge in a classroom setting.",0
"Professor Hafey aka ""Chaz"" is an awesome math instructor and very easy going. He really cares about his students & will help you out until you understand the problem. I struggled in math until I took his class. The way the class is taught is helpful because you start slow then speed up the difficulty. By far the best math professor I've had!!!!",1
"She is a very good teacher; she teaches well, is fair on assignments, and is always punctual; however, she is not the nicest person.  Very mean and condescending.  I'd take her again, but I would not make contact with her outside of a classroom.",1
"After grading essays, he doesn't point out the mistakes you made. He expects you to use your rubric and compare it to your essay to find your OWN mistakes. Letting him review your essay before the due date does not always help. barely learn the correct way to write at college level. you are basically teaching yourself. A VERY TOUGH GRADER!!!!",0
Excellent teacher who knows her stuff well.highly recommend to anyone,1
great guy would take him again really wants you to do well the final prestation are fun even if you do not like to speak in front of people,1
"She assigns a ton of work. She is a nice person, but the comments that she leaves on your papers are pretty rude. She can come off as condensing.  There are so many papers and they must be incredibly detailed. She is a ridiculously hard grader. Like she grades you on participation (only professor I know that does that)  I suggest avoiding her.",0
"I know the bad ratings for Stone; I was in the class with no curve. This is my honest opinion-the class can be passed, even with an A, but don't have any other hard classes because you'll need lots of study time. I didn't get lots of study time, but I studied without believing in a final curve, so I got a C- That curve is not assured, so study.",0
"Very accessible, knowledgeable, laidback, and clear. Provides outlines, study guides, and extra credit. Take him.",1
"McGrath was awesome. He's down to earth and has a reasonable expectation that we be there at every class. He's incredibly knowledgeable about artists, especially in the contemporary art world, and is full of information if you just put forth the effort to ask.  I learned so much in his class, including where to see art in Saint Louis. Plus he's hot",1
"Such a great prof! He genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. Explains things clearly and is open to any questions you may have. His tests are very fair, if you go to class and do the homework you'll do well",1
Professor Favara was an extremely caring professor. Her assignments made her expectations very clear and she always provided good feedback.,1
He is the best math professor I have ever had. Would highly recommend choosing him does not require textbook and does not assign homework.,1
Professor Wu is very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching his subjects. He makes sure that every students understand the concepts. He is always there to help when you ask for it. I learnt a lot from his class. If you make an effort to read his notes and do his assignments while listening to class  you will perform well.,1
"Ala is amazing! She gives ample extra credit, is very clear in what she wants, and just wants to help her students succeed and learn. I am so grateful this was my introduction to physics. I am leaving her class actually liking physics and excited to learn more!",1
Really easy. Gives chapter outlines that are all you need to know. Textbook Used for a paper and as a good study material.,1
Don't take this prof. unless you want to have your mind blown. He uses subatomic particles to change the laws of physics in class. He also hypnotized me and made me believe that I was a real student and not who actually tried and did the homework and that helped me get the grade I earned not given. I had to do the work for once in my life.,0
"Prof Jones is so awesome in every way. He is fun to learn from, kind, caring, easygoing, and interesting! His assignments are totally doable. He's so smart, but not arrogant. A real professional, great teacher.",1
clearly he is writing his own feedback on here. sitting in front won't help. going to innovation lab or slc was only way I could understand it. not helpful. kept saying right... like everyone one understood what he head just said and the room sat there confused and shaking heads as he kept talking... get ready to hear him talk nonstop...,0
"If you completely understand something, you will be confused once she explains it. She never finishes a thought, and is completely unclear. She is not too tough in the grading though, but get ready to teach yourself. ",0
"Great lecturer.  Even if you aren't interested in the class, you will be by the end of it.  Lectures are very organized and tests are very straightforward with no tricks.",1
No Comments,0
No heavy work. Make sure to reply to at least 6 or 7 students in discussion posts to get full grades. There were two multiple choice exams. It is an easy A class.,1
"Great teacher!  Online class:  I thought it would be tough to communicate with her, but she responded quickly and was always very helpful.  I would take other classes from her.",1
"Almost 100% sure you will regret taking her. She is the worst teacher I haver had in all of my schooling. She doesn't respond to any of her emails or texts. She also grades with her eyes closed, she is very inconsistent and does not provide explanations. She will give you 100% on the first half of the test, and 0 points for the rest. Horrible.",0
"Professor Gerencser was a very engaging professor who encouraged class discussion. He was definitely a tough grader, but fair. He was always happy to answer emails or meet to discuss your papers. Even if you are not interested in political science, this is a great course to take since it engages you in a lot of critical thinking.",1
"He is absolutely brilliant and expects such brilliance in return. His assignments are challenging and though his marking is difficult, it is fair considering what you are able to take away from his lectures. The effort he asks of you as a student will benefit you in all other English classes. You will walk away from his class feeling accomplished.",1
"This professor literally reads off of his powerpoint and does not teach or explain anything in any way. By far worst professor I have ever and I highly recommend that anyone taking him to get out immediately and switch classes. Otherwise, you will be spoken to like an imbecile and will be teaching yourselves throughout the entire semester.",0
"The entire class is based on 4 papers.. 25 points each. She's very helpful and makes the class interesting. I recommend taking her if you want to get an A grade, But she DO NOT accept Late work.",1
"Great professor and easy class. Although it was an online class, we had zoom sessions and he had guest speakers. Amazing lectures and extremely helpful professor. Easy class.",1
Terrible person. lot's of HW. Does not explain the materials.,0
"Every chapter has a discussion board, a quiz, and short writing assignment. You don't necessarily need the book, just use google. Unless you make the effort to learn you won't really learn. Its an easy A with a little busy work, you have about two weeks to do 3 assignments just for the one chapter.",1
Not bad. Very enthusiastic about her work. Does not take criticism well. Tests are not hard. Takes marks off of assignments for no particular reason. A new lecturer that still has room for improvement.,1
"Although no textbook, Tons of readings. Could not finish his sentences all the time, but his sense of humor helped a little to make the class interesting, and can't forget his funny gestures. Kind of a tough grader, really have to study and put work into essays.",0
"I had Dr. Orser for Short Fiction.  I loved the course and I really liked her; however, not get fooled by her sweet old lady looks and charm, she is an extremely tough marker so it is next to impossible to get an A. ",1
"The lectures are all but required in order to pass. There are frequent pop quizzes, and only two tests. The class is hard but Dr. Palmer is really nice.",1
"Professor Rice makes this lab very difficult. She grades very harshly, and also waits forever to post grades, leaving you in the dark as to how your doing. Professor Rice gives poor feedback on assignments and is not very flexible/understanding.",0
"Totally incompetent.  Will spend 10 minutes giving an example, only to realize she did the whole thing wrong and have to go back and re-do it.  Totally useless topic and I can't believe people actually devote their lives to studying it.",0
he's nice and helpful. the subject itself is hard but u'll do fine as long as u READ the book and do the exercises he assigned.,1
one of 3 best in my 5 yrs of education,1
"Do not take Spanish 101 (5 week course). I get its suppose to be a lot of work because its cramped but Id recommend if you have to take a language, save it for the reg semesters. teacher gives out an absolutely insane amount of work.. everything is in Spanish.. even expects you to write full convos in Spanish by the first week. No Beuno! Lol",0
"Two Exams + final totaling 80% of grade. Very tough class, but Dave is a great person. I probably would've done a lot better had I gone to get help from him outside of class and read the textbook. Nonetheless, make sure to study important concepts, and work problems over and over. Dave often forgets to upload homework so remind him, practice helps!",1
"Best Prof I had so far. She will literally spoon feed everything you need to know, her PP and lectures are great. You can get an A in her class by just reading her PP and supplement, she goes over cases, but they are not on any tests. Its all black letter law... Very Thoro, even a take home essay...",1
"A Professor that truly cares about the student understanding the course work, though the style of class is not the most modern. Very eager to help out. Stresses early on that doing work out side the classroom is the key to success, be it with him in his office one on one or in a group setting",1
"He would give a list of terms to know which took about an hour to look up, but then none of them would be on the test.  A lot of tricky questions on quiz and upon asking, he would give a BS answer and then knuckle under and give me the points like he was doing me a favor.  Death by power point lecture. I had a 89.6% and he gave me a B anyway. ",0
"She is amazing! It was my first time learning keyboard and I'm considering making it my minor now. Class is fun, lectures are clear, and the professor and tutor are in sync so they are very helpful. She gives handouts and assignments for each one. Extra credit is easy to earn and she's super sweet. Definitely a good choice",1
Never available to get help from.  Grades are based off of midterm and final only.  He didn't even know my name!,0
No Comments,0
"Don't really care for Finance, but I think he makes the topic interesting. There are no surprises on his exams. Although he is not the easiest professor, he is clear-cut with his explanation and willing to help you. If you study hard, you can do well. Do NOT buy the textbook. He posts homework online and his notes in class are all you need to do we",1
"She's obsessed with Ireland.  That's all she talks about in the spring semester, before her annual trip.  If you have a problem in the class, go outside and grab a stick. You'll get more assistance from it.",0
"If you are going part time and are interested in the subject matter I would suggest her. However, for the many students who work and are taking on a full course load I would look elsewhere for your Poli Sci credit.",1
Very chill teacher! His way of explaining things is funny which makes the class not so boring. Super easy class if you do the homework! Simple questions on the tests. Take him it's a for sure pass!,1
"such a nice guy!!! by far the GREATEST teacher for stats, which can be unbearable..he makes the class moderately interesting and is a really great guy! take him over the others!!!",1
"Great professor! He cared more about making his students good business managers, rather than making us memorize useless information. It was an easy class and very entertaining. Take him if at all possible. Again, he is a great professor. Tests are open book too!",1
"3 papers that are graded pretty hard, but exams are online and really easy if you use search and find in your notes. Lecture isn't too bad, kinda funny and interesting.",1
"This is a hard class - make no mistake. You need to attend the lectures and pay attention (most lectures were attended by less than half the class which is part of the reason for the terrible scores). Work the homework problems multiple times. And buy the HP calculator, it's far easier than the alternatives (I tried both).",1
"Horrible Teacher, only reads from the text book and expects too much from people. To give him a bit of credit, he does give us simple homework..at times. His test are also both True-False questions and are always open book. If only he gave a better description he would be a better teacher.",0
Professor Bonner is by far the most amazing teacher I've had. He always makes sure everyone understands the sections he is teaching and was always very helpful when needed. I feel like he truly wants to see all his students succeeded and is very caring. He also has such a great way of teaching and I have referred him to many people. Best teacher!,1
She was one of the most helpful professors I have ever had. She goes above and beyond to make sure her students are clear on everything. Take her whenever possible!,1
"I loved professor Lhota! She is so kind and helpful and is with you every step of the way. All you have to do to get an amazing grade in the class is to show up, do the work which is very easy. We had 3 essays all semester. The 3 essays are supposed t be 4 pages long but she believes in quality over quality. Overall an amazing Professor!",1
"At the beginning of the WWI course he guarantees you an A if you follow his rules: read books, watch videos and attend class.  He doesn't use Blackboard, return emails quickly, or return homework with feedback.   You won't know how you are doing until he gives you your final grade.   2 exams, 1 homework assignment and 1 extra credit opportunity.",1
That Class helps me to remember the basics on Math i leaned before. The quarter was good. Thanks for the teacher and Classmates,1
very very helpful guy.. if you dont understand anything;just ask him.. he goes over and over again and makes you understand.. not coming to class is suicide.. homework and quiz question are similar to exam....take a good notes..and pay close attention to his lecture... i learned a lot from this class.,1
"Easy class, barely went and passed with a B .",1
"Caring professional, but extremely difficult to keep up during lecture. Comes across as if unprepared and her dry method of facilitation does not help. She has conflicting information on her syllabus and seemingly is using a previous version of text and material; confuses students. Highly encouraged to avoid this professor.",0
Dr. Kendris is one of the best professors I've ever had! He is so sweet and truly wants you to succeed in his class. The textbook is a must because you will use it in every class and homework usually is online. Quizzes and tests aren't too hard as long as you understand the material. I would 100% recommend him!,1
"Professor Whitney is a very good professor and I highly recommend her. Sure, she goes off task a bit but in the end if you read and follow your notes you will make a good grade. Other than that she will help you with anything regarding psychology you need even after you're done with her class. One of my favorite teachers I've had at HCC.",1
"If you want to get an F take his class, Prof. Dhan makes you read a lot if you want to pass. If it's your first time taking physics at college you won't pass. IF YOU DONT SHOW UP YOU WONT PASS. I tried so hard to pass but I couldn't.",0
Professor Miura is extremely vague when it comes to lectures. He only skims through basic information rather than developing detail for the material he is teaching. Be sure to do all the work possible outside of class because he will not be specific during class. This was a lab course and it wasn't as detailed as other courses Ive taken at Loyola.,0
"Cool, funny guy. Very willing to help. Might have to do one presentation about a recent art movement. Tests are pretty easy: multiple choice; plus, there is a section that requires identification of famous art pieces. Pay attention to lectures slides because he makes the class fun with informational videos. Knowledgeable of modern art scene",1
"She's an awesome teacher. She's Very caring she really makes sure you understand things so, make sure to ask questions! If you ask for helps she gives it to you and also gives you feedback. English was always a little difficult for me to wrap my head around but she really helped me. Wish I can take her for English 1! doesn't give to much.",1
"Have taken a course with her before (3806), she is a fair grader. She is strict on APA in this course. Her APA differs slightly, so always ask for clarification beforehand. Her examples are not always what she actually wants! Ask an overachiever friend to borrow a book for the assignments. I only used it twice. Be sure your citations are correct!",1
"Literally one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Adviser for ECE degrees. Very experienced, down to earth and helpful. Great online class, loved the field  placement I was in (got hired there, partly because she is well-known in the early childhood community here and her good reference helps) and yeah, really a great person.",1
Really nice. I had problems with the TA marking unfairly and she read my essay and put it a grade up. She is very approachable and fair.,1
"Amazing professor! This class is SO EASY to pass if you just show up to class and take notes, which isn't a drag because the lectures are super entertaining.",1
"Math is not my strong suit, but she made me want to change my major to Stats. Her class was so organized and reasonable. I would 100% take her again, if you are taking this class because it's required for your major, take hers. She gives you cheat sheets on every test, but you need to go to class to know what to put on your sheet.",1
"She is supper hard grader, and also she cares but if she dose not get your work on time no chance to give it to her. She is pretty mean.",0
I love this man. I too creative writing and he kept it a fun atmosphere by just speaking like a peer would. The reading quizzes were a bit difficult but I failed them all and still got a B. Pay attention to syllabus and syllabus day- he will NOT remind you of assignments that are due.,1
"I've gone out of my way to take all of my math classes with Prof. Stein. He goes very in depth with his lectures, but tests on the basics of the material. As long as you put in the minimum effort, you could get a B easily. With a little extra work, you'll get an A. He cares about his students' performance.",1
"Great guy who can correct the other profs. He can be funny and laid-back, but he also knows how to teach. Unfortunately he only teaches one third of the class.",1
Talk about needing to get out of the past,0
"Probably my favorite professor at this school. She actually cares about our busy schedules and makes sure that we always have the bulk of our homework to do over the weekend. She lets us dictate what we discuss and doesn't say if one interpretation is right or wrong. The books that she picks are also very diverse, which gives new perspectives",1
She is the best professor I have ever had. The class was quite hard but she made it so easy to understand and interesting at the same time. I've learned a lot from her class. Love her professionalism passion. She helped me out with the project outside class and replied to my emails very quickly. I would love school if all professors were like her.,1
"Functions like strict math HS Math teacher. Math teacher who""speaks math""& doesn't turn math terms into real explanations. If you're a proficient studier you're good,but if you need explanations or to ask questions chose someone else. Not a prof for you if you don't feel like a math person or like you don't grasp well on your own.",1
he is very helpful if you take the initiative to ask for help.  his exams are VERRRRRRYYY difficult-he makes them that way so you'll actually learn.  tricks you. read the material and come to class religiously!  if you miss a day get the notes from a friend AND go see him in his office.  this is definitely a class you have to stay on top of.,1
"Professor Hegbloom has no respect or sympathy towards her students. She is rude and if you email her, don't expect a response until midnight. She does not provide you with any necessary requirements for assignments she requires and expects you to know the information without teaching a single thing. I do not recommend her to anyone. She's horrible.",0
"He is so confusing the way he teaches class! A lot of reviews say he's scatterbrained; that is completely true. He assumes you know everything he talks about & unless you ask questions, he doesn't really address things you want to know. Assumes you know everything & relies on you reading to learn, he doesn't have lesson plans. I don't recommend.",0
Enjoyable class.,1
Hes ana amzing professor. Keeps the class usper interesting and knows exactly what he is talking about. He keeps it very real. Hes very good!!,1
"He made all lectures interesting, class enjoyed participating and working together.",1
"Prof. Shields is hands down one of the greatest Professors I've taken. He's really passionate about his work and gives amazing feedback. I took his winter course so it was really fast paced with tons of movies to watch and notes to write but it was really enjoyable, especially completing the creative assignments. Also, his quizzes are not too hard.",1
"I never feel bored in his classes. He is the most exuberant person I have ever seen. (plus, he has a pair of beautiful blue eyes)",1
"Bob was an amazing professor, with a vision unlike any other. His dazzling smile made class all the more interesting & his enthusiasm for life bled into his enthusiasm for teaching. He allowed me to be as creative as I wanted & to fulfill my dreams of incorporating painting into my writing. After this class I would consider him a mentor & a friend.",1
He should be a literature lecturer in stead of a science or engineering lecturer. He keeps using fancy words and tends to make simple concept complicated. His teaching is very disorganized. 50% of the questions given in homeworks are not learnt or practise before.,0
"Helpful, easy, but takes his time grading assignments. A bit disorganized and unpredictable when it comes to posting assignments. Knows his subject, but teaching style is a little oversimplified and more suited for a high school classroom. Keeps students engaged and interested. Not enough tests per semester. ",1
"The best lab teacher I've ever had. He's a cool guy and very helpful. Very thorough and makes lab interesting (which is hard to do considering I have no interest in this class, it's required.) More than willing to help you out on assignments and fast at responding to emails.",1
Loved her class. I have taken her 3 times already.,1
"Dr. Ryner will give you your monies worth. He is an interesting lecturer. His test are difficult. Make sure you are prepared for grad level expectations. He is not messing around. It was hard, I am hoping for a B, which is rare as I usually get A's in English, but a B from him is an A. I am unsure if I would take him again, but I learned a lot.",1
"Ridiculously easy class. Show up and pass. He took attendance every day and most of the time we got credit for the projects just for being there. Unfortunately the professor who dictated the class was very disorganized, so several times Mr. Lee had to give impromptu lectures without the PowerPoints or lessons. Gets off-subject a lot, rambles.",1
"Highly suggest for her Freshman Experience Class, she tells you what you need to know without an excessive amount of work.",1
"Where do I begin with poor miss Thompson... Boring lectures, shes always complaining about how hot the classroom is, too serious, and she doesn't like when you ask questions during her lectures. TAKE ONLY IN MAYMESTER OR SUMMER!!!",0
"In the beginning she seems like a nice,good professor but the whole semester we did nothing, I learned nothing, struggled with quizzes and tests she let us take home because we did nothing in class, can never get ahold of her out of class, she grades stuff late & I felt I didn't get the grades I should have. Nice lady, but should not be a professor",0
Great teacher. interesting lectures. the text book goes along with the course perfectly,1
"So brilliant, knows theory like no one else.",1
"Dr. Woodard is a consummate professional - though he needs to loosen up with the uptight rubrics and all. That said, his expectations are the clearest of any prof I've ever had and his use of class time is splendidly varied to accommodate   various learning styles and adult attention spans!",1
"This class was great, very interesting/informative. I took it online. We did use the textbook but it's a short read. This class can be done in 5 or 8 weeks. The discussion boards and web article questions were thought provoking. Quizzes were short. Syllabus is self-explanatory. You can work ahead. I would take Dr. McLawhon again.",1
"Great guy, great lectures and best course for the semester",1
"Terrible Terrible Terrible. I strongly suggest you do not take her. She marks unfairly, she takes forever to give papers back, she always plays the victim, says she wants to help but offers no help when it comes to your exam. Terrible!",0
Marvin is certainly the worst professor i have ever had! do not take his classes they are terrible and he is a aweful teacher. i have never rated a professor before but he is just to awful to not.,0
"I had her for lab, I did not learn anything from her. If i did not have an amazing lecture teacher i wouldn't of passed BI121. lectures are all linked to personal stories from her life and job of being a nurse. Took test from different professors, so wasn't diligent on grades. Says spelling doesn't matter but will take points away if spelled wrong",0
"I had Sander for Bio 108 lab. Extremely tough grader and not clear on material. She is not very clear on feedback. While she is a very nice person (I liked her personally but not professionally) I would not have her as a lab instructor again. On a positive note, she was very willing to help during non-test labs.",0
Great prof. Teaches well and knows her topic.,1
Kathleen is an amazing teacher.  She will come around and critique your drawings to make you a better artist. Portfolios are very important so take them seriously. She has a lot of experience so take what she says to heart. Loved this class and her.,1
"As long as you do your work and prepare for class, he is a good teacher.",1
"One of the nicest lab instructors I've had. However, she's VERY harsh with marking. I studied like crazy and still managed to only get a B+ in the lab portion for this course. Despite her harsh marking, she provides crystal clear explanations and instructions in class, is very approachable, and is very respectful towards students.",1
"Dr. Baltodano was by far my favorite professor at FSW. Not only did I learn more about American Government, but I left feeling excited about things like voting. He genuinely cares about you and your grade. If you can, please take his class!",1
I would not take this professor if you are really wanting to learn biology. He gets off topic very easily and his notes taken in class do not correlate to the test. He takes attendance at different times during lecture but if you leave early will change it to show absent.,0
Easily one of the best professors at UB. Be ready to read a book a week and discuss but he is very open to interpretation and is a class act in all regards.,1
"My 8th online class-4.0 GPA. Worst prof. by far! Description of 8 wk online course: Step 1) Read the book. Step 2) Take 4 exams. Step 3) Write 2 papers(7+ pgs each) AND 8 pg group project AND write & give 5 minute speech. She told you which book to buy, graded papers & then zip. What about using the internet to show exs/clarify topics? AVOID AVOID",0
"She is a great lady. Tough grader, tough all around, picks unheard of literature and expects you to be an expert, but then dumbs it down for class. I think only 3 of us passed the midterm",1
"Dr. Lim is a very nice guy, but a very mediocre professor. He never derived a problem from scratch for us and instead just scrolled through his notes which looked like alphabet soup. We all had to teach ourselves by doing the homework and reading the notes. Many grades were saved because he leaked the final while we took it, invalidating it.",0
"""Politics of Past and Future"" one of the most unusual, different courses I have had. It introduced me to an entirely new set of views on society and politics. How leaders use history and future thinking to justify what they do. Readings are ""not the usual suspects"" including Freud, Sade, science fiction, movies, music. Take this if you can",1
"Dr. Palmer is clearly passionate about his field, but sometimes he struggles to convey it to the students clearly. While the material taught in Sensations and Perception was very intriguing at times, this class requires you to do all of the readings and come prepared for frequent pop quizzes. Pop quizzes, midterm, and final are your entire grade.",1
"Had a wonderful experience in this class. At first, I thought there were too many homework assignments. With time, I enjoyed both the readings and the do it yourself projects. Nice professor. Always helpful, but makes you work really hard.",1
"Professor Antonetti is great. He does a phenomenal job of clearly explaining all the material. If you review all your class notes well before the exams, they are easy. The textbook is not necessary at all. Also, if you need extra help you can email him for practice problems that are helpful. His lectures are funny, he always tries to crack a joke. ",1
Does not answer emails. Late grader. Not a good professor.,0
"The class but the Professor will assist in anyway that she could to ensure that you pass the class.  Don't give up!  Do what is expected and you will pass.  Don't be shy, email her if you don't want to speak with her prior to or after class and she will respond everytime.",1
"Hes very rude. Will take off points over the littlest things. Has no filter. Dont know why hes a professor. He has a big attitude problem. He likes to put students on the spot. Will grade you on your participation. Dont even bother taking him if you have things going on in your personal life. Hes inconsiderate. Also, good luck on the essays.",0
"Wonderful! All homework and quizzes on my accounting lab (like mymathlab) with easy ""help me solve this"" solutions. Miss Errico will help you do any HW probs you need help with. Two tests, you get very similar practice tests to practice on. There is one final paper, I got 100%, just do your research and follow instructions. Don't miss assignments.",1
Wow I can't believe he's still using that damn workbook. I was in the first class he ever used that thing. It was useless then and it sounds like it still is.,1
I can't speak to her lecture abilities because this was a hybrid class but she was a great professor. She was very clear about her grading and what was expected of you when. The class was super organized. She tells you the first day if you can't dedicate several hours to studying per week you should drop the class.,1
"Try to avoid him. The class is lecture heavy so if you skip you will be lost! He never tells you what is on the tests. In class you will learn mostly math, but the tests are all conceptual short answer. His tests are harshly graded because he is very picky about what he wants. Print the slides and write on them as the notes. Write down everything",0
"Always be prepared with homework because she will randomly collect assignments. Homework can be pretty time consuming, but it is beneficial. My listening/speaking skills improved drastically this year. She loves participation so always try to participate. Quizzes and exams aren't too bad if you study and understand the material.",1
"Professor Kenneth Leung is a great professor. Class was never boring, always made us laugh. Homework was super easy and he was always willing to help students. HE DOESN'T LET YOU FAIL! If you are stressed, sick, etc, he will let you take the test when you want, where you want! I recommend the professor!!!",1
"Amazing professor. Uploads lecture videos that are informative and easy to follow so you don't really need the textbook. 6 class discussions, 3 homework assignments, 3 exams. Easy and straightforward. My favorite class by far.",1
"I thought he was horrible, i also thought she was the worst and mean teacher ever there, she thought she knew everything but in reality she didnt know a thing. if you dont have to take i wouldnt take her if i were you.",0
"Dr. Stephens's class was the hardest class I had in the semester. She doesn't know how to work a computer very well so her handouts are hard to read and understand. Her directions are unclear! It took me an hour just to comprehend what she was asking me to do and I still didn't do the assignment right, but neither did the majority of the class.",0
Great Business law class. Highly recommend this professor,1
"Mechatronics was a lot of hard work. If you put in the effort, then you're almost guaranteed an A- at least. The class is very haphazard though. You're pretty much left by yourself to figure things out with a little help from the TA and the professor. Don't take this class if you have no prior programming knowledge.",1
Sara was very straightforward with what she wants in lab reports. This saved me time last quarter since I still had to study for the lecture portion of biochem. Take her if you get the chance!,1
"Her grading system made it difficult to see where you are on grades until it's too late. Harsh and slow grader. Her general HW grade and Attendance grade seems made up and not based on anything but her opinion. She expects a lot from you, cancels class often and expects us to be understanding of her but she is not understanding of the student.",0
"Not a good teacher, hard to get into contact with and gives huge amounts of homework.",0
"Really seems interested in the material he teaches. Incredibly helpful if you talk to him and willing to answer questions in lecture. Makes heavy use of the text, but will answer any questions you have about. Really laid back and awesome. I would recommend him any day, as long as you are willing to due the readings. Awesome professor!",1
"Always ends class early, very easy lectures, extra credit is offered, and she allows you to have a notecard on exams. There are several homework and in class assignments but they take no more than twenty minutes to finish and are always explained well. Gives ""study days"" where she cancels class so you can ""study"" which is cool. Great Prof.",1
Great!,1
"Dr. Ayers is a really down to earth, but smart guy. You will really learn a lot about starting a business in this class, and he is very inspirational. He is not a tough grader. If you put in a good amount of effort, you will probably get an A. The group project is definitely doable.",1
"He expects you to read and will often give a short quiz (usually 4 or 5 questions) over the material. Personally, I just read sparknotes or shmoop and I got a pretty decent grade in the class (it was a B or A, I can't really remember as I took this course last spring). I would definitely recommend Osborne to anyone!",1
Mini Term B. Class was difficult because of all the packed info for the 6 weeks. Out of 5 exams drops the lowest grade. Lectures are all over the place; studied straight from PPT for the exams. 14 labs/drops 2 - labs are easy. No research paper.,1
"She's enthusiastic about poetry, shes wonderful and draws you into the subject. I really didn't have an interest in poetry to begin with but i enjoyed taking this course with Kendra",1
"Professor Murphy is easily sidetracked and very disorganized. Our class was unable to cover even half of the material intended for the course. This caused many students to not take the class seriously and become rude and disruptive, making for a bad learning environment. The final grade was based on a total of three assignments.",0
"Randal was an okay professor. Easy subject, however, all he would do is read from the power point slides or show art history videos. If attendance was not required, I would have only shown up for the quizzes and tests.",0
"Her class is not suitable for beginners. The instructions for assessments are not clear. The focus points on each class hard to follow. Unreasonable time management for each project. Hard to communicate. Useless feedback. When you ask her a question, her feedback is not what you asking, her feedback is what she wants to say, and this is not",0
"Like someone else said, show-up and try, and you'll pass. You also learn some pretty cool ninja skillz.",1
"The man knows everything about CAD, which is awesome.  But he likes to have you solve your own problems so if you're struggling with something he'll referr you to the text sometimes.  Good though for first year students because he takes you step by step through everything.",1
"Dr Jasmin is passionate about organic chemistry. He mumbles a little, but he is very clear in his explanations.",1
Why are they still letting this woman teach?,0
"I love how passionate he is about his field. It makes his class so much more interesting. He tends to get sidetracked, but its still interesting.",1
"Dr. Clasen has not impressed me. His ""lectures"" are just him reading slides. He was responsive at the beginning of the class, but then he just disappeared. Lots of assignments; it's a summer class so it's 3-5 ch/wk and no feedback on any homework and rarely on tests either. YouTube is a better teacher!!! He does give extra credit, which is nice.",0
"This teacher is great definitely take her! She'll give exercises in class to help your understanding and she'll go through them afterwards, in class. She's accessible outside of class for any questions. She grades participation, as long as you're there, you're fine! She has quizzes every few weeks, but if you know you're stuff, you're fine!",1
"Extremely knowledgable about all things biology, nice to a fault, and will do anything to help you succeed. She is the best professor I've had. She teaches you with a medical focus in mind, that only magnifies the importance of some subjects. She teaches more material than will be on the tests, but it's always in the student's best interest!",1
"Most of the coursework is the workbook activities and discussions. There are few assignments youre being grades on, which makes it easy to do them on time but if you dont do them your grade will suffer. The quizzes are fairly easy as well, so overall the class should be easy to get a good grade in.",1
"This class is a nightmare.  She is very bad at explaining abstract concepts or presenting the ""big picture."" The only thing more useless than the lectures is the textbook.  It will take a LOT of outside work to do well in this class.  She is VERY nice, however.",1
"I honestly hated this class due to the overly-difficult and dry material, but DJB is one of the best professors I've had. She's so funny, tells awesome stories in class, and is extremely dedicated to making sure you have the help you need to get through the material. The one thing I didn't like about her class was that she cold calls intensely.",1
"Andrew is willing to give help and explain what you need to do to make an A on a paper. Lectures are boring (but what english lectures aren't?) There are 4 total papers throughout the semester and the final paper is the easiest one to write. He cares a lot about his students, would definitely take him again.",1
This course is good. you will learn many thins about Object Oriented programming out of it. There will a project work and midterm and fnal.,1
"amazing professor, excellent study abroad opportunities",1
"Really cares for his students and will go the extra mile for anyone of his students. He's hilarious and makes you think about things from a whole new perspective. He expects you to do quality work and actually tries to help improve your writing skills. Do yourself a favor and take his class. Great professor, even better person. ",1
"Pretty cool guy easy class. Two open book test, small paper like half a page,and a group debate. Pretty fun overall he has an accent but that's easy to get over definitely take his class. :)",1
slightly crazy but hilarious. have to read multiple novels but overall fun as a teacher and loves movies/tv shows in class.  not much work involved,1
"Great Prof!! keeps everyone interested, easy to sit through!! Tests aren't the easiest",1
"Professor Anderson is an average teacher. His pros are that he shows some interesting videos in class, gives study guides, and explains the readings pretty well. His cons are that he doesn't teach as much as you may like for a philosophy class, has quite a few absences because of his kids, and it sometimes isn't clear what readings were assigned.",1
"Clearly Explains all the readings in great detail, but overall is extremely dull in class. Not very good at grabbing students' attention and makes it difficult to stay focused for a long period of time. I definitely would not recommend taking this if it is the 1 hr 45 mins class- it is too long and difficult to sit through at one time.",1
I wouldn't recommend this professor. She demands the class to be very conversational as it is a mandatory factor of every class and your grade. She's very strict as well when it comes to due dates. She gives extra credit but it truly doesn't factor into your overall grade much so it's useless. I felt like I wasted my time taking this class.,1
This course is quite time intensive but that is expected of a language course. The course was very enjoyable and the students really got to interact with each other. Professor Yue was always ready to enthusiastically help any student and answer any questions about the course or other subjects related to the course.,1
"This man is one of the best teacher I ever had. When he was teaching, it was just like he was typing down everything he knows on my brain. Great teaching style. Provides extra helpful sources. If you put yourself in, you will get it.",1
"Very smart man, but his teaching style wasn't for me. Very strict and assigns a lot of work. You can't miss more than 3 classes or you fail. He is very passionate about Spanish and will help you, but I did feel like he could be rude to some of the students in our class. I probably won't take him again if I can.",0
"One of the best classes I've ever taken at UNT! I was in the accelerated 2040/2050 course and myself, professora and all the other students became like a big happy family, that worked really hard!! You must study, read, go to every class, get involved and work very hard. If you do all of these things, you will do very well. I already miss everyone!",1
"Very good teacher. Expects you to read. Her lectures won't give you all the answers. Very interesting class! Do the homework! Not only are they worth points but your time as well! I actually learned from it. Very nice teacher. Participate, she loves that and it helps you remember the lecture. Do the reviews! And READ! Trust me. ",1
"very nice professor. helpful. a little scattered at times, but he makes it up to you by doing things like canceling the final if he realizes theres not enough time ect. very reasonable prof. as well as grader. :)",1
"Mr. Gallegos provided everything he could for students to really explore the jobs within the major students wanted to do, as well with majors for students based on their personality and morals. Gives homework, but its so easy. Just fill in blank get it from book gives you 2 weeks to complete. lectures arent heavy there very fun.",1
Dynamics was rough for me. Dustin is the reason I survived. He is able to explain things in a way that make sense to almost anyone. His course layout is the same no matter what class you take. He tells you up front what it takes to pass the class and provides a straightforward way to do it.,1
"Sincerely hope no-one ever has to get this prof ever again. He is quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  Refuses to actually help students, belittles students, and is very sarcastic.  He should, without question, be fired.",0
"I hated this class so much, I withdrew. I have never withdrawn from a class before. He did the same thing every class- talked in his boring, single paced voice from start to finish. I took notes all class, every class. I would read the chapters and go over by notes and still fail. He was a tough grader & very specific about ONE PAGE papers.",0
Great teacher really recommend,1
"Thoroughly enjoyed his section of class. His lecture notes were great, had all the information you needed from what he was saying. All of his assigned reading is online, never more than 15 pages a week. Would reccomend him to any person.",1
Just took my first exam-studied for 10+ hrs and got a C! She is great in lecture & really holds your attention with a lot of examples & explanations. This is just a hard subject & I will be working hard for a B in this class! Study her slides like the bible & ask lots of questions. She really cares & is very approachable! I highly recommend!,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. She expects you read more than hundreds pages before every lectures. Her lectures is the most boring I had ever have in UW, also the most unclear. I don't understand why UW would hire her. She is not even community college level professor.",0
"Sometimes, I want to purposely get into a car accident to avoid his class. The workload is extremely heavy... although its just copying but beware lab reports. Bless your soul if you have him. But outside the classroom he's dope, he's a great dude.",0
Gives Excellent notes on overhead. Was able to refer back to them. Stayed on a schedule. Combined with the Hawkes program and Diane Stralka I really enjoyed the math class. I feel very accomplished after leaving her class. I wish she could follow me through the rest of my math classes. Highly recommend.,1
"I thought CMST would not be that hard at all. This teacher makes it 10 times harder than it should be. Her quizzes are outrageously hard even if you study for them, read the textbook, and listen to the podcasts. She talks WAY too much she usually only gets through a slide per class. She is a tough grader. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER",0
"Good teacher. Doesn't give too much feedback on the course work. Had to write a few papers, the last one being at least 8 pages of text. Will give you a 90+ on papers as long as you meet rubric requirements but wont be specific about what needs to improve. Delayed response at times but other than that the course was pretty easy to do.",1
"Every one dreads 100W, but he broke it down and made it easy. Also, he is an easy going guy and down to earth. I would take any class w/ him",1
So hawt. Great instructor.,1
"Class is mandatory, you will take a quiz everyday to verify you are there, there is alot of homework that is due every week, the homework is time consuming and you use excel heavily, if you are looking for an easy class this is not the one for you, tests are just like the homework there are 4 exams- very doable class i recommend it as an easy A/B",1
I absolutely love Her as my professor! I would take this class 10x over if she was teaching it! ,1
"Only like 4 homework assignments, all answers were on Chegg.  2 tests, midterm and final, pretty easy tests. Most of the work in  here are pretty intensive projects, 3 of them. Expect to work for several days and make a B.   He gives a ton of extra credit, up to 50 points that go toward the final test grade.  Lectures are pretty optional, no quizs",1
Great Professor with real world experience,1
"Good teacher all around, very fair with the amount of work assigned. Graded pretty fairly, though his handwriting is on par with a seismograph so don't expect criticism without asking in person. Tests were hard but fair, prepare for the essays because you don't have much time to write them!",1
"tough marker, hand still hurts from writing the 20 page final.",1
"Just take class with someone else. If you have children, a job, any other responsibilities, if you have any form of ADD/ADHD. You will fail. The amount of information your expected to absorb and retain is unreasonable for the time frame. The amount of writing is ridiculous. Lets face it, your not at Harvard its GCTCS. She doesnt act accordingly.",0
definitely of the best professors i have ever had hands down. The absolute best FIN 325 instructor out there. I had to take this course 3 times to end up with him and finally understand the material! He explains it so clearly and knows what hes talking about. I was so glad to have met him and attended his course. I would take him again and he is A+,1
"Avoid this class. Prof. Bauner is from Germany and it is very difficult to understand him, and his presentations were boring. The only reason I went to class was for iClicker. Homework was difficult, and the multiple choice tests were not representative of what was taught in lecture. He is also not interested in helping students learn or understand",0
"If you are not spanish or know any, please take someone else. This lady is heartless and makes it harder for students to be able to succeed in her class. She never answers emails, wont be clear with the instructions, and the amount of work everyday was disrespectful(6/day) .She has a ""figure it out on your own"" attitude and will set you up to fail.",0
"best math professor I've ever had. His responses are thorough and easily understood. He goes out of his way to prepare you for the tests by spending his own money printing out previous tests and detailed solutions. Be sure to mimic the way her gives solutions to previous exams, If you do you'll get full partial credit.",1
"Dr. Hernandez is a great professor. His methods of teaching an online calculus class work wonders! A 5-week course is tough, but his syllabus makes it possible to pass and learn a lot as you go. Follow his directions, do the assignments and ask for help early. He does an amazing job explaining concepts in ways that truly help! I recommend his class",1
"Surprised to see that Bernadette gets low ratings! She was responsive and easy to understand. I took this class online. Once a week there were clear assignments and an exam. This class was a late start class, so it is a lot of information in a short amount of time, but I earned an A grade by completing all assignments and using the text.",1
I hate speech and I was not looking forward to this class at all. But Kelli Worrall is such a wonderful teacher and she really helps you feel better about speaking and speech in general. The way she taught made me really enjoy this class! Take her. You will not regret it. ,1
"He lectures by writing on a chalk board and that's it. He cracks jokes but they are not funny. You cannot write on his test or he will take 5 points off, a couple test were 30mins for 50 questions. He was teaching the bones in the hand wrong. I dropped his class this semester, class averages on his test range from 47% to 59%. HORRIBLE INSTRUCTOR!!!",0
"Worst math teacher I've ever had. He gets dragged off topic and doesn't teach the curriculum well. 90% of your grade will be if you can do math bookwork because he won't teach it, you have to learn it there.",0
Jim really cares about his students.,1
"Good professor, professional",1
"Dr. Alse is an awesome professor!  His Money and Banking course was difficult, perhaps the hardest Economics course I have ever taken.  However, he really knew his stuff and his lectures were really interesting.  Tests were quite difficult.  Be sure to take a few days to study for each exam!",1
Prof. Freed is honestly the best professor I have had at Oakland University. She has such passion for literature and has the class read things that are different compared to other lit classes. She has a great personality that makes coming to lectures fun. There are daily questions that you get credit for so definitely show up to class.,1
"best professor ever she is super kind and is willing to help if you don't understand, exams are right from the notes",1
"By far my favorite class this semester. I looked forward to attending every single class because Hinshaw's teaching style is incredibly engaging and he makes the material sound even more interesting than it actually is, it's like magic. He is super approachable in office hours and loves to talk to students. Wonderful professor and a great guy.",1
I had him for history. it only consists of 3 pop quizzes a midterm and final. it was pretty challenging. honeslty I only passed because I copied the guy next to me. I got a C in everything and I passed the class. but its my fault I should of reviewed my notes as well as the books. that is all you have to do. just review everything and you will pass,1
"I took Dr. Jacobson's class fall 2018. Her class is super easy and she is hilarious. She drops the 2 lowest quiz grades as well, which is super nice. Half of the classes were activities and the other half were lectures.",1
This class is SUPER easy untill after the second mid-term.  this class can be a VERY easy A if you don't blow off the lectures.  Just go and take the notes cuz the test material is right off of lecture notes.  The last exam gets really confusing tho - so pay attention when she starts talking about word trees...,1
"Stephaine Crockett is awesome! I would recommend her to anyone for the intro class. She is very specific on what she wants for each assignment and will help you with any questions you have (especially apa formatted papers) She is real and honest about the conseling world. Great class, good discussions, fun assignments and never a dull moment!",1
"She seems like a cool professor the first day, but don't let her kindness trick you. You have to show up to class, she uses reef pooling for attendance. Her lectures literally put me and the whole class to sleep. Her book  review is dumb hard, and the tests are very tricky. If you really don't like history STAY AWAY!!!!",0
"Vance is a good guy. He tries to help students out. The tests are tough, but do the practice tests and the problems from the back of the book and you'll do fine. The other people complaining are just used to being spoon fed everything without having to put any effort in.",1
best prof. at bentley. really entertaining and informational at the same time. 3 papers plus an extra credit paper. super easy definitely take!!,1
"WOW, you will regret wasting money on her class. Not only is she boring she does absolutley nothing, she doesn't teach, she picks her favs and labels the students she dislikes and harasses them. She is biased, ugly and spaced out!",0
"I would totally recommend taking this class. I took it only to fulfill my art requirement, but I really enjoyed the class. She is a really easy grader, and she barely gives any work. There's a discussion post and a quiz every week, and there are 3-4 really easy projects in the whole class. Taking this class has made me interested in photography.",1
"Great professor, she really makes the class fun with her funny explanations. Tests are all multiple choice, follow study guides & her lectures. Prepare to study a lot especially for the practicals, don't wait and cram those. Wish she taught A&P II!",1
Finished winter semester. The class was easy to navigate. Ended up being not too hard.,1
"Not only a tough grader but an unfair grader. DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER.  Also she is not afraid to share her views with the class, which I found unprofessional. Definitely an interesting class but it is not enjoyable whatsoever. She does give extra credit options but even is picky with that. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Not a nice nor understanding prof.",0
"Dr. LaPresto is an excellent educator.  While she does demand a lot of students, she's also very fun and truly cares about student perfomance and academic life in general.",1
Took her for a summer session of Biology 1.  No lecture only lab. Deffinetly put in the effort of reading each chapter and making notecards to learn materials. She briefly went over power points in class.  Let you know whats on test.  You can make an A. Takes effort!,1
"This is the easiest class I have ever taken, and enjoyed every moment of it. There really isn't a textbook, but you have to purchase a workbook. That's the assignments every week is proof that you've done the workbook and a discussion board. The only assignments there is, are workbooks, discussion boards, a quiz, an interview and a reflection paper",1
"this class killed my GPA, i was studying all day and night for this class and still tough grading made it a D for me in the class. Worst teacher at nova!!!",0
"littlejohn sucks, she is not helpful at all, her lectures go by very quickly and are not related at all to the textbook, yet we get tested on the textbook, as well as the web design labs, its like 3 courses in one! with a crappy prof!",0
"Confusing, dry lectures but you have to just sit through them because he takes attendance at the end of each class and that's all your participation grade is based on so just go and zone out for the points. You really just need to review the slides, he puts all of them on bright space, to know enough for the exams. All hw answers are on quizlet",1
"Good god, these reviews are terrible. He gives out notes, eliminating the need for a textbook and still manages to follow a curriculum that can teach anyone the basics of control design without being a savant in differential equations. Anyone that doesn't like this course should drop out because they don't even want to work for their degree.",1
"The tests are made to take more than the allotted time, he is extremely vague, and does not post grades until the last minute, and he NEVER posted homework or participation grades.",0
"I don't do these at all, but let me tell you the rudeness I received from such a professor. I used to like Kathleen, she was and still is amazing. But personality and favoritism aside, I give her a 0. I definitely will not take one of her classes again. ",1
If you want to pass Microbiology with an A take this professor. She grades everything expect test on completion. She really takes her time with the students to make sure we understand everything we are learning. She is the best professor I have ever had. Take her class you will not regret it!,1
Very fun guy,1
"Had Professor Abdo for both Professional writing and advanced prof writing. She's an amazing teacher, probably one of the best at UTSA. She's kinda of a hard grader, but you'll def leave the class room with more knowledge than you came in with!",1
"Two weeks in and already the best class I have had dealing with advertising (of the three I have had).  Not too much reading, but the projects look like thy will be a lot of work.",1
"He's a good guy. Not too tough on grading, and goes veryyyy in detail on his explanations. Disorganized and messy handwriting on board, but he's smart and we talk a lot in class. Resting tough guy face but he's a nice guy! Enjoyed his class. One time I wrote the wrong essay and he only penalized me with w B+.",1
Very nice person and extremely willing to help students. Great professor!,1
Very interesting class.  Very sociology based (great if you've taken SOCY100 before).  Professor Andrews is very witty and makes 75 minutes seem like 30 minutes.  Very easy to understand if you go to class. Going to class alone will get you at least a B in the class if you pay attention.  Got an A- in the class but I got a 100 on the Final!,1
If you take this class seriously then she will take you seriously. Class should be easier than she makes it but prof is passionate about restoration and has lots of good points to make aside from the readings. Exam questions tend to be technical and not always based on the main points so study. Really wants you to learn.,1
Mr. Swint is really nice and he has a way of talking about the material that makes it interesting. Three tests right out of the notes.,1
"Awesome feedback.  Took the course online in the MHIT program, couldn't have asked for a better experience.",1
"Best professor at SPU, she is a HUGE help with anything you need, class wise its intense you really have to pay attention and read but she gives ALOT of extra credit and she is completely fair.",1
"I took her class because I had to, a friend warned me and I blew her off thinking she just didn't like math. I LOVE MATH, I passed 112 with a 97(for some background.) She gave us 152 problems,PLUS review to do for ONE chapter in TWO WEEKS, plus at home tests. She's cheery, but gives no guidance. I studied for a month straight, that's how i got a 78",0
"I completed all of the discussion posts and followed the rubric and even cited the sources and used direct quotes from videos provided by the professor only to still receive failing grades on each discussion posts. Her direct responses for one of my discussion posts were ""clearly you know how to read and write"" but then gives me a bad grade",0
"Professor Hoover is a very patient, detailed teacher who outlines specifically what will be on his exams. Great teacher! I'm definitely taking his class again.",1
she gets off topic often but is a great teacher . really explains the course and helps you alot to understand the material. she will help do reviews before test to make sure you have everything you need to pass and gives extra credit easy A.,1
This class was the easiest class I've ever taken. Two easy assignments that can be done early in the semester and four tests make up the entire semester's work.,1
Maril taught the honors version for SOCI2110 and he was very demeaning. It felt like a true lecture versus discussion and we just had to swallow and accept his ideas. He said his notes were based on facts but he picked which facts he used and omitted others. Very harsh grader and told me I didn't care about my grades when I went to his office hours,0
Great professor. I would definitely recommend her to other students. The tests are pretty tough and so are the assignments. But there is no excuse for failing any of the assignments. They are tedious but her directions and tutorial videos (for the online students) are very helpful and she is there to answer any questions about the assignment. ,1
Very knowledgable and informative. Answered every question clearly.,1
"Every day you have quizzed a 3 question quiz online, and the answers are online. He drops a few quizzes at the end. You don't have to buy all the books if you are going to look up the answers. The tests are also online but still study. Lectures heavy so take notes. Gives bonus opportunities.",1
Best teacher at SHSU hands down!! I wish he could teach all my classes! First teacher ever that I didn't have to go home and teach myself the material! barely even had to study for the tests because he taught it so well!!! Take him you will not regret it!,1
He is sooo much fun!!,1
Dr. Keys is the best professor I have ever had! He makes his classes so interesting and highly applicable. There were always hands-on problems to solve in class and labs were always interactive and almost always outdoors. He even took our class on a weekend camping trip up north! He is the best prof! Take him if you get the chance!,1
"Professor Al Marashi's lectures were fun and at the same time informative. He assigns reading from the book, but I honestly never did the assigned readings. He uploads study guides for the mid term and exam, and if you take your time to study a couple days before the exam you'll do fine . Also for the 5 page essay, make sure it is 5 COMPLETE pages.",1
No Comments,1
"If you are not electrical engineering, do not take him. He is a research professor, not a teaching professor. I took every AP Physics in high school, did the homework, studied for hours for the test an failed. He gave a 3 question test that was 9 parts total. The class average was a 44% and he does not curve. He does not care about your grade.",0
"best professor at pgcc for anatomy, i wish i can take him for all my nursing courses. Take him you want to learn and pass the class with an A. Highly recommended",1
Great person... tough grader,1
"Great professor. I've taken him for a few classes. CRM426 was very homework heavy, however it prepares you for the exam. He is very interactive, and expects you to be as well. He grades fair, but expects a lot out of assignments. The class was more in-depth than others, but it was still easy to get an A if you put forth the effort. Would recommend.",1
Good teacher.He knows what he is talking about and he doesn't try and push his views on his students.,1
You won't be graded on your knowledge of economics in this class. You're harshly graded on your ability to make pretty data visualization and your ability to summarize book chapters/articles that incorporate little to no economics. I would not recommend this class to anyone. Dr. Wooten made an interesting topic (crime economics) pretty boring.,0
Best teacher ever.,1
"He is a good teacher, but hard to understand. You have to take good notes and find alternative notes otherwise you might get lost. ",0
I was nervous taking Chemistry but Mr. T made it a breeze. He gives extra credit and whatever he teaches in class is whats going to be on the tests. He provides hand outs to help you how to solve certain problems. He definitely made chemistry a lot easier than I thought it would be. Definitely take Mr. T!!!,1
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
"she means weel for her student and is pro student rights, but she has trouble relating the materal to relife examples.  also, she barely goes over how to do problems unless someone ask how to do it.  she is a nice lady and offeres extra credit.  cant recommend her or not cuz from what i hear all the 1050 profs suck",0
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
Tests are a fair representation of testing your knowledge.,1
exams are difficult,0
"After having several emotional breaks due to her, I changed majors.",0
"Awesome teacher! Discussions online were really interesting. Reaction articles were very interesting as well. Read the notes, read the chapters,complete the chapter reviews, and you will get an A!",1
"There is a lot of reading! it is very difficult and long. You do not have to do the reading he provides outlines for all of the readings. usually only a couple of people dominate conversation in you need participation points so this is bad, it  blocks anyone else from talking. There is only a midterm and a final which are very HARD!! do the reading",1
"Nice prof,she clearly knows her stuff and is passionate about the subject. She really tries to give you as many marks as possible on exams and papers. But there is a TON to memorize for this course and tests can be really specific and difficult. Even with studying and attending lectures it is hard to get a good grade.",1
High ability to encourage students to delve deeply into various texts,1
"She was an okay professor, but was really hard to talk to. Every message was a fight and I never felt I said the right things. Glad it is over for me",0
"Kata is the top professor in the entire language department. We did not have any exams. Most of our grade came from 300-400 word responses to the readings (graded very nicely), and a final essay written as a group. Rather than smothering us w/busywork, Kata focused on creating lively discussions and making us think critically about the world.",1
she was amazing,1
She is very reasonable. Her exams and quizzes are exactly like her practice questions with different numbers and sometimes little tricks on short answer. Pay attention to what she says when she changes the question around. For hw and project she gives full credit if she sees you tried. Final was harder and all mc. I just didn't understand ch11.,1
"Her class is hard, but as long as you study for every test, it should be easy to pass.",1
"Explains content very clearly, little homework, but often lectures in tight pants with a raging semi.  So I guess take the good with the bad.",1
"He makes you buy a book that you will use only one, just because he wrote that book.",0
"excellent instructor!!! always look forward to his classes. writing was not an interest to me (couldn't write APA style to save my life) til i met this man. Really detailed oriented, you'll enjoy this instructor.",1
"Very bad. The class is supposed to be aboud culture, but she ends up teaching mostly history. Is unclear, lectures have little to do with exam material. Without discussion sections, the exams would be utterly impossible. Accent sometimes hard to understand (she's Polish) and rambles in lectures on nonrelated material.",0
Shes just so amazing,1
"talks too fast, very sassy, talks in third person.  Does not give partial credit.  If one period is out of place or a word is misspelled she marked it as wrong-- many kids are international students so this is difficult for them. I dropped the class and would not take her again if i can avoid it.",0
Excellent teacher.,1
Great teacher for Organizational Behavior.  Engages students.  A few presentations and tests.,1
this had to be one of my worst teachers. she doesnt help and expects you to know everything. she makes a simple subject very difficult. i would never recommend her,0
"Great professor who understood his students and was very lenient. He empathize with the students and went the extra mile to help you out. Easy class to pass if all you do is present yourself and try on your part. Doesn't give a lot of work so he's cool. Enjoyed him at UH, wish he was still here but I'll  always remember his class.",1
"Extremely tough when grading tests and quizzes. If a student makes one mistake, all work following it is worth 0 points.",0
Professor K is great. He grades based on your skill level and he understand that everybody is not a great drawer but still tries to bring out each student's greatness. He's very entertaining and passionate about art. I really enjoyed his class.,1
"Taking her Java class online is one of the worst college experiences I have ever persevered. Her tests and their answers are self-typed, so often answers that she allows are not correct per the book, or one of multiple answers that she presents. When asking for help, she had to use Google to answer a simple question. DO NOT take her Java class!",0
"Professor O'Quinn is an extremely knowledgeable professor who knows what he is talking about. However, I found his lectures very hard to follow & did not know what points he was trying to get across a lot of the time. His assignments are ambitious & unclear but he is very approachable and brilliant. Take a class with him if you want a challenge.",0
"Dr. Teekell is nice and she's pretty relatable, and she didn't go too heavy on the reading or assignments. That being said, she does not give the clearest directions on the few assignments she gives and the rubrics are hard to figure out, so if you misunderstand you lose a lot of points. On the bright side, discussing in class are always a blast.",1
"At first she seems like a hard teacher, but she is so knowledgeable about the topics.  I absolutely loved her class and she made me fall in love with a political science major! I definitely recommend her if you are willing to work and go to class.  her class is totally manageable and she really pushes you to your fullest potential!",1
"Her grading is REALLY critical and she will not try to clear up the homework, and will tell you to just read the ""instructions"". I also felt I was being treated as if I was still in middle school. Wouldn't recommend this class.",0
His passion for the subject in contagious. Explains everything thoroughly and will re-explain anything you didn't understand. Tests are off the power point notes. They're MC and short essays.  As long as you pay attention in class you will do good. I didn't read the book much. DO ALL the HW because it does count for a significant part of the grade,1
"Take David!  I have had terrible science teacher but David makes things easy to understand and easy to follow.  He reviews everything you need to know.  All you have to do is pay attention.  His teaching style is laid back yet serious.  He loves his roses, ask about them and google them.  You can even order the seeds.  David is a great person.",1
"He is very kind and patient. His classes feel like forever though. Class can be very boring and slow but its an English class so I expected nothing less. He is very helpful and clear on what he wants on his assignments. I haven't gotten my grade for the class yet but im positive I got no lower than a B+ because I do the work. Overall, nice prof!",1
Kim was a good professor. 3/4 exams (including the final exam) will be graded towards your final grade. She gives out practice exam which is useful. The laboratory for ece is horrible. Too much time consuming. My suggestion is to finish the lab and turned it in to the TA. Most likely you will get full credit by completing the labs.,1
"Hardest class I have ever taken, period. I am a Engineering Major, and this is the worst class i have taken. Teacher is rude and negligent, gives zero warning on Exam dates, gives zero feedback on discussions, the list goes on. I wouldn't want my worst enemy in this class. If you are looking for a easy class like I was, STAY AWAY PLEASE.",0
Ms. Shade is a very good science teacher who cares about what she does. Lots of labs that are never difficult. She was very chill the whole semester and answered any question that was asked.,1
Best professor ever. She was funny. She made the class interactive by telling personal experiences,1
"He has no clear grading criteria, his methods of grading and teaching are all over the place. His PPT slides are 100 each and he jumps around and skips slides, which makes it really frustrating. He only scribbles stuff on the chalkboard when he tries to further explain a concept but still doesn't make any sense. Exams are unfairly difficult.",0
"I found his class to be challenging because he seemed to be very unclear on what he wants and tends to teach what should have been in the last paper, He didn't really seem fully there and would tell you what to write about for free writes- other classes its free to choose. If you ask him about office hours he says yes but he doesn't seem thrilled.",1
I heard that he was a hit or miss. In reality you better be prepared to work your butt off and see him in his office hours. He is better one to one. His tests are not that hard if you study and show up. He does explain a lot but I personally would not take his class again.,1
Prof Cameron's class has been one of my favorite so far. He is engaging and explains the topics thoroughly. He encourages respectful discussions during class.. There isn't much homework beyond readings (which are tested by 3 pop quizzes) and the tests were easy as long as you had studied. He seems to genuinely want you to do well!,1
Mrs Hays is absolutely amazing. She truly cares about her students and them passing her class.,1
"Very helpful teacher.  Was nervous about talking in front of people, he made it a lot easier and more comfortable.  Highly recommend to anymore that is nervous about taking speech.  Great Prof.",1
"Have to buy textbook and access to another platform which was kind of annoying. Reading the textbook is important as all quizzes and exams are based off it. She's approachable, accessible and really nice and held review sessions before each quiz. Gave lots of opportunities for people to ask questions, although course was hard would recommend her.",1
"cogan is brillant. Professor and author he is current and funny. You will have to do the work, but he is always available for help and you will be rewarded. Fair grader.",1
Great class that increased a passion for writing. Love Morano.,1
The way she teaches is confusing. She expects you to know how to do problems before she explains them and then when you don't know the answer she acts like your stupid. The class average for the second test we took was 60%. Then she gave us a 25 minute lecture about how we should have done better.,0
She is not well suited for her job whatsoever. She assigns very long papers and I highly doubt she even reads all of them all the way. I had my paper given back to me with a grade of 95 (she also circles where the student makes mistakes) and when I was revising the paper I found a couple of errors that she didn't even circle. Did she even read it?,0
"She is an amazing professor!!! Actually, my favorite professor out of the entire Biology department...she helped make Bio such an interesting field...as long as you are committed to work hard and study for her test, which are a breeze since everything in the sudy guide she gives is in the test.  Just do her work, there's plenty of extra credit!",1
"Love Barclift! Come to class, do homework, you will have an A+! She is very blunt so if you get butt hurt easily dont take her class. If you appear to care about the class & material, she will love you.",1
"He is interesting. He clearly knows what he's talking about, but he's not great at explaining how to do it. He's a pretty nice guy and has a good sense of humor, but he's probably not the best person to take for intro into accounting. Four quizzes, drops the lowest grade. Lots of vocab, true or false questions on the quizzes, which is hard",1
"got a good grade, but bad teacher. kind of an air head. kinda nice. I worked pretty hard for my A, but you could prolly get a decent grade w/out much effort, but lectures can be annoying.",0
"Takes points off for the wrong hue of yellow. If creative choices do not align with her own, points are lost. Spent most of class on non-class topics. Breaks lasted upwards of 45 min., covering new topics with 5 min. left of class, running over. Welcomed outside students into her class to interrupt lectures. Take with someone else.",0
Fantastic lecturing and quizzing!,1
"She is not an easy grader, but you truly learn how to write in her class.  she is funny and nice.  Enjoyed her class",1
"This was the hardest class I've ever had.  He is a very sweet man, willing to help out however he can, but there was just way too much material.  My brain is toast.",1
Great Professor! Lab is worth 350 pts-with half of it coming from attendance. 2 Lab practicals with study guides given. Also offers open lab for review night before exam. Very helpful and wants you to succeed!! She has a great sense of humor and is straight forward. You do need to study. Will be taking her lab next semester as well!,1
"Dr. Heth made an 8 a.m. every day in JTerm bearable.  I felt like I really learned something from him.  He definitely has his opinions, but he's also cool if you have different opinions.  Definitely take a class with him.",1
Very enthusiastic professor that will make you fall in love with the subject of study. Inspirational influence on my career.  Probably my favorite teacher of all time. Dedicated to his students and (I feel) went above and beyond his responsibilities as a professor. I give Dr. Zlesak an A+!,1
Most amazing professor I have ever had. His lectures are great. Teaches with passion. The 3 hour class flew by. I highly recommend him,1
"He is passionate and fun. Easy A. However, you will leave knowing a lot about the movie The Social Network and little about the legal environment of business itself lol. Funny thing is, I never watched the movie not even once and still got an A. I would take him again though",1
"Professor Kaur is by far the worst professor I have had at William Paterson. All of my peers this past semester had a great English professor but I got stuck with Kaur. I got a B for the semester but I got all A's in the essays. All assignments are essays and her grading is horrible. Not an easy class or an easy person to deal with, trust me.",0
"I took Prof. Mihill for ASCI 490. (Capstone) This class was extremely difficult, however, Prof. Mihill is such an amazing teacher.  He was extremely helpful and patient and replied to my questions within a day, because communication is imperative while taking this class. I can't say enough good things andwould absolutely take this Professor again.",1
"This is a great teacher, you have to do some work, but if you do you cannot fail. Probably one of the best teachers at this school",1
"He was really generous with his time and willing to help with my essay drafts outside of class. His lectures in class and comments on essays are helpful too. I have a much better idea of what I'm doing in research papers now. Covid kind of messed up the semester because there wasn't class time to ask questions, but he was still easy to email.",1
"Parkhurst is an amazing professor!!! Very caring. His lectures are easy to understand and are intriguing. He seems to genuinely love what he does. Make sure you read!!! If you dont, I promise you he knows. DO NOT SHOW UP LATE. He will lock the doors and not let you in if you do.",1
"I respect Mr. Jason so much as a professor as well as a film critique. I highly suggest him! This class certainly isn't for everyone though and I would really only suggest it if you're interested in analyzing films and learning about film criticism. This class contains weekly readings and several papers. All in all, I truly did learn SO much.",1
"Great teacher. Very clear on the subject, and goes slow to allow all to follow. Answers questions and explains in great detail. The only way to fail this class is to put forth zero effort. His reviews are amazing, and very helpful. If you ever get lost, he is happy to help and get you back on track. ",1
"This professor during a pandemic does not provide any extra credit that will actually move your grade up. There are only 3 exams that make up the majority of the grades and she does not curve or care. Overall the professor can't keep her personal life away from her professional work, which is a bad trait to have as a professor.",0
"Great professor and person! Although the tests throughout,the semester were rather easy if you went to class, the cummulative final was brutal!!! Attendance can help your grade, so go. He's git a twisted sense of humor and it made class interesting! I mean, he looks like Monk! :)",1
Never rounds scores up.,1

Ask any female student!  He is hot!,1
GREAT TEACHER,1
"Karen is a great math teacher, I personally don't like math and have struggled with it in the past, but she makes it easy to understand and is always there to help.",1
"She got rid of extra credit. She prepares you well for the exams, but the final is a huge curveball so expect tears",0
"Soo... Im an 4.0 student, here's my take: Pros: homework and exams (2 tries each) are easy, found on quizlet. she gives many reminders abt deadlines. Cons: even if u use quizlet, hw takes hours to complete. Four writing assignments that are 500 word, and graded harshly Going to class is pretty useless, but still mandatory. no extra cred or makeups",1
"I had this professor 11 years ago but she was the most stimulating and dynamic professor I had in undergrad. She got the students to come up with ideas in class which led on to the conclusions she wanted to make, always encouraging creativity on the part of the students.",1
"Professor Callaway is amazing. She runs a discussion-based class and encourages students to participate. I love her teaching style so muchI really feel like I connected to the texts. She gives amazing feedback on papers and makes her expectations clear for exams. If you have the chance, definitely take a class with Professor Callaway!",1
"My fave class in grad school. He speaks English, explains ideas well, shows actual class examples, and will help you when you need it. His tests reflect the same concepts from the homework so DO THE HOMEWORK. He makes the hw more difficult than the in class examples, but he clearly writes out the steps and methodology. Work hard & you will be fine!",1
Knowledgeable. But doesn't really give feedback that is helpful.,1
"Professor Kleindienst is a cool guy, can be funny at times but his class is ridiculous. Group project almost seems completely unfeasible and pointless. First case study he doesn't give you an example, just a template and tells you he'll explain after it's discussed in class. Still grades you as if you knew what you were doing. Would not recommend.",0
"Monica is really good, she explains the class on a level that you will understand it!  Still not understanding it? She figure a way to break it down for you so that you WILL understand. Need help? Monica was ALWAYS willing to help her students!",1
Really funny and somewhat entertaining,1
"Dr. Amey is a good teacher. He's a bit disorganized and sometimes can be a little confusing but he's always willing to help you out. He actually wants you to succeed and do well, while actually teaching you something.",1
"She is phenomenal; she definately helped me grow as a writer. Her lectures are really interesting and she is very flexible with due dates. She is very sweet and can help you a lot. So, please engage in class conversation, do your readings, and let her help you become a better writer.",1
"Take this class and get old test! They are plentiful and almost guarantee an A, assuming you are not partially braindead.",1
"Really great professor. Highly recommend. His lectures are great, and his feedback on assignments was super helpful. He clearly cares about his students & wants everyone to do well.",1
She is very sweet. Wants everyone to succeed. ,1
Hardest class and hardest grader ever in IU. Do not take her unless you are willing to go through a rough semester !,0
"Best Professor at Suffolk! So funny, never a dull lecture & very interactive with the class. Usually online homework due once a week, one paper/project besides midterm & final. I've taken 2 classes with him and I know plenty of people do the same! You'll want the Monahan Experience!!",1
"I have always been a straight A student, and I wish I would've found the website before taking this class. Currently, I am in HIS1112 with Dr. Crews. He provides no help, ridiculous midterm and final, no study guides or preparation. This was my very first college class and thought it was going to be the death of me.",0
"if you want an easy A look elsewhere. If you want to become the best writer you can be, take her. If you're ready to push yourself, take her. She knows PRECISELY what she's doing and how to teach. I took her twice. She's kind of intimidating but very very helpful and patient. She's extremely intelligent. Be prepared to work, or get epic excuses.",1
"Fun easy A, but attendance is mandatory. Mr Hughes is a fun teacher.",1
"get on his good side, if he likes you he will grade you much easier and if he doesnt like you you...well...to bad",0
"My favorite teacher of freshman year. Cancels class more than most teachers, tells great stories, is funny and keeps you entertained. Quizzes are really easy.",1
"BEST professor. She has worked in multiple different positions in healthcare and has a vast and detailed knowledge of her courses. Truly inspiring, fair, and makes you want to learn. She's the reason I changed my major/emphasis. Compassionate and very caring of students--FANTASTIC TO TALK TO! She makes you work for your grade, but everything's fair",1
"Don't recommend. Since it is a one credit class, it contains too much reading and there is a Final. Besides, the Lecture is too long that it lasts  for about 3 hours, and on SUNDAY!",0
"Fabulous professor. Truly caring, builds confidence in students, makes herself available after office hours CONSTANTLY. She encourages students to come for tutoring from her! She is amazing. Would take her again if she taught the courses I need.",1
"Our class average was a ""D""and she did nothing to change that. let me remind you it was GENERAL. psych. AVIOD",0
"He is pretty intimidating at first, but once you get to know him, he is super caring. You have to work really hard (his quizzes are insanely hard) and you have a long paper, but no tests or homework. Plus you don't need a textbook. Attendance is mandatory but his classes are definitely interesting. I would take him again.",1
"She is a very nice teacher, will give extra help if you need it. Do NOT miss a test or quiz unless you have a good excuse.  The class is hard but if you read and study for tests it'll be ok.  I hate history and have always failed the classes but I PASSED!!! Take it and learn alot!!!!!!",1
I just took him this fall semester and Im not the strongest person in science but I managed to finished with a B. Definitely worth taking him,1
She is a great teacher who seems passionate about her work. She's willing to help and has a great sense of humor!!,1
"Yates is a wonderful and competent professor! You can definitely learn a lot from her if you just listen. She provides all the slides and key terms for the tests. Her lectures are interesting and informative and her experience in the field is noteworthy. Do the work, listen, study, and appreciate having an amazing professor.",1
"I had Dr. Daniels for my creative nonfiction class, he was really nice then. However, for this fiction class, his comments on student's work were unnecessarily mean on paper. This fostered a non-creative environment where students felt overjudged. Definitely has a complex about ""high fiction"" just because he's published. He was definitely rude.",0
"He is absolutely awful. He doesn't use online resources like d2l, his lectures are not clear, every exam has super low average and he doesn't even tell us where we stand on class. He doesn't post solutions to exams or homework. He is not helpful in office hours either. The syllabus he gave at the beginning of class doesn't even include exam dates.",0
"Dr. P is a wonderful professor! She is animated and really wants you to learn. She honestly cares for everyone in her class. When grading papers, she always gives feedback and suggestions for improvement. Some students have said that her grading is really hard but she really just pushes you to do your best. This was such an enjoyable class!",1
No Comments,1
"It is very difficult to learn just from lectures. Does not allow electronics in class meaning , no laptop to take notes. Goes over slides too quickly and cannot finish taking notes. Uploads unit notes on the class before exams. If you're stuck with her class isn't mandatory. You will learn more from the book.",0
"She tends to deviate from the course material. She's funny and talks about her ferret. You can't really expect her to ""teach"" anything because it's just a review course and she gives a good amount of homework which is a good thing because you'll be prepared for the test if you do it sincerely. Use Think Tank.",1
"This class was kind of hard, its a lot of content and reading. Her test can be a bit tricky, but most of it is straight forward. She knows her stuff and is pretty funny so it makes class a lot more enjoyable.",1
"Students discuss the subject, while she moderates. She never taught in the class, thus after paying 5K in uni fees you get opinions of ur peers & understanding from readings She is unable to keep her prejudices out of class & grading. If she dislikes you then it gets difficult Her approach is idealist & not policy based Take another professor",0
I'm taking her Fall online class & I am loving it! she is very nice and helpful. I would retake her!,1
Professor Brandt delivers his curriculum with humor; and he makes governemnt interests with current topics that can relate to the lectures.  He is my favorite professor this year.,1
"So far the best teacher at Uni, the great champion teacher the number one teacher no body can't beat him!! he teach in first level in his hold life... he sit around and teach!!! ... he teach to himself and he teach and teach!!! HE IS THE CHAMPION THE MICHAEL JORDAN OF TEACHING IS RUSSELL ...Numbre 1 in this area!!!",1
Lectures are boring and will put you to sleep but you'll need the attendance points. Don't buy the book just take pictures of the pages needed for hw. His study guide is ok however it only covered about half of the exam. The average grades for his exams are in the high 80s. This class is an easy B but you'll have to work hard for an A.,1
"Mr. Holmes is funny and so full of energy ..I was not looking forward to the basic concepts class,however he made it fun. I would take him again and recommend him to others...",1
"The material was difficult, but the professor had good humor and vast knowledge of Latin American culture that he integrated into the linguistic learning. He is a very much effective teacher. He is even more effective during his office hours. The tests are the only thing I would change, as even a slight spelling error gives you a 0 on the question.",1
awesome professor...his office hours are held at a coffeeshop,1
"I have no background in Middle Age History and I took his Medieval Heresy Seminar Course! Dr. Sheffler is very helpful, loves participation and drops 2 lowest papers. Average grader. Not easy, but doesn't butcher you on misplaced comma either. State your arguments clearly in writing. Pay attention on your papers.Super cute!",1
"Dr. Bret L. Keeling is one of the best college professors I have ever had. He genuinely cares for his students. The assignments were extremely straight forward and as long as he knew you tried, you got an A. There is literally no reason why you can't do well in his class as long as you show up and hand things in on time.",1
As long as you show up on time and/or early to class you shouldn't have a problem. She thoroughly explains things and really shows you what to do as well as giving great and lengthy feedback after speeches. Do your assignments and show up on time and you'll do just fine.,1
"Dr Miller wasn't very helpful in lab for 241, but was very helpful in 242. If you ask him for help, he always will. We did a lot of peer teaching, he IS listening, and will correct you when wrong. I think he expects you to be able to think for yourself by the time you get to a 200 level class. Don't forget: C6H12O6+6O2+6H2O+6CO2+ATP",1
I was so excited about taking physics until I met this guy. His lectures didn't make any sense. He liked making people look stupid. He used the sample problems from the book for the in class problems. I ended up dropping the course because I couldn't get it. I didn't take the first test but talked to some classmates and most of then got 20-30%!!!,0
"She was a great teacher, easy to learn from and made writing very interesting and fun, yes I said fun. If you want to learn a lot and enjoy going to class, then make sure you get her as your teacher!",1
the bast,1
"He was the best teacher I've had so far at MCC. Explains the material very well and relates it to the real world. Frequently goes off on tangents, but this doesn't take away from the lecture.",1
"Extremely clear, honest and fun Professor. Teaches the basics and beyond. A Professor who really challenges his students to think. I would definitely take another one of his courses again.",1
"Lots of storytelling, but he works it into the subject matter. EMS stories, army stories. It's interesting, sometimes repetitive. I believe he's very smart and knows his stuff. The class only has 3 exams, a paper and maybe another grade. So not many things to actually be graded on to help you if you do bad on an exam.",1
Great Professor !! You will learn a lot of interesting things in his classes. Take all of them lol,1
"Awesome class. Britton is interesting and really cares about her students being successful. Lectures are engaging and go by fast. Must read the book and take notes to do well on the tests, but not super difficult by any means. Definitely would recommend taking this class or any class with Britton.",1
Lots of discussion boards and film responses. Textbook is absolutely needed as it is used for quizzes and discussion boards. She is very fast when it comes to getting an email back and is very approachable. Lots of work but the class content definitely makes it worth it.,1
As long as you attend every class period and do all the homework you will do fine.  The material is not difficult to understand if you are willing to put in the time and effort the class requires. Larsen is always willing to help and tries to explain the material in a way students will understand. You have to put in the study time to do well.,1
"Horrible teacher, easy tests. Don't take if you actually want to learn/are a business major.",0
A phony and fraud -does not put time or effort into grading student work,0
shes the nicest professor on campus. she goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands everything clearly and does everything she can to make sure everyone gets an A. she is undeserving of any bad ratings.,1
"Love this woman! She's funny and very, VERY laid back! I expected something entirely different from REL209, but she is so approachable and quirky - it's worth it! Don't be afraid to ask for help. Do your study guides. Don't slack off, attend her classes, and brava, you'll pass with an A! She's really one of the best! Great mind as well.",1
"Really tough, not super helpful in office hours. Takes off unnecessary points",0
"DO NOT TAKE her class, her test has nothing to do with lecture. ",0
"Everybody loves Baughman.  Material covered in class is interesting and he's a pretty funny guy, too.  Highly recommended.",1
"The Almighty Duba. You clap when this man enters the room... you fricken clap. He hates it when we clap, but we must for our lord and savior. In all seriousness, this man loves his job and loves his class and loves his students. He is just a blast to have as a professor. Could improve on lecturing, but he is enjoyable.",1
"Very nice professor. Eventhough she has an accent, she makes up for her willingness to go over questions throughly. I really liked her and which will take a class with her again.",1
"Even though the homework was lengthy, you were not required to do every single problem he assigned. His quizzes were easy, the tests were pretty easy and the reviews reflected everything on the tests. He is a great guy and cares about you understanding the material. I had him my freshman year for mth 119 as well and was awesome!",1
"she is terrible when it comes to writing notation, does't accept homework once class starts, says an answer is wrong when it is right, basically impossible to do anything correct.",0
I took her class on spring semester. Be ready to Give 100 percent of your attention if you miss even a minute you will be lost. Tests are relatively easy if you pay attention in class I recomend you dont miss a day or you will be lost. pop quizzes are given but she gives a heads up. Listen closely because she has kind of a heavy accent,1
"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",0
"I like Dr. Schaller a lot and she has inspired me to pursue more studies in Urban Planning.  While her assignments are writing intensive and not always easy, she will take as much time with you as needed to explain. She uses case studies and often challenges her students in a new way.  Some may not appreciate that but I liked the challenge.",1
"Overall, a really great guy, though not always perfectly clear (especially in-class discussions). Then again, Old English and Chaucer isn't the easiest. Understands a student's workload, and gives extensions with no problem. I would recommend him to anybody.",1
Just finished taking the class. He is very fair. Was about to quit class but he kept encouraging. Is there early and stayed late if you needed help. He won't give you the answers but helps you work through it. I would def. Take his class again.,1
Paleontology.  Dr. B. is dedicated to science and to her students. Caveats:  Does not like dinosaurs. Tries to pack too much into a 200 level course. Mandatory field trips take up a lot of time but are cool.,1
"A friend recommended that I take this class, and so I did and I do not regret it. He is an amazing and brilliant professor. The class owns you for an entire semester, but it is doable with the normal course load from other classes. If you are pre-law, then this class prepares you well for reading and critical thinking.",1
Fantastic Professor. He will make you a better writer.,1
"This is a lecture based class, but you can print the notes he posts online with blanks. Very long winded. Was a interesting class. When I had to write any papers all he graded was the content, he didn't really care as much about the grammar. I enjoyed his class very much. He actually enjoys teaching and LOVES when you ask questions!!!",1
"This was the professor that helped me decide that I wanted to go into the sciences. I love his class so much I am taking him again next semester. Go to class, form a relationship and be genuine and you guys will get along great! I've learned so much from him. His tests are pretty tough, but he also can grade easy if you have concerns. Funny too!",1
"Useless, grades you based off how other people do. You can do really good on a presentation and he won't have any complaints but you will still get a B. Horribly boring. He basically talks to himself the entire class and makes corny jokes that he thinks are hilarious.",0
"She was alright, a bit hard to track down but otherwise she okay. Tests were not truly difficult but you do have to pay attention to the notes and study. If you dont feel ready to take a test she lets you retake it on a different date.",1
"While he is very knowledgeable in the arts, his teaching style is very mundane, so much so that it makes you disengaged in the learning process. I wouldn't suggest his class unless you are an art major, as the lecture is pretty heavy and there is a fair amount of reading involved. I also found him to be a tough grader, more than he needs to be.",0
This teacher is amazing. Her tests are hard but the material and the way she teaches it makes it all worth it. I would definitely recommend her for abnormal Psych,1
best online class i ever took. she is a great professor and cares about her students passing her class. responds quickly to emails. 4 exams and 2 assignments only for the whole semester!,1
"Dr. Harris is extremely encouraging and always willing to help. He admires perseverence, so even if you aren't great at what he teaches, just don't give up! He gives you more points for trying and struggling through than trying, failing, and not finishing.",1
"She's very sweet. If you can't be punctual and always attend,don't take her. This class was challenging at the beginning as I was petrified to deliver a public speech. However, it got easier and easier. Practice a lot, study the reviews for the tests, be on time, she likes slides, don't miss a class, pass.",1
"Well upon a good 1/3 of the way through the semester I find these other reviews disturbingly accurate when it comes to treatment for personal views. This professor is very unprofessional, this class is taught like a master's degree. Myself and other students have been talking about how we do everything she asks and still get basically a zero...",0
"Jasmin gets a lot of hate, but he is a solid choice for Orgo. The class is not easy and his lectures are all over the place, but he is hilarious in office hours and is always available to help. Exams are hard but doing a little better than the average (just 5%) you'll be fine. The curve at the end of the semester will save your grade.",1
"I am taking his class now! So far, I just love him. He is fair and very prepared! I have no idea what grade I will earn in the class, but I am learning a lot!",1
"Dr Barber always responds immediately to questions, like within minutes. He is very approachable, even though the course was online he was always willing to talk or meet to go over things about the class or special education. Very friendly guy, I recommend this class for anyone in education.",1
Kinda didn't seem like he cared much and just wanted us out of there plus he didn't explain well.,0
"She is a great professor. She is incredibly smart and she is also fair. However, you should really read the text book if you want that A, this material is not easy. Taking her again for corporate tax and I'm looking forward to it. Structured class, clear grading structure, great presentation slides, nice person overall.",1
"DJB is hands down my favorite professor at UT. Through her, I learned that I loved accounting and actually pursued the degree. I still talk to her (it's been 2 yrs since her class) and she even offered to help me find career opportunities. She cares about individuals and their successes. A great, hilarious, and caring woman that you need to know.",1
She is VERY passionate about POL. If you don't like reading DO NOT take this class you wont pass!  Make sure to do your ID's they are a BIG part of the class as well as participation. She randomly calls on people and travels during lectures so make sure you know your stuff. Overall great teacher! (:,1
I took Mr. Harp's class for the 2019 fall semester and he was great. Just follow the rules. He uses an online interface for his textbook meaning all the work is done through McGraw hill and DO NOT turn in things late.,1
"I was really afraid to take Calculus and Jennie made is so much easier than I thought. She actually has realistic expectations and presents the material in a really understandable way. I like that she uses words as often if not more than numbers, it helps with comprehension and to me it's way easier! She is also very very nice!!!!",1
"Ali is one of the best teachers York has.  I actually looked for his name when choosing my classes this year.  He is so helpful and approachable, he genuinely cares for the welfare of his students.  He makes the material interesting so you hardly notice that you are learning - but you learn so much in his classes.",1
"Great, great  teacher. Makes me want to be a writer even though I'm a math major. Always gave feedback on my papers before I turned them in. ",1
"THE worst. I took AP English in high school and passed it with flying colors as one of the top writers in my class. I get to Shamane's class and I'm told that my use of grammar is ""offensive"" and that I'm too ""flowery"" and wordy in my writing. Passed with a 4.0 overall and on the portfolio bc I am a strong writer despite her comments. AVOID HER!!!",0
"Amazing Professor. She is so easy, makes herself be understood. There's a decent amount of homework but its simple but If you do the homework then you have the answers for the quizzes and tests. She also posts answer keys on Blackboard. She made this class very enjoyable. I passed with an A.",1
Prey is an amazing and unique teacher. We learn the human body in all different labs that make learning fun. He gives us different learning activities to help us improve and learn the criteria better and easier. He is always there to help if needed and gives you many opportunities to learn and grow. I learned so much in his class.,1
"She's a great french teacher. I came into the class planning on fulfilling the requirement, and now I'm seriously considering minoring in french. Not too much work, and the class discussions are usually very interesting!",1
He likes to talk a lot. You don't have to show up unless its a review day. He does classes and tells you exactly what to write on the test. Like exactly. I recorded his lectures and took notes from there. He gets a little boring and rambles so be prepared for that. Nice guy and easy to talk to.,1
"She was probably the worst professor I've had to deal with. She is an extremely tough grader, when she gets around to grading. Her instructions are extremely unclear and she doesn't tell you due dates. You can't keep to the syllabus since it changed the first day. She was unwilling to answer questions and her questions are extremely open ended.",0
"She is very good, she is easy and she actually cares about giving you feedback on your papers. She gives you really good leniency, and she is actually really fun in class, as long as you do the work there is no way you could get less than a B in that class with her. Highly recommend her anywhere or to anyone.",1
AVOID @ ALL COST for sensation&perception he teaches from middles school book & teaches @400 level tests all writing/long answer no matter how much detail you put he wants more. treats students who don't understand like idiots/talks down no attendance taken but gives popquizes Extrapolates from book @ rate that's not followable NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!,0
"Although Linda is helpful and her assignments are easy (4 projects and 1 two-page paper), she doesn't warn you that you will be buying 90% of your materials. Many of which are VERY expensive! Takes attendance at the end of class so you have to stay the whole time. If you are a baller on a budget, don't take this class. Otherwise, have fun.",1
"This was not a core class, but I really enjoyed it. Her class is very easy, but at the same time, I felt like I learned a lot in the process. That's the mark of a good teacher. You have weekly assignments that are designed to help you learn the material, and she gives you everything you need to make an easy A. If you don't do it, that's on you.",1
Great teacher.,1
Excellent at explaining chemistry and the mathematical problems involved.,1
"WARNING: Fun and charming exterior, has interesting personality however rigid and inflexible interior. Does not offer extra credit. Does not like others challenging her ""Authority"".. Can become defensive when showed the hypocrisy of self. Is a very nice person, until you challenge her authority... Makes jokes about her self and her inelegance",1
"Bit on the timid side, which some students take advantage of. Other than that, great professor! Art history lectures are hard to stay awake through sometimes, but the hands on, creative aspect of the class is very enjoyable.",1
"This was an amazing class. You will have to work hard for an A, but you will learn a lot in the process. Pereira is one of the best teachers I have ever had, and I highly recommend her.",1
greatness is an understatement of this mans collabor in his ability to educate the youths of tomorrow .,1
"This was honestly the worst class I have ever taken and it has nothing to do with the course itself. The lectures were great but often times the professor would cancel the class last minute, change assignments or just never grade your exams. I, as well as many others, still don't have a grade for my last semester from him. It's almost February. ",0
"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless.",0
"If you really want a good teacher....go for Dr, Lee. He is really helping. If you ask any question, he will try to make you understand with his full efforts. he is really hard working. You will get to learn a lot of practical knowledge which we really need. He is among the best teachers in EMU. If you attend a class, you can easily get B+",1
"One of the Gems I've found at CCNY. Easy if you READ the Textbook, Slides and take good notes. Attendance Mandatory (10%), No Cell Phones or Laptops were allowed during class. 2 Midterms + 1 Final and Quizzes on Every Chapter. Always available through Email and makes learning FUN and EASY. I laughed every class. TAKE HER 100% Recommend.",1
"I loooove Dr. B! I needed an A in his class to transfer into my next university and, after submitting my final essay, he rounded up my grade from an 89.5 to a 90! That 0.5 was the difference for me!",1
Very good teacher.,1
"Extremely intelligent and interesting individual with a great interest and passion for what he is teaching. Really broke down the literature to a level that I understood &connected with. Holds high expectations regarding work, participation, &attendance and WILL educate you (as any GOOD professor should, because thats what we're paying for, right?)",1
"Great guy, willing to talk and work things out with you. Homework is online and very easy, search all problems in google. Class is easy to follow along but he has a thick accent. Didn't use book ever. Class examples are test problems. Overall physics is a hard subject.",1
"Very chill professor. Not difficult at all if you do the reading and the practice exercises. As long as you read, do the practice exercises, you should get an A. Offers a lot of extra credit towards the end of the semester so there's no reason not to pass with a B or higher. Cool guy with funny jokes.",1
This class experience is what your group is! Exams aren't as hard as EGR106 so nail the exams if you can. Stevens is a understanding prof the key is if you have a problem let him know immediately. DON'T WAIT FOR IT TO GET BETTER! it doesn't! If your real with him he'll be real with you. Keys: Get passed his dry sense of humor & go in with a humble.,1
"I've had many French teachers in high school & college, and Miss Pillai has been the best! For someone who struggles with speaking & understanding spoken French, she's very patient and helped me improve my accent. She's willing to work with students one-on-one and as long as you put in effort,  you will learn a lot about French language & culture.",1
"She is a easy ""A"". though unclear and outspoken she s very helpful. Just do the for papers and you will be fine.",1
"Don't buy the book; he will give you the notes in class. Three quizzes, midterm, final, 2 pg paper & 5 pg term paper. You will need to memorize certain words for the exam; some concepts are going to be used in subsequent exams. He is really chill & brings snacks when you watch Presumed Innocent in class. Easy A if you study for exams!",1
"I thought that this class would've been a breeze going into it. Little did I know, Nelson likes the tiny details in things. All of his tests are short/long answer. You have to know your stuff for this class. You don't need to go to ever class, notes are  online, tells you all of the important dates first day. Good at memorizing?  Take this class.",1
"Does not teach, you learn 100% from the Text Book. Unclear instructions.",0
"She is an extremely knowledgeable teacher and loves the her students. That being said the class moves VERY fast and her tests are ridiculously hard. If you have a hard school term I wouldn't suggest taking her if you want a good grade. If your term is easier though, she's a great teacher and you learn a lot, especially about other cultures.",1
"I had french with her, neither english nor french are her first languages but communicates very clearly in both of them. straightforward about what to expect on the tests, i had a night class with her and it got long at times but never dull, you can use the old version of the book but it's a little bit confusing, i used the old edition and got an A",1
"Excellent professor, I wish Mass Bay would give this professor more classes to teach. He made accounting exciting and not too dreadful. He gives homework only to make sure you understand the topic.",1
College Writing was an easy class with Worrall. She guides you through the papers. One thing I had was I never clearly understood what we had as homework for the next class. She's a good prof but CW is just a bad class,1
"Dr. Anderson is a very good guy, & it's obvious he cares for the students, but class material is ridiculously difficult.  I personally felt like there was too much information for one semester.  I feel like his BIOL 3250 class should be expanded into 2 semesters because of all of the course material.  There is also a huge and hard paper at the end.",1
Dr. Acharya is very approachable. Class is not difficult just as long as you attend class.,1
"While Prof. Luallen does make the class very difficult at times, his wealth of knowledge and clarity of explanation makes the class interesting and valuable as opposed to a different EC11 professor. While this class is certainly no cake-walk, I definitely recommend it for anyone seriously considering an econ major.",1
He is a great guy! Wants nothing but the best for his students! He explains the exams (2) to you on review day and there is no reason for you to get anything less than an A- for the class unless you don't treat it seriously!!! TAKE HIM!!!! He is also hysterical too!,1
"He goes over his notes very fast and most of the time you can't read what they say, but he explains every thing that is on the board and is a pretty good teacher.",1
run away. take a different history class.,0
Professor Hays is a remarkable instructor.  He allows his students to learn and gain knowledge while relating it to real life situations and challenges.  His sincere concern for his students shows through his teaching.,1
"She's a great professor.  She teaches well.. quizzes aren't that bad but her exams aren't easy.. so you have to study your material really well.  But I recommend her if you want a nice, laid back teacher.  I wouldnt take Baccari or Cunningham... they are way too fast paced....",1
"Excellent supplemental/elective choice for those needing an option. The course expectations are organized well. The professor opens 2-3 weeks at a time, allowing those students that need to work ahead to do so. Personally, it was like an online counseling session; the course requires that students self-reflect... excellent class",1
It is a challenging course and he expects a lot from you but he really really works with you and helps you genuinely learn a lot.,1
By Far the GREATEST teacher EVER!!! So helpful and really cares about his students. I have never been so sad to finish a class!,1
"I enjoyed her lectures.  She's interesting and respectful.  She laughs at her own jokes!  She wants her students to learn and takes responsibility  in teaching.  If the majority of the class gets an answer wrong on the test, she 'assumes' she didn't make it clear.  The homework assignments. quizzes and tests are reasonable.  She's very helpful.",1
I had Professor Watkins for two classes. He really knows his stuff. I think the best part of the class was that what he talked about he had actually experienced it by being there. I really wish he taught more classes because I learned alot from him. His attendence is not mandatory but you will fall behind if you don't come.,1
"By far the best professor I've ever had! If you go to class and pay attention, you will do great! He has lots of extra credit and drops several test/quiz grades. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",1
"4.2 is outrageous! DR. John Creed is pure butter. This guy is one of the best professors on the planet. Nearly perfect. He would put us in s ""Socratic"" circle and let us talk.",1
"Tony Bass is THE BEST psychology professor.  Students at CPCC are lucky to have him as he teaches at the University as well.  I had him for both General Psychology and Abnormal Psychology which were both a pleasure to attend.  I think the hot or not is rediculous though, c'mon, that's inappropriate and irrelevant to a professor's ability to help the student grasp the material.",1
"Very difficult to communicate with.  Didn't repsond to email. Cares about students in class, but hated our daily discussion groups.",0
He is a rude person who uses words to hurt you if you don't understand the material making you feel dumb. when the course is very hard if you dont understand it with difficulty math involved. He slams his hands on tables and doesn't help you if you dont understand sometihng.,0
"Will is an entertaining lecturer. I was always engaged in class. However, the way the class is set out... prepared to be confused. He will give you 7 readings, and a podcast, and youtube videos, that need to be reviewed before class. Knowing what is important is difficult. Also, he refuses to answer my emails. Actually, my TA has yet to respond.",1
Hard grader.  Often goes off on a tangent and wastes class time.  Would not recommend.,0
"Class material is hard at first but gets easier. Don't worry. Hw, Paper, Midterm 20% Final 40%. She has trouble understanding your questions, she'll respond but it's not what you want to know. She is willing to help you though. If you go to office hours, she will explain concepts and calculations and try to help you understand",1
Overall great prof was very clear and used interesting examples to explain difficult concepts. Take advantage of her office hours she is really helpful.,1
"Easy online class. 4 parts of the course but you can go at your own time. Test are open for a week so whenever you get the chance, you can take the test. As long as you read the power points and book you are good. Only had 2 assignments and they were easy as we also had examples on how to do them.",1
"Three hours of her going over everything you learned in lecture. Not a lot of hand on stuff, mainly just listening to her talk and not understand any of it. Young more tech savvy version of Palitinus.",0
"Professor Howson, is such an amazing professor. She is well prepared to answer any questions you ask. Connects with students , really accurate with her grading . And accessible to help at any time . Lovely conversation with students, so active and keeps a safe and positive environment. I recommend taking this class.",1
"Everyone told me this class would be hard before I took it, but I liked this class. Its not an easy A, but if you do your work and do better then the majority of the class then you can get a B or an A. My biggest advice is to study daily. Otherwise he is very helpful when you need him.",1
"Erin is a good professor who wants her students to do well. Plus her tests are all multiple choice. You'll still have to study, but it's easier than any written tests I've had. My only complaints are that there is a LOT of info to go through in Micro (not her fault) and the class moves fast, and she has a valley girl voice (you get used to it).",1
"Dr. Marchetti is SO nice! She is fun in class, allows group work, and her exams do not have any surprises. She did flipped classroom when I had her and it was extremely effective. She is always available for questions too.",1
I dont recommend taking him online!! The semester is over in 1 week and I dont have grades for any of my paper projects and one of the tests that was taken on campus. He doesnt really respond to emails. Its a pretty easy class he just doesnt post grades so you dont know how you are doing in his class..,0
Do not take this professors online class he will not teach you anything. If you have experience in code you should be able to get a good grade but don't expect to learn much at all.,0
"He was so engaging and I totally got the lesson every time he taught.  Anyone who does not appreciate his way should to to Yale or MIT. Does not get more easy than with the lecture and the animation in the class room.  Oh, and the ""War stories"" made me know he has been there.",1
"I love this man. He's a gem. He's incredibly knowledgable and clearly passionate about what he teaches! I understand that he speaks slowly, which many people find boring, but I think it gives more depth to the content, since it makes you slow down and think about what he's saying. I like his style. Please be nice and show him some respect.",1
"Dr. Smith is an awesome teacher. He makes it easy to understand. He DOES expect you to carry your own weight. You will learn alot, and he does an excellent job preparing you for the real world. Who cares if he said he was lazy, he's not, he's the best ""dang"" teacher you'll ever have!",1
Great educator! Does not want tot bore students and is extremely helpful. Always!,1
"Worst professor I have encountered thus far. Like everyone else has said, we didn't get our first test back until a month and a half after we took it. He doesn't post assignments or readings until the night before they are due. He coughs and clears his throught 150+ times during class. Not helpful, arrogant. If you scheduled it drop it, now.",0
"Daniel Chase is a really good professor and he knows what he is talking about. He is definitely a fair professor and is super caring. The class is based on his lectures and the reading. There is a homework consisting of 20 questions (all 20 have sub-questions), homework quizzes when HW is turned in, online canvas quizzes, and midterms.",1
"Robyn Lynn Proud is a must have, I cannot stress it enough. Best 3 hour teacher!!",1
"the class is pretty easily as long as you actually study. the online tests are really simple. and for the final and mid-term he gives you a very detailed study guide if you actually use it you will do fine. he tries to make astronomy interesting, however it's very hard to actully do that",1
Best teacher Ive had @ State.,1
"Great professor, couldn't ask for a better one.  Experienced and educated in subject matter that is taught. General interest in the opinion of students and willingly to discuss things in detail for his own and the class' benefit. Overall, 10/10.",1
"She is hard, but you learn a lot.  If you want to learn, take Prater.  If you want an easier class, don't take her.",1
This professor is a mind blowing man and will have you look at a lot of things differently. This class is something that would have you think about how things should really be. A real brain teaser. This class is completely enjoyable.,1
excellent prof. Clear explanations. Funny too,1
"I TOOK HER CLASS ONLINE. AS LONG AS YOU KEEP UP WITH READING THE BOOK YOU'LL PASS THE CLASS. THERE ARE WEEKLY QUIZZES, DISCUSSION BOARD POSTS THAT YOU HACVE TO DO, AND EXAMS ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE BOOK. OVER ALL IT WAS A TYPICAL ONLINE CLASS, I WISH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR HER LECTURE.",1
"I really enjoyed his class, probably my favorite out of my junior year courses. Sucks that it was virtual, I could imagine he'd be even better in person. Lecture notes were easy to understand, HW due Monday, Quiz on it Wednesday, Test after three homeworks. Man was realistic in most parts of the course, but I guess a lot didn't see it that way.",1
"Mrs. Wang is really sweet. You have to show up and apply yourself, however she is fair and clearly states expectations in the beginning. She is easy to contact outside of class, and even makes herself available on the weekends.",1
Dr. King's class was horrible. He literally doesn't lecture about the material but rather posts various documents and makes you hunt for the information you need. Very unclear expectations about what he wants you to learn. When you do ask for clarification in class he hardly ever answers the question and just puts you in groups to figure it out.,0
"Gilmore was such a great professor! His class was my 1st upperdiv Sociol course and I got an A! He is a very fair grader and makes connections that students are able to understand in lectures. He does't have any slides but he tells you what is important for the test. Attendance isn't mandatory, but is strongly suggested! Take Gilmore if you can:)",1
Amira is hands down one of the most caring teachers at the university and I would take her again for Arabic. She is very approachable and is willing to work with you outside of class if you need help. She makes Arabic a fun language to learn and I recommend her to any people I know wanting to learn Arabic. 10/10 would recommend.,1
"Professor Liszka makes the her lectures really interesting. She is really professional and passionate about ancient history. You have to buy an app which she uses for attendance, homework, lecture questions etc. The class may seem overwhelming but if you do your part, you will be fine. Btw she takes attendance in the beginning and end of class.",1
one of the best courses that I took.,1
"Mrs. Noland is a genuinely kind, comical person and I was sad to see her class end. She takes time to get to know her students and cares about each of them as individuals. Everything that she assigns is explained in great detail and there was never a time I did not feel as if I did not have adequate time to prepare. I highly recommend her!",1
Gives a bit of extra credit that's super easy. Totally willing to help you with your papers/ assignments. Very flexible and will let you make up if you miss something. Super easy to pass. 2 easy papers and a final. Literally the best teacher I have ever had. Taking her again for 1C!,1
She grades discussion question assign. (which are due once a week) with either a 0 or 100! nothing in between! so just beware! attendance is a must b/c she puts class notes on tests but role isnt taken.Its a LOT of reading too.,1
"Obviously, this class is not even remotely easy (you should know this coming). Material is difficult to analyze and comprehend, and exams are PURELY essay-based regarding book content (he wrote the book). I would say lecture is mandatory, considering. GO TO CLASS, TAKE NOTES, AND READ THE BOOK. You can pass, just try. It's GE, right?",1
"Professor Christensen is a PHENOMENAL professor! He is extremely funny when he teaches, and he is very easygoing. His essays are a piece of cake, and his lectures are interesting. I am so grateful to have him as my English professor during a semester that he says is his last semester of teaching before he retires. Im so happy that I had him.",1
"Some of the exam questions on her test were confusing and debatable.  The final essay prompt was very confusing along with a few other assignments, plus she sometimes did not post the lecture notes until the night before.  However if you study the powerpoints and read the book you should do fine.",1
"Mrs. Tersteegen is a good teacher. Buying the thin textbook is a joke and a waste of money. Thicker textbook we used often, other one twice. You don't have assignments sucks to be you points off. Definitely learn some things.",1
"His questions in class lingered on and on. Unimportant topics that he had some hidden interest in were just driven. His tests were okay. In the essay portion he wants every single last detail. I drew a chart, and cited him word-for-word and still got a 4 out of 6 on one question.",1
"A friend recommended him, I wasn't expecting to enjoy history this much. He makes everything so interesting and easy to understand. I was able to hold a conversation with someone and exlain son many historical events. I was amazed by his way of instructing the online class. There is a lot of reading and information but if you follow along its easy",1
"I took Professor McLawhons 5 week online summer course and it was a great choice. His instructions are very clear and he is a fairly easy grader. There were a lot of assignments per week, but none of them were hard. The material he has you read is very informative, and his discussion board questions really get you thinking. I highly recommend.",1
Dr. vohs is more focused on getting through the class rather then making sure we no the material. If you try to get help from him in his office he  seems rushed and annoyed. Take this class if you already know everything there is to know about chemistry because he isn't going to teach you anything,0
"Great online 380 class, few quizzes and tests. You don't need the book just the internet. You have to do 5 discussions but they are not too difficult. Good teacher.",1
His background in history and his practical involvement in tough appeals make his insights invaluable.,1
Professor Chooljian is an amazing professor who knows her stuff! She gives a lot of extra credit and curves both lecture and lab exams (for lecture she curves off the highest score). You also learn way more than what she actually puts on the tests. It is possible to pass the class but if you want an A then you will have to work for it.,1
"she is a great teacher, i have had her for 2 classes now and she is greatly helpful in both classes. i would strongly recommend taking a class with her if you could",1
She was a guest lecturer for our class and she was awesome!!! She's young and so funny! Her class was more discussion based rather than powerpoint. I learned a lot from her lecture-it had great content. She was great and I hope she starts teaching more!,1
"The test are worth 70% of our grade and dont follow his lectures. He promised a large curve and didnt follow through, which was annoying since this class is lecture heavy and moved to be remote. A 1% curve is probably the stupidest thing ive ever seen especially when the average for each of the exam was below a C.",0
"works as a flipped classroom (lectures for hw, discussion & practice in class), caring and willing to help, funny, tries many different ways to explain things (which is great), sometimes makes lecture videos late but it's not a huge problem, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, tests & weekly quizzes are straightforward and you'll know what to study for.",1
"Professor Wejksnora is a fantastic lecturer and hilarious man. His tests are not to easy, but if you study the material you'll do fine. Overall i would definitely recommend him.",1
"Barely showed up to class & had no idea what was going on ever & got an A two semesters in a row (ENC1101 & ENC 1102). Easiest class I have ever taken. Grumpy teacher but if you keep your binder organized you basically get an A. Also, he lets class out super quickly. ",0
"The midterm and final were comprised of exactly the same questions that were on the reviews, so if you study those well, you'll ace the tests. It's a difficult class that requires outside research if you want to make an A.",0
"TAKE HIM. He's super funny and really makes you think about how we handle corrections in america. All quiz points are extra credit so read the chapter before class to get max points! Tests are open note, 1 group presentation, 2 papers about any topic in CJ you want. grades HARD on APA format so beware of that. He makes it hard to NOT pass his class",1
"Best class I've taken at UM. He is a great lecturer, very funny, and very kind. When he asks if you have any questions, he means it; he will stop class to clarify. I also participated in his archaeological dig, the Gabii Project. I would not recommend the dig, as it was somewhat unprofessional and pretty expensive.",1
"Professor Robinson was great for me, he responded to my emails, he notified me if my work was not uploading and sent request to resend. He even offered to have a meeting in the advisors office or talk to me after class. His assignments were fine, but his tests were VERY hard. He was very approachable and he gave test guides, so for me I enjoyed him",1
I took her for 1101 and 1102. She's really nice and approachable. She always sends out a study guide before the test that basically tells you exactly what's on it.,1
"10/10 would recommend, this class taught me so much about the human body and also who I want to become. Mr Prey cares about his students and challenges us to do our best and gives us opportunities of success. Theres never be a dull moment in his class. Make sure you study, it will pay off in the end!!",1
"Professor Deluna is the kind of teacher you wanna take again because one semester with the guy just isn't enough. He makes what snoozy old history teachers make boring, pretty darn interesting! Funny guy, wish I needed more history classes to fulfill because I'd take them all with this guy!",1
I have never got an A on a math test until this class! She is clear and really wants to help you understand the math. The note sheets are very helpful!,1
You'll acquire next-level independent study skills - a real gem!,0
"Very passionate man about American History. His lectures do get outta hand since he doesn't use a power point or blackboard page. He scribbles everything on a board. Tests are easy though. He gives you 30 concepts and you choose 5 to write about. If you want an easy 'A' I would suggest taking it. Any history book will work for this class, trust me",1
"Bret was a really good professor. You do quite a bit of essays and projects in this class, along with the mandatory student-learning portion. However, the student-learning wasn't as bad as I originally thought and he puts a lot of time and effort into making sure you understand his feedback on your essays.",1
"Not the most difficult class in the world, but tough grader on papers. Show up on time and stay for the whole class to get the most out of everything. Read the materials that she puts online and you should do well. SHE WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER WRITER. Two tests and three papers. Paper topics are very interesting! Highly recommend",1
"Not a hard class if you stay caught up.  if you fall behind it may prove to be more difficult than I experienced.  Helped considerably with my writing as I learned to edit, and edit, and edit.  Definitely worth taking.",1
"LTF is the best deal in town! The gym is nice, clean and quiet. They always have people on hand to help you or answer questions. They always have fresh towels for you. Don't forget your ID or you can't get in! Make sure you keep track of your workouts... EASY A if you show up.",1
"My favorite course at Walsh. I kept all books after class ended and still refer to them almost monthly. Do all extra credit including the grammar book. Tons of reading and tons of work, but I found it valuable and eye opening. Do a little of the living case study each week to make the end of class more manageable. I would highly recommend McHann.",1
Wonderful teacher! Dr. Lewis is the best!! I would recommend this class to anyone!,1
"Dr. Wooten is an amazing teacher and 315 was a great course but there is a LOT of work required. Expect to write over 3000 words, read several chapters, and complete a project every week. On the bright side, there are no exams.",1
Glen walks by my computer every day and laughs . I'm trying my best Glen. I'm trying,1
I recommend not taking this class. He is funny sometimes and very sweet but it is so boring and all he does is talk. Your grade will be based solely off of 3 exams and a four page paper. Thats it.,1
Junior seminar is great with him.,1
"Map quizzes every wed and regular quizzes every fri. She's an awesome teacher she gives you the quizzes you just have to find the answers in the book, map quizzes if your good at remembering things really well then your do fine if your not might be a little bit difficult.",1
"Be prepared to read A LOT. Always gives a heavier assignment over the weekend and often emails us Saturday afternoon with an additional assignment due Sunday before 5, or for class Monday. Class discussions are engaging- but make sure to actually know the information and participate. Participation grade is major. One midterm and take-home final.",1
"Dr. Beymer-Farris is a wonderful woman! The work she has done is incredibly inspiring and she genuinely cares about her students' mental and physical well-being. She thinks critically, pushes students to think critically about presented subjects, and is willing to learn from students. She also has a vast knowledge about what she teaches.  A+ :)",1
DJB is my most favorite professor I've ever had! She truly cares about her students and prepares you well for exams. She keeps everyone laughing and engaged in her class at the same time. I can't say enough good things about her!,1
"Fischer, while passionate about philosophy, rambles. However, if you go to discussion and actually read the assignments, you really don't even have to listen to him.",1
"Best prof, try and you will get the best grade you deserve.",1
"I like Dustin as a person but his class has horrible grade structure! 90% of your grade will be based on questions and problems that he has never shown you in class. And there is no homework, no tutor, cant see what you did wrong on the exams and Dustin is no help besides telling you that you suck pretty much. No joke, I hope you the best of luck",0
"Duba is an awesome guy.  If you ask a question, he will answer it...  for the most part.  He tries to teach you how to find answers for yourself rather than just giving it to you straight.  He wants you to learn, not just to regurgitate information for the final.",1
He is a nice and funny guy but I would not take him again. He acts like he offers so much help but really doesn't. You really need to know your stuff to pass this class.,0
"I love Prof. Galan. I would definitely take him again. He is so passionate about history and he really cares for his students. When it comes to the tests all you really have to do is study and that is all. Great Professor, take him!!!!",1
"Not too bad of a class. I already knew most of the information, so that made it easy. It was incredibly boring, though, and my head was constantly dropping down because I was falling asleep every other day. She definitely saw me lmao! Tons of extra credit, though. Final was only over three chapters.",0
"By far one of the best professors I have taken. Very relaxed and personable, wants to ensure her students understand the material. Handouts are very helpful, shows work step by step in ppt and on the board. Exams are 2/3 of final grade, no cheat sheets. Comprehensive final included in drop. Wish she taught more courses, would definitely take again!",1
Excellent lecturer. Very articulate and comprehensible. Would recommend this class.,1
This professor is not truly professor I think she bought her degree. She avoids teaching because she does not know. I think she is getting old and start losing her mind but she still comes to FGCU. Avoid this old hag and take it with someone else,0
"this professor was terrific to work with, and I would love to have her again.",1
"Do NOT take this class. He gives little to no feedback, and is not willing to help struggling students. He changed his curriculum, so now students are required to write 3 papers and take 3 exams (each exam has an essay). Hardest english class I have ever taken. Do not recommend Prof. Landrum. He grades extremely harshly. Not an enjoyable class.",0
Stephen is a horrible prof His grading SUCKS. More than 17 people dropped out of the class and maybe 5 made it to the end with probably 2 actually passing the class If you get a tiny part of like a 10 mark question wrong then the entire question is wrong Its basically impossible to pass unless you have a photographic memory doesnt care for student,0
"Having taken a course with Professor Lopez before, he is still very interested in challenging one's creativity when investigating Renaissance Drama. His lectures are fine, though the content can be a bit much to take in at times. I definitely recommend taking any courses you can with Professor Lopez.",1
"He rocks!! 100% my favorite teacher Ive had at CSUSM. He is super funny, and his lectures are so entertaining! I was genuinely excited to go to class and I didnt have a particular interest in history to begin with. If you need to take a history GE take Al-Marashi!",1
"It's a very easy class just do the work before it's due and read the assignments. We have a lot of discussions over what we read and for the most part, it's good. He will look out for you and he's an all-around good guy",1
"So far I like this class because there is somuch I didn't know about resumes, cover letters, and how to research the company of a job position you want to apply for.",1
I'm an A student and got a B+ in the class. Tough grader but not to the point where it's notably unfair. She's an awesome person and super Australian. The lectures are really boring especially for the first few weeks. If you're deciding between this and other bioethics courses I guess I'd say this is a safe choice but not by any means an easy A.,1
"He is extremely lecture heavy. However, hes just reading from slides that arent even his! When he goes off script, he just confuses the class. He knows what the topic is but hes not good at articulating anything. It feels like hes still stuck in 1972. Theres no curve too and he LOVES saying it too. Avoid him. Hes not mean just a bad professor",0
"Craft is no joke. It's hard, no matter who the professor is. Sheffler is very nice, and he is really funny. He will help you if you ask for it. He tries to make the class as painless as possible, but it's still tough. He is a medieval historian, so that's alot of the reading. I had to drop the class. Nice guy, but I won't retake Craft with him.",1
His classes are really interesting! The course in general is a great one but I loved Fenster's lectures and his little stories that always had a twist in them :) He's a great prof to have :),1
"There was a lot of work to be done in this class. I liked that she let you work ahead. If you emailed her on a Sunday, she got back to you in a couple of hours. I would take one of her classes again.",1
I took the one year 101-103 sequence with her. She is very enthusiastic and friendly. The class does move fast but it is very fun and interactive.,1
"Meyer is a pretty good prof. He is a good discussion facilitator, which I think is one of the most important components of an ethics class. Also, he explains the philosophical arguments (which are sometimes pretty complex) quite well, which is extremely helpful. If you're interested in the class ahead of time, I would recommend him.",1
"Really smart guy that clearly cares about what he's teaching.  Tough grader for most, but if you put time and thought into your work he can tell and will reward you for it. He's not easy, but you'll learn a lot.",1
"Dr. Searfoss is a good professor who cares about students and is passionate about the subject. Your grade is made-up of 2 exams, participation, quizzes, a group presentation, and a paper. There is a lot of reading, and you do have to work hard on assignments to do well. Dr. Searfoss is reasonable and fair; her class is interesting and do-able.",1
"Super easy class.  Tells you exactly what to expect on the tests.  Lots of reading required, but just skimming and understanding the basic plot will do.  Very minimal work outside class.  Take him if you have a hard course load.  Negative commentors shouldn't be in college.",1
Kelli has great industry experience from before she was a professor and does a great job of incorporating that into her lectures. If you show up prepared and ready to participate Kelli is a great teacher. If you just want to sit in the back and never talk it will be harder for you to get the full experience of her class.,1
"It was a very easy class, some of the in class projects are kinda weird but overall it was a cool class. And yes, the teacher is hot.",1
"Professor Keeling is very nice and pleasant. That being said, she's not a great teacher. She asks for something in a paper and will then take off for it. She also puts her views into what she teaches. And she holds class long virtually every class period. It's really annoying with a six o'clock class and I'm trying to get dinner.",0
"Professor Evans' class was unexpectedly my favorite this semester. He works hard to make material interesting, challenging, and relevant to his students. His teaching style and assignments are engaging and make you think in positive ways. I highly recommend taking a class with him.",1
"Lectures were helpful, labs are long and annoying but that's to be expected. Lowest exam out of 4 is dropped (you may not have to take the final). DON'T BUY OR RENT THE BOOK. Practice problems are posted online, use them to prepare for the exams.",1
Professor knows what she is teaching. She gives you ID's every class (like vocabulary words) which is going to be on the midterm(2) and final. need to REALLY study those and this class is a HEAVILY reading class too!!,1
"Dr. Lim is a really nice guy but his lectures can definitely be hard to pay attention to. Thermo II is a very challenging course no matter who you take it with. Dr. Lim gives out extremely detailed notes so for nearly every homework and test problem, theres a very close example problem in the notes.",1
Took online mini-mester for this class. Professor always gave updates and frequently sent messages to students. Very approachable and is quick to answer any and all questions. Very active online.,1
Just a fantasitc guy who wants you to get an A. Go to every class and take the notes he gives and you're getting a high grade for sure.,1
"If you want to gain knowledge and are interested in Cultural Anthropology or another Anthropology in general amazing, passionate prof. and a class I'd to take again. Fast talker, but will repeat anything if you ask him too. Reading quizzes which you really have to read assigned articles to get a good grade :) ",1
AMAZING instructor. Never once was lecture boring with her. She is very intelligent and funny. Jill will take out any extra time necessary to help you understand the material or if you just need someone to talk to. She tests off of her power points and the book is more supplemental to that. You are very LUCKY if you end up with her!!,1
Professor Snaza is an extremely caring professor. His main goal is to actually teach and prepare his students for the future rather than focusing on grades. He is very passionate about his work and is super knowledgeable about the topics he teaches.,1
"Very nice and experienced professor. You will be graded by only a few things on this class. Although they are not difficult, if you don't want to be worried about grading during the whole semester, don't fail any of these tests.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had. I'm not a good writer by any means and he did anything but help improve my skills. He is unintelligent, ignorant, and disorganized. Assigns to much work and grades harshly, assignments are misleading and lack optimal choices for questions. DO NOT TAKE HIM. ",0
"Loved this class and this professor! You will use the textbook, but it's very interesting. She is super informative, and will help you however she can on any of the assignments. Highly recommend!",1
"Really good class discussion, interesting scenarios",1
I couldn't imagine a more self-congratulatory professor. How could you screw up craft of fiction? Use it as your podium/back-slap/let me tell you about me and the writing process therapy session.,0
"Metzl is the man, and his class is both interesting and easy. His powerpoints were awesome, and there were two brief papers to write, on top of a semester long project and easy final exam. He's got a great sense of humor and really seemed like he cared. Highly recommend to MHS majors",1
"She is a very nice woman and who kinda funny at times. She is probably the best finance teacher for principles of finance. She teaches well, but her tests are rather hard because they are very different from the review materials. Easy B and certainly not hard to get an A if you study, study, and study.",1
"This class was full of interesting content. The professor was a little forgetful at times, but overall a very nice person who was clearly very passionate about the subjects. I would recommend this class to fulfill the ethnic studies requirement or just for fun!",1
"Moved to online courses and he did not adjust material at all, actually had more work to begin with. Constantly ignored emails and uploaded materials late. The class became more work than all my other courses combined. Spent 7 hours on one exam that he said would take 2 hours max. Worst professor at wcu and hoping to get him removed",0
"Pattern of class is very clear and it's easy to get into a rhythm with the work, Dangerous to fall behind because work can piles up, Tests are written fairly poorly, but they are multiple-choice and she gives you two chances so you can usually figure it out, the KEY to this class is taking notes on EVERY chapter (mostly the main terms and summaries",1
Smart and kind professor.,1
"Confusing set-up. Sometimes it takes over a week, well over, to get grades back... and that is no bueno!! I would suck it up and take Jerry James, at least you will learn something in his course!!",0
"Well.. BIO 1082 literally gives you headaches. First, the lab is the most unnecessary lab ever created. It has absolutely NO correlation with the class. Regarding the class, Dr. Thompson lectured and 95% of the time you have no idea what to study for on the test and she is not much help either.",0
"Excellent professor, very helpful.",1
Great guy who definitely understands that this material is difficult.  He is very funny and very laid back.  Good grading system as well. Take him if you can!,1
"Lectures were easy to follow, especially when you print out the online lecture slides ahead of time.  He is eager to answer the student's questions and make sure they understand the concepts of microbiology.  The lab portion was hands-on and added to my learning.  He was very helpful and made sure we were ready to perform our own lab experiments. ",1
"This instructor has only one volume when teaching, it's yelling.  There's a reason why her class is the last to fill up during registration..... Avoid taking her!",0
He didn't make his grading criteria clear at all and then scolded the whole class for missing the point of the paper. He will make your life so much harder than it needs to be. Take literally any other professor for this class if you can.,0
"The course is not terribly difficult and his teaching is not that bad (lots of examples) but the final exam is a horror, there wasn't enough time and it was extremely hard. Also, the Ferguson text is incomprehensible and reads like something from the dark ages.",0
"She is a great teacher. Her class is well organized and she stays on point.  The assignments are clear, and if you don't understand she will help you. However, she is a tough grader you have to try hard for an A.",1
"I have never loved a teacher more. Sister Kirkham really cares, she works with and understands every student. If you do the work and try your best you will do well. She is all about helping her students succeed. I found a love for writing after taking this class.",1
"Professor Callaway is one of the most delightful people at Fordham. Her class on the Old Testament, which had the potential to be incredibly boring, was one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Fordham. She is a tough grader, so be prepared to do the work, but it never feels like a chore because she makes the OT interesting. ",1
Professor Dattolo is an excellent professor who dedicates himself to his work but also dedicates himself to the success of his students. It was always a pleasure to go to his class because you knew that you would get the respect from him. His lectures were amazing and easy to follow. I am so glad that I had him for a professor!,1
Get her if you can! She is super nice if you work hard and show up for class. I have always hated giving speeches and she made it fun.,1
Stacy is a great teacher. It is easy to tell that she is really into what she is teaching. She has a BUNCH of experience and loves to share about them. She is a great speaker as well. Stacy has a great sense of humor paired with knowlege in the business field.,1
"Not hard but not helpful.  All you do is read slides all class.  Tests are the only thing counted for grade 20Q multiple choice and he curves. Didn't make us ""present"" our final project either just turn it in. All in All just an ok prof",0
"We're taking an online program called ReadingPlus and its the WORST. I get it done, but I dont learn anything from it. Has nothing to do with reading really. It FORCES us to speed read. we should be able to read at our own pace. And forces us to advance when we're not ready. The whole program feels like a video game. Horrible program.",0
"Professor Chase is an amazing and very passionate professor and love what he teaches. Though I took him 1 year ago, He really cared about his students and he loves doing his job and is passionate by far one of my favorite professors at MJC though I am not a good test taker I managed to pass Astro and learned so much.",1
"Monotone, non-existent, Tough grader,shows zero effort towards class and teaching. Sometimes uses his phone in class.",0
"Didn't feel like I got enough out of the teacher. The class was great and I learned a lot, but I wish the teacher would have helped more. Constantly had to ask for additional instructions. I was extremely ill and he gave me a redo on an assignment, but only for a couple more hours. I wrote him when I was super sick.",0
He is amazing! I was skeptical about taking him because he had no reviews but he is awesome! He lets you take all your exams in groups if you want to. Do the homework and study and you will pass.,1
From time to time his lectures can get a little dry but he'll tell you upfront. He is very aware of his students and their attitudes towards his class. If you're honest with him and genuinely want help he is awesome! He always had us laughing and the info stuck. Very recommendable if you're willing to put in a little time. ,1
"Mr. MacCabe is an amazing teacher. I was nervous to take his class because of the other reviews on here, however, I am SO glad I did. Very understanding teacher, helps you out personally if you do not understand something, and will email back right away with scores and responses. Such an amazing teacher and a very interesting class.",1
"All these comments explain exactly what she is. She's great and I've never had a professor that cared so much. My grade might not be good, but it's my fault. All i know is that it's so easy & enjoyable. I love her class and love her way of teaching.",1
This professor only lectures and doesn't let others talk. Hard to participate or be engaged when so negative and rude.,0
"The class was basic in how to use Microsoft Word-2003. Attendance is expected, several projects are assigned, but they are not overwhelming. Book is needed for exercises. Very helpful, willing to assist in any way. Class can be a lot of fun with the right mix of students.",1
"When everybody in the class got a bad grade on the first exam, he said do better. Not very respectable and cannot explain things very well. You learn mostly through the online homework.",0
Super interesting. Not an jerk. What more could you really ask for?,1
"Her lectures changed the way I thought about English and life, and now, I am not scared of writing essays anymore. She gives all the tools to succeed and learn in the class. There is a paper almost every week, discussion boards and grammar quiz. She teaches you how to apply English in every aspect of your life. A life-changing class.",1
"Extremely attractive and helpful, Makes class enjoyable. Changed my whole look on Philosophy. But one must do their readings and take good notes.",1
"Great professor, great guy! Dr. Cogan loves sharing his knowledge on cinema. He teaches Irish cinema, Eastern European, and Japanese cinema.",1
No Comments,1
"She is the most disorganized professor I have taken in my undergrad education. This means that assignments don't make sense, but she still gives them out like anything. With that, she still is the toughest grader who won't give you any margin for error even though the assignments themselves have so many errors in them. Worst professor...",0
"This was a logic class and I took it online. WOW. The course material gradually got more difficult. The last Chapter was brutal!!! Make the best effort you can in the first chapters. Dr. Childs makes it as painless as possible but with this subject, one can only do so much!",1
"Yue Lao shi cares so much about her students. She truly loves teaching. She always does her best to make herself available for students, and when she helps you she does so in the kindest way possible. She understands that her students top priority is not her class but their major work, and she's always considerate of that.",1
Everything is done through Pearson so know your deadlines and complete them you will get a good grade. The powerpoints are available through Pearson that helps with concepts and the math nature. He posts videos on D2L on how to do some of the math so if you save your excel sheets from the homeworks it makes taking the exams much easier.,1
"Very easy. Writing essay heavy but very easy. Get ready to print a lot of though. However, if you're looking for an easy class then he's the one for you.",1
If you put the time into the class you can easily get a good grade. He gave us a study guide for every exam and if you study that and go over the homework questions you'll do great. Overall I thought he was a really good teacher.,1
"Very intimidating at first, but she looks for your best interest, nice lady and is very helpful",1
"Professor Shields is great fun to talk to and listen to.  He is perhaps just a too laid back. I feel that making the textbook reading option was a real missed opportunity as the book is full of amazing info.  I would like to see his genre class go into a bit more detail from the book. Because of the laidback style, it was tough to prepare for tests",1
"Well, I'll start with the good: Firstly, she's peppy and sometimes makes funny jokes. Yeah, that's about it. She has a pretty thick accent, which isn't her fault, but she speaks so quickly and blasts through so many topics that I always found myself with a dull headache at the end of class. There are NO practice materials and feedback is minimal.",0
"Her lectures are based from the textbook so I suggest reading the textbook ahead of time then going to lecture for a clearer understanding. Your grade is based off of 3 exams, 1 group project and a few other assignments, but the assignments vary depending if you have her large lecture or smaller class.",1
"Mrs. Young is so understanding & gives multiple opportunities to keep a good grade. This class is fairly easy to begin with, but she explains the material clearly & gives a chance to ask questions or seek help at any time. The final exam can be exempted if you have an A at the end of the semester! She doesn't count attendance but expects effort.",1
"Good professor, can be a bit of a jerk, but fair exams and interesting lectures",1
Loved this class. It was on dystopias and survival and we read all kinds of great books like the walking dead comics and handmaids tale. Catherine was down to earth and really nice (AND a cool english accent)! I dont like english or writing but I feel like I really know stuff about the books and society that I didnt before. Would def take again.,1
"She's an all around sweetheart! I learned a lot from her, and she knows a lot about the field for sure. I would highly recomend her!",1
"If you are not fluent in Spanish, you will struggle a lot. He depends on you to ask, and when you ask he might not explain it well. ",0
"Dr. Keeling is kind and very patient. Her concentration in young adult and children's literature shows and makes the class much more interesting. Quizzes follow the day's reading, just 5 questions. Small group discussion before class compilation is helpful and fun. She is very clear about grading and her expectations and will love to help you!",1
"Awesome professor, very funny and understanding. Attendance is *not* a grade but she will give you extra credit if your attendance is high - and you're not likely to pass if you skip. Everything she talks about is on the quiz with the addition of one or two things you'll have to read on for the exams. Homework is relatively easy. Easy class.",1
"He's really strict with attendance and being on time, so be careful with that. The assignments are 100% writing, and what he wants you to say isn't always obvious, but his office is always open for questions.",1
"She is very politically biased; also made a lot of rude, sarcastic comments to me about my grades when handing back tests, in front of other students no less, without my having said a word to her. Very unprofessional and her tests have nothing to do with the reading or lecture, which is baffling.",0
"Mrs. Johnson is very religious and conservative. Shes not afraid to make that known. The whole semester was her showing us documentaries against abortion, homosexuality, and basically any other hot button topic that should be left out of the classroom. I was in high school at the time and looking back, I realized how inappropriate she truly acted.",0
"Professor Black was decent, but he was very subjective in his grading. I got an A in the class, but  I had to go talk to him before every paper I submitted to fix nit-picky little errors. I also got like 50 percent on the participation points even though I was never late, never missed a class, took good notes, and asked lots of questions.",1
"Professor is really rude and hard to communicate with. Grades seem random. We watched movies with no assignments attached to them. Easy A but useless class, didn't learn anything. Great for someone who just wants the credit, doesn't want to learn or do much work. ",1
"Dovidio is a good teacher and he knows his stuff. His video assignments are not complicated, just make sure everything is lit well and positioned correctly and he will be happy as long as you try. Try to show him work as often as you can. The only thing about him is he repeats himself ALOT but try to have patience! He has connections!",1
"The best professor I have taken a class under at Purdue. Grading is harsh, but extremely fair. He is very available outside of class and truly cares about his students. One of the best!",1
"Brent's a great teacher.  Be prepared to learn a ton of information, and study, study, study.  The class work is very involved, and at times it's difficult to find the information.  Be dedicated to doing your homework and it will all work out.  He's a really good teacher.  Be prepared to get a really good education!",1
Great teacher.  Love his stories which actually help you remember the curriculum.  One of the best at ACC.,1
Doctor Heth is a great teacher who also cares about his students.  His teaching helps integrate our faith with real life.  I wish there were more professors like him!,1
"Easiest class ever. Show up, do the assignments and you'll be golden. And the professor will help you with anything if you ask him.",1
"Took his online summer class. Being that it was a shorter semester, the workload was a little heavier. As long as you put in the work, and do everything on time, you will do good on the final (it was in-person). I learned a lot, wish he taught Stats.",1
LOVE DR BROWN SO CHILL,1
"Prof. Maojoudi was a good teacher, he taught at a fast pace that was hard to learn, but he made sure we understood by asking us if we had questions . The examples he used were great and is related to real life. His quizzes were ok, but his exams were hard. There is a 2 page essay and homework that you would have to do every week. Great experience.",1
"G.O.A.T! Great class, simple online quizzes. The lectures are online, great sense of humor, he tells you what will be on the test in the lectures. I read the book to find the other answers for the test, everything is in the book and lectures. Easy-A tests, it is open book and open notes. I am taking his other classes as well.",1
Great professor! I took him for ENG 1101 and 1102 and passed both classes with A's. He's very professional and passionate about the subject he teaches. He has the entire class outlined day-to-day so you know when everything is due and what you'll be doing in class. I also feel he's very generous when it comes to grading papers.,1
"I took Konya for Math 7,8, and 15. He is caring, and emphasizes that he is there to help you succeed. He was such an inspiration to me, and is the reason I am now pursuing math further. His test questions are pretty easy and some come straight from the textbook. His grading can be tough but it's helped me improve my solutions to make more sense.",1
Take her classes. She's super nice and makes the classes easy.,1
Hard but really informed professor.,1
Hardest course I've ever taken!!!,1
"this is a immersion style class which makes it very difficult to overcome for first year students. spanish is already spoken fast, which makes it hard to learn crucial grammar rules. She cares about her students and is a organized teacher. Last thing is the class moves very fast",1
"Lectures are a bit messy, as she jumps from one thing to another and it's somewhat difficult to stay on track. Projects and labs are fine, although take some time if you are not that deep into IT. You still can get an A without even taking the final, providing that you do everything on time.",1
"Passionate about the material but she expects a lot and I think she doesn't get French is hard for some,especially talking.  Class was way too big. She really likes the subject but she could be more patient with the class when readings are long and difficult without a list of vocab words. Study guides were helpful sometimes but stressful too.",1
"Let me just say one thing... I have NEVER met a professor who is so into her classes as Professor Rasowsky is. She is absolutely an inspiration and she enjoys being there and teaching. She is so awesome, I recommend her to EVERYONE. Theres a lot of group work that she usually picks herself, but she's amazing. Best professor ever.",1
"Unclear criteria in exams. Teaches his own developed tool that doesn't work half of the time and expects you to peform like you are a 10 years experienced developer. Just like any other professor, he is just sweet on the top but will not give you any marks. SKIP SKIP SKIP.",0
"Professor Crane is a good professor. She is very sweet and makes the class super easy. She lets the students kind of ""pick"" when they want to turn things in which makes the class easy to pass. She brings in many inspirational guest speakers, which was my favorite part of the class.",1
"This professor is excellent and very easy to talk to!  She goes over the material thoroughly and doesn't hold your hand.  She expects students do their work.  She's strict with deadlines and expectations.  Projects are self-explanatory and kinda fun! Tests are ""open notes"" on 3x5"" cards only - double-sided. Very fair grading scheme! Enjoyed it!!",1
"WORST CLASS EVER TAKEN! This teacher gives NO feedback and does NOT respond to emails; he says to allow up to 5 DAYS to respond to an email?! He should not be allowed to get away with that for an online class. Very hard to communicate with. His assignments are confusing and not clear. I would never take him again, waste of money and time.",0
Took this online and only had two major assignments that are possible as long as you follow directions. Three exams and they were all over a few chapters. As long as you study and then the assignments in on time you'll get an A.,1
"He is very well informed and is always talking about current events. This man is woke!! There is like 8 one and half pages essay you write every other week, a midterm, group project, book report, and final. As long as you listen to his lectures its a pretty easy class. 10/10 recommend!",1
"She was a true inspiration and she is a very kind soul, she made my Spanish class close-knit. She's so sweet, a motherly figure and pushes you to do your best. Her class was the highlight of my semester. Do your homework and study and you will do great!",1
"This was the first sociology class where I got an easy A. 3 Papers throughout the entire semester that are due whenever you feel like giving them in. He lets u revise it to get an A and he really cares about you. You would be an idiot not to take him. highly recomend taking this man,",1
"I'm convinced Professor Brannigan-Wisniewski wrote that comment on December 14th talking about a ""disgruntled"" student. Honey - face the reality of what the students are saying and get over it. We didn't enjoy your class and you clearly aren't the best at communications contrary to what your profession might state. Reflect on yourself! Disgusting",0
"Mr. Smith is a very nice guy.  He genuinely loves teaching, and it shows.  He knows materials science very well, and loves to see students become interested in it too.   He can answer all of your questions, and always makes himself available to do it.  I really enjoyed his course.  ",1
"She gives quizzes almost every class, and she tries to trip you up on them. If there's not a quiz that day then you have group work.  Attendance is a must; due to the  quizgroup points. One of those professors that want her class to be your top priority, even with four other classes. ",1
"I had Melaine for Engl100 online and she was a solid choice. The course was fairly easy: 4 essays (in total) and usually 2 forum posts (weekly). She gives great feedback on essays and the marking is clear. Her course requires 3 textbooks, however I only ever used the Wascana Anthology book for the readings.",1
"Terrible Teacher, doesn't teach, has trouble staying on track.",0
"If you are taking PHIL 1010 this is the professor you want. There is a reason a majority of his classes finish with A's. You must ALWAYS come to class, do the online discussions (NO ESSAYS) and you will pass with flying colors. Great lectures and prepares you very well for his tests. I thought i would hate this class but i really enjoyed it.",1
"Funniest person I've ever met. Takes time to explain things. However I don't feel like I am learning anything because lectures are very short. Quizzes online, final exam is field trip.",1
"One of my favorite HR courses, the learning style is more laid back, she shares her extensive work history and relates it to the topic. Very flexible, just participate in class and do the work. its not a heavy workload either. I only used the textbook to study but if you take good enough notes you may not need it. ",1
"Very easy  class, 4 Essays and 1 group presentations. Lectures are very  boring , don't expect to watch modern movies very often, usually the movies in focus are black and white or from foreign countries. Easy A as long as your essays are good.",0
"Super organized! Love her, great professor. I hate english and she made the class fun and easy. Great writing tips, cares for students! Attendance is mandatory. Gives study guide that are 120% exactly like her test (mid term and final). Study that and there is no way you will fail!",1
AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word. He makes you read the chapter in the book and then you are allowed to revive lecture videos afterwards which I think is ridiculous. This is honestly the worst class Ive taken and I regret doing it online as well.,0
I highly recommend his class. Amazing instructor. He breaks down math very well and will work with you if you're struggling.,1
"Expect an easy A. She gives study guides a few days before the test, and then gives you the answers. The questions  on the study guide are EXACTLY the same as the test questions. Her lectures consist of a lot of videos in which another professor is teaching. She also assigned homework that asks questions about the video, and questions from textbook",1
Professor Richards is an amazing teacher to have. He focuses more on teaching the subject rather than giving out a lot of homework. He does give out homework but its very manageable. Its an online textbook and you answer questions on the readings. Then he teaches it in class. He wants to make sure you understand it. Thats his priority. Hes caring!!,1
"10/10 Would take again. In class work is easy and fun, you get to be creative. Tests require you to study so grab a textbook! He is super laid back and helpful.",1
"Ms.Jacobo was a real nice teacher but she made us by all our books with in 2 weeks and some we didnt even use till the end of the semester.She's strict on cell phones and her tests are real easy,sometimes she treated us like middle school kids.oh and she let us out early sometimes",1
"great teacher, definitely will have to put some effort into your grade. Had 6 quizes, he dropped 2, a mid term and a final which you get to use a piece of paper, and a paper which wasnt that bad. Overrall good class and cool teacher",1
"Ms. Olson is very intelligent and gives interesting lectures. Almost no homework besides two projects and studying. Very helpful. Pay attention to the lectures, don't miss classes, and youll be more than fine. :)",1
"Good guy. You have to put the work in throughout the entire semester - I didnt and had a tough time with the final exam. Teaches accounting in a unique way, which helps you stay focused on an otherwise mundane, difficult subject.",1
"This guy here really cannot teach. If you don't self teach i guarantee you will fail the course. His exams are easy until you get to the 10 point long answer question. Even if you answer the question correctly you can get a 5/10, this will drop your test mark 1 or 2 letter grades. Literally don't take his class if you care about your mental health",0
"Good class, good professor, learned lots, she is passionate about class. She does pick favorites, if you are a young, middle-class white male, she will LOVE you.",1
"Amazing! One of the most engaging lecturers I've ever had. Very clear, concise, and actually rather entertaining. The class is pretty intense - lots of reading and attention needs to be paid - but with a bit of effort the course is really worth it. I would recommend it to anyone.",1
"Dr. Russell's first year writing seminar was quite informative. I definitely learned a lot about the Supreme Court and the legal world in general. That being said, her grading criteria is not very clear. All the grades come from essays, and she doesn't always hand back feedback on the essays -- nor does she provide a rubric for them.",1
all you do is read the textbook. the lecture are SOOO short and no help at all. I was really disappointed by this class.,0
he was my advisor on the study abroad trip to england... what an amazing guy he is!,1
"You read a case or set of articles every week and write a 3-5 or 1-2 page paper on them, so there is no textbook.  Lectures can be long but interesting; make sure you take detailed notes because that's what the two exams are based off of. Participation is a huge portion of your grade, so show up to class! You can only miss one time. ",1
"Her class is easy but you really have to hit the book and study if you want to pass. She does not help you, give extra credit assignments, or make up tests, no review.dont expect her to teach, you have to read on your own. if you do no undertand she will not help you.",0
"lectures are 3 hours and most of the lecture is examples of examples without examples lecture are an hour He is a harsh grader he does make a study guide for quizzes He makes his test straight from the N+ textbook He has ridiculous turn in times, sometimes 2 weeks others 3 days He doesn't give you any lab time, you have to go to the lab on your own",0
"She was pretty cool and would play music during class. When starting a new project she would do a quick demo and then let you go do it on your own. She is super straightforward but it can come off rude to some people but the criticism is effective. If you attend class, pay attention, and use your time wisely you will do fine.",1
I'll tell you how he makes me feel by quoting someone famous: kidbvkjsdnvkjsfdnvkljfsd - Helen Keller,1
"Professor Winogora is the best. He tries his best to make the class fun and engaging, while encouraging conversation. It's a fun time, and he doesn't penalize you for having opinions if you can back them up. He gives an assignment for every class, but they're usually short and just help you keep up to date with what's going on in class.",1
"The most arbitrary grade I have ever received. Most of the grade is his opinion on your ""participation"". I learned NOTHING in this class. The material was basically pop psychology. To hammer the point home again, Meyer and his class was useless in every sense of the word.",0
Excellent,1
"This professor has been so great! She really cares! This class is online and asynchronous, a challenge, but this professor is the most available of any I have ever had! So many of my classmates are trying to cheat and are mad that they can't in this class. Very organized. Straightforward. I am studying and doing great!",1
"If you want a professor who really knows what he is lecturing, take Ptak.  Not an easy grader by any means, he absolutely makes you work for your grade. Tests and homework are created to make you think outside just memorization of the material.  Go in to office hours and study his lectures and you will do fine in the course.",1
"Do not take this class if you are not confident in your math skills. He works example problems on the board, but he skips the small mental math steps which can make things very confusing. I had to go to the tutors every day after class. If it was not for the tutors I would not have passed the class.",0
"Overly critical & a tough grader. She gives an extreme amount of assignments and is very strict. She gives no leeway at all, so plan to be there for every class, on-time & constantly busy. The way she conducted lab group experiments was awful. If students had the same answers as members of your group, she'd accuse students of cheating. Terrible.",0
"Margarita is a great teacher.  She has passion for the Spanish language and is very sweet.  She wants questions and answers them very clearly.  Expect online homework every night, usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.  Three very short papers due over the term, most had to be 200 words all in spanish.  Would take her again.",1
Learn nothing from this class! Lecture are terribly boring. He expects you to know everything! Midterm and Final are bummer. Do not take this class unless you know all the code and HTML!,0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. All her exam questions are trick questions; since her grammar is poor to begin with, this makes getting an A very hard. Put of a class of 60+, we averaged one or two A's per exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",0
"Absolute worst professor at the university. Do not take him unless you can teach an entire course to yourself, otherwise, you won't pass. Over half of my class dropped. Will literally call you dumb to your face if you ask for help. AVOID",0
"Very nice, helpful, and respectful instructor. Not a difficult class. However, after entering Thermo 2 it was clear how much I didn't learn from her. Basically learned all of Thermo 1 in the first two weeks of 2.",1
"To be honest, I hate speech class, but this professor know how to make all the student and me love going to class, and over come our fear each time. There are 4 speech to provide, but it is not that hard if you well prepared. Go for this professor, you will  not regret plus you will got help from him and classmate. The last is a so much fun.",1
"Dr. Snaza is the smartest prof. ever. Every class is pretty socratic style, with people saying things that popped out to them in the reading and him building off of it. He doesn't believe in tests, lets you redo everything you turn in, leaves great notes, and is flexible. There is a lot of hard reading, but he explains everything and truly cares.",1
"Professor Fritsche is an amazing professor especially as Accounting can be difficult. He explains his lectures and makes sure everyone understands. With the transition to online due to COVID-19, he has been helpful with everything with the class. Take his 211 and 212 class, also get the textbook that includes both sections to save money!",1
"He's passionate about Sociology but honestly the course is really boring. I ended up using most of the class time to do homework for my other courses. On the plus side, he gives many extra credit opportunities. He's a good professor but I wouldn't recommend the course in general.",1
"Dont listen to the negative comments. Although you do have to memorize a lot, so does everyone else in the class. He prepares us as much as he can for the final and most importantly for the bar exam. I thought his exam was straightforward if anything so long as you memorize the rules and case names. He is a little scary but overall very helpful",1
"I had Adam for Calc 1, 2, and 3. He is super awesome! His lectures are easy to follow, and he does lots of examples. Homework almost every night, test and quizzes are straight forward. He is awkward but funny, and always has great stories. I highly recommend him for any math class!",1
Pretty easy class. Tests are straight forward and there are about 3 projects throughout the semester.,1
She is one of the kindest professors at Ramapo. The work she gives you is based upon your own skill set. I would definitely recommend taking her  classes.,1
I had him for music theory and Aural Skills. I found Music Theory boring and hard but i think that is just me. I loved Aural Skills with him. We moved very slow so i knew how to do everything. it is a fun class too! I would recommend him! Also he is a very sweet man and really knows his music!,1
She is a  tough grader. I  won't take any class with her in future . She really wants that student get low grades. Pre Calc is  easy but she made it too hard.,0
great prof! super nice and caring,1
"Amazing professor!!! Answers any questions that you may have. Has lots of experience. Likes to move the class together as a whole to make sure everyone is on the same page. Wants to make sure that everyone passes. Constantly talks about his overweight cat, lol. Gives practice exams for mid term and final. Would definitely take again.",1
really poor and mean,0
A perfect mathematician. You can ask any kind of question in anything regarding algebra and he will give the answer.,1
"Probably one of the best professors in the Brownsville UTRGV Campus. He knows the subject, he cares about your grade... meaning if you don't do so hot on a paper or assignment he will let you take it home, correct it, and submit it once more for grading. He's old school, all grading done by hand and is also very down to earth. An honest professor!",1
"She is amazing. I agree with some of the negative comments because she does not like it when you disagree with her but besides that she is perfect. She is very knowledgeable and an entertaining professor. Once you understand what she likes, you will get an A no problem.",1
"Quizzes were hard, had to use the book a lot, definitely take notes!! Most of quizzes and tests were open note, but still difficult. Pay attention and do the readings and you'll do fine.",1
"Super understanding professor, very laid back with lectures and homework. You can tell he actually cares about students learning and not so much on grading. Would take him for every MKT class if I could.",1
Amazing!,1
Guyomar was amazing - she thoroughly  explained all details and was available for help at anytime you needed it. There are plenty of opportunities for extra credit as well. You have to come to class & participate in order to pass and also STUDY. She's reasonable & fair and will work w/ you if you need it! She's great!,1
"Why are you worried about taking this class/professor? You're a senior at WSU! You should know how to write proper English regardless of your background. I want to take this challenging course and professor. I want to learn. AND, he helps you if you ask. Want to go to grad/med school? Take this course. He will help you. Yes, he helps YOU. Thanks.",1
"Always willing to meet before or after class hours. Extremely helpful, kind and caring!",1
Dr. Tulin is one of the smartest people I've ever met. You will learn things in his class that you won't get anywhere else at Howard. I took him for Ideas in Antiquity which is a lecture course. Lectures are fascinating and his main goal is to make sure that students are absorbing the material. Take him!!! He is a fair grader.,1
"The best way to describe him is ""FAIR"". He has clear grading criteria and it is not difficult to do decently well in his class. Get your stuff done and write like someone who isn't in 7th grade- ""And that is why I think Professor Monnin is a great professor."" smh. do better.",1
"Very good professor. He has over 30 years of experience in teaching. If you go after getting more knowledge in the finance, Dr. Sarver is a good choice. If you want to get easy way passing the class, he is not that bad as it described by some reviewers. You have to take a reasonable effort to get a good grade.",1
His jokes are hilarious. Makes good use of his time. You will learn a lot when you attend class.,1
"Furno is absolutely fabulous, relates subject matter to real events that occurred in his personal life. Textbook is required but didnt cost an arm and leg due to using an older version.",1
The best Organic Chemistry Professor at Allegheny.  Easier than Murph-dog...and his class isn't a joke like PJ's.  Take ams.,1
"Super arbitrary in terms of grading, I asked him in the middle of the quarter about how I was doing in the class and he said I am in the top of the class but refused to give a letter grade. Then he gave me a B+ even though I was never late nor absent, and participate every class. I am just confused.",0
He is extremely knowledgeable on this topic and has a ton of real world experience. Do not pay attention to the EGR 106 ratings because they don't know what it means to be in an engineering class. Engineering is not easy and  you need to expect to put in time for the class but it is extremely helpful for the industry and work after school.,1
Manuel is the best professor at ASU for COM.,1
"Hands down the best professor I have had in college so far! Cares about his students, is very funny, and explains clearly what to do to pass in the class and how to study for exams! If you don't even show up I am sure you will pass! Very down to Earth guy and very understanding! Would recommend 100%!!",1
Hard but good,1
"Would often make you stay hours after class for a critique that wasn't very useful, or wouldn't have time to give one at all.  Provided lots of examples and books that were helpful to look at. Her instructions on assignments weren't clear half of the time, and she docks points if you don't participate in class discussions/critiques everyday.",0
"Awesome professor, boring class. He definitely is an extremely smart prof who knows main interest is in cancer biology. Study the powerpoints and old test till your eyeballs fall out and you'll get a B+/A-/A.",1
"I took this professor for psychology of media and she was amazing. The class is real simple, you watch movies and write essays about them and you learn how psychology is displayed in films and different movies. I definitely recommend if you're looking for an easy A!",1
Tons of busy work for homework. Not very understanding about late work. Boring class activities,0
"Assignments were marked unfairly, the midterms and finals are extremely hard. The prof is overall a nice guy but the class is definitely not something anyone at york should ever take.",0
"lectures were very clear. He only tests on what was covered in class, but you must understand everything to do well.",1
Confusing/inconsistent grading. Easy class but not for passionate criminal justice majors. The bare minimum is accepted and received well by the professor. Easy class requires little to no effort. Expect to do a LARGE amount of research. Most of the information needed for discussions and projects are not in the weekly course content.,1
"Absolutely loved her!! I highly recommend her classes! I took the six week summer course which is a lot of work at once, but once it's over, it's over.  Quizzes every day, but they are very helpful for the tests, and not all are counted.",1
"This class, like many of the other reviews show, is a complete mess. There is no communication between temple and his TA's which led to one of the 3 graded assignments to be graded wrong. The only assignments worth grades are the 2 midterms and the final. He rambles a lot and goes off topic in lectures. I only learned from the book. STAY AWAY!",0
"Lois is a trainwreck. For an instructor of a class with the stated aim of ""open-mindedness"" and ""objective analysis"" of political systems, she does nothing but  opine. This leads to a poor educational environment. I don't know how anyone could or would recommend Lois' classes to anyone",0
Severely annoying. Treats her GE level History 146 class like it's an important upper level course. Whines when no one participates or take notes on what she's rambling on about.,0
"Dr. Paul Coutinho is a fantastic professor and a beautiful human being. What I found exceptional about him is his ability to easily connect with students. He is genuinely interested to get to know a person behind the name. The atmosphere in the class was relaxed and welcoming, and I really enjoyed the way class was conducted and taught.",1
He is a funny and helpful professor. He has a great teaching style. He loves participation and is available to help you if you don't understand. Most of the hw is online but he takes you to the lab one day a week to complete them. His class was very interactive and fun even at 8 a.m. He gives great study guides and you won't regret taking his class,1
Dr. Solano is a good guy. He's not like some of the other professors who just show up and treat each class like a routine. He really wants his students to succeed and will work with you to make sure that happens. Operations Management isn't the easiest subject but Dr. Solano teaches it very well. You'll get an A if you take it seriously!,1
she does about a month's worth of lectures and then puts the rest on students. I pay her salary and she sits back and watches. 15 minute presentations from students for 3 hours numbs your mind; we are not professors so it can get quite boring. AVOID HER CLASS AT ALL COST,0
I figured I'd give Connor a shot since it was at a good time. I went to class the first day and I automatically knew it was awful. She was VERY unclear with her actions and it just overall confusing. I switched out after that. It just was not worth it. I'd pick another class if I were you,0
"More than half of the class dropped her class and out of 12 of us that were left, about 4 of us had to email the dean about her behavior. On the final she said we have to show work even on multiple choice question b/c if we dont we wont receive credit. Takes points off labs for things such as commas and dots. Also has an envy towards girls",0
"Dr. Burridge was fine but this class was definitely dreading. A lot of reading every week, an analysis assignment per week, and the final paper was killing me. This semester was additionally hard because he didn't allow us to choose topics for our final paper.",1
"avoid her if possible. she seems cool at first but as the semester drags on you'll regret taking her class. her lectures are very unorganized as she goes back and forth through time periods you lose track of which your supposed to be learning and what is just ""setting the scene"".",0
"Just be in the class, that's all matters. he is sweetest, very understandable. Everyone should be fine in his class, even if you don't know anything about spanish. He doesn't fail anyone guranteed",1
If you are not good at math do NOT take him. He skips a lot of steps he feels are common sense but for those of us not good at math are important to understand the material. Quizzes every week. Doesn't answer questions thoroughly. I never felt comfortable enough to ask questions because of the way he responded to others when they asked.,0
"She's so nice! She put up with a lot of goofing off, and kept her composure the whole time, eventually just going with the flow of the class. I didn't learn all that much, but I think that the course is pretty pointless in and of itself...she's really cool though, and in a regular semester would be great to work with.",1
"Not allowed to stand up at all. NO bathroom, NO eating, NO electronics, including if you wish to take notes digitally. His lectures jump around so it makes it difficult to find your appropriate notes when studying for the midterm or final. Studied religiously the study guide for the midterm, did not help at all. 5 books and 5 papers. AVOID!",0
"Best Professor I've had at UMUC. Real world teaching, he tells it like it is.",1
Great teacher and even better guy! I took his class and learned a lot!,1
"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes. Instead of teaching or asking provoking questions, it almost seems like she is so bored that she could care less about planning out a thoughtful class discussion. Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",0
"Take anyone else for writing composition. I didn't enjoy this professor's lack of respect towards her students. Tough grader, have to go to class or you'll fail, pushes agenda on students, just don't take her.",0
"Easy if youve seen basic physics before, but beware this is a modelling class, so lots of drawings, and the class is very slow",1
"Stephen is a nice prof who always tries to lighten up your day with a few jokes. His slides are simple and contain all the information you will be tested on. He recites them in class with more detail. The exams are straightforward and consist of MC, and written short and long answer questions. Make sure to study precisely and good luck everyone!!",1
"Although his test may be difficult he usually curves. He has a lot of passion about biology and his students, and it shows in his lectures. He also gives great advice about life.",1
Pretty easy class. Weekly quizzes that help prepare you for the test. his lectures are super helpful and I would definitely recommend going. The online hw is usually pretty easy and he usually makes them around 10 questions. Would recommend if you took precalc in high school and need a good refresher.,1
"Great course, I highly recommend taking it online! She was very caring and quickly replied to emails. Tons of extra credit opportunities. Weekly quizzes that were easy. Exams were long but she posts recaps on chapters every week that have almost all of the answer in them! Textbook helped a little on tests but rarely used. Only 3 discussion boards.",1
"I like how she teaches. You do have to read a lot for her class, but she explains anything confusing and at least makes the reading relevant to students. She is also not bias. Exams very fair.",1
"Great teacher. You want to pass? Need to study. Tries her best to help you with all she can. She is flexible. She does not want you to fail. You will learn in this class as well, not an easy class but not a super hard one either.",1
"Do not take this professor if you really want to learn. Class was very chaotic, unorganized, waste of time. It is difficult to learn because the class was all over the place, but he does want people to pass.",1
"PROS: EVERYTHING is on canvas, so you never have to guess what will be on the tests. He is really lenient when he grades the test and lab practicals. He gives you extra credit opportunities. Questions are welcomed. CONS: This summer course is a 4 hour class MTWR, his accent was a little hard to understand. The class requires a lot out of you.",1
I really liked Professor Fan. She made class really easy to understand and cares alot about her students understanding and doing well on the exam. She also provides homework which helps alot. If you don't pass this class then that means you didn't try,1
"I dont know what everyone is complaining about. Tuppet is one of the best psyc professors here. She is approachable, helpful, and hilarious! Her tests are hard, but they are fair. You get out what you put in, keep that in mind when you read the negative reviews. Pay attention in class, stay current on the readings and you will do just fine.",1
"I had him for 1201 and 1202. He was a funny guy and knew his stuff, but was one of the toughest graders I have seen. If you don't do word for word on his exams, you'll get points off automatically. He'll also roast you if you word a question wrong.",1
"IS the most impressive professor at UTTyler, very smart and cares about students ability to communicate and overcome or be ""aware"" of their ability  as a public speaker.  COACHED the class and made the class as one team in compassion, respect, humility and empathy.  HE CARES, YOU WILL GROW WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE.  GREAT ROLE MODEL and PROFESSIONAL.",1
Professor Druffel is really caring and wants everyone to pass. The lectures were asynchronous (and split up into sections with mini quizzes at the end) and homework was a weekly quiz with around 20 questions. She was eager for students to show up to office hours and the tests were open notes. I definitely recommend this class.,1
Excellent professor. :-) Most CSUSM profs you could leave behind in a dingy Pizza Hut bathroom and not notice the difference. But Dr. Al-Marashi is a true gem. He knows his history and puts together great PowerPoints to help you understand what you're reading in the textbook. His class is actually fun and interesting which I can't say for most. :-),1
"Hard subject, but he is pretty cool",1
"Science is my worst subject, but she has a way of explaining things that I didn't understand before!",1
"Professor Dunham started out great, was very clear of his expectations and grading criteria. But a few weeks into class he had a family emergency, and we didn't hear from him for weeks. We couldn't get feedback until almost all assignments were turned in. Grades more on APA style than actual content, very tough grader! Good Professor though.",1
"I hate giving speeches, but this teacher made it very simple & easy going. Most laid back classroom atmosphere ever. One of the best teachers I've had.",1
Really good teacher can help you if you ask and always makes sure you understand what is happening in class,1
good teacher...everything is very clear and assignments are easy. Really cares for her students,1
I've studied at 4 colleges in 3 countries and Kata is one of the best professors I've had. She is fun and dynamic with her lectures and reading materials. She is clear about what is expected and if she sees you putting in the time and effort you will do well in her class. Make sure to participate in class because that will help a lot. Great Profe!,1
"DJB is probably the best professor I have ever had. She gives amazing lectures, and she's hilarious. She makes an effort to know everyone's name, so be ready because she does cold call a lot. Take her class if you can!",1
"Some of the material is dense but relevant to the discussion. This course builds up on early readings, so make sure to read. It becomes repetitive at some point, so I advice to have questions regarding the material, if not it is brutal. These theories touch on current events, politics, and pop culture, be sure to prepare on that for variety's sake",1
she will do almost everything to help you pass the class. there is quite a bit of homework. all in class work is done in groups and all the test are just like the study guides.,1
Prof. West is truly an awesome teacher. I didn't know what to expect when I took this class as a math alternative. I'm so glad I  did! He makes learning challenging and fun. He drives that curiosity that makes you compelled to do your homework. I recommend this Instructor highly! ,1
"One of the best English professor at CCBC. Took her for ENG 102 online course. Only advice i would give is do what you are supposed to do, and you will get an A",1
"Dr. Abara is awesome. He tells you what will be on each midterm so if you study that you will be fine. He gives extracredit which helps you alot if you don't do well on midterm. Read, go to every class and do homework and you will be successful. Dr. Abara makes learning fun and he is really funny.",1
Really enjoyed his class! Learned a lot and honestly it wasnt even that hard. A quiz every class but he offers extra credit so youll always get a good grade! Test are pretty straight forward if you study youll pass.,1
"He is very passionate about what he teaches. Participation is very important, but the readings and tests are very easy. He cares about his students, and does everything he can to make class exciting and useful for your real life, no matter your major. I highly recommend taking him.",1
"Although I admit, Mrs. Wedemeyer  is a very difficult professor, she is one of the greatest professors I've ever had Expect many homework assignments and reading but after all of it you will know everything you need to know without questioning yourself. I have taken her for 3 different accounting classes and hope to have her again",1
No Comments,0
"Dr. Hess is a pretty chill instructor, she expects you to participate and be active in class. She goes over historical context to understand the movements and the authors. Test can be difficult, since she picks a random poem or passage from ANYTHING that was read in class. Midterm and final, four response papers, two presentations, and one 8-page. ",1
He is a great professor and easy to pass. His tests are open book and open notes so you will pas his tests with your eyes closed and if you get a low grade in your test he will give you extra credit so you can get back those points you miss in your test. He is an amazing advisor as well. If you are planning to study law he will help you. Take him.,1
"Great prof. Very helpful, chill and laidback.",1
"I read these reviews after taking her class and I'm honestly shocked. She does explain things relatively well, but has such a rude attitude if you ask her any questions in lab. She kicked a girl out and failed her after screaming at her for coming in 15 min late and asking questions. Never seen anything so rude before.",0
"Doesn't teach very well and usually explains things poorly, but his notes are excellent.  Teaches straight from class notes.  Requires a lot of work outside class to succeed.  Attendance of TA's office hours is usually required to get a good grade on the homework.  If you put in a good amount of effort, a great grade is possible.  Slackers beware.",0
way too hard...a bit unreasonable,0
"Excellent professor! Dedicated to your education, wants you to LEARN & understand, not just memorize concepts. Very basic econ. Minimal book use. Flashcards highly recommended.",1
Professor Glauber is an excellent teacher. Follow directions and this will be an easy class to pass. Assigns a few papers and allows you to rewrite for a higher grade. Excellent teacher!,1
"There is no science in this course, which remains superficial and descriptive. The teacher is still interesting and cares about what he says. The calm of his voice and the lack of structure of his class and PPTs unfortunately don't keep us interested very long. You will easily pass the exam without attending class, or without reading the book.",0
I love Mrs. Barclift. She is very understanding. She knows what she is talking about and is very interesting. She is more strict in this class than she is in other classes.Most people do not know how to take her outspokeness and crude humor when they first meet her she means no harm.,1
"I loved Professor Allen, but this class definitely isn't for everybody. To do well, you need to attend every class and pay close attention. Professor Allen's lectures are very interesting if you actually want to challenge your mind.",1
"Easy online class! 4 exams that are open for a week. The book and quizlet are very helpful for them. There are two simple assignments as well. Don't go through the trouble of taking this class in person if it's not your major, get it over with online. Recommend taking her!",1
"This is hands down the best Prof I have ever had! He actually cares if his students are learning, and takes the pressure away from the letter grade. It is so refreshing to be in a class where my Prof has my back. All he wants is for you to succeed. If you want to learn from a professional in a comfortable environment, then Mr. Hurley is for you.",1
Best professor and extremely helpful in all areas of the courses he teaches. He specializes in ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENT so if you are looking for something other than this obviously you go to someone who specializes in that subject area.,1
"He is a great guy and a super genius, but every time I try to pay attention to him, his English accent catches me and all I do is listen to the accent and I forget to learn!  Whenever he presents lectures, however, most of his slides are irrelevant.  His exams contain a section called ""concept questions"" which are the most difficult part.",1
"Boyer's cool and his Cisc 101 class is extremely easy. Its just that he's a total bum. Oh and if you need to email him about something, don't bother! He won't respond back. He's virtually useless. And it's weird that a man who teaches CISC has to stare at the keyboard and types only with his pointer fingers",0
Great class....made adjusting easier.  Uses common sense approach to adjusting.  Helpful in one on one setups.,1
"He's the kind of guy that will stay two hours after his office hour ends just to listen to you cry about your problems, and still motivate you to be the best version of yourself. One of my best friends and he's my professor. One of the coolest guys I've ever met.",1

This man is so energetic and passionate about Bioengineering that it will most certainly be wonderful! This guy is undoubtedly one of my favorite professors in the department and really does care!,1
"Soil science is a relatively boring topic but Dr. Ptak makes it interesting, attendance isn't mandatory but its a lab based class so if you want a good grade you need to show up.  We go outside to take samples a lot which is nice because it makes class go a lot faster.  The grading is tough but fair, do the work and you should do well.",1
"I turned in all of the HW in the last week of sem., barely came to class, and still recvd full pts for both hw/particip. For the 2 Mterms, he gave 90% of the questions that were on the exams the week before; meaning getting an A on them is guaranteed thru memorization. For the final, he gave around 50% of it early, which is the only time you study.",1
"Jones was an awesome professor, but his test and homework were pretty tough.  3 exams, 3 quizes, 1 research paper+EC. He teaches the most important parts of psychology , book is not recommended. He has an online outline of what he is going to teach and was very helpful, print it if you can or use your laptop . I highly recommend taking his class!!",1
"An absolutely brilliant teacher who knows a lot about her field.  Despite her age, she continues to do research in Middle Eastern Studies.  Her class was very interesting though there are times where she can drag a topic out.  Overall, excellent professor.  OIL!",1
"Awesome professor and generally a great guy! He makes all of his lectures extremely interesting and focuses on topics that relate to every day life in Bio. He is extremely helpful and is always encouraging his students. If you are looking for an awesome Bio Lab professor definitely choose this guy, you'll enjoy lab every week.",1
Anna is super nice but if you don't go to class her lectures will make no sense because they're super vague.,1
"I would take this class again. Going in with some information and experience with excel and power point will definitely make this class easier for you. I felt like I learned something from this class and overall the class wasn't very hard. Weekly discussions and quizzes, three excel projects and one paper. Could have been worse.",1
"Look, Logan is a very nice guy, but he's SO quiet and slow, that the class was so painfully boring to sit through. He got really behind because of how slow he is, so the last couple of days of class were insane. He's a poor planner, as our last test was on the last dat of class, and the following Monday was the final. I hated this class.",1
"GO TO CLASS!! People skip his class, do poorly, and complain about why they did so bad. His lectures come right from the book, but are you actually gonna read?! So just go to class, take notes, and the test are easy if you study those notes. Our entire grade was 4 tests. The only hw is studying, so study! Don't make it harder than it actually is!",1
"I found Professor Abrams to be unorganized and confusing. Yes- he cares a lot about his students and the course, but that doesn't mean that he's smart or a good teacher. I regret that I did not learn very much from his class.",0
He's super fine! SILVER FOX material here! Hes also an awesome teacher! Love the guy!,1
"Kind man, but poor lecturer. Very hard to hear in a lecture hall. His notes are not available to you and makes you purchase expensive program online for hw and textbook. 3 midterms and 1 final. lots of hw.",1
"Excelent teacher, excelent person!!! Take him!!!",1
"My favorite professor at DePaul. Wonderful writer, very engaging and funny, gives amazing feedback. Took time out from her busy schedule to help me with a piece I was working on independently. Grades are hard to anticipate, but she does her best to let you know how you're doing until your final portfolio is graded. TAKE HER.",1
"Hardest teacher ever, genious",1
"You can tell that she has good intentions, but she simply does not teach the subject well. If you don't go into this class with a very thorough background in Chemistry, you're not going to have a fun time.",0
Smart guy but a bad prof. Doesn't tell you what you need to study. Concepts on exams different from what's on notes and taught in lecture. Just reads off of class notes provided to us. If I had a gun to my head telling me to take him again or jump off a cliff. I'm jumping lol.,0
Took this class during the summer online. Didn't require much of my time. Just be sure to start essays early. I found the essays to be the only difficult portion of this class.,0
"Great teacher! He knows what he is talking about. Straight to the point, very smart man and very helpful! I would definitely recommend him to anyone.",1
No Comments,0
"If you don't like working too much don't take him. He teach you a lot of things. You got to work a lot in his class, Essays, Quizzes, Tests, a lot!! But you will learn with him.",1
-Soft spoken & difficult to hear his lectures. He reads off his notes & rarely will offer additional examples or explanations when asked to clarify an idea. Backtracks during lecture which can be confusing. Writes small & slow which eats up a huge chunk of class time leaving little time to explain new material or review hw. +No hw due dates.,0
Mary is a fabulous teacher and pretty sexy too! ;),1
"He is a nice person but not so good at lecturing. He is a really strict grader, who has really high expectation to his students. I don't think I will take his course again, because there are so many mandatory small projects. This course is very labor intensive.",0
"Prof. Sanders is willing to help. she sent out an email after the final asking if anyone wanted to come to look at their finals and because of this, my grade moved up a letter. her powerpoints are a bit disorganized but I never had trouble knowing what was on the test because it was going to be everything she would emphasize, no surprises here.",1
"Good guy, good teacher",1
He is the best Math teacher I have seen so far,1
Awesome teacher. I wished he taught more classes.,1
"GREAT PROFESSOR! He has a sense of humor which makes Philosophy more interesting,not ""serious"". He has a way of explaining concepts that makes them easier to understand than just reading alone. You will need to keep up on the readings or you will be confused by his lectures. All exams will most likely be essay, but do an outline and you'll be fine!",1
"3 exams, basically gives the answers to 75% of the exam, the other 25% you can google on quizlet. Textbook mandatory for HW. Honestly, his accent is really bad. His handwriting is equally just as bad. Nice professor. Encourages students to participate. Loved his positivity during these hard times. Tried to do his best with what he was provided.",1
"She's really nice.  She's outgoing, and kind of loud.  This class is extremely easy but sometimes, she can be very unclear about assignments.  Sometimes, she's hard to follow and you just don't know what she is talking about!",0
Homework is more of a suggestion since it isn't collected and is therefore worth 0% of your grade. Grade is determined by 2 midterms and a final exam. The exams pretty much cover what is in his lectures and lectures are very proof heavy. He often gets off topic talking about physics problems that are loosely related to lecture material.,0
She is not very good when it comes to teaching and also tends to get off topic a lot which takes away from what we are learning. Does not give very good explanations for assignments that are given to us either.,0
"Really nice! She was an amazing professor who really cared. Show up, do the work, and you will pass!",1
Taking this class in the summer is no easy undertaking. Xandy is awesome! I would recommend her!,1
okay teacher.... you must study for EVERY test to do well!!! as long as u put in the time you are good to go. its just a hard class in general.,1
"Great online class, definitely recommend her!",1
"I'd heard of life-changing classes, but this one truly fits the description. I am able to apply ideas/techniques learned in this class to improve my daily life. Fr. Paul's interesting and easygoing lecture/teaching style added to vigorous classroom discussion, good visual/video aids, and challenging assignments makes this a great class!",1
"Andrew Nedd is an engaging and kind professor. The workload is great, every other week is an online quiz or a very short essay, which are both manageable and helpful in understanding the material. He leaves good feedback on essays and is very open to hearing what students have to say, all questions and comments are welcome with him.",1
"Was not a bad professor, but he is a little hard to understand sometimes because of his accent. He'll call on you randomly, so pay attention. If you pay attention in class, study your quizzes, and do the hw, you'll be fine. There are far worse professors in this course",1
"Even though I didnt do as well as I had hoped, dobrin was helpful and great in the class",1
"She's extremely dry, but a good professor because of her knowledge of the material.  She can be tough but like all accountants, has no sense of humor or personality.  ",1
"Professor Gonzalez is a good English Teacher. I will admit he is a bit strict on attendance and he doesn't like to repeat lecture. So if you miss a day in class, hopefully someone can help you out. Other than that, he is extremely helpful and easy to talk to as well. I do recommend him, but just make sure to show up to class and do the work.",1
"Bio126 is notoriously difficult, and Matt does not make it more difficult than it needs to be. The classes difficulty stems from the structure of the examinations, which can be combatted by vigilant students that seek help from him and stay on top of the material. His lectures are extremely entertaining but they move fast, so make sure keep up!",1
Enthusiastic and fun!,1
"I have scored high 90s and even a 100 on exams but her projects bring your grade down immensely, She's such a tough grader and expects you to do exactly what she wants BUT doesn't tell you what she wants.",0
"Fantastic lab instructor, very good organization and always there to help students.",1
"I did terrible on one of the essays, but his comments were useful and way more detailed than feedback I've gotten in other English classes, and helped me get a good grade on the revision. Lectures aren't always exciting, but were useful, and I liked that he always tried to show us how concepts were useful beyond just his class.",1
"She's a really sweet lady. I felt bad because I would sleep though a lot of her classes. But she is genuinely a great, caring professor. She kind of grades a little hard, but the class it self it extremely easy",1
Very good teacher. she is very helpfull and knows thermo in and out. Great course.,1
Mr. I is a unique Professor and he is totally different from others. He supports each student to be different in the end of the semester. Anyone would like to improve his speech and to get a free lessons in the life take him. I highly recommend him. In the end of the semester you will speak totally different.,1
"Had Mr. Petro Summer 08, great teacher. It's a tough course. Do your homework and you'll be fine. He'll help you as much as possible ( he gives extra credit on tests ). Don't blame him for the tough course work.",1
He plays videos a lot. He's funny. He makes class interesting. Made me feel like I should have done Honors because I didn't feel challenged enough.,1
"He is great! In the beginning of the semester, I thought I would fail the class due to the high amount of slides we covered but he insured me not to drop it. He is VERY helpful and his study guides are THE BOMB!!!!!!! Pay attention the day of the test because he throws out massive hints! Great class. ",1
"I am NOT a science person, and I got an A in this class. Professor Reddy gives you multiple way to succeed in this class. Literally just PAY ATTENTION and she will give you all the answers in her lectures. Which are still short and sweet. She knows how to pack all the info in an hour lecture. The homework is easy, you just gotta do it!",1
"Professor Freed is a really nice person, but her grading is unbelievably hard. Assignments were unclear and difficult. I liked her as a person but I wouldn't recommend her class! Expected more on the papers than what she mentions on the assignment paper itself and in class.",1
He is a really nice man.  Lovable old guy.  I had a really good experience in his class because he is so smart and helpful! Thank you Mr. O!!!!,1
"She's terrible with computers, assigns the most useless things, and expects us to memorize AP style rules. She's the worst professor I've had in the department. And she used to tell us that we're going to be terrible journalists because we don't do things her way. The only reason she gets away with it is because she's the internship coordinator.",0
Amazing professor. Yue Lao shi cares about all of her students. You can tell just by being around her that she wants every student to succeed. The workload is what you make of it. If you don't understand something she will gladly go back and review. She takes a lot of time to go beyond the textbook but the quizzes/tests are based on the textbook.,1
"Chris is a born teacher.  He's very helpful and down to earth, and he's also very funny.  He goes slowly and breaks down the way to write a paper into clear steps.  He also teaches grammar in a interesting way and shows how to apply it to writing papers.  I want to take him again!",1
"Nice person, and willing to go the extra mile and help students connect to the material. Do the readings, speak up in class each week, and turn your work in - you'll do fine and you will even have fun. I am considering a major in philosophy because of her.",1
"He is a good guy but average TEACHer. Reads his lectures straight from the slides, attendance is not mandatory but the tests are difficult. Difficult as in he curves every test because the average grades are so poor. Teach your self type of class.",1
"I've had this professor for two weeks and already, I'm hearing political propaganda that has nothing to do with sociology. I'm not liberal or conservative, but it's really annoying when I have to hear about ""Bush getting his way into Yale free"" when I'm trying to understand what the hell I'm supposed to be studying.",1
Nice and funny.,1
"Don't bother buying the text book, but you will need the code for online weekly quizzes. Show up to class and you will get the answers to extra credit questions. She is super nice and laid back. Can replace lowest test grade (including final) with attendance grade. ",1
"Prof. Stevens makes you feel stupid when you ask questions for clarification. For EGR106, he assumed that everyone in the class had previous coding experience so he skipped over the basics which screwed me over because I had to figure it out on my own while doing projects similar to my friends in 300 level classes. He assigns a project once a week.",0
"This is not an ""easy A"" core. Dr. Moore gives pop quizzes (5 points) and they're straightforward IF you read! The material can be dry and confusing at times, but if you take initiative to ask for help, he will help you and is really caring. Also, make a friend in the class for assignments and help in general - it helps a lot!",1
Excellent professor very dedicated to making sure the class understands what is being taught. He is very reasonable when grading. I would reccomend him for any Calc class. He is one of the few outstanding teachers at akron,1
"she puts up with loud people in a huge lecture hall, so she gets props for that.  the subject can only be so much fun to talk about for an hour and she does an ok job keeping it interesting.  however, the class is really easy, and she makes it seem hard or like we're all stupid.  easy class",1
Dr. Curman would probably be an amazing professor outside of online school. She doesnt have a great public speaking presence or voice. If you like the word UM this class is for you. Its A LOT of reading so be very prepared.,1
I took six terms of Spanish (101-203) with Margarita and loved every minute of her class. She is extremely organized and well-prepared and brings a good attitude and lots of humor to the class. She was very encouraging and willing to devote extra time to helping each student. I highly recommend her to anyone.,1
"Danae is an amazing teacher, and has so much passion in her teaching. She is one of my favorite teachers. I took her class Tuesday nights and expected it to be and learned so much! She is an amazing teacher, and made the class very interesting. I loved everything about the class. And homework was enjoyable. I really recommend this class with her!",1
"Rita was always there to answer questions. There was homework, however it was necessary to learn. This was a wonderful learning experience. I learned to think outside the box.",1
"Took his Saturday 8am class, the lectures are long but if you browse the material during the week it isn't that bad. The tests are pretty clear cut, you do have to study though. He is caring and willing to work with you to make sure you learn the material. The labs are short but entertaining. If you don't get an A it's all on you.",1
"Llaneza is a nice person.  There is no doubt that he is a kind individual.  But his instructions are hard to follow sometimes.  He expects you to read a lot, too.  If you hate to read, I would not take this prof. if possible.  His tests have questions that really come from nowhere, too.  The labs are helpful.  Only take if req. by major, I say.",1
"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",0
Almost all of the grading is based on the exams which can contain very obscurely-formatted questions a lot of the time. All of the lectures are pre-recorded so you can watch them when you like but you must watch them if you want to pass the exams. You're gonna be talked at for 2.5 hours every week and you need to scribble down notes. Very boring.,1
She is the best accounting teacher. Take time to do the extra credit because it will really help your grade. I hope she will teach managerial accounting!,1
Absolutely amazing professor. You can tell he genuinely cares a lot about the success of his students; he holds many review sessions and is always open to help even in the middle of a lecture. His lectures are very easy to understand and actually quite interesting. He is an amazing person and teacher... 10/10 would recommend taking his class!,1
"One of the top three professors I've had the pleasure of learning from. He made the information easy to relate to, and gave ample opportunity for every student to do well. Even after the class was over, he offered to write me a recommendation to get into Law School.",1
Dan is the best. It takes everyone about a week or two to realize he is really great. He cares a lot about his students and all his assignments are for your best interest.,1
"PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Professor Crumple is very condescending, arrogant, and very rude. He tries to make students feel like they are not smart enough for his class. Sometime in the middle of lectures he goes on tangent about subject not relate to the lecture which could be very confusing. He take pleasure to see his students fail",0
"Nice older man, very fair.  He has a thick accent so he is difficult to understand. Go to study group! Gives reviews before each test, tests are very similar to reviews.  I suggest him over the other physics professors!",1
Excellent teacher! She has a focus in education and really understands how to teach. She offers lots of extra credit and is helpful. She will only lecture for 20 or so minutes and makes sure you understand the material. I think she could teach any subject well. Wish there were more professors like her!,1
Didn't learn much. Wasted time about out class topics.,0
He is extremely knowledgable. Really wants his students to participate. He assigns a lot of papers and readings but nothing crazy. An overall interesting class but don't slack off.,1
"I was a little hesitation to taking this class since reading Middle English can be somewhat difficult sometimes. Im telling you I skipped class 5 times, did the minimum of reading (summaries on the internet occasionally), got Bs on my papers and still got an A! Awesome guy, super easy lectures to understand. Take this class",1
Professor Alexander is an excellent educator. He works in the field that he teaches so he has first hand experience in what he is lecturing on. He has an abundance of knowledge in the law/ criminal justice subject and is willing to answer any questions you might have. Fair grader and gives you all the info you need to succeed.,1
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The only available Comm 230 section was a 180 student lecture with Cindy White. Worst professor. Attendance is pointless because she goes so off topic and the Powerpoints do not help! Your grade is based off only 3 tests, not leaving you any room for mistakes. All she does it babble.",0
"She teaches at a very quick pace and crams a lot of material in. She wants you to go to math lab for more instruction, but that's tough for people w/ jobs and other classes. She sometimes makes people feel dumb when they ask questions. I would recommend taking a different instructor if you would like to pass the course with a good grade.",0
"The best teacher ever! Like most people said just notes and 4 test. Funny teacher, he had the "" joke of the day"" every day. Would take him again any day. :)",1
"Professor Richards takes a seemingly boring class, like tax accounting, and makes it the most entertaining class you'll ever take. He's witty, charming, and super intelligent. He made the class very interesting. He jokes a lot, but makes it known that he has a superb understanding of everything tax.",1
"Terri cares about you as a person and your success. She is wllimg to answer questions and give all the help you need. She is fun, but don't think she isnt serious about what she tells you to know.",1
He is not tough grading speeches. The only thing that will bring down your grade is TIME! Your final speech is worth the most so make sure you work on it before the week of.,1
As somebody who is not a history major this class was very difficult because I did not have a lot of prior knowledge about  other than what I learned from high school.  I learned so much about European history in this class and really enjoyed the professor's lectures.  HE IS A VERY TOUGH GRADER. Do not expect an easy A or an easy B,1
"He is great! His class was focused around ""Fear and Desire in Popular Culture"", so the 3 essays he assigns are on topics that are actually interesting to you. He is a very fair grader, and doesn't call on you unless your hand is raised. Plus, he always makes the class laugh. He's really cool and approachable, and I definitely recommend him.",1
"Professor Gier has been a wonderful instructor. He is eager to help his students succeed but whatever means necessary. He gives homework once per week which generally consists of what has been discussed during class that week. He frequently gives quizzes, but he always emails a study guide first. Quizzes are usually 5 short answer questions.",1
"I like Psychology a lot, but it seems like we missed multiple points of the class. Since it was online, all her homework were nice and easy. Exams were tough, the application of it makes more harder. She's very caring and sweet, definitely would like you to pass her course. Self-study and takes a lot of time for her to respond. Overall, she's great",1
Professor Cramer is a saint among men. He's very understanding when it comes to unforeseen situations sometimes plague students and late assignments. By far one of my favorite professors at Suffolk.,1
"Keep up with the homework and ask questions when you need help and you will be fine. Give her respect and you get it back, if you slack off and ask for help at the last second, then your a bad student and don't deserve help. Gives great feedback on assignments but may take time to get back. A lot of reading but perfect if your interested in COMM",1
"Susan is nice enough, but she tends to pick favorites in the class, especially the ones who are getting A's. I ended up dropping her because her grading process is really unfair. I dropped the class",0
"She is a great professor. I've had her for many classes. She is very organized and you know exactly what you're doing each class. I loved her ethics in health care class. She will also help with academic guiding and responds to e-mail very quickly. Highly, highly recommend her for any class.",1
"Professor Feagin was my favorite teacher at GHC. She is very caring, and always willing to help. This was my easiest class and I took her for American History I and II. If you aren't good at history (like me) take professor Feagin. Midterm and final are easy as its the same questions from quizzes.",1
One of the best professors I've had. His lectures are very clear and interesting. I highly recommend him for history!,1
"Mescioglu is a great professor.  He is always willing to help outside the classroom, before & after class. His homework is just like the examples we go over in class.  Just come to class every day and take good notes.   He also is a human calculator. Right now, I have over a hundo in the class.  Study the examples &the final you get a cheat sheet.",1
"Goldner is by far one of the best professors I've taken so far in the History department. He clearly know his subject and adds a great personality to lectures which keep you engaged which is important for a history course. He's somewhat strict about classroom etiquette, but I can respect that since it feels like he puts his energy into his lectures",1
"This was a Hybrid class so the lectures were all online- she was great with all the labs and information, but never clarified on actual lectures and exams. Practicals were a breeze, but exams were terrible. Discussions were difficult but she is a fair grader. I like her as a person but for Hybrid she was not for me. On ground might be different?",1
One of the best professors I ever had. His classes are interesting and helpful. He always make sure that he communicates effectively. Bruce is awesome! :),1
Tough but extremely fair and knowledgeable. You will grow as a writer and critical thinker.,1
"I absolutely loved taking French 052 with Marielle! She was fun in class and was always happy to explain a concept more clearly if a student was confused. She was very passionate about the material, and she has a great sense of humor! I would definitely take another course with her.",1
"Shes funny and seems to care. But intentionally uses tricky questions to trip you up, is often unclear about what she wants, and assumes everyone has taken an UNT Spanish class. USE THE ONLINE BOOK WORK to teach yourself. Most were confused by lectures and we transfers had to learn the process with online element because it was not explained.",1
Prof Shapero is by far one of the best professors that I have had at TCC. If you are taking ENG112 make sure you get the book. You won't be able to complete the class without it. You have to work for your grade which should be expected. She is very helpful and class is always upbeat. I highly recommend her class.,1
This profesor helped me a lot. She was nice and creative!!,1
Mo is great. He loves jazz band and it definitely shows in his teaching style. All you need to do is attend all concerts and rehearsals and you will get an A. A great guy overall.,1
"Ms Young is great! If you struggle with math like I do, she is really helpful! She can talk too fast sometimes, but just let her know and she will slow down. If you need help, she responds to both texts and emails. She gives great feedback, and is very patient, which is great for someone who struggles with math like me.",1
Prof. Dutta is a great teacher. You need to put an effort into his class to pass with a good grade. You need to earn a high grade and not just expect to pass. MIS 310 isn't an easy class but he helps you understand the material quite well. Fair grader and will give partial points. Well respected and I would take him again,1
"Dr. Thibodeau is easily the best professor at Bentley College, and I've yet to see anyone who even comes close to this guy. While his class is difficult, he teaches it with a vigor that is unseen among all professors at the college, and he wants you to succeed. He will never bore you. You need to work hard, but you'd be a fool to take anyone else.",1
"EXCEEDS HIGHEST STANDARDS OF ANY ONLINE CLASS. Excellent instructor, highly organized and engaging. Follow syllabus, turn assignments in on time, use your book for tests; this is an easy A.  This professor is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about teaching. She offers a ton of extra resources; I can't say enough good things, take the class!",1
Professor Carson is an amazing teacher. He is so sweet and funny. Definitely take his class if you can!! You wont regret it!,1
"I loved her! I took this class as a Mini-mester, and it was super hard.  She expects you to read the chapters!! She teaches the subject matter very clearly, but if you aren't getting the material, she wants you to read the book. She's cool and grades lightly on the exams. Put in the effort and she will notice.  I will definitely take her again.",1
"Great professor. Speaks clearly, gives lots of examples, and relates almost all material to real life application. Be ready to take notes, lots and lots of notes. Quiz's at the end of every chapter and the final is cumulative. Never opened the book once.",1
"I have always struggled with math. I failed math 40 and retook it with Crocoll. Hands down the best math teacher Ive ever had, ever! Other teachers expect you to know a lot. Truth is, its easy to forget even foundational math after a while of not using it. He explains everything step by step and is always willing to help you out. Take him!!",1
Your B.S. papers from High School will not fly in this class.  You will read a lot and discuss it every time in class.  Students must be willing to do the work and be ready to excel.  Take advantage of Office Hours.  Do your best and this class will be enjoyable.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the subject matter isn't that exciting.,1
"She talked to her class like we were in pre-K. She was completely unhelpful, the program glitched (almost everytime), and the tests were so hard. She's definitely one of the worst teachers I've ever had. DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
"Do not take this class if you don't like politics. He is very dry when giving the lecture as it is easy to fall asleep or not pay attention. His grading criteria is mostly based on tests which he makes extremely difficult. The exams are short answer, multiple choice and essay. He also hardly gives extra credit and doesn't care about his students",0
Loved loved this class. She is there for you. Amazing lectures. Hands on. Great group projects.,1
"Professor Bauman is such a sweet and caring person. Her materials and assignments are indeed kind of challenging, but they are thought-provoking. If you really want to learn stuff and actively engage with the materials, definitely take her. I would say it shouldn't be hard to get an A-",1
"Brent is simply amazing. He knows what he wants from his students and is clear about it. If you don't understand him, just reread his emails. He knows everything about film and is so passionate about it. He's a wonderful teacher. don't expect an easy A, but expect to learn a lot. I recommend him to everyone I know. LOVED this class.",1
I absolutely loved having Professor Ippolito! We learned so much more than just how to give a speech! He really cares about each student and that is the first thing you will learn in his class. C.E.H.R. Be ready to learn all about that acronym!! He has a great way of teaching because he is more like your coach/mentor than your professor! Loved it!,1
grading was super late and i had written half of the essays before one was graded. weekly in person recitations and zoom workshops. intensely boring lectures. i felt like i was just regurgitating information for a grade.,0
This professor is so funny and his lectures are super engaging while adding to the class material. The class was based entirely on 3 exams all of which were take home and short answer essay question based. I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed learning it. Amazing course.,1
"Everything is online so the people giving Crumpler bad reviews haven't actually had a bad professor. Out of all the ones in the chemistry department, this is the only teacher that cares. You don't know what you have until it's gone. He will almost never fail someone as long as they try. That's something to respect about him, and something to adore",1
in all honestly she is a good professor but omg she gives out way too many assignments. they are never ending and totally unfair!!! if it wasnt for her excessive assignments she would be a GREAT professor. its like she thinks we have nothing better to do. humanities is BORING!,1
"Many of the questions on the quizzes and tests come from the homework and slides but the final exam had really complicated problems which I struggled to solve. Dont take this class during the summer, it is really fast paced. This is the first C I gotten. Spend a lot of time doing homework and youll be fine",1
Quite easy in my opinion. Took this class before and didn't pass took it with Yemut and did amazing not particularly great at math but was really excited when I got an A on a test. Simple do your homework and tests are ALWAYS 25 questions. ,1
My favorite professor of all time! He is so intelligent and really cares for the success of his students. All his exams and quizzes are open note. There is absolutely no way to fail this class. You will learn a lot from him and enjoy doing so! No idea how he doesnt have perfect rating!!!,1
"NEVER forget doing her homework or go late to the class, she gets mad when this happens. The tests are okay, but if you have an ascent wrong, you lost all the points for the question. If you wanna learn Spanish, this is not a good class. You will learn only grammar, and this is not important as conversation for a language. Overall, she is 6.5/10",1
Easiest stats class in the world. Only thing I disliked about the class was that it took him almost 2 hours to explain something that I understood after 15 minutes. He is extremely detailed and thorough with his lectures. I loved everything about how to class was set up. You're guaranteed a good grade if you pay attention in class and do the hw.,1
Great  teacher. I learned alot in this class. The most interesting class so far in Psy,1
"I would definitely take professor Lhoest again!  She is a wonderful teacher who is sincerely interested in developing her students in the french language and culture. She gives out extra credit. Tests are not too hard. She gives study guides. Lectures are not boring, but essential to the grade. Missing class is a bad idea you'll fall behind so fast",1
"Some lectures were a bit long (lots of information), but overall, she made the course more interesting. There were many activities to prepare us for exams. Very helpful.",1
She's a good professor. Im taking her again whenever I get the chance.,1
Dr. G's class was great. He lays out a clear path to follow and you just do the work. Writing English at a basic adult level is needed to pass. If you write like a ten year old child then you get a D. Like you literally have to be totally ignorant about writing to fail his class.,1
"Don't take a class with him. You learn nothing, because he knows nothing about the subject. Look elsewhere to fulfill your requirements.",0
Put in the work and you will pass.,1
"Took this class online. I didn't feel like I had a teacher since I havent talked to her once this semester. It's a good class. Put in the work and you'll be fine. Not going to lie the ""only two exams(midterm and final) is a bit of a gamble. You don't have a lot of recoveries if you fail either exam.",1
"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",0
"I took this class since the Holocaust is one of my main interests. The class should have been easy for me. However, she goes way too fast for anyone taking notes by hand to write anything down and doesn't like to see anything through anyone else's eyes. She has no formal grading system and is of little to no help on the one paper assignment we get.",0
His tests are often confusing and he ends up dropping four or five questions every exam because they are worded awkwardly. There is an immense amount of reading that goes on in this class. If you are not constantly on top of the reading you will fail the exams at the end of every four units. ,0
"She has an accent, it is fairly easy to understand, but if you do not have an ear for accents you may struggle. Lectures are pretty straightforward, and I was able to understand the content. If you are bad at math, I do not recommend taking her because she at times is not clear and can move a bit quickly. Pay attention, and ask questions!",1
Great teacher! Kind and considerate.,1
He's is the best professor I have ever had......extremely understanding person. I love his knowledge and sense of humor which makes the class more interesting. He inspires me to like Anatomy and Physiology,1
Makes classes fun and easy. Attendance is mandatory but studying is minimal.,1
"Metzl is an awesome professor! If you are looking for your R&E req., this class is great- interesting lectures/guest speakers. Some reading, but it's fairly easy. Take the honors section if you have the opportunity. Though I had no interest in women's studies before, this class used both history and current events, and made me care. GREAT class.",1
DONT TAKE IT WITH FOWLE..SHE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR!,0
"She talks for ever in class about the most abstract stuff. Approximately 5 minutes of what she goes over in lecture is on the exams. Inconsistent af, late all the time, exam is 100% based off the book, and you only get a study guide if you're lucky. Never grades things on time. Comes off as super nice, funny, etc. but a bad professor.",0
"Amazing professor, very helpful. Learned so much. Had her for A&P I and II got an A+ for both. If you study and do the homework you'll get an A.  Ask the Questions, she will answer.  Very nice and awesome.",1
"Professor Bonner is by far one of, if not the best math teacher I have ever had. His class is the first math class I have taken where I felt I was not just regurgitating information. He encourages you to explore fields where the topics you go over during the course are applied in the real world.",1
Dr. Mavica was great. As long as you stay on top of her lectures and do your Mindtap assignments you are set. This course was really interesting and I enjoyed it a lot. The textbook was very helpful for me on the exams as well as her lectures.,1
"Sister Kirkham has been a huge blessing to my first semester here. She genuinely cares about each student & she has a string tugging background. Her strength radiates throughout the classroom & her honesty has helped me raise my own standards. She is a PHENOMENAL teacher, I could write a book about how incredible she is. Learn powerful things w/her",1
"This was a diagnosis and assessment course on DSM V. Unfortunately Dr. Meshelemiah is NOT a clinician. A non-clinician instructing this course was absurd. She is a confusing writer and will debate it is your fault for not reading her true intent into ambiguous language. Students have no idea what a writer intended to say, only what was written.",0
"Dr. Ferrero lectures from her own powerpoints and the class has 4 exams, 1 presentation, and lab/class work. There is a lot of information covered in the powerpoints, so she provides a review for each chapter so you know what to study for. She is very smart and kind. The class has zero surprises. Bio 2 is hard, so you must study!",1
  She's crystal clear of what she wants.  A lot of writing  but they are fairly easy---6 discussions + 11 analyses (your grade depends on these)  and 3 exams + 11 quizzes.,1
"This is literally just the best professor I have ever had in my life. There's no exaggeration and I would never say that unless it is actually true. He changed my view of life and helped a lot in giving me directions. I am beyond grateful to him. THE BEST. Makes everyone participate with a camera on. Trust me, taking him is your best choice.",1
"Don't even need the book. 1 group assignment and 1 individual short one pg writing assignment. Two exams: Mid-term & Final, which are easy. You can bring ur laptop to search the exam questions online. No note taking required for class. Just sit back, relax, & enjoy the class. Easy A & great prof.",1
"Teaches for biology students, not chemistry students. If you are a chemistry major, I strongly recommend some basic biology class first, even though it is not a prerequisite. I struggled with the biology portion. He is a talking teacher and does not write things down for you. Very hard to keep track of all  the new biology vocabulary.",1
"Great class, nothing else like it out there.  Takes some work to keep up in lectures.  Uses Greek a lot.",1
"Dr. Evans is one of the most difficult professors I have had at Union. However, if you are looking to truly understand American Politics, he is your guy! Definitely a fun class, but it is a decent amount of work.",1
"She's great, honestly. Decent amount of homework, but she really, genuinely cares about you and your work. We had notebook checks which demanded she read 20+ pages of homework for just me, and I found notes and words of encouragement written on every page. She really cares.",1
"Stats is a nightmare but Maojoudi made it easier! A lot of homework, but it is worth it. Attendance is a must. Group quizzes once a week. Three tests. A final project. He is very passionate about teaching and is one of those teachers that wants you to finish every class understanding everything. Very sweet man. Best stats teacher at Skyline!",1
Professor Guerra is one of the best teachers at UCF. He is so understanding and great at explaining everything. Honestly a true gem. Highly highly highly recommend taking him!!!!!!,1
"He only gives 30 minutes to do assignments in class, and he grades them harshly. Do not take this professor unless you're auditing his class.",0
"This rude lady suck! Half of the class dont understand her ""English"". You wont know what you do in class. Give you suprise that she never taught you in class during final exam. GRADE STUDENT ON HER PREFERENCE.",0
"People like Fulsom for Astronomy, but I really enjoyed Nelson's class. I admittedly fell asleep often in the dark room during long lectures, but the subject matter is really interesting. Has experience in field. Very passionate about astronomy, clear about what will be on tests, good review sessions. I learned a lot.",1
"McConkey is a great teacher. Interesting lectures and personal stories however he does put that information on his tests, it's helpful to at least get recordings of lectures if you're not in class. Would recommend taking him, would also recommend trying from the start. Each test counts a lot.",1
Dan was so cool. He's hilarious and keeps the class entertaining. He knows his stuff. I didn't take the class serious at all and still got a C. Be sure to study for the tests. Overall a great class and a cool professor. One of the best by far at Mjc. The class is very chill and laid back. Highly recommended Mr. Chase,1
He really has the passion and the talent. Seems very hardline at first but turns out to be the nicest,1
No Comments,0
"Very long lectures, he talks about the same thing forever. Way too slow paced of a class. Talks about the same things the book covers; if you need to save money don't by the textbook and just take good class notes. Sometimes talks down to students when they ask a question to clarify. Knows topic, brings in his personal experiences.",1
"Overall good teacher. She's excited about her job and that makes her very likable. If you don't do the homework or test reviews, don't expect to pass unless you're a math genius or something. Do the work assigned, ask questions and you'll do fine.",1
I would highly recommend for anyone to take his class. He is very clear on what he wants to see on essays and he is easy to talk to. This class is very easy because he makes it easy. He is very strict in attendance and being on time.,1
The professor is very clear on what she expects. If you just follow her directions you will do fine. You have to complete weekly assignments and if you keep up with that you will be good.,1
Horrible. Avoid her if you can. I promise there are better communications professors. She could use some brushing up on communications since she's so horrible at it. Didn't teach a single thing. All student based and forced discussions on zoom.,0
"Very hard to contact! Does not answer emails and is very unclear when he does! He makes it very difficult to succeed in his class, and he lets you know that as a student! We are beneath him as students! Stay clear! Avoid at all costs!",0
Worst instructor I have ever had. Is not clear with dates of tests.,0
"Mrs. Zeoli is a great lady! I've always struggled (and failed) through math courses; she takes all the time you need to help you understand the material fully, is fun and engaging with the class, and teaches at a decent pace. Highly reccommended for anyone who needs extra help passing math!",1
Thanks for a great semester.,1
you know he's done a good job when a good chunk of his classes end in a round of applause. He is the most passionate professor I've ever met.,1
This teacher deserves an award. He is outstanding. Makes the material very interesting and loves his job. I have taken 2 of his classes and loved both of them. Would highly recommend.,1
"I had 125 and 135 with him.  To be honest, they are hard classes, so you have to put in the effort.  But he is VERY nice and is ALWAYS willing to help.  If you dont understand something, ask questions.  He is a very nice guy and a great teacher!",1
"Tough, learned a lot.",1
"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",0
"His tests & quizzes are straight from class notes, don't waste your money on a text book. He is very passionate about Economics which makes the course interesting. He is hard to get a hold of and barely checks his email, but he is an amazing professor!",1
"You can tell he likes what he does. You always know what to expect on tests, he gives some extra credit, and will always answer any questions you have. Highly recommend him.",1
Professor Washburn is awesome. Very interesting class and i learnt a lot.  Will definitely take her again.,1
"I had him for lab, and for someone who doesn't like science and took Geology to fulfill a distribution credit, this was a great class.  He gave us simple notes each class, let us leave early, and the quizzes were really simple.  Plus, he's such a sweet old man :)  ",1
"Mary is a very nice lady and is very brilliant and accomplished. However, she was maybe not the best teacher ever for Intro Enviro Geo. It often felt like we weren't actually learning anything, and we were assigned a Lot of reading that was actually never relevant ever. But she is nice and probably good for upper-level geo from what I hear.",0
"Cant find the words that would be enough to thank her effort and i assure to my own if i gained any presentation skills then its her class, she hit the the right nail in the right spot, although i have not been graded yet, i am not hesistent to take further classes with her",1
save your gpa and don't take her class. trust me,0
"Great professor! Tapia is really has great lectures, and really funny. He's really straight forward, very clear expectations. The quizzes were online, don't miss them because you would have to do a closed book test, which is harder. Simulations were fun! Take Tapia, 10 out of 10!!!",1
"explanations are lacking and course content never goes deep into a topic. overall not interesting, but easy to pass. even though much reading is required.",0
"I had her as a on campus class before COVID. We transitioned to online and she still managed to make the class easy. She was easy to access outside of class and made the course load very simple. Completely recommend!!!! Also, really adorable personality",1
"Poor communication regarding expectations and course information and updates are all over the place, if you can even find it online.",0
"I took this class during a one month duration during the fall. I can say Professor Lane is a great teacher. She is welcoming and likeable. She is fast with replies to emails, and gives great feedback and advice. There is a lot of work that is due each Sunday however, if you are mindful with your time then it shouldn't be a problem.",1
"She might have been having an off semester, but could have given some more feedback. Feedback was pretty sporadic. Assignment due dates were mostly unclear or changed at the last minute. Useless syllabus. Project instructions were vague, which may have encouraged creativity, but definitely inspired frustration. Probably needs to improve rapport.",0
She's very nice and extremely helpful. She is great about answering questions and explain things thoroughly.,1
"Its a Math class, so theres lots of homework. thats just part of the deal. But she teaches in a very clear, easy to understand way, and gets things graded fairly quickly. I really enjoyed the class and i would love to take more of her courses.",1
"Had ken for intro to hospitality. You only get like 4 assignment and 0 homework tests or finals. Super easy class, he's a great guy and has lots of passion for what he does. He loves participation and deep conversations. Overall, I 100% recommend him. Wont forget him.",1
"Super easy class, very little homework. Definitely take this class if you have the chance.",1
Changed my life.,1
I liked her class. She is really nice and is really passionate about child care. Only reason I got a B instead of an A in her class was because of the group projects (my group was lazy and never showed up to meetings) ALSO DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!,1
"I took Intro to Philosophy with Prof. McConnell. His lectures stimulate interesting conversation. He is smart and knowledgeable of the material.  Whether I felt like I aced a paper or failed it, I got a B. Don't get on his bad side. When you ask for help or clarification, he is VERY helpful. His paper prompts can be unclear and vague.",1
Best teacher I've ever had!!! I always got excited to go to class because he makes it so interesting and fun. He is very helpful and so nice.,1
Dr. Solano is very thorough with this course. He opens assignments in myomlab at least a week in advance so there is plenty of time to complete them. His in class lectures are very good as well and he is great with answering questions whether in class or via email. Overall he is a great professor and I would definitely his class again.,1
"Lectures were a big waste of time, had to buy 5 different books - all of which were poorly written & uninteresting",0
"Very detailed and easy to follow modules. A lot of reading and writing, but he will help you every step of the way. I learned so much in this class. It was a lot of work, but worth it. He explains in DETAIL how he wants assignments turned in. Great professor. Responded to an email over break! Take him!",1
"Good class, 3 tests, 1 non cumulative final all multiple choice. No papers or projects, all you have to do is bring examples, and read the book. Usually go home early everytime. Take her.",1
"I've had this prof many times, and each time it just gets worse. It's impossible to get office hours. Don't even try to get feedback on a paper before you submit it. His handwriting is gibberish-so feedback on assignments  and his notes on the board are scribbles. The quarter also ended last week and he hasn't posted any grades yet. He is a mess.",0
"Pros, Easy class with little academic rigor, Say the right things with bare minimum deliverables will result in an A unless you openly disagree with her. Cons, Little academic rigor, Slow to respond to email, Can be extremely rude to paying students.",0
"Like most art history profs, she shows slides of the artworks and then talks about them. The course content is interesting, but sometimes the lectures feel long. You don't need to do the readings regularly, but they are useful for the essays if you scan through them. This is an easy course and it's good to attend for content on your essays.",1
Shes a VERY HARD teacher shes horrible she never helps you when you need the help she expects you to know how to do the work take someone else who will help you.,0
"Currently wrapping up her class, and it is great. She is very helpful, very insightful, laid back. She creates a chill atmosphere and yet, teaches in a way that sticks with you. She's also sexy",1
"Dr. Robichaux is a great, caring and helpful teacher. She will explain all that you need to know and exam content comes directly from the powerpoint slideshows that she presents. However, it is still necessary to put in a good amount of time before test day to study this information, as it will be a lot.",1
Tough grader!,1
"Excellent teacher.  He runs an activity-based type of class, which really helps out when it comes to learning.  He is available almost all the time in his office to help out.  He keeps students awake with a lively manner of lecturing, and gets students involved.  Very easy going, but requires work to be done.  Not a bad teacher at all.",1
Great professor,1
"Very interesting class, she is very nice and helpful. You will be bored by the material but love her stories.",1
"Loved John Shon. Didnt realize how great he was until I got to Managerial Acct where the professor is brutal. Clear grading criteria, notes were incredibly helpful and midterm wasn't too bad. Final was hard but it was department issued, so what do you expect. A real good guy.",1
"David is a nice guy, but he has trouble engaging students and discussions will drag on way longer than they should. Criteria for grading as well as due dates of assignments are also very unclear. Had to do 4 oral presentations and a bunch of papers, so lots of work, but pretty much everyone gets the same mark, so not worth putting in extra effort.",0
"You have to get past his French accent. Once you get past that, get ready for confusing teaching, 0 clarification, lots of homework (online quizzes graded on accuracy) and a few pop quizzes. He doesn't explain things very well and is quite confusing.",0
BOOOOOOOOOOO. Bad professor. Makes a 100 level class way harder than it has to be and offers zero extra credit. If you want to get an A make sure you memorize the lectures and everything in each chapter as he will pull random questions from the book that were never covered. Only need a 50% to pass though if you're okay with a D.,0
"Gerard's class ended up being one of my favourite classes. It takes a lot of work and a lot of creative thinking, but it felt like it was worth it. While you will need the short novel, the textbook is unnecessary. If you do the homework, you won't get below a B- in the course. ",1
"The class is interesting compared to others and he tries to make it fun. Most of the test is short answer so take notes in class he does not try to trick you, everything was went over in class.",1
"I've taken quite a few of his classes and even gone out of my way to take his classes. He barely gives out work, the work is super easy, and sometimes he'll do ""pop quizzes"" which are really just you writing down your name and getting 10 points for being in class that day. Great professor!",1
"Exams are pretty easy, you have 3 they're online & all problems from the homework. The exam will only have 3-5 questions though and he does not give partial credit if you made a typo. But Wiley will give you partial credit if there are a few boxes you need to fill in. HW is optional and he goes over every single problem. Do homework for grade boot",1
"Matt teaches exactly what you will need to know for the exams. Participate in lab and follow the manual. Ask questions, he'll only go deeper if you bring it up. Form groups to study the lecture notes and slides. His Nerd News facts are funny. Overall good professor.",1
"Great teacher. He's very enthusiastic. Can be a bit disorganized at times but will go out of his way to make sure things are fine if there's a problem. Though, I can't say I liked the idea of having a poetry exam that was as critically graded as it was...",1
"MCOM320 is awful no matter who you take it from. Jason is the best you can take it from. He's only 29, still single, and comes from the same stage of life as us but a step ahead, so he incorporates the material into his own entrepreneurial life. The class sucks, but is very rewarding and his feedback is super helpful. Take it from him!",1
"Had her for Teaching Literacy. She's very one-sided and annoying with her opinions, but the class is easy. 3 papers total and a few easy group projects. Her directions are very unclear and vague, so you gotta wing the assignments but she's an easy grader. Just pretend to agree with her on everything and you'll be good.",1
"Best prof. at Hamilton, hands down.",1
"Nice guy ! very helpful, just go to class and you'll be fine. if he repeats solving any problem, it's on the next test or quiz. weekly quizzes, will tell what exactly on some of them. VERY fast and easy grader. Would take him again for sure. ",1
"Ratana is a pretty awful instructor who can struggles to explain the most basic concepts of operating systems. He recycles assignments, quizzes, and tests, and he teaches this class pretty often, so it shouldn't be difficult to find resources from previous semesters. ",0
"If you are willing to work hard, you will do well in this class If you want to slack and study last minute - you gotta look for another professor. A homework every week and 1 test a month. Great lectures. If you listen to the lectures and take good notes, the tests will be fine. DONT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, only purchase his workbook for practice",1
His resources for success are not helpful and are outdated. Way too many things to navigate throughout the website. Feedback from work arent helpful. Prof responds emails in a long time. The online meetings have nothing to do with what were learning. The criteria and rubrics he left for us to work on for assignments are not resourceful or helpful,0
"My favorite professor so far, three essays not graded too hard",1
"Very easy class if you're always there on time. The exams derive mostly from his lectures, and his lectures tend to be long, but very informative. I highly recommend recording his lectures so you won't miss any important details. The textbook did not help me much. Study the definitions he uploads on blackboard.",1
The journalism section of Econ 1051 is a COMPLETE waste of time.  She expects people to participate in a giant lecture and she talks about subjects we haven't covered yet.,0
Gives good lectures and is always on point. Good with explaining and keeps it simple.,1
"took over for our physic teacher half way through the semester because he was ill. Completely changed the lesson plan. skipped 5 chapters of learning because we left off at chapter 11 before spring break and came back on chapter 16... and then tested us over 11-15. Nice lady, but her homework and lesson plan could use some work",0
The lab book is required so buy don't rent it. The first half of the semester was kinda difficult bc you are kinda on your own to teach yourself. The second half of the semester is better. There is a lab practical and Final. She doesn't give reviews (just to read) but she's really nice and willing to help. I would take her again for a course.,1
She has a deadline at 8pm instead of 11:59 pm like everyone else. She also doesn't explain assignments well. So far we've wasted about 3 classes for one assignment. There's a trivia that we had to cite. Who does a trivia with citation?,0
"I loved Intro to Shakespeare with Dr. Spearman. She does give a quiz at the beginning of every class, but if you've done the reading, they're easy points. Make an effort and participate and you'll do well - she's a great professor.",1
Alyssa is awesome She set a great atmosphere within the classroom and made it really fun. However she DOES make you work for your grade but it''s still really fun because the topic are intriguing. ,1
I loved his class! Not only did I learn so much but he showed that he really cared about his students' progress. Whenever we needed extra help he was always there for us. His kindness and respect made me want to learn and to do my best. I highly recommend him!,1
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points* thanks Wendy! but srly, do not take her!!!",0
"Terrible teacher if u like feedback. We got our first exam back a month after taking it and never got our second one back. My final grade was not posted for 3 weeks after the semester. Never used the textbook. Reading assignments were ridiculous and always last minute. Avoid this professor at all costs, especially if u don't like history.",0
"Mr. Carter was honestly the BEST communications teacher I have ever had!! No matter how bad of a public speaker you are, you will not feel intimidated in his class. He makes it so easy to speak in front of a crowd! Everyone needs to take his class!",1
"Took this class online and was decent. Homework is time consuming and done on McGraw-Hill but helps you with the tests. Discussions are simple but was slightly confused with due dates. Overall, Professor Casada seems very laidback and easy going. Responds to emails quickly. As long as you pay attention to homework for tests, you should get an A.",1
good prof. he explains things well. hard class though.,1
"For my first graduate course this professor made everything easy. Clear directions for assignments and answers emails quickly. She was not too involved in discussion boards, but still made her presence known by commenting on a few posts. Offered resubmissions and extra credit. Overall easy class of you do the work. APA understanding is critical.",1
Amazingly boring.  Arbitrary grading.,0
"GET THE COURSE READER! She's a little sassy, but she helps if you ask. This fall (of 2015), we were not allowed to use cheat sheets on every quiz BUT for our final we were allowed a double sided cheat sheet. It was an easy course for the most part, not a lot of ""math math"". I recommend this class instead of STAT 119",1
"Dr. Brown is a great guy and loves what he does, but he makes his exams much harder than they should be. He makes study guides for the exams, but then goes in a entire different direction on the exam. Lots of A and B or B and C questions, confusing, just overall difficult.",1
"She is an amazing teacher, but you have to be willing to work hard and study. Otherwise, you won't pass. Attend class and do your homework! ",1
"Bullock is a really good guy. I like him a lot and he tries to keep the class as interesting as possible.  Although it can get boring at times (2 hrs), he is very entertaining and fair. He gives out a fair amount of homework and is a fair grader. He is pretty cool and he's sung to us in class and acted out scenes from history. Take his classes",1
"She's the type of professor your conservative parents warned you about. If she could hug every whale and destroy every coal mine she would. LIBERAL. Can be mean to girls. She locks the door after the start of the hour (excuse me, I'm paying to go here). She also is so far behind the times in terms of resumes and cover letters it's not even funny.",0
"Dr. Hartman is the best professor I ever had. He is funny, intelligent, and will challenge your beliefs (in a good way). I cannot recommend him enough. If you ever have the chance, take a class with Dr. Hartman. He is an amazing teacher and and is always there to help. ",1
"Professor Russell is the best professor at Vandy, in my opinion. I would recommend any of her classes to anyone interested in political science or law. She's really funny and knows everything there is to know about Constitutional Law. She is always willing to help students and it a really great person to talk to about legal careers.",1
"The class was fairly easy, but her lectures were bad. Spends most of the time talking about her personal life, then has to speed-read off the slides for the remainder of class. Kind of homework-heavy but not hard, just tedious. I wouldn't want to take her again, but I've heard there are way worse psych profs here, so do with that what you will.",0
Mrs. Sundberg is extremely confusing. Quite frankly she doesn't teach anything. Very bothersome and the pace of the class is super slow. One paper will take you like 3 weeks to write because she likes steps instead of rough drafts. I would fight god before I take her class again.,0
He is an accounting stud!  Follow his ways and you will be successful.  ,1
The most down-to-earth professor I had at ESU.  Makes interesting points and actually cares about students.  Class can be dull at times.,1
"I am a 4th year UTM student, and this is one of the few courses I have taken at UTM where you will actually learn something. Lectures are old style pen and paper, which is why, in my opinion, you actually learn, the professor is very organized and clear. Test questions are a bit challenging, graders are tough, but I'll definitely take her again.",1
He is a horrible teacher. I can't stand to listen to this man speak. He is alwasy 20 min. late for class and he always leaves early. I'm not talking 5 min. early I'm talking 30min. early. He can't teach. You will learn nothing in this class!!,0
Stockton's philosophy 101 class is a hoot. He makes things fun and interesting as well as provoking interesting questions and ideas. He's a really nice guy and the class is very easy to pass if you just show up.,1
Good instructor,1
"Genuinely cares about her students and knows the content well, but I ended up learning from YouTube & watching her recorded videos at 1.75x. I didnt really understand her explanations. Go to the optional lectures because less people go so its a bit more interactive and she explains problems more thoroughly.",1
"Had him for intro to lit. He is a really cool guy. You go to his class, read soemthing, leave. It's really dumb if you fail his class because it is so easy. He's really helpful. I hate poetry, but he helped me understand it. Take this class!!!!!",1
He gives 4 tests that are essay tests but he gives you the questions before the test so you know what to study. You dont have to show up for class but if you do you learn more for the test. He is easy going and not hard. Yes you have to study for the tests just like any college class but other than that it is super easy I recommend it,1
"Read the book for this class!!!  He makes sure you understand the material, but test questions come from the book!  Do all your homework and PeachTree.  If you get full 100 on each of above and maintain test score of 71% and higher, he guarantees B in his class.  He will repeat that throughout semester so students don't stress out.",1
I looked the most forward to attending because I learned a lot and it was 100% worth my time. He is a very kind professor who enjoys actual discussion and it never felt like a lecture and more like a really open conversation (I was in the honors with 20 people). The tests were never as hard as I thought they would be. Fun and enlightening!,1
The professor talks really fast when she give lectures. She grades hard! She except you to know the entire book and vocabulary. Her quiz online are difficult. The time for each quiz is 20 min.,0
"Shapiro is  super knowledgeable about the Chinese history and environmental politics, and she  shares fascinating stories from her past and work. She is deeply connected to the fields and often brought in guest speakers. She is strongly opinionated, which is good, but it can color her teaching. Other 2016 SIS140 students exaggerate the difficulty.",1
"Sweetest thing. She is a tough grader, but she will let you rewrite things. we had 2 exams with a few papers. she wants you to ask questions and participate and loves those who do. i would recommend giving her drafts and still rewriting it. she gives you study guides for the exams which you have to know inside and out. go to her. sweetest thing!",1
"I received 88-95s on every exam, yet even if I get a 100 on the final, I can not get an A in this class. Giant flaw in his grading system. He does not respond to emails. Exams are 95% of the class and homework is completion. He can be funny in class but also very sassy. Homework every night with videos that you are required to watch.",0
"Overall he is an okay teacher. He is somewhat unwilling to provide help to students, and he talks down to students. However, if you miss class everything is online. Personally, I have not enjoyed him as a professor.",0
very likable professor. Easy class. All that he requires  is attention and a degree of inferential perception,1
Not clear when explaining. Assigns redundant code modifications (that are nearly impossible to read) for nearly all the assignments. Grades more ruthlessly after drop date. Extremely picky when checking homework; don't expect much partial credit.,0
"Strange teaching style, but not impossible to pass his class.",1
"First things first, Marc's class is DIFFICULT.  You must participate,and make sure to ask questions. He is very understanding , and offers plenty of resources to help you, staying after class , going over tests to help you understand the material etc. if you ask for it! I Hated the subject, but loved Marc! Take him. The work passes off.",1
She doesn't grade easy but I actually understand the language now. She doesn't slow down and it was hard at the start of class but i feel like I understand how real French sounds. ALWAYS  be ready to talk because she randomly calls on people. She can be kind of tough but she is helpful outside class and gave me tons of advice about study abroad.,1
Professor Xian takes a lot of pride in her work. She goes above and beyond to answer all questions or concerns from all students.,1
"Pretty easy class. Few, but simple assignments and a final project at the end which is also fairly simple. He goes over and does part of the homeworks. Tests are open laptop/notes and consist of 3-4 questions similar to the homework but slightly more difficult. If you found CS151 easy, then you'll probably feel the same about this class.",1
"(The honor section) His idea is very clear, his logic is extremely strict and his proof is always complete. The class is almost perfect except that..................I cannot understand........",1
"Konya is a very nice guy and teaches the material very well. On exams he wants you to write out answers in detail so that anyone could follow along and understand it. For some people it isn't ideal but for people wanting to teach math in the future, being specific and showing full work on problems is a good habit to pick up.",1
"I thought that lecture could be a little boring sometimes but Dr. Galileo has a certain subtle humor to him that I found very funny. Personally, I enjoyed the material which forms a basis of understanding for other classes like molecular or genetics. Enjoyable class overall although quizzes could be tedious to study for with a busy schedule.",1
"Best professor I've ever had! This class focuses on health programs and effects in workplaces. There is chapters posted for reading, there is no textbook. Quizzes cover readings! Some topics covered are less interesting than others, but that's life. This class is great if interested in health promotion! I recommend her for every class possible!",1
She's very giddy and nice and helpful. Her labs are tough as there are no paired teams. All on your own. Tough grader too. Just get on her good side.,1
"The best online class professor. There is a lot of work that you have to do. But you learn tons from the course that Soh put together. Her eLearning is organized so well that you don't get overwhelmed during the short period of time. Soh is accessible via zoom. Whenever I had questions, she was right there and helped me.",1
"It's true, Sean Brennan is the best there is. If he is still teaching mechatronics, don't miss your chance to take it with him. Not a blow-off elective though. Great lectures, lab sections were challenging and often frustrating, but rewarding. Exams and homework were not bad. He is a well-respected guy and the best prof I've had at Penn State.",1
"Super informative, pleasant voice to hear for lectures. Her quizzes are straight-forward. You have to study a little but it's not terribly hard.",1
"If this a mandatory course you should take him. The exams are almost identical to the study guides, he only changes the numbers and this is extremely helpful. Practice problems and you will pass. Do not take LaRosa",1
"Wonderful teacher. She clearly knows what she is teaching and is very helpful! At first, I thought that fresh. seminar would be boring, but there are many activities Dr. Michals have conducted. Reflection papers help you become a better writer, and she wants the best for her students. Wonderful, and by far, one of the best teachers at CSUS.",1
"Incredibly knowledgeable and smart, a practitioner within the field and has been published many times. You will learn from him, having said that... he is extremely condescending and sometimes is a bit sarcastic. He is intellectual and gets frustrated if you are not on the same level as him, he expects a lot from you but seldom gives feedback.",1
"I had Dr. Phelps for two art history classes. He was hard but fair. The people that complained about him never came to class or texted and slept.  So as long as you came, paid attention and took good notes you did well. In the first class the students where uninterested but in my second class the students where engaged and it made for a fun time.",1
"She is amazing, and you get to choose between shop or show hours to get full credit. I chose to work the first two shows, and you have to shows for all the tech rehearsals and shows on time in order to receive a good grade. She is very friendly too. :)",1
"Best math teacher I've ever had in my entire life. Math is a very hard subject for me, but getting an A was really easy because he's such an amazing professor.",1
"Probably one of the most unorganized people I have ever met. She always showed up late for class and had to fight with the projector. Lectured for about 4 weeks and then sat back and made us do presentations for the rest of the term. She was also not very helpful. The midterm and the exam, however, were really easy.",0
She does not prepare you the at all for anything. As a result the class has a failing average!SWITCH OUT if you have the chance!,0
This guy is great. He is literally responsible for getting me my first job in TV. Best prof I had at Rider and even better as a mentor. No serious student would have anything bad to say about Kildea.,1
"We had four essays throughout the semester and we did peer reviews to help us develop our papers.  She is very caring and gives great feedback.  She's hilarious in class and rarely gives quizzes/tests, but if there is going to be one she reminds you.  Overall great teacher and person!",1
"Favorite class at Clark. Super interesting, but there is a lot of reading and you need to study. If you're good with that, then you will be just fine. He curves his exams (or quizzes? can't remember) at the end. This helps your grade a lot. I had a B- the whole quarter and when he curved quizzes/tests & put in our presentation & final, I got an A.",1
"Suhaan was a great, passionate professor! Would definitely recommend taking The Art of Fact SAGES course that he co-teaches with Andrea Simakis",1
"GREAT teacher by far my favorite! Really helpful and understanding. Makes jokes in class, he is one cool dude",1
Very thorough and very fast paced class. Take good notes and the class is easy. Very approachable professor and helpful. He is definitely has his opinions and shares them with his reasoning to his conclusions. Found him very interesting and left me with new perspectives on the influences of historical events. Highly recommend.,1
Prof Cramer is a nice person. He is very into his lectures. Material is clear. But test and grading is very hard!,1
"She was good, but I found that she inserted her own opinions too often.",1
"Picks favorites. Good teacher, but loves those who are most quirky and out there. And I agree that classes are not grad level.",1
Casey (Kazimierz) Kleindienst is a fair professor. Reading is a must to pass exams. Case studies are important for discussions & exams. Group Project should be taken very seriously. Kleindienst values participation.,1
Key-up!!! Super fun class!,1
The best,1
"3 individual papers, 3 group papers/presentations, 2 memorization tests, group and individual online business simulation.  Professor creates an uncomfortable learning environment.  Half of the class didn't say a word the whole course.",0
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Avoid if possible. Hes a very tough grader. Sets his expectation for his students very high. Does NOT give good feedback on any essays and makes you figure it out yourself even at a basic level course. Is never satisfied with any essay. Vague topics. One low grade and you can never recover.,0
He is extrememly easy. I took him for writing 201 and class was a joke. all you did was watch videos and write a couple 500 word essays which you have to. He has to fulfill a  minimum amunt of papers to write. He cares about grammar but he is a good grader.,1
"Shes such a nice person & really cares about the profession, very laid back and pretty flexible when it comes to assignments and attendance as she knows life can be chaotic. Assignments are very strait forward. She gives PLENTY of time to get all of your assignments/papers done so dont procrastinate bc theyll add up. She loves participation!",1
"Excellent Professor extremely knowledgeable and fun, really enjoyed his class",1
She is the WORST Professor that I have ever had. She sat and read off of the slides. She treats her students like they are little children. She also does not care how you do in the class at all.,0
"Way too much work for a 3 unit class. Discussion posts every week, 1 original post 2 replies. On top of that, you have MyBComm Lab assignments and assignments from the book like once a week. Easy, but just need to be on top of it. The tests are kind of hard, just need to read. 1 major project end of class, multiple parts such as ppt & presentation.",1
"Ariail was a good professor. Helpful, clear and gave examples. Wasn't so boring and he was funny (at least in my class he was).",1
"If you want to learn absolutely nothing and just listen to him talk and joke about his life, take this course. Easiest class I've EVERRRR taken.............",1
"He was an easy A for such a difficult subject! He really explains everything in a way many students can understand if paying attention. Although he does not require you to show up to every class, you'll want to go so you don't miss any lecture. Gives extra credit during every test so there is no reason not to pass! Great teacher!",1
he's a great guy! pretty cynical but I personally loved it. book quizzes are pretty tough but his lectures are good.,1
"Phenomenal teacher. The material can be dry if you're not interested in poetry or having to decipher what an author means, but Professor Spearman is great at keeping it as interesting as possible. She makes it worth your while to attend class and offers some extra credit opportunities.",1
"Dr. Hess is such a wonderful, nice lady and it shows when she teaches her classes.  She grades fairly and only wants her students to learn.  She has also helped me with advising and is increible!!",1
He has long lectures about what he talks about. If you pay attention to the DVDs youll be fine. Not really much to do when just taking notes. Sometimes he asks certain foreign words and wants the class to participate in on their meaning. Most of the time its silent in class because we just doesnt know the answer.,1
"Dr. Brown loves what he teaches. His exams are hard but not if you actually study and he has no problem answering any question you bring to him. I leave his class happy every time and usually laugh a lot too. He is a funny guy and overall his classroom experience is very relaxed and welcoming, but you actually need to study for his exams. ",1
"Very interesting lectures, learned a lot from classes.  Not easy but it is definitely worth the effort.",1
He was my favorite teacher for Fall 2016. An a amazing teacher. Easy A. Gives a lot of extra credit and helps you on everything even test and quiz. i highly recommend him. i would definitely take him again.,1
"Great guy! I wouldn't say the class is super interesting but Holt is just an exceptionally nice, honest guy. If you put in a little bit of work, talk in class every once in a while, and show reasonable effort and understanding, you will get an A.",1
"Great professor, and knows her stuff about entering into the world of Social Work! I would recommend her to anyone who is starting to head into this career.",1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, with an unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. 1/10 from me",0
Dr. Brown is my favorite professor. Tests are hard but he is a great guy and very approachable.,1
"I believe he is very smart and always want to help you to success. He is always late to the lecture as well as online meetings. He rarely help in lab, basically you just figure with your lab partners and he's doing his own stuffs. Takes forever to grade and provide very very little feedback on your homework. Tons of homework due at the same time",0
I took her class over interterm and she is the best Spanish teacher yet. Even though the class is very fast paced she does and great job and the tests and quizzes are very easy. She is also the sweetest and is willing to help with anything! Not to mention she sometimes bring food/candies to class!,1
Awesome professor!,1
She is an amazing professor and probably my favorite one. She is extremely passionate about the topic and wants to make sure everyone understands it. Her explanations are clear and always offers help outside of class. MT and final were fair. Study old ones.,1
"This professor would pick on specific people. There was one girl in my class who she would be extremely negative towards. She would make fun of her when she wasn't in class, tell her her ideas for projects were terrible with no constructive criticism. She lacked a professional attitude and she seemed to lack compassion for her students.",0
Took a fascinating honors seminar with her. Super helpful and cares about her students understanding the information. Best science teacher I've had at Foothill,1
"Funny professor,very kind, but being very strict with attendance.  Only lectures, no need for participation. Always write all important points and definitions on the blackboard, clearly and orderly. Quizzes and tests are usually about some items mentioned on the blackboard,  not difficult if you understand and  memorize them. Worth to try.  ",1
She is often unprepared for class and none of her directions are clear. She expects you to know things without telling you. She literally makes no sense.,0
He is the best english professor that I have ever had!  He made class interesting and I never wanted to miss.  I am usually terrible at english so i was worried about this class but it was so easy!  I got an A and i have never received an A in english before!  TAKE HIM!!!,1
"Really enjoyed the online class and her content was amazing. Engaging and clear, very helpful feedback and overall an awesome professor.",1
"Good prof, the course material can be pretty boring and lots of grammar. ",1
"6 labs and 3 exams. However, if you fail any of the exams, you wouldn't pass. Tip: either read the entire textbook or go through as many quizlets as possible. Very clear and straightforward.",1
"Would love to see her stochastic processes, but avoid her if you can!",0
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"This felt less like a management course and more of a spiritual self-help class. The reading isn't too challenging, but it's more touchy-feely and preachy than I'd expect from a business course. The instructors are fair with their feedback and grading, but quizzes are poorly for multiple choice format. Use the virtual classroom!!",1
Honestly very disappointed in this professor. Took a class I cared about and came out less interested than I started. Meyers is extremely dogmatic and narrow minded for a philosophy professor. He is very set in his way of thinking and presenting opinions other than his will not end well.,0
"He has a passion for design and tries to instill that passion in his students. sometimes his passion gets the best of him and he goes off on random tangents and talks a little too much about stuff unrelated to projects, but overall he's a great teacher.",1
"Honestly he's excellent. Knowledgeable, clear, and direct instruction. He respects his students enough to not spoon feed them and in turn expects that they do the work assigned. He is fair, and if you pay attention, his classes are pretty straight forward.",1
"If you are looking for an ""easy"" (3) Theater Credits to satisfy your Fine Art requirement, look elsewhere.  This is class nor Professor will be an ""easy"" course.  She has no tolerance for truancy and you will be expected to read every word in the book, be quizzed with no heads-up on what you are being quizzed on AND you better perform via GOTE!",1
GREAT COURSE AND PROF,1
"He does get distracted when having class discussions, however they are all in good fun. Reading quizzes can be difficult but they do not impact your overall grade that much. Dr. Daniels is a very talented writer, and I valued his input on my stories so I could grow in my skills.",1
"This professor is one of the worst Ive had. Professor Smith has hardly done any of the work herself and leaves it up to her Sophomore TAs without a set grading scale to grade a majority of your assignments. While its and easy A, its if she actually grades your paper in a timely manner. Im still waiting on a huge grade and its been two months.",0
"-Yes lectures are long ( YT /user/profjpearce/videos), but it helped me to watch the recordings over a few times rather than attending live. -Yes Jedi is difficult (custom built on top of Scala) -Exams are REALLY difficult and due to the weighting, worth a LOT -Recordings def helped w Jedi (being able to see his code) -Answers emailed Qs thoroughly",1
"Very rude and unhelpful via email, though I suppose that is because it is an online class and she does not want to be bothered with helping students. I sincerely hope that she isn't this unapproachable and rude to all of her classes.",0
... ... Boring ... ... A+ ... ... That is it ... ...,0
"Matt is the best professor to take for anatomy. Your entire grade is 4 online homeworks, one dissection plan, and 4 exams. Lecture and lab exams are taken on the same day and are equal in points. There is no ""fluff"" in this class. He is very specific on what you need to study and you won't find anything on the exams that weren't in his lectures/lab",1
"This is my last semester with Professor Bertens and I hope I can find someone as clear and helpful as him. Two homeworks a week and a quiz every other week. His instructional videos is very helpful, he will teach you helpful ways that would make sense.",1
"I like Professor Nurick, he is a nice guy. Seems to be genuinely interested in getting to know the students. Something about him makes you think you're gonna get an easy 4.0 in his class; this is NOT TRUE, make sure you actually put effort in your homework and group projects! Overall positive experience and highly recommended.",1
This guy is almost impossible to understand at times.  Class is SOOO boring.  Tests are hard and you wonder if he ever taught what he is testing over.  Some test questions aren't even in proper english.  AVOID!!,0
great teacher! only homework consisted of 2 five page critiques and 2 exams (the mid-term and final) which were take-home tests. he grades a lot on participation during class. highly recommend him as an instructor!,1
Clear in presenting. Clean slides. Nice.,1
Moore is a great professor. he knows his stuff and is hilarious. There is a bit of reading but it is manageable. The final essay is the main grade for the class but wasnt too hard.,1
"Mrs. McGlynn is honestly one of the most caring, passionate, and inspirational teachers that I have ever taken.  I have enjoyed this class immensely.  She is kind and willing to help, and you can truly see that she loves what she does.  I cannot recommend her enough.  She is incredible and I am so very glad that I took her for this class. :)",1
"Professor Howson is great, I have taken multiple of her classes and definitely recommend. She is always available to help via text (yes, she gives you her number and encourages texting questions!) she also checks in to make sure you are enjoying the course and learning! I would recommend to anyone that likes engaging in their classes",1
Excellent professor.  Would definitely take her again.,1
"4 major assignments miss one and you are done for. Class is very work/essay heavy. Be prepared to write a lot. No makeups, no extra credit",0
She likes to talk about her family and baseball more than accounting. I only took her again because I know what to expect from her. I've been in 2401 for a week and we haven't had any actual teaching yet. Can't wait for December.,0
She manages to turn an interesting subject into an arduous journey through monotony. Her accent cuts right through you and trying to take notes is beyond frustrating. Ridiculous amounts of reading that really doesn't provide a relevant look at current culture.,0
"Professor McNeil runs a bit late but she always comes in ready to go with a smile on her face. She is an awesome teacher, I would totally recommend her. Keep in mind you sit around people you know because you do many group projects and you want to be comfortable with your group. Professor McNeill will help you pass, as long as you do your part.",1
She is a great professor that sets the class up for success. She really teaches so everybody easily understands. I have never been a good math student but she made everything very easy! Her tests are straight forward and you will always be prepared through the work in class. ,1
"This was an easy class on the Vietnam War. As a teacher, he will often give out assignments before class but otherwise if you participate, come to class, and do the reading's you will pass. He is also absent a lot, which is nice. It's a super easy Gen Ed class and if you have other hard classes and a busy schedule I would recommend Rossi.",1
"Out of all the math teachers I ever had Mr. Abdel is certainly the best. Like many people I'm not a genius in math but he really worked with me and I actually understand the problems.  He is a fair professor, if you show up and do the work and participate, he will notice.  If you skip class and are lazy don't expect him to give you extensions. ",1
"The best professor in pgcc. He knows what he is teaching and he help you reach your goals. He is amazing , he is kind hearted and hilarious. You go to school with no stress. I highly recommend him.",1
"He is a tough grader. Expect papers, and group projects. He grades your participation, so if you don't speak up, you'll see it reflected on your grade. The text book is a must. He uses every second of class, so arrive on time. He is a nice guy, just a tough teacher to have.",1
She acts like everyone in the class is a CPA. Unfortunately she does not take into consideration that everyone is not an accounting wiz. She is very tuff and very unreasonable. She teaches only through PowerPoint and make other people feel like they are stupid. Her final is so difficult that you cant even finish! NEVER TAKE!!,0
"I was discouraged after reading all the negative reviews. First of all, this is a self-taught online class. The lectures are there to just further solidify the info. If you put in the work (at least an hour a day) you will succeed. Do not let all these negative reviews keep you from taking this class. Start early, and practice! It is not that bad!",1
Professor Washburn is the best teacher at LACC. I highly recommend her. Took her for CD 42 and CD 30 and I got A's both class. Love her classes.,1
"Nimrod made Macro not only barable, but interesting. He put everything in terms we could all understand. He made himself available at all times and went to whatever lengths necessary to help every student. His love for coffee is life changing.",1
I thought this class was effing hard. Hes one of those old school professors who wants you to really learn. 4 months later I've recovered enough to write this review.  I think he is one of the most knowledgeable dudes on campus and he wants his students to be prepared. He has become like a mentor to me and a good friend.,1
"Apparently he lost all his money investing in an app that's supposed to teach your goldfish to twerk, so he recently returned to the teaching game after a decade in retirement. Super awesome professor who simplifies advanced content. The only downside is he randomly loses touch with reality and thinks he's in rural Oklahoma birthing a calf.",1
"Her class is fairly easy, but you will have to do a steady amount of writing each week. Usually about 1000 words over three combined discussion posts (minimum 400 for original posts and 250 for 2 replies to other classmates). Her lectures are entertaining and she is quite likable.",1
"I absolutely loved Mrs. Kurtz and the way she taught. I passed this class with flying colors. If you do the homework and practice tests and there's no way you can't pass. She was always so happy! The only bad thing is I wish I would've been told to only buy the online code, instead of wasting 200 dollars on a book that I never even opened.",1
"As a professor, not my favorite. As a person she is very nice and easy to get along with. This class was okay. we had 2 essays which you share with the class. No quizzes, but the midterm was hard. A LOT of lengthy readings for homework.2 books required and we used them both.",1
"Great professor to take for accounting, even if that is not your major. Clear, concise, and always there to help you with problems.",1
"Really hard class, tested on way too much material, but really good lecturer and wants students to do well, the material is just really dense and complex.",1
"Poole is one of the best uOttawa professors! She is very understanding and makes so much time for her students outside of class. She also teaches very well and thoroughly and truly understands what she's talking about. She gets a bad rap because she challenges her students, but I have taken 4 courses with her and I have learned so much from her.",1
Dr. Vutha has been one of the best professors I have ever had. The class is tough but Dr. Vutha does everything in his power to help you through it. He is very funny and personable. He holds review sessions before every quiz and exam and he is willing to meet with you anytime about any questions you have and explain them to you. Awesome dude!,1
"Professor Yemut is awful. He doesn't care about you learning, he is hard to understand and leaves class early. He teaches exactly out of the textbook and expects you to do the rest. Test are heavy, but he does give partial credit if you do part of the problem wrong. If you work on your own, you will pass the class, just don't expect him to help.",0
"easy A, its more about self learning about yourself. im sure you could breeze by it if you dont want to look from within.",1
Professor Kim had really long and boring lectures.  He flew through powerpoint slides and didn't really explain concepts well at all.  Never actually had an in-class test until the final so I had no clue what his tests were like until then.  Just was not a good teacher when it came to teaching or testing.  Somehow got a B-.  Would not recommend. ,0
"Dr. Vohs was a great professor.  He was very helpful when I needed him, and I thought he explained difficult concepts very well.",1
"If you have at least a passing interest in world religions and you come to class, this is for you. He does assign frequent reading quizzes from the (cheap) class book but they're easy to skim and ace. Tests are on readings and class discussion, essays and group project (2) not graded harsh. Drops a few missed quizzes and in class assignments.",1
Professor Fritz is the main reason I want to go into education. I had no idea of what I wanted to do at first but I KNEW after taking this class. She can be very laid back but also expects you to put in effort to learn and participate in class. If you want an inspirational professor that genuinely cares about your education then definitely take her,1
"By far the worst professor Ive taken at uno. Gives only grades for 2 test and a final, no homework grades and no quizzes. The test are 2 questions. Doesnt explain his notes and expects you to know the material already. Dont think you can ask questions in class because he gets mad he has to answer your question. 0/10 dont recommend",0
"Dr. Hanson is a very difficult grader and will make you work, but is also intelligent and always willing to help. A bit of an old-school professor in that he prefers to lecture the entire class period.",1
"Professor June Lane was very reactive to emails and it was easy to ask questions. There is quite a bit of work, but it is all clearly outlined and easy to keep up with. Easy material and great professor.",1
Professor Konya graded way too harshly and doesn't seem to care if a huge percentage of his class is failing or has to withdraw to not get an F. He takes off so many points for tiny things. I definitely advise against ever taking his classes!,0
"I thought Aren was great at lecturing and keeping it interesting. That being said, gender studies don't always present ""interesting"" content (especially at 9 AM), so you have to actively focus to see the value in this course. If you're willing to pay attention, Aren and this course are both full of valuable insight to almost any given scenario.",1
"Class was canceled often which was good for relaxing, but not for learning.   His lectures drag on and are hard to follow.  His notes are repetitive and all over the place.  I barely used the textbook, which was a waste of money, and it took forever for him to hand back our essays.  If you have another choice, I would take it.",0
Compared to the other 2 economics teachers at MCC this guy is amazing.,1
awesomeness!,1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. The course was challenging but you can do well if you do all the readings, pay attention in class, and study for the exams. The material was extremely interesting, and Dr. Britton was engaging in her lecturing. The course expanded my mind so much, and I would highly recommend any of Dr. Britton's courses.",1
This is by far my favorite professor here at SUNY Cortland. He ties in all his lectures with real life examples which helps extremely when learning the material. He is very enthusiastic and makes learning a fun experience and he is very available for office hours and willing to help. He wants all his students to succeed in the class,1
Great instructor. Nice guy and I really liked the class,1
"I love John Creed with my whole heart. I have never had to work harder for a class, but it has made the learning experience so much better. He is truly a staple for the political science department and I highly recommend him to all students. You will read more than any other class that semester, but you will learn so much. He truly loves his job.",1
"There wasn't a single student in class who wasn't in awe with his lecture. He's extremely passionate about his subject, very personable, has a great sense of humor, and very easy to work with. His lectures were very interesting, the textbook (free) was easy to follow, and the homework prepped you for the quizzes/exams. Best teacher at MJC!",1
"Awesome, awesome, professor. All quizzes and discussions online. Attendance not mandatory, but she makes class really fun and engaging.",1
"First of all, she knows her stuff and she is quite enthusiastic about it. She encourages participation and cares about the students. On the down side, however, she grades way too hard and she takes too long to get back to you with comments and help. When she does get back to you though, her feedback is excellent.",1
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
"Dr. Schwartz is a great professor. He is tough, but he truly cares about the material. He has review sessions, responds to emails quickly and will help you if you need it. Put in the effort and you will do well. His test care challenging but so Anatomy is a hard class. Be prepared to study a lot.",1
"Young-Chul is the only option for 341 at the moment, but he really is great. He is caring and tries his best to make the dry material interesting. As boring as the class is, it's actually useful. He cares a lot about participation, but hardly anyone does. If you give your opinion, raise your hand at least twice per class he will LOVE YOU.",1
"I took her for Social work with Individuals. She is a nice professor but doesnt not explain ANYTHING. She has a hard time getting her words accross because of the language barrier. Her ""quizes"" are hard. But besides all that she is a nice woman. You just have to make sure you know whats going on",0
Doing the homework is a must.,1
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
"ethics of education is sooo boring. she is very monotone and unclear. the tests are ridiculous (and i went to class and studied). the readings are ambigious and very boring. the only fun part of the class is going to teach at the school. and that's mostly bc dr. wike isn't talking. she's very smart, just boring.avoid if possible",0
Awesome teacher. Very clear. Really fun.,1
"Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.",0
"Took Beba for 20th C. Fashion, Art & Culture. A really good class. I knew next to nothing and learned a lot. All papers (creative writing, midterm, final) have correlating PPTs. A brief quiz. Finding primary sources, especially for earlier decades, can be a bit of a pain, but it's doable. Check your grammar on your papers!! Def recommend.",1
"Don't get me wrong I LOVE Dr. Ingram, but you have to pay attention in his class. His writing is not the best, so I do recommend to either close pay attention or record his lecture (record friendly). Also, he does tend to lose some students papers, so I do recommend to SAVE ALL YOUR WORK YOU GIVE HIM. Overall, love the class and professor.",1
"Ghent stood up in class one day and said that ""immigrants and women have no place in geology"". 50% of the class was female; another 50% was visible minorities. We formed a study group and all aced the class. Avoid him or make human-rights complaints - the guy's an ass.",0
"He tells applicable stories from his experience.  Light assignment load, but big group presentation and paper due at the end of the semester.  He does excellent test reviews!!!  Overall, good professor that I would recommend!",1
"Awesome instructor. Understanding, empathetic, and most importantly, she provided continuous feedback. Great professor!",1
He tries to make it interesting an hes always excited and sarcastic but you get used to it. Its not a class you can take lightly cuz my best friend tried. Learned a few things I guess !,1
"He is very nice and respects students. He is also very empathic, effective and teaches so that students would understand the concepts. Try to attend class and pay attention and you would pass. If possible record his lectures and make your notes from it. His exams are not difficult if you listen to him in class.",0
"material was difficult to understand even though i read through all the material at least twice. exams are purely essay based and depend on your ability to interpret the ""meanings"", and arguments behind the various topics addressed in the class.",1
"She is a very intelligent professor and teaches unique ways how to write a paper. However, she only had the class out of 100 points and a 91-100 was an A. I am a 4.0 student and got my first B in this class. Very hard grader on essays (only 5.) Not doing the readings and posting discussions would only count against you, not for you. ",0
"This class made my day! His lectures are so interesting, however many think that you can do well on the test without reading the textbook. Some of the questions on the midterm and final are not covered in his lectures. This class was easy and a great learning environment.",1
"Great teacher but, his lectures/test reviews don't line up with the test. You will always have 2 tests every night you have a test excluding the first one. He's willing to work with you and offer extra credit if you're struggling but if you're like me and got over a 100% in your previous class, you should not take this professor.",1
"Stewart is so hilarious, he has a really dry sense of humor that made an otherwise dull subject matter pretty engaging. I wouldn't advise skipping class, as you'd get behind quickly. I would say that he doesn't give that much feedback on essays, which can be frustrating if you want to improve between draft & final. Very sharp guy.",1
"She was thrown into our class unexpected mid semester and managed to do great. She teaches very well and gives great examples. Her tests are easy if you take really good notes. Always go to the test reviews before class on the day of exams! She gives a lot of good information that's on the test! For the final, you have 1 hr review. ",1
"Amazing man. His lectures are definitely something you don't want to miss. They're SO intetesting and enlightening. You definitely can't miss Gerard's lectures or you will not do well on assignments. There are many small assignments, but they are definitely manageable. You NEED a textbook for this class. An A+ is doable if you work hard. ",1
"Fenster is an amazing professor, like just watching his lectures brightens up your mood and his CHEM181 lectures were so clear and enlightening, making it really easy to study for the exams. Love this prof, he's adorable and his humour is amazing!",1
"I've had Dr. Altamirano for multiple courses and as an occasional, unofficial mentor. She is a wonderful woman. My first class with her was what made me first want to become an ANT major. She gives a lot of readings and sometimes the assignments are a little unclear. She can be a tough teacher, but if you're up to it, you will learn a lot!",1
"One missed class will bring you down basically a letter grade. Lectures are circular, slow, and if they do end up coming to a point the point is generally something that any breathing human could have gotten to on their own at age 15. There's no final but there's a funky amount of busywork. Daily discussions are torturous. A very timid teacher.",0
Greenberg's lectures are the bomb diggity,1
Do not take this professor under any circumstances. For some reason she believes her students should dedicate most of their time to her class despite it being a Miami plan class for most. The tests are filled with ambiguously worded questions which cause averages in the high 60's and essays are expected throughout the semester. Do not take her.,0
Ms. Sexton is an amazing teacher. She is strict but very fair. She only asks you attend class and study.  I had her for Micro Lab and I learned a lot from her lectures and techniques. She can be detailed in her quiz so make sure and study! The unknowns were not hard after taking her. ,1
"It was the easiest UGS ever. There were a lot of essays, but you have the chance to rewrite after you receive feedback. I never attended lectures and I still got a A, so I would 10/10 recommend",1
Goes super in-depth more than you need to know she thinks that we are all medical students,0
Best teacher of my life. He is not hard to understand if you are listening. Very intelligent and willing to explain things. Would recommend him!,1
This class is a good one to take online. This professor puts all the text on canvas so there is no need to purchase a textbook. Weekly quizzes/discussions and some essays but not too difficult! Take this if philo isnt your thing and you dont want to sit in a lecture about it.,1
I recommend taking his class. He is the bomb dot com. I took his class for 092 and math 100. Attendance is a must and you must do the work. He cares about his students and if you need help he will help you. I would take him again.,1
"She's a great professor and I learned so much in her class. Her tests are easy, there's a group project which is not difficult at all. She has lots of guest speakers and overall it's a very interesting class and I would recommend it.",1
"Super sweet and explains things very well. She keeps the notes super organized which I love. The class can be hard but she won't try to trip you up on the quizzes or tests, she genuinely wants you to understand the material and do well in the class. She's very picky about sig figs and labels. Don't miss any labs! They really help your comprehension",1
Helps you out Chemistry is a very tough subject and he understands that,1
"Professor Bonner is one of the best Professors I have ever had. He understands that we are college students and does the best to his ability to help us in every single way. Bonner would make the class room enjoyable and made you want to go to his class and learn. Also Bonner was very respectable, students would want to do their best!",1
I am not much of a reader or someone who likes English classes but I really enjoyed her class! She made the material relevant and interesting and everything she had us read was interesting and made me want to be engaged.,1
"Erika's class is ridiculously easy, but beyond boring. I love anthropology, but this class made me want to sleep. I sat on my phone during every class and ended up with an A. Erika also is strict on her grading in weird ways, like turning in assignments. I was NOT a fan of her as a professor. She just talks and talks and talks until you sleep.",0
"As long as you participate on Discussion board and workbook assignments, Its an A!",1
"I loved her. She is very helpful, involves the class. There is a lot of homework and reading. Homework every class. She is a very nice lady. Ready to help when needed. I would take her again and would recommend her to anyone. Plus she got our textbooks for only $9 or free online!",1
Good teacher!,1
"Swartz is a very good professor; however, beware at the beginning of the semester he seems like such a mean person but he is not.",1
If this teacher said that he was lazy it would be to add humor to an example that he was giving.  I found him extremely helpful and was impressed by the clarity of his teaching skills.,1
"Marie Larsen is a top-notch teacher and a lovely person.  She knows what's required to excel, and is all about helping those who commit to the class.  She matched my investment in the class in every way, even offering up a small conference room near her office as a de facto homework room where she was practically always available.   A+",1
No Comments,1
"Most sporadic, unorganized professor ever. Not clear, changes her mind. Your grade is dependent on whether or not she likes you, emphasizes group work then will give members of the group different grades. Plays favorites. Rudest person I've ever met ",0
"Does not explain his grading for the homework, which is 50% of the total grade, lectures are fairly well organized but also fairly boring.",0
"You should only take her class if you are proficient in math. She makes many mistakes and often gets confused. A nice lady, though.",0
Professor Dattolo is an excellent professor who is always willing to help us. He is available to give us extra help during his free time. His lectures are very clear and he really respects his students. He is the best!,1
"Funny, cares for her students and she pretty easy going. Beautiful also.",1
Dr Borglin very caring. Wants everyone to succeed. Lecture provided on Powerpoint and available on canvas. Must review the chapters and labs before class in order to have a better understanding. Weekly quiz and homework. Study guides for the exams and finals are provided. Extra Credit is offered on exams. Easy A. Lots of math conversions. Spring 18,1
"Great teacher, grade consists of 8 out of 12 response papers, 2 exams, and 2 research papers. Make sure to keep up with the reading and you'll do fine but it is quite a good bit of reading. Very caring and will help you out if you miss a couple assignments",1
He goes over everything step-by-step and always willing to answer questions. I wish that he taught every math course that I need.,1
"This class is very tough, time consuming and takes a LOT of studying to succeed. There is a LOT of homework and tests or quizzes almost every week. However, if you study and use lab time wisely this class is very doable! Professor Chooljian is very caring and offers a LOT of extra credit. Use those opportunities! Study HARD and you should do well!!",1
"Dr. Cash is a very good professor. Clicker questions are part of your grade so show up to class, but you can be absent (I think up to 6 times) before it affects your grade. He is very understanding and nice, although if you wait too long to do discussion posts (even before the due date) he'll email you to do them. It's pretty funny. He's a nice guy",1
"Overall not a bad professor for this section . He tells you straight up to read and take your own notes before class , and then take notes during class. Its not hard. The only thing he does that can be confusing is jump around a lot , his board gets so messy. Hes also awkward , but doesnt require you to participate soo. Also , tests EASY.",1
Horrible teacher. she made me want to drop out of college entirely. She lowered my self esteem and I felt very uneasy around her. TAKE KATHY SOHN!!!,0
"Overall, not bad. She's really nice and very helpful. Always have your AP Stylebook. Always.",1
"Clearly, everyone before me has had a different version of Mr. Bisiacchi. Snarky. RUDE. All of his tests are pop quizzes. His lecture are useless and boring. If it wasn't for the test that were ALWAYS at the beginning of class, I wouldn't even come. The book is MANDATORY. Essays were simple, but grades hard. Would never take this class again.",0
The very best!:)  Loves teaching and she was very helpful throughout the semester.  She is an asset to the UNT's  language department.,1
I had taken French before so nothing I learned in that class was new. I rarely showed up to class but did well. She's a nice lady I'm going to take her again.,1
"Professory Harris is great. I have him for a mix of online and in person. He does live lectures on zoom if you don't go to class. His class mainly consists of easy homework assignments, small writings, easy quizzes, and 6 exams. The exams are not hard and there is no final. If you need to take a music gen-ed take him he's the best!!!",1
"Lectures drag on forever, talks about the same thing for a while. Portrays his opinions as if they were facts, and occasionally even told the class something that was outright wrong. May or may not respond to e-mails. Test are written very confusingly. Got questions wrong despite knowing subject matter. Takes attendance. Book is not needed. Avoid.",0
"Good teacher, Quiz every day but you get a 2.0 for writing your name of the paper. Weekly journal over what you read, midterm, final and group project.Tests are all short answer over quotes that were discussed during class. What play they're from, who said them and why they are important. Read and go to class and you'll be good",1
"This class was really cool, professor Gilbert has these weekly quiz things you have to do, they are really easy and is just there to make sure you did the readings, so don't be put off by that. If you are thinking of taking this class, take it with him, it's really amazing",1
I loved his lectures and the reading material wasn't too bad. There are few assignments and they are pretty easy if you keep up with the lectures and reading. I would definitely recommend him.,1
"He's the absolute best professor I've had for any science class by far!! Prof Crumpler cares about each and every one of his students and definitely does his best to make sure everyone passes. He goes off his powerpoints (based on the text) and gives out a lot of practice problems. Love him, he makes chemistry so easy.",1
"took dr hernandez for cal 2 online last fall. i took this course twice before with others and failed. met with dr. hernandez in his office for help with class and that helped a lot! also emailed with problems i couldnt do and he replied quick with help. points in discussions and extra credit in exams helped too! I passed with B finally, thanks!",1
"Honestly, this is one of the best professors here in Cal State Long Beach. no idea why people are saying bad things about this professor. Yes, he makes the class difficult, really difficult. But his explanations are always accurate and concise. If you want to pass, you have to study before lecture; considering 229 is an abstract class. 326 is fun!",1
"I love love LOVE Professor Michael.  She's so sweet and cares so much about her students and really wants to get to know each one as a person.  The papers can be a little difficult, but you'll get an A if you follow the rubric.  Really one of the best English classes I've ever taken.",1
Very easy. Very chatty. Knowledgeable about the education field to the max! Alice is so loving!! I would recommend her.,1
"Not a bad prof, not a great prof.  Doesn't understand when someone asks him to slow down, because they can't take in the info on a lightning fast pace.  Fair in marking.  Overall, a 'fair' professor.",1
"Mr.fultz is a really nice teacher, you can retake test and all his reviews are the exact same question on the test, take him! His class is easy and they fill up really quick.",1
Amazing teacher . She will make sure you understand the material.,1
"He is a really nice guy. His teaching style is a bit different for this class; he expects you to work independently (with classmates for review) and support you in the work that you do with hints along the way. If you can work independently, then he's your guy; if you need someone to hold your hand, find another instructor. Would take again.",1
He's really boring and easy. Essays take little to no work. He always ends early though. :),1
"Professor Meacham is the best professor at UNI. There are A LOT of assignments, although they are quite useful. She quickly responds to emails. I honestly dont like online classes. Professor Meacham makes it bearable. Her course is super organized and everything is quite clear. I would definitely take her.",1
"Took Scott for Trig, would not recommend unless you already know what you're doing and would still hesitate to recommend. He's late for class almost every class. His answer to most questions is 'look in your notes'. If he does answer it there's not much explanation. If you take Scott and plan to understand trig, be ready to learn it from a tutor. ",0
He just doesn't care if you do not do research! need many years of work experience to take this course. Worst part is his midterm which was a 8mb project with no guidance just throws you in the middle of a random project and expects you to refactor their code without any guidance or system knowledge. I Think he is only a inventor that is it!,0
Mrs. Ala is amazing and very very nice she has her accent but is understandable. Easy class... Shes funny... I didn't use my text book at all  she sends you notes to black board and she goes based on that and also for the tests. ,1
"Online class was interesting. There are quizzes each week and there is a final project that is due, which is 40% of the class. It is done with a partner so it is not to difficult. Overall, this class was good.",1
"Professor Morano was interesting. She was a bit wacky and definitely opinionated when telling her students how to write; however, she gave me a great deal of feedback that (hopefully!) helped me. The outside work was a little much and only somewhat furthered my overall understanding. Honestly don't know if I'd recommend her or not. ",1
Dr. Andrews was a great professor. He kept the class very interesting with his lectures which worked in numerous videos each class. Overall I looked forward to going to his class and would definitely recommend him to anyone.,1
"Even tho this was an easy class, I still learned a lot.",1
"He is a very nice and kind professor. Very understanding and extremely helpful. If you have any questions, ask him in class or during office hours, he is always willing to help. Teaches from the powerPoints, attend class even though it may seem boring, it will help. He does examples and clarifies everything. My favorite Professor! Take him !",1
"Okay there are too many ratchet comments for this decent guy. If you simply read the textbook (which is extremely interesting), study the vocabulary, and understand the experiments, you should get an A, simple. You don't even have to participate in discussion, that's what the talkative people are for. Sit back and relax! Not a hard class.",1
"I do not need epidemiology but have heard so many great things. No exams, BUT a lot of reading and writing. And that he grades grammar. Okay, I can improve on my writing proper English. He believes in academic rigor; this is what students hear the most. AWESOME. Why are other Profs not known for academic rigor. If you plagiarize, don't take...",1
Eileen is a phenomenal teacher! She knows her stuff and has a talent for picking the perfect song to complement your voice. I took lessons with her for 3 yrs and I went from so so to getting rave reviews on my singing. If you do not practice you're gonna get it when you see her and she will criticize you. She gives praise when praise is due. <3 her,1
"The homework is not turned in every week, but there is 5 questions quiz randomly instead of HW. The 4 tests and 1 Final, it was all 20 questions, and it is all open notes. He sends the grade by E-mail every week, you can maintain your grade. Also, there is extra credit worth 25 point! If you want to get easy A, you should take his class.",1
Absolutely love her. I've taken her for Intro to Teaching as well as Diversity of Educators and she is an amazing teacher.,1
prof. Chet is very passionate about math and it's hard for students not to get influenced to also desire to learn the course well. he is very organized and he gives assignments every day.,1
I love her she is the best professor I have had,1
Jeremy Fry is one of the best teachers I've had at Hawkeye.  He made the classroom fun and gave great examples that made the problem solving very easy to relate to.  He respected you and had fun with you as well.  He likes to pick on you and I think that makes his class that much more fun and it makes you want to do your best for him!,1
"The lectures are really long but the tests are pretty easy. When I took the class, 2 of 3 exams were online. All exams when I took the class were open-notes and open-book. If you pay attention and/or take notes, you should be solid for the exams.",1
Most likely the best professor in the religious studies department and possibly one of the best in VCU. She is helpful and her lectures are engaging.,1
"Great guy, active in arts scene in baltimore city. Super down to earth and encourages personal drawing style choices while still promoting technique.",1
"He is a good human being, but his tests are tough. Not too much homework, but a lot of reading. Sometimes when M.R jones talks, he uses a lot of pronouns, so you miss what he is talking about. Also, half of the class is about brain anatomy which is in my opinion, not a part of psychology.",0
Dr. Grapenthin is THE BEST! Even though I haven't had her in college (yet) I have been studing piano with her for wuite some time. She hasn't only helped me with music but she has helped me get throught a lot of other issues I came across. I HIGHLY recomend her she helped me with A LOT and I am sure she will help you to! Shes so nice!!!,1
"i have no idea how she got her Phd. her way of teaching is just stupid. i was planning to get at least a B in IE 314 class. but after the final test i was hoping for a D :( . She thinks she is strict, but in reality she is not. she doesnt know how to be flexiable with students. you will understand me if you try other professors in the department.",0
"Either he doesn't care or he doesn't understand English enough to answer questions, so have fun teaching yourself. His ""lectures"" are just reading from the slides word for word. All the stuff he draws on the board is, you guessed it, straight from the slides. If he says something you don't understand, don't ask questions. He'll just repeat himself.",0
I really don't understand the bad reviews. He is very fair with grading. He will take the time to explain things if you need it. He is passionate about chemistry and really wants his students to learn. He will take the time to explain things to you and keeps at it until you get it.,1
"Yes, you will have to do lots of reading, PowerPoint presentations and lots of research but you will come out of her class with knowledge of the subject in question! Shes always available for students. Fair grader and participation is a plus. I took 2 of her Urban Policy classes. Best professor at CWE.",1
"This guy is awesome. took him for intro to counseling. Funny engaging, learned a lot and he is informative. a lot of what i learned will be helpful in my career and daily life. Demonstrations on active listening during the class made me more aware of how much it is important it in with  communications with people.",1
Best teacher ever easy A very funny and also makes sure you understand everything,1
"Dr. Keeling is a very demanding teacher and does not and will not give you extra help / accommodation when you need it. He expects everything his way or you'll get a 0, while preaching ""grades don't matter."" If you miss a class or show up a fraction of a second late, he'll passive aggressively call you out on it and make you feel terrible.",0
"Very hard to earn good grades even if you really work on it. Some of her class rules suck!If you don't have a job and can spend tremendous amount of time for the course, you'll probably learn a lot. But if you are working and taking other classes, it can get tough. Very very had to earn an A. Most ppl got C I thnk. I'd look for better options!!",1
"Raul is a great instructor. He is involved in the class and encourages you to do better, and corrects your form if needed. He taught us how to use the weight lifting machines, as well as different free-weight lifting techniques and core exercises. I would recommend taking a class with Raul!",1
HE IS AWESOME & SO HELPFUL I TOOK HIS 101 CLASS & EVENTUALLY SIGNED UP FOR HIS 102 . FUNNY KEEPS THE CLASS LAUGHING.,1
"The best Prof in the world. What a guy, what a ma dude! Teaches wonderfully and his course is mathematically great. Let's you build your own matching model. Best Prof!",1
"I was looking for a math professor based on the reviews on this website and fortunately I found his class available. I took his and wouldn't feel regret. His lectures are easy to understand, and you always have review for the exams. As long as you study well the review, you will do good with the exams.",1
Amazing! All I can say. Made me realize why I want to be a nurse. Love her,1
Easy and amazing Professor. He reviews stuffs at the beginning of the class so you won't get lost. Very nice when you go to his office hour (though I just did once). He will explain some difficult stuffs that he didn't mention in class if you are willing to learn. Homework questions are not mandatory but they will help you understand materials.,1
"I knew from my first day of attending his class it was going to be my favorite class in the semester, or maybe even my whole time being at Suffolk. He's super funny, he explains the material so well, and there is never a dull moment in class. This was my last semester at Suffolk, and i'm glad i got to take Professor Monahan's class before i left.",1
"awful directions, expects everyone to care about art even when none of us are art majors and that we should just leave because we were wasting his time, told me today that he may have thrown my paper away because there is another kid in the class with the same last name and that made it confusing. 70% of grade is in the final week.",0
I took Prof. Venus after being out of school for several years in a month long summer class. He helped advise me on questions i had when my advisor was not available. He sometimes went off track but usually found a way to skate back towards discussion. He may be more difficult if you have trouble understanding older literature. Participation HELPS!,1
"Keeps class fun, only a few tests, but does a TON of practice and review beforehand. You'll be well prepared. no unnecessary memorization.",1
"Didn't know this guys name until I looked it up. Very disorganized class. He talks the entire class, mostly about nonsense, then tells you to take a pop quiz. His talking makes you doze off and not pay attention to anything. His quizzes will feature questions on things he quickly covered that you wouldn't remember if he didn't tell you to know it.",0
"I have had three Spanish instructors, and she is the best one yet. Being a natural speaker of the language adds a dimension that assists in learning. We learn not just the language, but the culture as well. She will do whatever is needed to help you learn, not just for the grade, but to actually retain and use it.",1
You'll be graded on five tests!  I had two bad tests and three good ones and I never I reapeat NEVER missed a class and he FAILED me!  DO NOT TAKE HIM! If you want to move on take another professor.  He shouldn't be a teacher.,1
"If you need a gov credit, take him. You'll get a great grade if you do what little things he asks and his lectures aren't mandatory, but they will definitely benefit you if you go. Also, here are no exams, he is very approachable, and his lectures are a lot more interesting that i anticipated. I highly recommend! Take him and get a good grade.",1
"Liked that he made us do different things besides always lecture. Some discussions but it's about history and one about current events (guns). Overall, just do the work and you pass.",1
"She is a wonderful professor! She keeps it interesting and as long as you pay attention and complete the assignment according to her instructions, you will get an A. Some people complain about her classes being hard, but they're not if you just do the work! She's tough on attendance and will get you if you dont follow directions!",1
WOW! Fred is an amazing teacher. He shows you new ways to use your mind to become better readers and thinkers. He used Humor to keep the class fun. And Man is he funny! Loves Cigars and Soda. He just really chanllanges you and wants you to become succesful in college and in life. What a GREAT teacher!,1
Awesome! Easy! All his tests are half take home essay questions and half in class multiple choice. (Even the midterm and final) He lets you use your notes. The questions are exaclty from your notes. There is no excuses you can get an A easily! TAKE HIM! He made my life so much easier for me this quarter! He is funny too. Taking him again winter,1
"Love her, love her, love her.",1
"Mrs. Ebron is a very competent professor, very helpful. She will give evryone a chance to do better. Very personable. I dd miss one single class with her, that is to say how interesting her classes were. Will definetely recommend her.",1
"It's an easy A. He's very loud and enthusiastic about the subject and obviously very knowledgeable. The quizzes are a little ridiculous, but the only part of the course where I didn't always get full credit. For everything written, just hit the word count and you're fine. Final project was annoying, but not hard.",1
"great guy! i was not looking forward to this class, but i learned a ton. very easy to follow, in the end, not the best grader",1
I did not find this class helpful.  Most of the information we learned came right from a textbook.  We learned this material in health and wellness but have to take it for majors.,0
"She rushes through lectures and doesn't really explain that well. She's still a decent professor and you can visit her office hours if you need help. You need to work hard for your grade and her exams aren't that simple. Do the homework, attend class, and pay attention!",1
"Amazing professor, he is very cut and straight to the point about what you need to learn. Very happy that I decided to take this course.",1
I loved this class! Very interesting.He's a great Professor in Philosophy. He was clear and concise in his lectures. I would definitely take another class taught by him.,1
Very intelligent and kind woman. Goes out of her way to make sure you understand the course material and is extremely helpful. She makes everything relatable by using examples that the class understands. Energetic and makes jokes! I actually really look up to her as a person! Highly recommended class and easy if you study and go to class.,1
"This is the best teacher at NOVA. She relates to the students and knows what she is talking about. I would recommend if you have to take this class to take hers. You have to do speeches, but they are easy. If you fail this class than you should just drop out of school. Another good thing is she is pretty hot so you will want to go to every class.",1
"EXCELLENT professor! I went into this as my first Greek class and I fell in love with it! Im considering taking more Greek classes I found it super interesting. Prof was a sweetheart, super easy to talk to. Clearly LOVES Greek History, he prepares you well for the exam. He has enthusiasm. Text was cheap and used constantly. Excellent Professor!",1
Very enthusiastic about the subject! 3 tests. He gives you the test to study a week in advance. No final so once you take tests you can forget the info. 2 part tests: define terms & essay. Just attend class and you will get an A!,1
"Dr. McLaughlin is a great professor! His lectures are interesting, although a little long (he will elaborate on a single topic for a full hour on some days). He takes attendance and participation VERY seriously, and it does affect your grade in the class. Also, there's about 1 assignment per week, but they're all pretty simple. Would recommend! :)",1
Dr. Meche is an great professor and a great guy. His work is hard but he is trying to teach you to find your own mistakes and correct then . If you listen to him you will pass and do what he says,1
"Brian McNamara is a fair and reasonable professor in Computer Science.  Although the class I took with him was online, I found him to be available whenever I had questions.",1
"I took Jeff's A&P hybrid course. I think he's a pretty good instructor. Always took the time to answer any questions you might have, even if it's off subject. The only issue I had was that he is late to class everyweek, but only 5 or 10 minutes. I would recommend taking his calss.",1
"She a very nice teacher. Very clear and understandable. She will help you if you don't understand, or if you have an issue that conflicts with class.",1
"Mr Phelps is probably one of the worst professors I've had.  Leave it to Phelps to start working on Test 4 material before you even take Test 3 (yeah, he does that).  If you ask him for help or clarification he says ""Ask someone else."" He has the assumption that everyone on earth loves art as much as he does. Beware of Mr Phelps",0
Thank god he curves the exams! Accounting is not an easy subject but he made it easier to understand. Lectures give lots of examples and he works them out step by step. Very monotone voice. Tries to make the class engaging but only makes things awkward. Wiley plus is tedious but not hard. He knows his stuff. textbook is your friend.,1
Buddy doesn't explain anything. He literally sends YouTube videos as lectures and he gets mad when you ask him something. His expectations aren't clear for work.,0
Jill is an amazing teacher. She is fun and really encourages students. She is always available for help and lectures are clear and informative. Best teacher in the program!!!,1
Derek is an extremely personable professor. He also graduated from UE so he consistently maintains a difficulty level on par with other courses. He is also very helpful and will do his best to answer any questions you have.,1
"Bob Waxler is an inspiration. He is so deeply passionate about his content. Take his class, it changed my outlook on literature and life.",1
"Spotty English, mandatory iclicker participation, essay, group project. Midterm consists of short answer and multiple choice. Same with final ",0
He was great,1
"Great personality - She reminds me of Elaine from Seinfeld. She keeps class entertaining but her tests are IMPOSSIBLE! No such thing as a straigh forward question, you will 2nd guess yourself every time. She crams in material to meet her own deadlines.",1
I took Dr. Liszka in my undergrad. I thought she was great!! I wished I would have taken more classes with her. Her class isnt easy but it is very entertaining and informative. She also was so funny in lectures. I say go for it! Youll definitely learn something about Egypt.,1
Sister Kirkham is by far one of my favorite professors i've ever had! She is always willing to help you in the course and she brings the spirit to class every time! She teaches through personal experience and tries to make the work less difficult. I learned so much from her course and from her that It changed my outlook on life completely!,1
"He sincerely cares about his students and their learning. Doing all he can to help them. He provided examples of all materials presented and was very interesting to listen to. He told us what he expected and there was no tricks on the test. If you study hard, you'll do fine. Lee is a very interesting professor and I have recommended him to others.",1
"Enjoyed his class material, thought he was very niceelligent. Make sure to do the weekly study guide ?s & consider recording lectures bc lots of material. Always avail @ his office hours 2 answer ?. My only critic: his time management & organizational skills, lectures and lab would start late and run over because he lacks managing these areas.",1
"Deb is one of the best profs! I bet if you follow her advice you will successfully publish your research papers. I wish I took the course earlier. I didn't get my grade yet but I am thankful for the opportunity to learn from Dr Fells. The assessments r structured well to achieve learning goals, the lectures well prepared, active and participatory",1
"Hard work, but worth it.  I learned so much!",1
"I took him for a class that was actually about religion and science. He is the most biased professor I've ever had. He talks nonsense, trying to make intelligent, well spoken students feel like idiots. There's no point in reasoning with this gorilla.",0
"One of the most inconsistent professors when it comes to grading. He grades papers primarily off of quantity over quality, so if you aren't good at writing fluff, he is not the professor for you. He does not have a clear grading criteria and will often base your grade on your performance in class. If you care about your GPA, I would not recommend.",0
"Explained terms very well, willing to explain things over and over again to students, regardless how many times has said he it. However you have to be willing to study outside of class. You should read the textbook. If you study using notes from class and the textbooks, there is no reason you should not pass his class.",1
Her exams are a mess. Some questions I swear is from her nursing practitioner background and nothing to do with the course. Brags about herself,0
"Chilliest teacher at EMU. Will work with you on Papers, homework, and the tests until you get it. Will also work with you on your grade. Heavy accent, hard to understand at times, but this class is way easy, and worth it.",1
"WORST TEACHER EVER! Seriously. I could not understand a word he was saying. He told us to study one thing, then didn't put it on tests. He even put some stuff on the tests that he didn't go over! In fact, he told us not to study one thing, and then put it on the test! I do not recommend this teacher to ANYONE! Stay far away from this teacher.",0
Great professor. Tough grader but fair. Everything is in syllabus.,1
"Awesome teacher, super involved and knows what she's doing.",1
"she is literally the worst. rude to students, not understanding of why some stuff cannot be turned in on time, homework and what is due is usually very unclear, classes are boring and she reteaches things we learned in high school- i hated showing up and it ruined my entire day. save yourself",0
Mrs. Padgett is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is EXTREMELY scatterbrained therefore can never stay on topic. She claims to go by the syllabus but never does. She also picks favorites which get graded differently than the rest. Her grading varies by student or what mood she is in.  She is very unprofessional and inappropriate.,0
Ok if you don't come to class your double done he is super harsh and can come off as an a hole but once you get what he wants his class is attainable he grades very harsh and is BIG on correct MLA and citation,0
"Exams are strictly based on memorization of useless facts from his book such as ""horses have very high alcohol dehydrogenase."" The class was no help for the MCAT. To this day, I don't know the point of Glucokinase. He is very bad at explaining material in lectures.",0
"DO NOT TAKE IF YOU ARE NOT POLI SCI MAJOR, you will waste so much of your time. This is an incredibly hard class and would not be worth it if its for Gen Ed. You have a 3 page paper due every week, lots of reading, and hard tests. Lectures are hard to follow, and he rarely gives feedback to you and if he does, its months later.",0
Mr. Cortez knows what hes talking about but he doesnt talk down to you. Makes topics interesting and encourages  discussion.,1
she is funny n smart n a sweetie,1
No Comments,1
If you expect the professor to hand everything to you maybe this is not the right course. If you are a keener you will get your A/A+. His exam questions are straight out of his notes and there are no tricky questions. Very very straight forward. Do your flashcards and you will ace this course. Highly recommend him!,1
Awesome professor. Brings his experience into the classroom. Easy grader. I took him for 2 CCJS classes. Awesome lectures. Answers all questions with honesty and real life. Understanding. Overall - the best professor I have had at UMUC,1
"Rombo is an easy teacher to have a class with. The class does have some more assignments than usual but nothing too hard to comprehend and she offers help. Her accent is NOT BAD AT ALL. People made it seem like a heavy and thick accent, maybe if you have never been exposed to someone from an African country it would throw you off guard.",1
"I have taken Berger-Hill for two classes in one semester and I would take her a thousand times again. Because this is a online course, expect work due every week but her class is very easy, if you received a bad grade, you just didn't care. She give feedback very well and responds quick. TAKE HER! she's amazing!",1
The class consists  of  quizzes that you have unlimited attempts to complete and a few discussions.,1
"Professor Seymour is nothing short of a goofball. His sense of humor is 1 of a kind. His class was the easiest history class I've taken & I actually enjoyed it. Hist usually isn't my best subject, but he made it fun and easy to follow. He often goes off on a tangent about his personal life and treats his students more like friends. He's cool.",1
"great guy, if you wanna learn the real deal take tony bass. learn the material by taking notes and reviewing them time to time and you should get an A no problem",1
If you need anything he is there for you. He loves his job and it shows. He wants people to succeed. I would take him again. There is no assigned homework in the class. ,1
"If you want to learn the material well I recommend to take her. If you don't really care don't bother. Great professor and treats her students well! Not an easy class but it is a great challenge, recommend!",1
"Dr. Viriasova can be challenging but she wants her students to excel. The reading is daunting but she has taken steps to make the material more accessible, including visits to her office hours to discuss papers so everyone can improve. She's incredibly thoughtful and dedicated to her craft, and once you do the readings the course becomes very cool",1
Such an awesome teacher.  Really loves what he does and is passionate about it.  Fun class with lots of learning but not an easy A.  Have to go to classes and an assignment every week.  Essay papers as well.  If your offended easily with controversial topics or language then not a good choice.  Best class ever,1
"I have never disliked an English class so much, and Im an English major! Mike doesnt like his students and obviously has some insecurity issues because he uses his job to make himself feel better. He has no clear grading criteria, asks for 3 papers a week, gives pop quizzes, and is flat out unprofessional and rude in his feedback. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
"Dr. Anderson is one of the best professors I have taken at VSU. He is very understanding if you have any issues. He makes a point to get to know everyone on a personal level. Although the class material is difficult, he makes sure everyone has an understanding. Make sure you go to lab, it really helps your grade.",1
Professor Hafey is a great math professor. He is really helpful and won't move on until he knows that everyone is confident with the material. He is very supportive and explains everything clearly.,1
"If you enjoy self-learning then this is the class for you. For the online version of his class, all he did was give you links for youtube videos and said figure it out. He also doesn't give enough time on the exams but when you ask him for extra credit he doesn't offer it. Go with caution when taking this class, many breakdowns happened.",0
Attendance is only mandatory on Friday's and you only have to do 5 out of the 10 discussions (which take about 30 min of your day to do and not graded harshly). Dr. Amundson is super passionate about history and very easygoing. The 2 exams are easy if you go to the review the day before and the one big paper you have to do can be resubmitted.,1
"Mr. I is a great coach, he truly cares about the students. He teaches tools that will make you successful in life. He is very professional and loves his job. He makes sure each student is comfortable in their environment, to deliver their speech.",1
"Dr G has one of the best personalities in a teacher Ive ever experienced. He is very sweet and down to earth, he also provides cookies and coffee every class. However, he isnt the greatest at explaining the material and labs are usually very unclear. I feel like tests and quizzes have a lot of questions that we never touch on.",1
"I loved his class so much. However, be aware it is a lot of writing. If you struggle with writing essays he may not be for you. He did help a lot and provided a lot of materials to help you write better.",1
"She's a good professor, who really cares. I learned a lot in her class. She is very knowledgeable in the law field.  I found her to be reasonable and fair.  The workload is challenging. I would love to take another class with her.",1
"Professor Bamford is a fantastic professor here at QU. Caring, committed, and always willing to help her students, she is one of the best professors I have had at QU.",1
You dont learn anything about epidemiology and he makes you write 11 page papers weekly.,0
This guy is a total jerk....Really offensive and demeaning.,0
Best teacher I have ever had at Valencia College if you know what I mean,1
The weekly coursework consisted of readings and an exploratory discussion with responses. There is a group project in this class and a final paper. Gave easy As all semester and hit heavy on APA format for final paper.,1
"Chris is a really inspiring lecturer that'll change your life for the better. Learning about motivation is really important and interesting, even to a non-psychology student. The class is really easy if you do all the papers and attend the lectures (they're recorded too!). I would take Niemiec again in a heartbeat",1
Better than most of the high school teachers i had!,1

I took this class over the summer for my major (SLHS) and it was the best decision I've ever made. Professor Raney was hands down the best professor I've ever had in college. Her lectures are very clear and her quizzes and exams (midterm/final) are VERY straightforward. If you complete her practice worksheets you will be golden. TAKE THIS PROFESSOR,1
By far the worse and meaningless class so far. He spends 60% of time talking nonsense and inappropiate things not related to class. Then rushes 10 mins before class expecting us to know all the info before exam in next class. Expects us to read the chapters byt vaguely discusses them in class. Long study guide with short and long answers required.,0
"I took his class in Spring semester . Just want to share my opinion for who want to take this class. If English is your second language and you are not VERY GOOD at Enlgish, want to get A with ENG1302, DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS. I had D grade with his class EVEN I finished all the essays in class and I have to take this class again.",0
"This is the most failed class in the Education department here. Her tests are 100 questions and after the first test she will sit down and say ""now you see you can't study for my test you just have to know it."" I believe she said she was retiring this year though so good luck!",0
"Excellent teacher.  Not a breeze, but not too difficult if you put forth effort.  Great class.  Limited homework.",1
It's a passable class but don't bother buying the textbooks. Everything comes from her power points. Also she gives random quizzes to check attendance.,0
"This is a great class if you want to learn. She is funny and keeps the lectures interesting. Make sure you do the reading because she will call on you. Study for the tests and take good notes. Not a lot of homework, and the homework that is assigned is easy.",1
"I took this course as a post-bac student and I just don't recommend to take it over the summer, much less with him.  As others before me have said, yes he does have a DEEP accent.  Yes, his tests are hard.  Yes, he goes through his lectures WAY too fast (which is why you NEED the textbook).  He is not great at scanning the room for raised hands. ",0
"Great teacher and is very helpful.  Tests can be challenging, but if you want to learn the material he is the teacher to take.",1
"Course needed to advance in the business program sadly.Used an awful program called SAM2007.You do tests,quizes and homework using this program.Most people know basic ms word already and don't need to know the intricates of it,and excel and access,which 2 arent needed in future.Teacher note-nice, but test closed early and she denied her mistake >_>",1
By far the best professor I have ever had!,1
she is the sweetest! if you need psych 1 Dr. Guimberteau is the one ya'll.,1
He is approachable.,0
Most amazing prof ever. Notes on web are helpful and lectures are done well.,1
"Spanish is difficult if you've never taken it before. I've taken spanish for a long time, but this professor is very willing to help you during her office hours and even lets you make up missed work (unless its a habit) She gave up on the online part of the class because it was too hard. Shes a great teacher and is hysterical! TAKE HER!",1
"I loved her. The content is not particularly difficult to grasp, although there is a lot of it. Keep up with your readings and you'll be fine, trust me. She's a great person overall, though. Very kind-hearted. I look forward to taking more classes with Professor Douglas!",1
"His class, tests, and quizzes are the definition of that one meme. Sally has four apples and gives one away.. calculate the mass of the sun.. like bruh Alot of college is self teaching/learning. But this class takes it to the next level. He lectures off slides with no additional context of HW problems. Very few examples and guidance given. avoid",0
"The tests DO NOT match the reviews. If you are taking this class as a requirement and know most of the material already, it's straightforward (tests/hw only). He doesn't ""teach"". He works out a problem of every kind in the chapter (whether you need it on the test or not-overload of info) . He does this quickly & with no patience for questions.",0
Dr. Wike is a great Professor.,1
"dont know what these people are talking about. Hard professor, if you are not those one or two students who answer every question do not take",0
"She is helpful if you ask questions! She gives a huge group project that is easy and is worth a lot of points. Her tests are kind of hard, but if you pay attention, take notes, and take time to study, you'll get an a. She gives you a study guide of what the test is going to be on, so you know exactly whats on it. Take her if you want an A",1
"When I took this class I found it to be pretty boring. However, I work in an accounting firm now and I am SO grateful for the knowledge that Mr. Meixsell imparted on to me. I am an excel wiz. I blow my co-workers minds with easy Microsoft short cuts everyday. Stick with the class. Yes computer stuff can be a drag, but it IS VERY IMPORTANT.",1
"Great teacher.  Really clear expectations, gives you evaluation sheets before every speech so you know exactly what you need to do.  Will always talk to you when you go into her office hours, too.  Really helpful and makes it a fun class.  Highly recommended!",1
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points*. Thanks Wendy! But srly, do not take her!!!",0
"Boyer is the man in Math114, you only have to show up the first and last day and everything is online. no tests just homework due twice a week. Super easy!",1
"Gerritsen is one of my favorite professors at SUNY Cortland. He is willing to do whatever it takes to make the material understandable, and will put in countless extra time if it's not. I recommend taking a class with Gerritsen, if not for the credits, then just to get to know him, hear his stories, and learn a thing or two about the real world.",1
Excellent professor who cares and clearly understand the material. His class was by far my favorite freshman year.,1
She is a great person and understands this class is a joke. Super sweet with her students and tries to be as helpful as possible. Quizzes are super easy and so is her grading scale.  ,1
"Dr. Waxler is a great professor. His passion for literature in a book, not Ipad, is inspirational. His class is not only good for one's academic development, but also for one's soul.",1
"Janey's class is super hard, but she teaches it well and does a pretty good job of helping you understand some of the more confusing material. Her late work policy is very relaxed, but it definitely helps to do the work ahead of time in her class. Otherwise, she's super nice and has a good sense of humor and knows the material extremely well.",1
He is one of the best professors. He will help you learn and is very easy going.,1
"I've never had a professor who cared about attendance as much as Prof. Shimizu (don't call her Celine) does, seemed like it was the only comment she'd ever make. (I wanted the online class for a reason but w/e).  Some readings were interesting but others seemed unnecessary.  Everyone was confused from what she wanted from us.",1
"Overall, he is a man that knows his stuff. His work and critiscm is by far some of the best you can get on that campus. However, his grading and expectations is sometimes over the top and ridiculous. He holds everyone at a professional expectation which is good and bad. He has no censor and says whatever he wants. Overall 3 stars.",0
"hard to know what to expect. quizzes are super similar to test, problems hardly change. hw is not required and useless. can treat you like an idiot frequently when asking a question, in lecture or msg. Lots of bonus on tests. Unclear class / lesson structure. teaches material well though. stickler with partial credit. WRITE YOUR THT PRCSS.",1
"she does not teach much on grammar, but she teach you a lot on your oral and let you practice on each class. go to her class if you would like to practice your oral, or avoid her if you want to learn more about grammar. moreover, her exam is more about listening in grammar test, but oral exam is easy",0
"I took one of her classes online for PED 116. I think she's really nice and provides good feedback. You will read a lot (just as much as you would in any other class), not much home work (12 week online class, you'll have one discussion board and usually one online quiz but if you read the slides, it's rather easy). Easy two projects.",1
No Comments,1
"Swartz is very arrogant. Terrible professor, my friend had Dr. Liddell and said she was a better teacher. Avoid at all costs",0
The class is extremely helpful it allowers dancers to learn the beginning steps/basic. Only negative is the classes are a little slow at times and the songs we listen/dance to arent really Latin songs they are mostly English old pop songs.,1
"She is a very good professor because she cares for her students and loves to give A's! If you focus and do the reading in the text book consistently you will get a good grade. The notes are all on the tests, but you have to also read to get to know the topic better. Believe me the tests are hard but she does give points back!",1
"Definitely one of the best math professors Ive ever had. She answers emails and proactive throughout the semester. Everything is through mymathlab, but her setup makes it easier to understand each chapter. Take her if you can!",1
"She's by far the best instructor I've ever had. She gives a very clear precise outline for ur notes, provides xtra credit assignments & is constantly concerned with ur engagement & understanding. She won't GIVE u a grade, but she'll give u everything u possibly need to earn it. Textbook required. Fun Labs. Keep up& pay attention you'll do just fine",1
"Very good prof! He's passionate about social problems and is so informative. He's very funny and throws up peace signs a lot while saying ""know your facts"" LOL facts are a big deal in the class. He's a memorable guy, you won't regret taking him!",1
The average on this professors tests in 50%. His tests take 5 to 6 hours to take on average. He is super unhelpful and does not teach what he puts on the test.,0
"Very nice, caring and funny. Shes easy going, chill, and very open minded to any questions you have. Youll definitely understand the homework easily if you just pay attention in class. Its College after all. She does give out a lot of homework but the good thing is, she gives you enough time to work on it before its due. Would take her again!",1
"You can easily achieve an A for Dr. Solano's operations management if you're willing to work for it.  Spend the required time to complete every homework assignment, take the practice chapter tests before the exam and you will have no problem passing!",1
She is an amazing teacher and woman. Extremely interesting class,1
"Yue laoshi was excellent, showing a great wealth of knowledge way beyond what was expected. She know the entire history and origin of every single character and had great background and cultural information for many of the topics covered. She was also very aware of the difficulties in learning a new language and was very patient and understanding.",1
Dr. Keeling is an awesome professor and very knowledgeable. He is very passionate about equality and getting to know his students. He is very understanding and wants his students to succeed. He will move deadlines if we are overwhelmed with work and is always there to talk if you are confused or have a problem. You do have to work for a good grade.,1
"Absolutely LOVED Dr. Perkins, the class was pretty much online except for test days. He would pre record lectures which were in depth and broke it down to make sure you understood it. If you pay attention to the videos and do practice problems you should be fine. Quizzes and final (optional) were open note .",1
"Dr. Lim is a terrible teacher and horrible lecturer BUT, and hear me out on this one, he lets a lot of things slide, especially when he forgets what he was supposed give you (happens a lot). I would reccomend this class if you are good with computers and don't mind learning material yourself...",0
awesome class. so fun and creative. linda is awesome. if any problems just go talk to her!,1
"TURB 102 is probably my favorite class that I've taken with Yonn. His lectures were interesting, and I really liked the subjects we covered. There were four tests and two papers. The tests were easy if you studied and came to class, but I'll admit that the papers were kind of tough. In all though, I'd recommend the class because it's fun!",1
"Recommend GOING to class.  I didn't miss any.  All test questions come straight from lecture.  He tells you straight up, come to class, not to miss  and DONT text in his class.  common sense.  He uses really good examples and is a great teacher.  His test aren't that hard if you pay attention and take notes.  Favorite class.",1
She is very knowlegeable and helpful.,1
hes why i want to be a professor.,1
Super boring classes but they always ended early. Three super easy essays and an extra credit essay. Hes not very nice but an easy grader,0
This class is insanely hard! I wish I could go back in time and never sign up for this class. While his lectures are really interesting the amount of stress I got from his tests was overwhelming. If you are taking four or five classes I wouldn't recommend this at all.,1
he is one of these liberal types who is a throw back to the 60's. all of the stuff he talks about doesn't even make sense today. he needs to bring the course up to the 2000's. always acts like mr nice guy and you get creamed on one of his tests. also a real brown-noser around campus. acts like Mr. Bentley all the time. avoid at all costs.,0
"There weren't any tests so with only 3 essays your grade definitely depends on writing ability, but he doesn't grade too hard and definitely rewards what you do right, plus there's an opportunity to revise one of the essays for extra points. Show up to class on time and go to office hours when you need help and this class should be fine.",1
"I took Ms. Barclift for three classes during my four years at JSU. She's always very helpful and the classes were pretty easy. You learn a lot of cool information dealing with her experiences in social work. She's very open to talk to and although she comes off as intimidating, she's very sweet.",1
LOVE THIS TEACHER!  He the BEST!,1
"he's very good professor, easy class",1
"Awesome teacher. If your someone that is serious about your education and actually want to learn something, take Professor Tersteegen. If you don't want to show up to class, then why are you even going to school? Students that will not like her are lazy, unmotivated,and disrespectful. Show her respect and it will be reciprocated. Just like in life.",1
"Professor Vavova made me interested in philosophy. She's one of the smartest people I've ever met, and she really values her students. As a philosopher, a big part of her job is to take things that aren't stated clearly and extract meaning from them. That skill comes in wonderfully when she's helping us explain our complex ideas.",1
"Stoner is very long winded and hard to follow. A third of his tests are quizzes, the other on the lectures, and you have to write a paragraph about a definition. Only take if required, I'm struggling to even get a B. Very knowledgable though and very kind. Gives quizzes every day on chapters and chapters  of reading so you have to come. ",0
"Dr. Galileo was VERY monotone, and I was not interested or engaged. He reads off his powerpoint slides, and expects you to read the book to learn. He is not helpful, and does not answer emails . People say its an easy A (if you actually read the book and practice test), but I 100% preferred BISC401 which other people have said is harder. ",0
"I don't recommend at all. U will not know about nothing, unless you struggle by your self.",0
"She acts nice on the outside, but in her heart it has a duty to shatter every students' dream. Every week, she post practice quiz online and hands the real deal when we meet and all the questions doesn't make any sense. For the exams, they are roughly 70 questions and she expect us to know this. She doesn't even help her students at all.",0
"Took a blended class of hers. Classes are easy but this one is quite a bit of work. She takes a couple months to grade assignments but is understanding and nice about a lot of things. Oh and never worry about being late because normally she is 10-30mins late usually each class. Dont worry about being absent either, she doesnt really care.",1
This man is a living legend. Take him if you can and you will get an easy A.,1
"First semester at Mjc, let me tell you, I hate waking up early for school but he made me excited for class. I would look forward to his funny stories. I promise you having him as a professor is something you won't regret. His tests are super simple he literally explains to you the material. All you have to do is listen & you're good b",1
"I would make sure that if I ever have the chance to take another class with him I will. He was extremely helpful, very knowledgable, and passionate. DEFINETELY choose his professor... best one at WCC I have taken yet!",1
"Easy class. You could literally show up at the end of class and he'll count you present. He really works with you, especially if you show that you want to pass. There are lots of group activities, essays, and extra credit. The book is used sometimes to keep up with chapters, but he will get side tracked alot. Other than that, this class was easy :)",1
"If you do your assignments on time, and read the chapters. You will do fine, she is an easy grader. She knows her stuff well! Don't wait till last minute to ask her about an assignment before it's time for the assignment to be graded. I will say she is late grader. But I would take her again !",1
"Take physics 1 with Dr. Cooney if you can!!!! As a person who generally has trouble understanding physics, he made it much easier. The textbook isn't mandatory but is very helpful. Careful with the lab though; my TA was incompetent, incoherent, and didn't communicate with the professor at all. Tests are easy if you go to class and do the homework",1
This teacher was the worst professor I have ever had.  She belittles and talks down to students on a regular basis.  She also never teaches until the end of class and refuses to help students  when asked for help.  People like her should retire before they stop caring about their students as she does.,0
"Wonderful professor. Extremely helpful and clear when talking. He makes a lot of great jokes, which makes class fun. Would take another course taught by him in a second.",1
Just go to the lecture and you'll be fine. Don't need to take notes. Every assignment is online and you have to go to two concerts within the semester. He's super chill and understanding about absences if you email him a good reason he won't count it towards you. Attendance is mandatory of your grade will slip.,1
"She was one of my favorite professors. She loves to get off topic, but she always makes sure the class knows exactly when everything is due. She goes through the material pretty fast, but if you have already taken at least a year of Spanish, you should be fine.",1
"Very interesting, sweet, helpful and ecouraging. I fell in love with this subject after taking this class. It changed the way that I think about disability. If you read and attend class you will do well.",1
"Professor Stan is a good professor,  but his exams are based off of the Readings. He will not talk a lot in class on what will be on the test, due to the independent readings he will assign you. Be aware that he is a busy guy, but if you have his contact, he is more than welcome to answer your call and set up a meeting with you.",1
"Took him for ITCC1375+1376. There are chapter exams each day but only worth 10% of the final grade. Hands on skills final, and online final are important. Both finals he prepares the students for. You have to try to fail this class. Both classes have the same 8 week layout. Easy B/C on low effort. Course codes change sometimes because of Cisco.",1
Great professor. Very intelligent and easy to understand. The best advice is to READ THE BOOK!! All of her tests come straight out of the book and not from lecture. Tests are very difficult but the class is fun overall.,1
"He is a very nice man, will help you if you seek it. However, if chemistry is not your strong suit, take a different professor. He does not provide powerpoints, he just does a bunch of problems on the board and messes up a lot and confuses things.",0
"I love her,she is understanding and easy to talk to.The only problem is she gives long readings.",1
"She is the sweetest professor I have ever seen. Easy A. Just read the materials she hands over and participate. Try not to skip the classes because she delivers amazing lectures. She is super accessible and replies back real quick. If you have any problem, just discuss with her and you will be fine.",1
"she aight, likes astronomy",1
"Don is hilarious! But he has very high expectations that are hard to meet. He is very fond of group work, even during a lock-down (google meets) but his presentations are really hard to ace as he contradicts himself in his expectations. His test are quit difficult too. Would recommend buying the text because his lectures do not cover everything.",1
"I love Dr. Childs, especially for logic.  She makes it easy to understand.",1
"This course is definitely useful for someone who knows how to code. If you are not good at programming or you just know how to print out ""Hello world"" you should skip taking this course. But if you are a good programmer or java developer, fasten your seatbelt, you gonna have so much fun in the first part. The second part is paper discussion.",1
I took Allen for a race/diversity gen ed & thought he was great! As long as you show up to class you will do fine in his class. There is a lot of reading but I got A's on the exams with only skimming the books or just listening to his lectures. The class is very conversational but he doesn't force anyone to speak up. There's not a lot of homework.,1
He is a good professor who would record his own lecture and post after the class. The exams are always covered in the lectures. So be prepared for reviewing the videos before the exam.,1
Great professor who gives great feedback on all your work. Very relatable to her students and pushes you to do your best work.,1
"Before I signed up for Boydston I looked at the reviews, they were low but I kept an open mind that I had to work for my grades regardless who the professor was. But this professor designs everything so you can fail, she goes beyond measures to make sure her exams difficult. Either than that I see no effort from her in anything else. DON'T TAKE",0
He is really nice!,1
He was a great professor. He was almost always available by email. Also met with me when I started doing not so good. The class was filled with about 3 exams and 1 Final. But it was a great class totally reccomed.,1
"He is so interesting! BEWARE: He's switching up the old exams- do not just study them alone anymore- after 10 years, he's finally beginning to make a new exam. You can get a B or a B+ from studying the exams alone presently, where in past years you could have gotten an AA-. Read his slides. Bolded or things in red are crucial.",1
"This professor's expectations are high. If you want to learn a lot and be driven hard, take a class from her. This class, ENGL 308: Interpretation of Literature, was reading-intensive (two or three hours a night)and covered a wide range of interpretive theories. You'll get as much out of the class (and out of her as a lecturer) as you put in.",1
Good class,1
"I took this class online so I don't know what she's like in person, but sometimes dealing with her via e-mail was a headache. The tests were ridiculously hard and not based on the quizzes. The only saving grace was there was plenty of extra credit available and the discussion questions were easy to do and worth a lot, too.",1
Worst professor i have EVERRRR had . She does not help you whatsoever. Expects you to know every single thing. On blackboard her power points have atleast 105 slides. EXTREMELY tough grader. Takes of points for the smallest things such as adding a 0 or removing one. Test are weighed ridiculously high. do yourself a favor DONT TAKE HER AT ALLLLLL.,0
Great professor,1
"Good professor. You will want to shoot yourself though if you're not into poetry and creative writing, as this is what the literature class evolved into.",1
"She's really passionate about the subject. It made the 8:30 class bearable. It also helped that I enjoy it, too. I would (and am planning on) taking her again.",1
"Great professor!!!! I had a lot of fun in his class. Be prepared to think, not absorb info. He expects a lot in your witting and expects you to be vocal and participate in class, however, he's a great lecturer. He is always around to help you out and genuinely cares about his students.",1
"He started off the year seeming like a nice guy.. He changed as the year went on, Hes pretty harsh I learned this the hard way. He tries to push his views on you (politics, vegetarianism, etc). I think he chooses favoritism as a way to grade rather than what work or effort you put in.",0
Very good teacher! classes very laid back but useful.  Defiantly take his class,1
"Arguably the best professor at Western State.  He is very clear, and it is almost impossible to go through his class without ending up understanding the law.",1
Lectures seem are long but once the class gets involved time seems to fly by. Prof. Aragona is a great professor. I walk away from the class everyday learning something new every day.,1
"She is horrible. 90% of the classes are spent in unrelated discussions. She waits until the last minute of class to tell us important info, so we end up staying late. She tells you to learn about how to write your paper by reading about it. She is extremely difficult about grammar. She marks off for every tiny thing she can find wrong.",0
"Paul is SUPER! Really understands the busy work schedules of his students and allows for flexibility. Involves everyone in the learning, keeps class fun and informative.  I'd do the whole program with him if  I could.",1
I cnt believe anyone could say Cogan is horrible hes an extremely easy grader and halrious take himmm!!,1
"This was by far one of my favorite classes at UofM. The topics discussed will quite literally change your perspective and how you see the world. The papers were slightly challenging but if you go to office hours and keep up with the reading it is fine. Discussion for this class is also actually very helpful. Overall, awesome class!!",1
she is a very good professor.,1
"Participation is important to her and will ask you to participate directly. She is enthusiastic about the subject and is very critical of you if you do not do your work. In this manner I think she is caring, she gives at least 2 short essays per week, final is on book of choice. Musts, use the writing center, check your grammar, submit on time.",1
"At first I didnt really like Mr. Miller, but over the course of the semester his class grew on me. He gives study guides and practice tests for the midterm and final which is pretty rare as Spanish teachers go. Very open to questions in and outside of class. I highly recommend his class!",1
Boring boring boring Idk if it's because this was online but I was suffering I have ADD so having to sit for 4 hours in her class where she doesn't show power points or anything really visual It's hard to stay focused. She's great for some people but she wasn't it for me It was hard to retain info.,1
"He is the worst professor I've had in my whole college experience. He expects you to go out of your way to see art pieces, know the proper way to critique it, and makes you write so many papers that are pointless and a waste of time. His grading is so hard, it's almost impossible to get an A anything. If you get him as a professor, GOOD LUCK!",0
"Great teacher -  there was a ton of work to be done in a short time, but Greta made the tough workload manageable. I'm so grateful how she helped me dramatically with this course on a 1 to 1 basis.  She was probably the best professor as far as communication and returning e-mails quickly that I have ever had",1
"By far the best prof I have run into in my opinion! Easy grader and is very open to giving feedback and help! She has been a sweetheart from day one, and the lectures might get boring but they are 100% straightforward! She can also help you in advising for an Anthropology major and is great at that too! Overall a wonderful prof and person!",1
"Very easy class!!! Only 2 credits...A lot of little writing assignments, (10 total)...10 class notes, reflective paper, and 5 discussion boards. Easy, but very time consuming",1
"I loved the readings for this class and the paper assignments had a nice amount of freedom, often allowing students to choose between multiple readings. Feedback on papers was always extremely helpful and on point. Grading felt fair. Reading was manageable to light. Class discussions sadly got stale rather quickly and I wish there was more variety.",1
Best prof! Very caring and interactive. Really wants you to do well. You must go to class but it is worth it.,1
"He makes sure you know your material, but sometimes he is discouraging. I think his goal is to be the next Dr. Miller. He has an ego problem, and wants things his way or no way, Especially when it comes to senior seminar. His way or your grade will suffer",1
Class has no structure. He comes in with a vague idea of what he wants to teach and he goes all over the place when he starts teaching. Writing on board is all over the place and it's difficult to understand and follow. Has a lot of proofs that he explains once and himself didn't know what was going to be on the exam. Expects us to upper div math.,0
"I loved his class! He is a great professor and really knows his stuff! I learned so much in his class, especially grammar, which he is huge on! He gives a lot of assignments but they are all designed to help you learn the material. There are also tons of extra credit opportunities.",1
"He was a great Prof, I learned alot and took it with me and use alot of his stuff everyday. I think it was alot of work but if u are serious about ur major then this is the guy to take,, he made class fun and things interesting, had him for intro to counceling.. two thumbs up!",1
Dr. Walling is a great professor and a good man as a person. I got very sick last spring and he worked with me and gave me enough time to catch up. He was very encouraging and caring for my situation and made sure I do not drop the class. There is room for extra credit. You still need to work hard. I am having him again this fall for ANTH 112.,1
"Pretty easy, despite the other comments. Yea, he reads from the notes, but that means you'll know what's going to be taught and what's on the test. Don't feel like going to class today? Luckily, you'll still have the notes. He's also really good if you go to his office hours or ask questions in class.",1
easy class.. i had taken spanish before so it was that much easier.. but her tests are straight from the workbook and she is understanding about absences,1
Mrs. DePinto is a true gem. She is truly a great teacher I have learned a lot from her this semester. I am so glad to have taken her class. She expects hard work from her students.,1
"He records his lecture so attendance is not mandatory. Overall, I thought the class was very easy. Exams are multiple choice. Make sure you study all your notes and memorize them. Even though I thought the class was easy, I did not do extremely well on all the exams so make sure to do the extra credit which will bump up your grade say from B+ to A-",1
"I loved taking Dr. Fischer's class. His lectures are very dense and it can get a little boring, but as long as you do the readings and go to discussion it'll be fine. His midterms and final were a bit tricky because they're all free response. You really need to understand the material and expand upon it with your own objections and/or agreements.",1
"at first I really wasn't interested in this class but this instructor made the class interesting, she's very thorough, gave extra credit, and prepares you for advanced nursing jobs, tests/quizzes are straight forward",1
"It really seemed like This professor just picked up this class in her spare time, but didn't really care about it. She showed up to our lab section once the whole semester, and for about half of the lectures she brought in guest speakers. The homework was inconsistent and seemed arbitrarily selected.",0
Would not recommend at ALL! HE DOES NOT DO POWERPOINTS HARD TO TAKE NOTES HOMEWORKS ARE VERY HARD AND HE  MAKES YOU WORK FOR EXTRA CREDIT AN WILL NOT  GIVE YOU LOTS OF POINTS!  I ALSO STUDIED  VERY HARD AND ENDED UP  FAILING CLASS,0
"I have taken multiple courses with Dr. Hanson during my years at CLU. I am very sad that he is retiring because I will miss his style of teaching. He is very old fashioned and relies on the basic system of lectures and essays/tests. However, his lectures are always very interesting and most of the pictures he uses from around the world are his own.",1
"My second class with Dr. Crockett in four semesters.  Might be the best instructor in the program, a consensus favorite among students.   Academically rigorous and inviting at the same time.  Perfect balance of lecture and open discussion.  Brilliant without arrogance.  Models counselor traits, and will go out of her way to help you succeed.",1
Best teacher I have ever had.,1
"Tabea cares so much about her student's success. There is a lot of group work involved in this class and if you don't participate, you will lose a ton of marks. She is a very well respected lady and anyone who takes a class with her is extremely lucky. She always dresses and acts professionally and is able to build one-on-one connections.",1
Meehan is a challenging professor. She expects you to know alot. Her tests are long but she does drop your lowest,1
"I absolutely loved Margarita's classes. I had no prior experience or knowledge of Spanish before taking her class. I definitely struggled with how fast paced it was, but that is how a lot of college classes are. She cares a lot about her students success and is just as happy as you are when you FINALLY get something you've been struggling with.",1
"I got an A minus in her class which is surprising to me. She is the most difficult teacher i ever had it was stressful throuhout the whole semester, she takes points off every thing. Don't get me wrong she is nice but she's just a harsh professor. I took this as a hybrid if you like a challenge take her class . This class took most of my time.",1
Best professor I've taken thus far. He is really motivated to teach and keeps things interesting in class. I would highly recommend taking Ams for O-chem.,1
"snoble a little bit,",0
"I enjoyed his teaching of AT. He made the topics easy to understand. At times, his lectures did get boring but he teaches life lessons which were helpful. Make sure you know basic math or you will struggle a little, but ask questions, he loves to help. There is a group project and group quizzes. Make sure you take notes! It's essential.",1
"classes are all lecture style but he's funny and kind of out of it. 2 midterms and one final, all multiple choice which sucks because each question on the final is basically 1 percent of your grade. homework is online and super easy. he does cold call every class though so be prepared to get called on",1
"One of the best professors I've had at LSU! Super passionate about his topic, which makes class enjoyable. He really loves what he does and is more than willing to talk to students outside of class. Do the readings and pay attention during the lectures.",1
"Brent is awesome! I was excited for the class, but it was even better than I thought. We talk about some controversial topics, and get to vote for what you want to talk about during the semester. We went on field trips to the theater too, which was a blast. The class isn't hard if you pay attention and attend.",1
"She's a good teacher in the sense she knows what she's teaching. Her biggest downside is that her exams are much harder than her classwork, homework, and practice exams.",0
She WILL help you become a better speaker and her assignments will challenge you to think outside the box. She doesn't critique too hard but you will have to work for that A. She will straight up tell you that she has no problem dropping and failing people who don't show up or do the work. One midterm and final.,1
"Great professor, would definitely take a class with her again!",1
"I loved this class, but the workload was far too much.",1
"Overly anal with grading labs. Cares mostly how organized everything is/how neat it looks. Always finds ways to mark you down,even when tons of effort is put in.Almost impossible for an A out of lab.Partial credit not given on much of tests.It brings your grade down quite a bit. Handwriting very sloppy & fast, makes it hard to get problems right",0
I really enjoyed his class.  Considering it was a Summer math class (17 weeks crammed into 6) I think he did a great job teaching us at such a fast pace.  He is very fair and is always able to help if you need it.  Just do what he says in the syllabus and you will do fine.  He is also very patient compared to some math instructors. He is very nice,1
Great Prof! Best Spanish teacher I have ever had. She is very clear about what will be on the tests which is very helpful. She will sprinkle in some jokes or life advice which makes it interesting! I would highly recommend her!,1
Good teacher take notes and read,1
Lots of material and it's not easy- but if you study a lot you'll do well. She really is responsive if you have questions- ask her after class or by email.,1
Professor Smith was great. She was easy to reach via email or office hours and was very understanding when it comes to grading. Do the work and you'll pass. ,1
Worst teacher ever. Somebody needs to fire her! She needs to mind her own business!,0
"He's really charismatic and he's not afraid to joke around. There are very few assignments (three short papers, a midterm, and a final) so you NEED to put time into studying for them. We analyzed all sides of Thomas Jefferson and I'm glad that Nelson didn't make TJ out to be a saint. Moral of the class was that TJ was a complex hypocrite.",1
her quizes are hard now and she marks paper hard too!! and she changes syllabus 3 times...not easy any more.,0
"She's a genuinely a good person. If you go in after class to ask for help you can tell she really wants to help you . However, this means nothing since she is not a native speaker; you literally cannot understand her. She is also unforgivably strict on assignments, and will not accept anything from you if you are even five minutes late to class",0
"Wonderful instructor! :D Also loved the schedule because she gave us ample time to get our work done. Furthermore, I love it when she checks our projets before we submit them <3 If you ever need to take this class, take Professor Nearing! :D",1
"He is very kind and funny, can tell he knows his physics. But most of class was spent discussing theories and I didnt really learn anything. The material in lectures and the material on homeworks and test and had no correlation, I only started to understand the class until after he graded it and gave feedback, which he takes forever to do .",0
"Tove was a wonderful professor. The class and material at times is difficult to understand because macroeconomics in itself is difficult- Tove made understanding it easier and made sure everyone was on the same page before continuing on in class. Definitely looked for people to participate, but an extremely fair grader.",1
HIghly recommended. I get bored listening to him talk but he has dry humor which keeps me interested. Only write 2 papers and revise them. No tests or quizzes. He is very helpful and wants you to succeed. I have enjoyed this class. He also has group discussion days to review your paper before its due.,1
He was a pretty good professor.  There were three exams and one ACS final.  He curves the final.  The homework is online and it isn't too bad.  There is also extra credit online.  I would recommend him.,1
"I think hes very entertaining, some what ""out there"" but i think hes fair and wants everyone to succeed.",1
"A great professor is very easy. I took her online very easy A. she gives lots of extra credit, but the work is a lot. she is one of the best online professors, but there was too much work but you can handle it. take her trust me you won't regret it.",1
"Dr. Lee is great teacher. Yes there are times you have to really listen to what he is saying as he does have a bit of an accent. If you ask a question about any, he will explain very carefully and draw pictures on the board. He wants students to understand. But you have to make that effort to ask the question.",1
This professor was very nice.,1
I absolutely loved this class. I took this for my literature course and found that it was more fun than work. Melissa is so friendly and passionate about detective fiction. There are 4 small books required for this course. We read some short essays and stories along with 2 novels. There are 2 discussions and one 6-8 question quiz each week.,1
"Professor Keith-Serafy is awesome!  She works hard to make sure that everyone understands the topics she goes over in class.  Her notes from lecture are what she uses to create her tests, so you always have a very clear picture of what you need to study.  She wants everyone to succeed and genuinely cares about her class and her students.  A+++",1
Do not take this class,0
Probably one of the most demanding and incredible professors. Also one that try to nurture the growth of your writing. Definitely one of top professors I recommend and respect!,1
"Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit.",0
"Professor is definitely a tough grader, but only because she cares for her students. She makes you work hard for your grade and will give you the opportunity for extra credit, her courses are always worth taking.",1
His classes are interesting and he puts in effort to make sure we understand what he is teaching in class.,1
"Out of all the classes I had to take in the credential program, this one was one of the few that I did not hate.  She has good humor and is understanding with her students.  Wish all the credential program teachers were more like her.",1
Please listen! She is a very hard teacher! Anatomy is suppose to be basic but she is detailed to everything! Her exams are extremely hard and so are her lab exams. You need to dedicate at least 40 hours a week to study for only this class. This is only a basic anatomy class and she teaches like a university advanced anatomy course. Don't take her.,0
Interesting course,1
"Would definitely take this class again, Chris was an incredible Professor and the course was interesting.",1
"Terrible regarding grading in a timely manner. Didn't have anything beyond three assignments graded until the very end of October. Doesn't actually teach, just has you and the class follow pre-built questions on Canvas & the reading. No actual feedback beyond a unhelpful rubric, made no attempt to hold any office hour. Avoid at all costs.",0
"I like the course however not my favourite lecturer, struggled to stay on top of lectures I thought I would get used to her teaching style but didn't see much improvement. I had to resort to wizedemy to re-learn and catchup in the course.",1
Prof. Browning is a true professional who has many years on the hazmat front lines herself. She will work with you if you let her. I would love to take another course with Prof. Browning at AMU!,1
"Dr. Searfoss is amazing to meet with if you need help and answers questions quickly. She is patient and understanding, but to pass the class you really have to read the textbook.",1
"Easy A. 3 take home essay-tests, one paper. The prof. is a bit nosy though. Lots of students told their personal business and she probed a lot. But easy class. She's also really funny",1
Dr. Solano is one of the best professors ive ever had. He teaches by lecturing and hands on in class practice done through Pearson. He pulls up excel on the projector and does the problems along with us while we do them on our own computer. Tests are also on pearson and are just like the homework/ in class examples so theres never any surprises.,1
"Raquel is a cool person, and she says she gets our busy lives outside of class, but her workload says otherwise. What kind of class puts a quiz with 3 hours of information to study for on the same day as a speech? c'mon now, lol nah. Take this class only if you know you have time to put in all of the work for the quizzes. Whats up summer school?!",0
He makes you feel very dumb no matter your question or concern. His test are about 15% of what he goes over in class. Talks about everything that isn't on the tests. He spends more time on the 'unimportant' things. He wants you to devote ur life to the class. With him its more of a self taught class and A&P is defiantly not the class for that.,0
There's a lot of group discussion for an online class. First time in an online class I felt like I got to know the other students. That's good if you had a great group like my class was. I can see where it could be bad with a worse group though. Textbook is not necessary.,1
First day I was scared because I didnt know much about networking. Now I can say I know a lot more than the first day. Make sure you come to class everyday! Tests are taken every class day but its nothing to worry about. Test grade doesn't count much. Major grade is the project and skills exam. He gets you ready for both. Made an A in the class.,1
Mr Sekta is the teacher to take Arabic classes with!!! He makes it so interesting :),1
"Professor Shields is one of the most sweetest professors that I know. Hes a person that you could approach , you don't need a book for the course, and the documentary films are very interesting to watch. The only issue is had was staying up!",1
"I'm not that into history but this class was a easy to understand class! I took the 8-week online course for fall '15 and I enjoyed it. You'll really need to books to pass the tests because you need to read. Everything is completely at your own pace! Honestly, I would say you use ""The Silver State"" book 90% of the time ! TAKE THIS CLASS!",1
"She is a good and thorough teacher but this class is so much WORK!! All the reading and homework and participation we need to do is too much for summer. She has too high expectations for a GEC, she needs to be more relaxed in classroom discussion. Not everyone has time to read everything and give answers! She helps outside class but intimidating.",1
"This class is very lecture heavy, must try to write notes as she talks. Attendance is mandatory only on discussion days but I would suggest always going. Review days are the best , ask questions !!! 2500 word paper gets graded twice for a higher grade, take advantage !!",1
He seems to have stuck with the same processes for years and has never innovated his teaching style or class format. The homework is incredibly straight forward and actually allows you to learn. The exams are a different story. He has no questions from either the homework or workbook that prepare you for the tests. 75 percent of the grade is exams.,0
"He talks down to his students; it feels like you're in elementary school. All of the assignments are busy-work. He tries to lead discussions, but they always fizzle. Very boring, poorly organized, and too many assignments you don't learn from.",0
She is amazing. She is very helpful. She goes over what is going to be on the exams to the T. I would definitely take her again if i had to.,1
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLINE HE STILL MADE HIMSELF ACCESSIBLE TO OFFICE HOURS. IF YOU EMAIL HIM HE MADE SURE TO GET BACK TO YOU ASAP.,1
"Very nice guy, trying to better this world one student at a time, but his tests were insane. When you have to curve exams 15 points every exam you should know there's an issue. At the end of the day if you put in the work in lab you'll do fine but the exams are very stressful even though you know there will be a curve.",1
"Madhu has specific unspoken criteria for assignments, even when you follow the syllabus she always finds ways to deduct points. Unlike other ECE profs, she does not accept missing assignments at the end of the semester, and you will get a zero for them. If you are having hardships in your personal life she isn't super compassionate or accommodating",0
Don't take this professor. He is unclear on assignments and is one of the toughest graders I've ever met.,0
BEST PROFESSOR OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. He is so funny and really cares if his students are understanding what he teaches. He is clearly very passionate about economics and presents the concepts in an extremely clear and digestible way. No homework if you take notes on the lectures and open notes for all assessments. 10/10 would recommend no question.,1
"Almost impossible to understand, hardly ever returns homework, and you are tested before quizzes get returned. Knows his stuff, but he just can't get it to the students effectively. He WILL notice if you miss a class, and you WILL pay the price for it.",0
"Took her for the first online art course.  I thought she was very organized.  She is an artist but does not expect her students to be artists so her critiques are gentle,hlepful and kind.  If you didn't get an A, you just didn't do anything.  I highly recommend online course.  You only put in about 2 hours per week.",1
"Baughman's semester-long policy papers project was nuts: five 5-page papers on top of all the other reading and work for the class. But he's an easy grader, so if you do the work then you should be fine. It's just time consuming. His tests were pretty reasonable too. Memorize the key terms in the textbook and you should be fine for the final.",1
"His class is not that easy. Basically he doesn't teaches the course he just tells you go and read it if you don't understand then i will explain. All around the place goes from chapter 5 to chapter 2. Exams are T/F, multiple choices, and 3-4 problems to solve.",0
Will's a nice guy if you go to office hours but honestly the lectures were pretty pointless. The whole LFS250 course was super messy and so much work... but I felt like we didn't get much out of it. Definitely more TA dependent than prof. Cool beet tattoo though.,1
"She is a teacher who cares but expects much from you.  If you really want to learn the material take her class.  She will show you exactly what she wants.  Sometimes it is hard to understand her, but if you don't just ask someone else.  She is extremely caring and wants everyone to pass.",1
"This is the most kind-hearted prof I have ever had. The assignments are SO easy but really help you self-reflect. Most assignments are out of a workbook she wrote, so you have to buy that but it's worth it. Take this class!",1
"This class is a lot of work. There are tons of group activities, few projects, papers, etc. Really not worth the time and stress if you're not into all that. Dr. Laflin, howver, is very nice and intelligent. She IS understanding of personal needs. Exams are insanely difficult and timed online.",1
"This class was very easy. You read 2 stories, have 3 discussions and 1 quiz a week. Although that seems like a lot, it's very doable. Discussion posts are pretty short (150 words) with easy to answer questions. The final is an essay that was 600-900 words. She always comments on your posts, and I believe she grades discussions on participation.",1
"He provides lecture notes, but they are very unorganized and involve a lot of unnecessary detail, and he doesn't tell us what is important for us to know. He goes off on tangents, wasting valuable class time, and further confusing his students. Averages are in the 70s on most of his tests, but he does nothing to change that or help his students.",0
"I know nothing about the prof himself. But his class is good. The videos provided are my saviors. textbook provided. There is a project-type thing due every Monday. Strict-ish on guidelines. Updates grades regular. The tests are the worst part, just because they are timed, and you have to show 100% of your work, so thats hard. id take again tho.",1
"Dr. Miller is awesome! He is good at approaching hard-to-learn biological concepts so that they are easier to pick up. He gives a lot of extra credit, so there's no excuse for a low grade. IF you study hard, you will leave this class with a good understanding of A/P. His favorite line seems to be ""Diffusion: ALMOST always a good answer!""",1
"Professor Keller-Perkins tells you what you need to pass her quizzes, exams, midterm, and final. Do the homeworks, always refer to your notes, and study the examle pictures in the OCR; they will save your life. If you don't understand the material right away, then speak up. The professor will explain it again. Visit the tutors and form study groups",1
"Had professor Rice for lab, many people claim to really dislike her, I found that although she is rough on the outside she isn't that cold and heartless on the inside. She is a stickler on the rules, so always follow her directions, come dressed appropriately for lab, read the lab manuals,  and read modules before class and you will be just fine.",1
"I believe he's working on something about Joseph Smith and/or Mormons. Lectures are interesting, more you contribute to book discussions, more you get out of the class",1
"I think Mr Fu is one of the better graphics teachers at this school. He knows what he is talking about, and has years of real world experience. He is always willing to help, and is lenient with grades as long as design aspects are learned and improved",1
"If you get the chance to be in his class, you are in for a treat. He is passionate about this subject which makes it easy to learn from him. Helpful and gets right to the point. Complete all your work and show up to classes and you will do well.",1
"Tries very hard for his students, genuinely cares about student success. Not a great lecturer. I never really learned the real material for the class from his lectures, so the online tests were very hard for me. really nice guy, he just tends to ramble on and on about ""real world"" stuff that doesn't actually pertain to the material.",1
"I remember I went to several office hours and she does not know how to answer my questions. She tells me to refer to textbook (which I did prior to attending office hours). This is a horrible professor who isnt very knowledgeable of what she teaches. This is why tests are so easy, because she basically uses the textbook to come up with questions",0
"Robyn is one of my favorite professors I've had! She's helpful, funny, and approachable. She goes above and beyond for her students and that's one of the reasons she's such a good teacher. She makes writing lesson plans less intimidating by breaking it down and spending a lot of time on it. Classes are fun. The only 3 hour class I ever enjoyed.",1
"All you have to do is go to lecture. My GSI was NOT helpful but since attendance to that class is mandatory, I would go and do the online homework for 101. Overall very simple and straightforward if you do the reading and go to lecture.",1
"She's not bad when you first meet her and if you show that you have a ""passion"" for the theater. If not, you're clearly just wasting your time. She can be rude at times and she wants everything to be about her and her ""directing"" passion but if you do what you're supposed to do you'll pass the class.",1
"Professor Fritsche does a good job at explaining things, he takes his time to explain things if you are confused. There is a lot of homework but the notes that are taken in class help you a lot with it.",1
"Dr. Stephens knows all the tricks and is old school. She was asking regular compare and contrast essay questions for most tests, then threw in a random test with only quotes. So MAKE SURE TO READ EVERYTHING! seriously.   Other than that it is a great class and you are learning from someone who has devoted their life to their studies, utilize it.",1
"Hes not a good lecturer at all. Nothing he says makes sense and when it does he makes it needlessly confusing. I didnt even bother attending lectures after the first two months and I still got an A, showing how useless it actually is. Do the readings and youll be fine. Hes just so BORING and pompous",0
The BEST teacher at Bentley by far.  Worth taking at 8:30.  201 is hard and depends all on the teacher. Clearly teaches and uses tons of examples to help you. Always available for office hourse.  DEF TAKE!!!,1
Wonderful professor!! It's very hard to find a great math teacher and he is the best!! He will work with you outside class and is very understanding. Highly recommend him! I took him for both Pre Calculus and Calculus 1 and have no regrets!,1
"I have signed up for classes I had no intention of taking just because I found out Kellie was the teacher; she is THAT good. Her classes are challenging but fun, and as long as you participate and give it you're all you'll pass without an issue. She's so good at teaching for all skill levels, and she's one of the sweetest people you'll meet.",1
"Dont take over the summer. Horrible experience, material was severely reduced and I feel I learned almost nothing. On the other hand I have heard great things about him from many others so I can only assume it was the reduced time structure.",0
"I dont use this ever, but here I am to warn you to not take David Stone. His average on his exam was a 47% (the first was a 58%), and the final was a 51%. He refused to say what the final exam average was until I asked the TA. He literally sent out a PDF explaining he's not fair bc life isn't fair and hence he wouldn't curve and to just suck it up",0
"Dr. Callaway is a very kind woman, but as a professor she can feel a little removed and intimidating. Her class is sort of dry and uninteresting. The readings are not long but are constant. A VERY VERY HARSH grader, on papers and exams. I personally think the class is not worth taking, but she is worth getting to know. ",0
She runs through power points EXTREMELY fast. I mean barely having time to write down half the slide before she moves to the next so keep this in mind. Aside from that if you read the book you'll be ok. Pay attention to midterm and final review. Online tests are timed.,1
"extemely nice prof. very easy to understand and an awesome teacher! writes notes on the board and you just sit there and copy what she writes. assigns a lot of homework though but it helps when it comes time for the test. very funny. if you study and know your stuff, tests are really easy and it'll be a breeze. very easy grader.",1
I would recomend this professor to anyone taking english... She is an understanding and awsome professor... I loved her class and she is so helpful.... I highly recomend her...,1
Currently taking her summer online trig. class. Best decision I could have made on a summer course. Her material is organized & easy to follow. The homework is easy to understand and we get 2 attempts on quizzes. On exams we can take a note card with formulas. Do homework and you will pass the quizzes. Would definitely take again,1
"I learned so much from her and her acting techniques, she is honest and she always is willing to help all the students to improve and grow in this career. She tell you what to do to improve and to be better, do not take any critique personal is for your own good.",1
Terrible teacher. Haven't had class in a month. Reading assignments are never online but he expects you to read them. He coughs all class and will randomly call on you. Do not take if you have another choice.,1
"Miller is the man! One of the best professors I've had at ACC. The material is hard, but he has a good way explaining it in laymen terms and by example so we can fully visualize the material. He loves teaching and it shows. He can be a bit sarcastic at times, but overall he's a great professor. Wish there was more grades though, not enough grades.",1
"The class is graded by 10 online assignments, 4 online short quizzes, and 3 in class exams. I recommend purchasing Chegg and the financial calculator he suggests so you can get a 100 on each assignment and quiz and follow along easier in class. He curved every test and you should study how to actually do the assignments and quizzes for the exams.",1
He's an amazing professor! He genuinely cares about the well being of his students. Take him if you can.,1
"Alright, Ted is a great guy. Young, relates well to students, cracks jokes, knowledgeable. But he was very unclear and even confused himself at times teaching the slides; students had to correct his mistakes. His tests are ridiculously long and hard, even for a 50 minute class. Also, if you ask him a question during a test, he won't help at all.",0
"I loved epidemiology and have decided to go to get my PhD in this field. No textbook exams--awesome! But, you will read and write a lot, a good thing because he grades grammar. This means you will be a better writer at the end. Ah, I was so hoping to take his section of MBioS494 in spring, but he won't be teaching. Sad. He's super as a professor.",1
"Super nice and caring professor. 50 question exams, gives the answers to like 30 of them. You need the book to do the HW, thats the only negative. Super flexible. Yes his accent is bad, but he tries his best to make himself understandable. HW is 6% of your total grade. Also did not respond to my email. CHOOSE THIS PROFESSOR TO PASS WITH AN A!",1
"I started this ACCT class with the very helpful Professor Hegner. She had to leave halfway through the semester at which point Professor Skelly took over. He has wonderful stories that relate to economics and politics, both are not helpful to the number crunching of accounting. He writes illegible on the board and speaks in a low monotone voice.",0
"Shes a great teacher WHO CARES. easy, & straight forward grading/assignments. Easy A as long as your doing your part.",1
One of the most interesting professors I have ever had. If you get the chance to take a class taught by him I would highly recommend it.,1
Well learned in subject. Willing to compromise and work with you.,1
"I never took chem before. There's no reason for you not to pass unless you're seriously not even trying. If you're struggling (I did), then you bought the book, so use it! If you need more clarification ask Mr. T. Do the optional hw to remember how to do the problems. Your lab group has 3-4 ppl you sit with on the 1st day, so sit with smart ppl!",1
run...,0
Great professor. Still remember him 8 years after taking the class.  Put it all together for me.  Very clear,1
"Professor Stevens was straight forward with what he expected from the class. If you go to him with your graded homework's he will walk you through what you missed, and even offered extra credit opportunities. Would take him again!",1
He really knows what he is talking about and goes in depth into all topics.,1
Dasgupta is awesome.,1
"This woman loves thermo so much, she'll make sure you love it too! She is an AWESOME prof and definitely the best I've ever had. Really helpful in class and out, has clear notes, explains topics thoroughly and has reasonable exams. If you have the choice, take thermo with her! You won't regret it",1
I took her Intro Psych class ad it was honestly very easy for me. Just take plenty of notes and memorize key items. ,1
"Dont sign up for this class. RUN. Average exam grades are Ds. The only reason youll pass is because of the exam drop. If want to keep your 4.0, choose another class.",0
"This class was very interesting and Meyer did a good job to teach it. He put together a good syllabus & was easy to understand even though I have no philosophy background, and he facilitated good class discussions. But, I don't really like the guy, he has a big ego, loves his own ideas, and sometimes makes students uncomfortable.",1
"Dr. Xing is a very intelligent professor with a Harvard Education. With that said, she expects much out of her students. She teaches very fast and very detailed. HOWEVER, she is extremely helpful in what she expects you to know for exams with study guides and reviews. She gives online HW as well as book HW. Dedicate the time and you will do fine.",1
"Take her! Has an accent but does her best to try and get through everything. 2 discussions, 2 assignements, 1 midrerm, 1 final (DOES AN AWESOME REVIEW) offers extra credit even though you probably won't do it. The only negative thing I'd say is not to take her at night because you cannot sleep, doesn't text back or answer emails either",1
I've had Clark for three semesters now and she is one of the best teachers I have ever had in my entire life!  She's always there to help you out when you need it and will even look over papers that you don't write for her class.  She defintely deserves an,1
Prof. Reddy's class given this was done online was the best Bio class Ive ever taken. She tends to lecture really fast but thats because of the school's learning pace and not hers. Though her grading is very fair regardless if it was in class or online. I really liked how quickly i was able to get in touch with her via email as well.,1
"super easy class you have 2 test and he gives you a ""study guide"" that is a replica of the test. NO FINAL!!! All you do are 1 page response to videos (double spaces) and discussions. Take the pace class super easy and little work.",1
"Dr. Lyons is a great prof. Her lectures are heavy but if you pay attention you'll be fine. She's got her moments for jokes, but she genuinely cares about her students. She's very passionate about her material and knows a lot.",1
Do not listen to other bad reviews! Moazzam is a very nice professor. Make sure that you attend all of his classes and complete the in-class assignment at the end of the class. Easy to get A+. Highly recommend!!! I would take his class again and again!,1
"She's a great professor but as someone else said... ""Nice but grading is arbitrary""",1
Fair and balanced. Would take him again. Knows his stuff.,1
Had a tough time this semester and this was not an easy course but she worked with me to make sure I graduated. Held me accountable and made me work for it but helped me the whole way.,1
His explanations are good and easy to understand. Show up and pass. Simple.,1
Professor Walling is very passionate about his work as an anthropology teacher. He is in charge of a study abroad program in Belize for those who are interested. DO  NOT USE YOUR PHONE IN CLASS! The only exception  for this rule is if you're using your cell phone to record one of his lectures. He talks fast. I found his office hours very helpful.,1
Arnold is obviously very enthusiastic about science. But the class... boring and a waste of time. I would have ditched if attendance wasn't mandatory. The 10-day unit plan we had to create - a burden that I won't ever look at again. The whole unit assignment needs to be revamped somehow.,0
Yea since this is a chem class its just a tad bit rigorous and skipping will dig a deeper hole. But overall he knows his stuff and makes it easier for you to know it too,1
Best Professor. Really cares about his students.,1
She is unfocused and unfair.,0
"Seipp was AWESOME! she takes time to help you in and out of class if needed! she wants you to understand the material not just get through it. get used to my math lab. she posts the lectures powerpoints, she drops the lowest test grade and hands out study guides. if she sees you are TRYING and putting in work you are most likely going to do well.",1
Hard to get a clear answer by email. Kinda rude. Tests are hard.,1
"She's a good person and cares about her students, but her lectures are off a power point that she quickly goes through.  Make sure you print out the chapter outlines and follow her with those or else you could easily get lost during lecture.  Do the quizzes, they will help your grade!  Also, her exams are mainly fill in the blank and short answers.",1
The class seems easy at first but after taking the tests (online due to COVID). His class pretty hard. There basically no work except for 3 test and a simulation project which I didn't even get an email about when its due. Not the best experience sadly...,0
I don't understand why people were having such a hard with his tests but his tests are very straightforward and tells you what it's going to be on it. Go to class and take notes. He gives plenty of opporutnities for extra credit! There are no surprises. He assigns group work which is kind of annoying,1
"If you like going to class lectures to learn because you don't really read the book, this is not the class for you. Her classes are more for practicing what you read. Hands out lots of problems to work in class, felt like a waste of class time when we could have worked those at home and reviewed them in class. Doesnt teach the logic of accountin",1
"I love Gershuni, by far the best professor I have ever had. She is very proper and does NOT tolerate any type of talking or disruption during class. Participation is huge in her class and requires you to sign in for attendance. Her assignments make you think a lot, but you learn a lot and do a lot of critical thinking.",1
"I love this professor! He is really good at teaching math and he is so patient. He gives 17 quizzes and there are 4 exams plus finals plus he gives a 25 to 40 extra credit points if you go to the math lab. I used to hate math, but now I love it! Highly recommend him if you're having trouble with math!",1
Professor Guimberteau is excellent! I took her online Psych 1 class and really enjoyed it. I liked the textbook chosen for the class and thought the class was very straightforward. If you put in the work it is an easy A and a great online class to take over the summer. I highly recommend taking this professor's online class!,1
"Shapiro may be easy -- but this is because she develops such a strong personal bond with each student that you feel guilty if you don't truly apply yourself.  She is smart, makes students excited about class and aware of the issues, and assigns work that you actually learn from",1
"He was clear, consistent, and quirky. Always asked if anyone had questions on homework problems at the beginning of class. The rest of the time was spent writing/teaching on the board. Your hand will get tired, but you will understand how to math. NO CALCULATORS ALLOWED FOR TESTS. Very kind and understanding if you took the time to know him.",1
"Dr. Shkiler was overall a fine professor. She could come off a little rude every now and then, but nothing crazy.",1
I enjoyed D. Dyers class. His lectures were great and helpful. He gives Webassigns and assignments roughly once a week that are usually pretty easy. The hardest thing was the short projects but they aren't worth much. Overall if you put in the work it's not a hard course.,1
Ryburn was by far my favorite professor my freshman year. She makes the content easy and understandable and will slow down for you if you don't understand the material. She should be a role model for professors.,1
"Tests every two weeks, word for word from slides. Paper is an easy A if you follow the prompt and can speak English well enough to be understood on paper. The class is an easy A but the lectures are painfully boring so bring something to entertain yourself",1
I've taken two classes now with Dr. Poole and I've enjoyed my experience both times. Read the textbook and be familiar with the concept and you'll be able to pass with flying colours.,1
"Mrs. Stralka was a great teacher.  Did she talk often about her family, yes, but it was completely within context.  She did a great job clearly explaining everything.  She was helpful when needed and focused on helping you pass.  Show up, take notes, pay attention & you'll not only pass, you'll understand the concepts for the next Math level.",1
He is a great teacher who cares about his students and the subject he is teaching. As long as you read you will make a good grade.,1
She is amazing! This is the only class I look forward to going to.,1
"Had Ams for Ochem 1 & 2. Ochem 1 wasn't bad but not as good as it could've been. Ochem  2 was a disaster b/c he stopped caring about the students and teaching after he received his tenure. There was not additional help outside of the lecture that left you confused and unprepared for test. If you want to get a good grade/learn ochem, don't take Ams",0
He likes to be called Bob and he is hands down one of the best professors at Keene! He is very knowledgeable about Management and has great examples. He makes this 'dry' subject interesting and you'll actually want to go to class. His exams aren't bad you just have to make sure you study from his power points and you'll do great!,1
He wrote everything that was going to be on the test on the board in in an outline format. He was helpful and friendly with the students. He treated every question as if it was of utmost importance. He eve looked something up for me that had to do with a health issue my grandfather was having. Great teacher!!!!,1
"Professor Russell has been my best professor at Vanderbilt. She not only makes classes interesting, but she validates all of her students as thinkers and workers. She wants you to succeed. She is very understanding about mental health issues and is more than willing to accommodate you. You need to put in the work but it does not feel like work",1
Mrs. Henderson is the best teacher I've ever had. As a clinical instructor she is tough and caring. She is very comfortable with students being independent and is always there for support.,1
"I couldnt possibly be more open to a teacher, she is amazing. I can email her about ANYTHING and she would help relating what she had gone through with her son giving her students the best possible solutions to things whether it is class related or not. 1000/10 best teacher period. Thanks to her i am a semester ahead in the first 2 weeks i started.",1
Dr.Anderson is literally the smartest and most down to earth professor I've ever had. His class is hard but it's really just that the material is difficult and unlike any other aspect of biology. you really just have to get used to his style of teaching. He curves A LOT and labs are adventurous! BIG paper due at the end but he walks you through it!,1
"Parkhurst was pretty chill and rude at the same time. I thought I was a decent writer until I took his class. He grades your papers extremely hard. The topics you write about are pretty flexible, but I feel like if you dont write it how he views the topic; youll suffer. His class is extremely stressful! Please, save yourself.",0
"I have him for lab & lecture; I definitely recommend him. he let us use cheat sheets for a lab test which he helped me make,notes are easy to take b/c he writes most of them on the board with pictures. nice guy too. I failed the first test and he said hed drop it if I did extra credit. wants us to pass and will do what he can to make sure we do",1
"So this class is definitely challenging. You need to study a little more than just following along with the HTML tutorials for the tests. If you email her though and ask to see if your website is correct & working, she will respond quickly and tell you what is wrong and how exactly to fix it.",1
she keeps saying is that right,1
great professor but get ready to read you have to work smart in her class not hard. She always reviews what is going to be on the quiz and its almost the same as the quiz. If you listen to her lectures go through her power points and follow instruction its an easy A. Awesome professor,1
"Not just for this class, this is an overall review for Dr. Kamau. In my opinion, one of the better professormentor a student can have. Dr. Kamau truly cares about the success of his students and will help as long as you show a willingness to learn and be active in your own success. ",1
"His lectures are engaging enough, though he occasionally makes you participate in inclass activities.  The course work is super easy.  I got A's on the tests with minimal studying.  He has reviews for the tests that are lame group activity games, but attendance isn't required at all, so it's not like you have to go.",1
"Was a nice teacher at first and had a different way of teaching that I respected because not many professors are willing to try something new to help students succeed. However this style of teaching just did not work for me, and after expressing these concerns I guess I triggered him into writing a 5 page paper about how I was a terrible person.",0
He is a very nice professor however he says papers only deserve at most a 93% which I believe is unfair. He gives one extra credit assignment. Other than that hes a good guy.,1
Very little knowledge of economics.  VERY unclear about information in the course.  He has no clue what he is talking about.  His lectures and the class are extremely boring.  Tests are difficult to study for.  It always seemed that the information on the tests was not covered.,0
"I know how everyone keeps saying how hard this class is, but it is honestly THE most interesting class you will EVER take! I LOVED Dr.Yates, and i found her to be such an intense individual, with alot to offer as a professor. She is also extremely helpful outside class. Even though her exams are hard, they even out at the end...so don't worry!",1
He definetly used to be a stoner! Class is wicked..if your into music definetly take it. He really knows what he is talking about. I would highly recommend him. And he's to hottie to boot! =P,1
"Prof Perov is the cutest man in the world. He genuinely cares about his students success and well being. He WANTS every student to pass, but this doesn't mean he is going to bump your grade up for no reason. He doesn't scale grades, but he will go out of his way to help you better prepare for next exam. He also has make-up exams if you do poorly.",1
Awesome!  Had her for 2 classes now & love the flipped classroom method.  Fair grader and always returns stuff the next class.  My favorite in the chem dept!,1
"Great Professor, teaches the class well and his exams fair. Online homework required but it isn't that bad, make sure to do it because much of the test material comes directly from the homework. Also provides a fairly substantial amount of extra credit for completing reading assignments. ACS final was curved.",1
"Pass on this Professor. Doesn't teach, is rude at times and expects the most from students. Heavily graded on discussion boards and participation.",0
"Funny guy. Definitely knows his stuff, and his teaching style makes it interesting to learn it. The assignments seem hard at first but are usually straight out of the PIC book, if you know where to look. I don't feel that he gave us quite enough time to work on the car, though, nut we still got it going in the end, so I guess it was enough, really.",1
One of the best choices I made was choosing her as a teacher. She is not a hard teacher. She gives good feedback and is clear on the assignments she wants. With the class being online she also allowed a good chunk of time for each assignment to be due.,1
"Professor West is passionate about what he teaches. He believes in helping everyone pass and is always willing to help outside of class. Attendance is crucial! He covers a lot in one class and if you miss a class you will fall behind. But even then, if you make the effort to seek his help, he's always there to offer it.",1
Really a horrible instructor for math 95 and higher. She does not know the materials for any of this math class. Really rude in class and yells at students when she made the mistakes. Her office hours are really late and when students goes to her office hours for help. She sleeps in her office hours and yells at students for no reason for material.,0
"The math course for people who can't do math. Field is a solid lecturer, making sure that everyone understands the material. It's a tough class but he gives you plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. He's funny and loves participation. Just talk to the guy and you'll learn a lot. He's brilliant and witty. Hated the class & TAs but liked him",1
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He will start lecturing about material in test 5 before you've even taken test 6 He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
"Handsome, smart, and friendly. Dr. Snaza is a wonderful professor. I wish I had more time with him. I recommend taking ""him"" rather than the class.",1
"Asking a lot from the students, maybe too much. It's true that he knows his stuff very well and he's a world-leading autority on many subjects, however he is a bit old-fashioned.",1
"My all time favorite professor a Case. He's hilarious and genuinely enjoys teaching and making an impact. He goes above and beyond as a professor to make sure he's students have a valuable experience. Take whatever class you can get with him, you'll be doing yourself a favor!",1
Mrs. Sieber lecture are long but she make them fun. When she says in the beginning of class that she does not round up grades she means it. I made a C because of this and missed a B by 1 point. She does this because she offers extra credit on the exams. Do all the extra credit and you will be fine. Every point matters! ,1
The way he grades you seems very unfair to me. All it is is about 3 tests and then two papers that only count for 10% of your grade. The subject is interesting but your ability to pass may be questionable.,0
Lots of writing but no surprises. I learned more than I thought. Was pretty painless.,1
"Accounting isn't an easy class, but I have an easy time with him! He explains things very well, does multiple examples with the class, gives study guides, and gives fair tests. You might get a little bored in class because he goes into great detail, but when you are confused on something you'll be happy that he explains everything so well!",1
"Definitely worth taking this course. His accent is 100% understandable. All of his teaching materials were self-curated (much better than a regurgitated textbook), and always used interesting, relevant examples. Choose partners carefully for your team project. Overall, a great experience (enough to seek out this professor for other courses).",1
She managed to take an interesting subject area and make it very boring and dry. She is not the best presenter yet she marked our online zoom presentations quite harshly for things like enthusiasm and eye contact ( with a webcam...). She does often end class pretty early which is nice. If you are really interested in the subject try and avoid her.,0
Sarver puts a 20 point curve on every assignment and test. Not because he is easy but because all his quizzes and test are very hard. He didn't use the book but expected us to read the chapters and understand it without using it in class. The tests went way more in depth than the notes ever did.,0
"Arts and crafts for babies was the most difficult course I have taken at MacEwan university. I took Gerard's class becasue I heard he was inspirational and it would be a GPA boost, but instead I just found myself up at 2am gluing googly eyes into a scrapbook in order to explain my life story to my classmates in picture format the next day.",0
"This a tough upper level course needed for HPFM majors. I'll admit many of our HPFM courses are simple, but you really need to work for this one. Chaloupka has been published many times, so he knows his stuff. I recommend reading ahead and watching Youtube video to really understand the material. Overall really nice guy!",1
"If you try your best, you can get an A. He is fair. Slacking off/not doing your readings will hurt your grade. Follow the instructions he gives rather than thinking you know better. I love him. He is cute when he gets passionate and he is funny. One of my favorite professors. I have taken him twice. Sadly I cant take him again bc Im graduating.",1
"I was struggling a lot during the first half of the class, but she was so patient and caring when working with me and what I needed. The class is very discussion based, she can go off on tangents sometimes, but a lot of the weight is placed on students. Hard texts, but she's so awesome about meeting outside of class to discuss any questions.",1
"VERY NICE TEACHER. GIVES A LOT OF NOTES AND A LOT OF MATERIAL TO STUDY FOR THE TEST, BUT GIVES HINTS ON WHAT WILL BE ON THEM. EXPLAINS AND CLARIFIES THINGS IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. VERY PLEASANT WOMAN",1
Don' s a nice guy and takes time to go through problems. The midterm exams are primarily based on his examples and sheets in class. Only issue I had was how some of the textbook questions were far more difficult and irrelevant to the ones he teaches in class. He can be intimidating since his jokes can be very sarcastic.,1
The BEST at CTC!!!!,1
"I wish that Prof. Liu taught Calc 2. I took calculus in high school and mostly already understood the course, but she made the concepts so much clearer than I remember learning them. Her accent isn't that hard to understand and she will do everything to make sure you pass the class. Homework is completion, tests are short and the class isn't long.",1
I love Katie Pingle,1
"Dr. Wejksnora is very funny and interesting. Don't buy the textbook, I didn't use it at all because all of our notes came from lecture and were available on the course reserve. Discussion is worth a large amount of your grade, so do all of the online homework and study for the 3 quizzes. Overall a good class, and I would recommend Dr. Wejksnora.",1
EASIEST CLASS IVE EVER TAKEN AT PCC got 100 percent on all quizzes and extra credit. B's on exams/midterms. 50% in participation. ended up with a 94.,1
Professor Raphael knows the material - plain and simple.  It also helps that he loves the material and Supreme Court jurisprudence.  Class is mostly lecture-based.  Exam is short - two basic fact patterns (with expectation to cite case names).  I would recommend Crim Pro - Adjudication with Professor Raphael.,1
Professor Randall is a pretty awesome Professor and is always willing to help you inside and outside of the classroom. She always relates very well but can class can get slightly off topic easily.,1
"His lectures don't prepare anyone for his exams, but he's a nice guy with a lot of experience",1
"This professor is an absolute trip. If you have a question regarding anything and you e-mail her one week in advance, she will say I never saw the e-mail. The weekly homework were mostly essays that had to be cited in APA . She is easily the toughest grader in the dept. If you have the option, please save yourself and your GPA to not take the class",0
Inexperienced Boring Lacks context,0
"I have never worked so hard for an A in my life. 5 week Cal 1 class and there was so much homework. I came in weak on my pre-cal and Algebra. I came out a Beast in Calculus and all the above. With math, you have to practice and you get a lot of practice with the homework. He has very good class explanations too. Just don't take a heavy load.",1
very hard class and though grader. readings are confusing,0
"He is the most specific grader I have every seen.  He docks off points for the way one writes their symbols.  I once overheard him tell a student that he will give him/her a zero on the test if he/she writes too small for his liking.  He seems passionate about math and one's understanding of the material.  Good guy, awful grader.",0
Boring basically. I have fallen asleep in some of his lectures because he would just go off topic a lot. Very easy class if you can manage to take some notes and manage to do well on the assignments. The tests aren't pretty though as they are weirded very complicated and it's very hard to store information in that class. He grades on a curve sadly.,1
"Cute little French Canadian lady. She gets rather impatient with students at times, but is an overall good teacher.",1
"He makes you work hard for his class, but you learn a lot.",1
"She was really cool, very understanding.A bit strict when it comes to grading papers. I would recommend her class.",1
I love the way Miss. Sexton teaches ,1
"Very very easy.  Tests are taken straight from the workbook that you have to do.  I had already taken some spanish before and made an easy A, but some people found it difficult.",1
terrible dont go to class the test is so easy and you dont use your lecture notes.,0
"Awful prof, he doesnt teach, he only goes over whats in the book once and expects you to know it fluently. Expects you to be fluent in the oral exam(its a requirement to get 100%), give hours worth of homework a week. Exams all open ended, will give a zero On a problem for missing a letter in a word,no word Bank. Class runs over almost everyday.",0
"She is the best professor EMU has. You need to go to class and pay attention and you will do well, she is excellent at explaining the material and will do anything to help her students. This is not an easy class by any means but if you listen to her and prepare for exams you can most definitely get an A. Her exams are extremely fair.",1
"Great teacher, definitely learned a lot from him. Hes honest and straight forward with great stories.",1
"Super sweet and understanding Prof. Basically to pass this class you need to take notes on every assigned chapter, which I didn't mind b/c I found everything interesting. Using the review list to know what to specifically take notes on is useful too. Well structured each week, 2 attempts on every test (even the final), ezpz.",1
"I had Mcleod for ECON 102 and he was good for that. Would give us practice exams that were very similar to the exams. ECON 302 not so much, HWs were not too bad and like in-class examples, but his exams were different than some in-class examples and challenging. He also expects you to understand everything the first time you learn it no exceptions.",1
"No homework. Don't buy textbook. Took him for 307 and 308, write down EVERYTHING from his slides. Study your notes and course pack before every exam. He only has 3 grades  3 exams so study a lot. The math is very simple but the multiple choice and T/F is fairly difficult. Definitely not an easy A but doable, and at least he's (sorta) funny.",1
"she doesn't care if you can keep up with her teaching or not. She is the most subjective teacher I have ever seen. Once you know you are not her type, better frop the class ASAP because no matter how hard you try, she will still give you a low grade.",0
"Prof. Stewie is a very difficult prof. indeed, but so is Research Methods in general. He however was always available to help and invests time in the success of his students. His humor is a bit sarcastic but he is pretty entertaining. During his class my friend and I would often chuckle about the chest hair that would always pop out of his collar.",1
"DO: show up to class, take good notes, WileyPlus online hw, study for tests DON'T: be late, use phone/technology, ask questions b/c she won't answer them well Tests are all based on her notes and are relatively hard b/c it covers a lot of material. She's awful with technology, kind of scary yet kind of nice, but overall good teacher.",1
"Took US History after 1945 a few semesters ago, and it was great. I forgot to write a review, but he's an excellent teacher :)",1
"Students your educational intelligence would be tempestuous with you, if you don't have the privilege of being a student in his course of instructions.",1
"Didn't like that most of math formulas used/execution of math problems couldn't be found in textbook as the slides were from Pearson, not OpenStax (this was confusing). Sometimes impatient with evening class students. Did make effort in explaining problems mid-semester for tests and final exam. Advice, team with classmates and use youtube math.",1
Great teaching enviroment,1
"What a sweet person. Maria is one of the few professors that makes video lectures and feedback and posts them. I found that so so helpful. She is super nice and really accessible, knowledgeable, and understanding. I learned so much in her class that I will need to finish college. She is not too as a grader and listens to feedback.",1
Great teacher. She really takes the time to get you to understand the information and gives good feedback. She puts her PowerPoints that she teaches from on Blackboard and all you really need for the class is the online homework course.,1
"Don't take this class too seriously. There were a few people that were just peeing their pants every time something even more complicated came up. Those people just need to know only the exceptional student is going to get EVERYTHING from the course, and that's the way it was designed. I mean come on, we still all got A's.  Chill out, it's DigiPen.",1
"Professor Connor was great. She gave extensions on things for some students which she passed to the whole class. 2 proctored grades- a test and the final, and note cards were permitted for both. Everything else was online with two attempts for each test. Homework is unlimited and I loved the textbook. Very interactive. I wish she did MGF 1107!",1
"I took this class online and it was a breeze. There are clear deadlines on everything and most of the material is easy to understand. You get one notecard for the midterm and two for the final, and the reviews are basically the test.",1
"She's incredibly anal about grammar when grading your papers. None of my french teachers have been this picky and petty about sentence structure, yet she's an art prof. She cares more about how a paper is written rather than the content. I recommend submitting your papers in English for this class if your French isn't 100% perfect.",0
"If possible, do not take his class. He rarely answers emails or messages and doesn't interact with students at all. His rubric is unclear with 'dramatically exceeding expectations' required to get an A. I understand it's college and it isn't meant to be easy, but this guy is horrible. A month in and he hasn't taught anything himself.",0
"I took an online course with Professor Molnar in ENGL 161. As an avid writer, it wasn't difficult to keep up with his workload, and as long as you make an attempt and show willingness to learn, he gives great advice and is very understanding. Grading is tough but well-explained when you first enter the course.",1
"This is a simple class, students will get a good grade on the speeches if they prepare and practice a lot. Be prepared for the 2 tests worth 40 percent. You can manage to get an A if you study She had to give us 25 extra credits for the 2nd test because she didn't know the answer to many of the questions and half of the class failed the test",1
Super helpful with any and all questions. Will take time out of class to make sure everyone understands the material. Gives lots of review material and provides a lot of study information. Takes work and studying to get an A but great teacher!,1
"When you take Honors 210 do yourself a favor and do not take White's & Ritzenhoff's section. Before, this class was only taught by Ritzenhoff, which everyone said was fun. This was the first year with White & she was awful. Gives no assignment guidelines, not available for help with assignments, and then has audacity to tell you not to worry Awful",0
Dr. lyall is amazing and very funny! class is easy because he gives u things that's gonna b on tests I had fun in this class and loved counseling I learned a lot and I would love to take him again you must take him,1
I've had Dr. Cochrane for several classes and I've loved every one of them. She's a great professor and really easy to talk to. Good sense of humor and extremely nice!,1
"She's ridiculous, we spend every day hearing Dr. Smith telling us we need to work harder. We have AT LEAST 4 pages of homework every day. Our mid term was three, three page papers, an interview, a 8 semester course diagram, and 6 pages of the workbook. UI100 is supposed to be a blow off class, and it is in every other UI100. Not this one.",0
"Doc Lamkin is an excellent professor. She made me love all the material. I've got an A in her class by  working hard through the whole semester. A lot of memorization!! My advice is to print the lab manual and practice with it, also take notes during class, and practice with the chapter tests in the book. ",1
This lady is NUTS! Avoid taking this course with her if you can! Take my advice please! You will be better off taking this course with somebody else!,0
"Professor Smith is the type of guy that gets  you excited about his classes, he's just that passionate about material sciences and engineering. His motto is ""my job is to give you an A; so don't get in my way."" he really does care about his students. Tests and quizzes abound, but he prepares you well for them.  Work hard,  and you'll pass easily. ",1
"I enjoyed the class. She is a fair (read: forgiving) grader and a great lecturer but her discussions are more or less lacking. Overall an interesting teacher, not perfect, but good. She's also a stone cold fox. really really really attractive. and smart. and attractive.",1
"I took this course online, and it was overall an easy class. Her class-lectures are difficult to follow, but she posts an extended version of each lecture online, and the textbook is very useful. The tests were also relatively easy as long as you study. She is a very caring person, and you can tell she wants her students to succeed.",1
He meets with everyone after the first and second project and gives great feedback. This course requires a lot of effort.,1
J'adore ce prof!!!,1
Dara is the best!  She is so helpful!  Her lessons are clear and precise.  Her tests are hard but fair.,1
she is fine you just need to pay attention.,1
He is a very good teacher and makes understanding business very easy. He is funny sometimes and i highly recommend!,1
"I enjoyed this class a lot. It is all lecture in typical lecture fashion. He has weekly quizzes online, only 4 exams, and iClicker questions almost every class. Very knowledgeable and will explain things if you go to him for help. You get out of it what you put in.",1
"On the first week, she slams her hand on a table to make sure we are listening. It's difficult to convince her on the exams you ""own the material"". There's also an essay due the day of the multiple choice final.",1
"Amazing teacher, sets his students up for success! Follow his study guides and lecture notes and you can easily get a good grade (book helps but his notes cover about 95% of what you have to learn). He curves his class which can easily bump you up a full letter great! I highly recommend him!!!!!!",1
He always dives deep into the problems.,1
"I learned more about English in this class than any other. Show up to class, do your work, and you will get a good grade a learn a lot. Very good professor!",1
I loved taking her class and regret that I didn't take one of hers sooner. She's one of the better teachers I've had and she's willing to help on her papers and the final and gives the option of rewrites at the end of the semester. She makes the class fun and relates it to topics that might come up in the media as well. ,1
"Dr. King is one of the nicest professors and incredibly willing to help. Both Shinkle and King are very intelligent but oftentimes that made material inaccessible. Utilize office hours to understand what the profs are looking for and how they ask questions. For King's modules, focus on material application/big ideas > straight memorization.",1
"100% recommend this course for online, easy, not too time consuming, socratic is your best friend for this course, everything is exactly like the powerpoints & exams, she gives you so much time to do your work, self paced, she answers emails quickly to clear up understanding, she's so caring and awesome, not a hard class, take it now! w/her <3",1
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
funny!,1
"Doc is by far the most caring, thoughtful professor I have ever encountered. He truly understands his students and helps out when he can. He relates all his lectures to real world experiences and has a multitude of knowledge to share. Don't hesitate to call him as he will always answer!",1
most sweet and nice proffessor ever,1
Important to read the book in order to understand the class. book is very helpful but her slides are even better. wasn't understanding her class but made all efforts and was able to take 1st exam and ace it. She knows the subject too good. gives in class assignments which help a lot on the exam.,1
"she was an okay professor. I really liked that she was always there to help out when I needed it and gave good feedback. You have to really work for a good grade though, but if you ask for help and do what you're suppose to you can end with the grade you want.  Im not 100% sure if i would take this professor again.",1
she's so nice and the class is relatively easy,1
One of the best profs I've had.Clear concise and very helpful.Do well on midterm cause final is hard.,1
"He'll provide you with about as good a music introduction class as you can get, in a 30+ student class with both music and non-music majors. He explains the subject very clearly, is personable,  and gives fair exams. The best way to ace this class (for a non-music major) is to create memorization tricks and widgets to use during each of 4 exams.",1
"Great Teacher! Brings concrete examples to explain theories in the form of videos, and articles. Class content is not easy, but  she is very helpful and understanding. Very approachable. Her power points and study guides are extremely useful for midterms and final. I learned a great deal in her class !",1
"Four 500 word writing assignments and four reading quizzes (the syllabus says what article they're on). Midterm/Final: She gives you 12 questions a week beforehand, the exam has 6, you write about 4. She's clear and thorough, no rambling. GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS FOR WRITING. Most my class tanked the first assignment, the rubric is unclear. Cute too!",1
"she is very unclear, very unorganized and sometimes has an attitude with students after they dont understand her. she likes art though, and it shows. if you like writing and unclarity, take her art criticism.",0
Shes great professor before and during the pandemic. She tried her best to delivery the material and rose above the occasion. I really enjoyed her class. She gives 4 exams including the final and a lot of extra credit. You also have a quiz after every chapter. She wants kids to be engage so participate much as you can. The material is interesting.,1
sweet teacher & does really care about the students. sometimes she asks for feedback about the test because she actually wants you to learn. I really recommend this teacher for history. GO TO CLASS if you don't you won't get a good grade bc she does a lot of clicker questions that are participation! don't get the actual book use the ebook!,1
Professor Lusk is AWESOME. I enjoyed her class very much. She takes the time to make sure each student understands the material before tests and quizzes. It is helpful to at least skim the book before class or at least before tests. She made the point system very fair and clear.,1
The best professor in the bioeneg. department .... he makes you love the fact that you are an engineer,1
Had Lee for a few different classes don't agree with some parts of his class but is one of the better IS professors I had at Eastern. During the move to online classes He done a great job at making a good transition for students. He gives a lot of homework but gives you a lot of time to do it. Biggest down fall he is slow at grading.,1
"Gabe was an awesome professor, he works very well with athletes. I am trying to write for the school newspaper next year just because he is in charge of it. I disliked writing and english before taking his class and now I thoroughly enjoy it.",1
"She is the best yoga instructor I have ever had!!  This is an excellent class to take, and you can get a letter grade!!",1
Always makes sure to let you know when there will be a pop quiz and is helpful when studying for the exam,1
"I learned a lot in Dr. Robinson's class. He does give a lot of homework. However, it prepared me to transfer to a four-year university to pursue my BSW degree. He helped me reach my goal!",1
ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST.  KNOWS THE WORLD OF ARCH VERY WELL.  KNOWS DESIGN.  NICEST GUY EVER.  WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO HELP THE STUDENT LEARN.  PROBABLY THE BEST AT CAP.  CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF HOW THIS GUY HELPS YOU IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM...,1
needs help with online classes,0
"Despite how he acts in the beginning of CHE110, Swartz turns out to be a really cool guy and a fantastic professor!  He was always willing to help me with the labs (when I could find him), although never expect him to just give you the answer on anything because he won't.  Lab helped more than lecture ever did.  Swartz also gives GREAT life advice!",1
"Professor Tanoukhi has a unique, discussion based teaching style.  If you want to learn to think in the abstract and like a challenge, I highly recommend her classes.  She knows her theory and also makes sure to incorporate her student's interests.  She will make you a better scholar.  Plus she genuinely helpful in answering questions.",1
"This was no doubt a tough class, but Dr. Fan really cares about her students and wants you to attend her class! She drops the lowest test grade, and it really comes handy towards the end.",1
"EASIEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. Show up, do your homework, pay attention, and take notes. That's all you have to do to pass this class. You get to use your notes and homework during quizzes and tests. Homework is optional but you get extra credit for going to the math lab so do your homework there. I wish every class was taught like this.  ",1
"If you want to be an Econ Major, take EC11 with him. His lectures are extremely organized, and his slides for the class are extremely clear. Honestly, I'm still using his slides to review for EC16. The tests are definitely hard, and you need to put lots of effort in, but it will worth it. If you just want an easy class, then don't take it with him",1
Nice guy but an awful teacher. Going to class is a huge waste of time considering he doesn't take attendance and all he does is read from the powerpoints. Half the time it seems like he hardly even knows what he himself is talking about. Very unclear when explaining concepts. Practice problems are rare which makes the tests even harder.,0
If you care about your GPA and your mental health do not take his class. he is very rude and random with his attendance by asking a random question to a random person out of the blue. Only grade is midterm and final. Speaks in a low monotone voice and just rambles for three hours  & doesn't cover the material he expects you to know to test over.,0
"She is really vague about what she wants out of your writing. She grades harshly and is picky about wording. A lot of the activities in-class felt like filler assignments. You pick one topic for all of the essays in class. Because of this, you'll find yourself hating your own topic by the second essay. She doesn't like if you disagree w her ideas",0
"I have never had such a terrible professor in my entire college career. I submitted every paper, took every exam, and only missed about 3 classes and I still failed the course. I went to her before every one of my papers were due, for help, and still failed every paper. If you do not agree with her personal beliefs she will fail you!!",0
"He doesn't curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution",0
"I have heard good things about this professor before I took this class. He is an awesome person, but this class needs another professor to teach it! Avoid him at all costs for MIS 300. His lectures (which are fun and interesting and very much off topic) on powerpoint DO NOT MATCH what he tests on. Study the text, have a friend sign you in. Easy A!",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had here, his class is easy, but you still learn allot. He focuses on educating, not testing, wish more teachers were like that here. He doesn't have any probs with late assignments either, within reason. Not bad looking for his age!",1
Since it's a speech class it can be nerve wrecking having to talk in front of the class but she grades pretty loosely. She is really understanding and funny. Definitely not a hard class. She talks about some interesting things and the speeches can be fun.,1
"Dr. Kuss would be a great teacher if he could actually teach. He is a very intelligent man but he paces back and forth while lecturing, he mumbles everything, and he never looks his students in the eye. Worst lectures I have ever been through. You will need the book just to teach yourself all the material.",0
"She's awesome, it's a comfortable environment to really discuss interesting topics. I would take this class again in a heartbeat. She lets the students have her number and you can text her at any time and she will respond very quickly,",1
"Patrick McKean is stuck in his very old ways. It's always his way or the high way. If you ask him for help he won't help you, he'll simply say ""I've already given the instructions you've should have paid better attention"".  I felt like I had to teach myself since he spent his dragging lectures talking about his personal life instead of journalism.",0
Professor Mattson is a great professor. He's really nice and helpful. Just make sure you do your blogposts on time and you'll be golden. I enjoyed his class and met awesome people.,1
"Great instructor! Great stories from a public defender that are a learning experience. Make sure to attend class since all test material will be from lectures, no need to purchase textbook unless you want to. Best instructor and would recommend his class to all those that want to learn Criminal Law.A GREAT TEACHER, wish more were like you...",1
"Jill is probably the most favorite teacher Ive ever had in my life. Knows how to teach exceptionally well and doesnt stop until you really have your skills down. Kind, witty, smart, relatable, caring. Made us very comfortable and gave us a break from the regular nursing program hell! Wonderful.",1
"I took Dr. Ratner for as many classes as I could, and also requested him as my advisor.  His lectures are structured and his notes are easy to read and concise.  If you pay attention and actively participate you should not have a problem.  If you actually want to learn, I would take his classes.",1
Excellent teacher!,1
This class was probably the worst class I have taken at CSUSB.,0
"Taking an online class with Jennie was a bit difficult. She only held office hours one day a week for 2 hours. Although, if you asked for help she would give it to you. She understands that life happens and is easy to work with. She does make you write a lot for tests and homework, but in the end it helps you understand it better than before.",1
"Every time I emailed her, she would take forever and then answer with not helpful information. Literally reads over the power-points and doesnt explain much. Youre pretty much on your own unless you study with a group.",0
Easy going professor. He never gives back your grades or post on Bb. Might seem like an easy A but must keep track of your grade by urself. If not you will get something different from what you think u will get. If u really want to learn spanish not a good choice. Everything mostly take home but make sure to ask what u get!! Be on top of ur grades.,0
"Love her style of teaching. She really cares about her students and tries to make difficult material easy to understand. She wants the class to be fun, and enjoyable, but not an easy ride. Quiz questions come directly from lecture and outlines and test questions come directly from quizzes. Just do your work and you'll be fine.",1
No Comments,0
she expects too much from an online HISTORY class. like girl it's an 8 week course and you want us to put 4 sources in a discussion... bye. dont take her if u can help it,0
Wonderful prof. You will learn a lot if you pay attention. Most of the teaching comes through real world examples. I graduated 3 years ago and he still helps me out from time to time.,1
Gets ready to study hard. If you missed assignments no chance to cover up its done. work hard get good grade else end up with D or C.,1
She did not only teach me what is good in life but also inspired me to do good in life. She is a great professor and a good human being. She contributed heavily to build my life.,1
"He is laid back and if you do the work he assigns to the best of your ability, you will do well. I will be taking more of his classes in the future!",1
"ABSOLUTE BEST PROFESSOR! He is the nicest person, very interested in literature, and cares for his students. He is funny and very intelligent. As long as you try, you will do very well!",1
"Ruder was an okay teacher. My one complaint is that he graded the 2nd half of our project the day that the 3rd part was due, which was not helpful at all. It's like a teacher handing back your rough draft the day the final one is due, and then complaining later that you didn't make any corrections. He is a good teacher, just needs to grade better.",0
"She's a great person don't get me wrong, funny and super nice. But her lectures, she just reads of the powerpoint and her examples do not go in-depth. Her exams are so so so hard in comparison to her lectures. Read the book and know everything in detail before the exam. ",1
Great teacher! Very helpful. If you study the notes you'll ace the test. Don't need to even look in the book or read the chapters to ace exams. Start studying early for Lab Final. Would take a class from him again. Has funny comments during lectures,1
LOVE!!!!! ,1
"I have heard goo things about this professor, but please DO NOT TAKE if you are taking him online. He has no clue how to run and online class and we never meet. We doesn't add any assignment to the D2L calendar, so its a fun game of guess when the next assignment is due, at to top it off he take of 50 POINTS for one day late.",0
"Awesome class, glad I got the chance to meet her.",1
Pretty solid professor for Systems Analysis. Overall the class isn't too difficult. The first half of the semester is pretty frontloaded with a lot of work but it's so you can work on your final project. Would take again.,1
"Interesting topics but not worth it honestly. She is very passionate but lectures the WHOLE time, readings everyday, and only 2-3 tests with a good amount of papers.",0
Shes a great teacher. She teacher very good and grade pretty fair and gives you a lot of feed back. Very professional as well.,1
"This guy is useless. I took his online class and he never helped you and was a real jerk. He felt as if he was invincible when speaking over e-mail. Oh well, what else do you expect when a coach teaches?",0
Not so sure if the class (Moral choices) is just easy. We just do discussions and presentations. Homework once a week. Only midterm and final. Open book only for midterm. Just talk and discuss for most of the class. Can be boring and sleepy sometimes but discussions are so fun. Phones are totally restricted in his class***,1
Great teacher. She doesn't ask for a lot but she is really big on APA. We had a lot of group projects which is pretty cool. She is very understanding and easy to work with.,1
Just had her for health care ethics- one of my new favorite professors at loyola. she knows what she's talking about and easily one of the best lecturers at loyola....take her- it's such a great class!!,1
"Great speaker. Encourages participation and has 3 group assignments. Choose group wisely - they are with you all semester. Make sure to take notes during class reading assignments (Jager, Clear Blue, ect) because they are used on the exam. Easy professor to talk to and ask for help. Bonus - he is pretty cute and has an awesome German accent.",1
"I love Professor Washburn. I could listen to her lectures all day. She always talks about her family, and boyfriend in the context of the material, which really helps make sense of what she is teaching. She is super friendly and warm. She is will always help you in office hours if you are struggling with anything. Take her. You won't regret it!",1
"I really love Prof Reisinger. This class (Voices in Global Health) was not great, but Prof Reisinger did her best to make it better. I strongly recommend open communication with her, because she is willing to meet outside of class and give clear feedback, but you have to seek it out.",1
"Professor Ratner's class is beyond dull. He stands in front of the class and reads off the slides the entire lecture. 3 exams and 1 project. No room for error. His ""curves"" are points reimbursed for mistakes that he made on the exam. He's also pretty inconsiderate, he doesn't care about your situation unless you provide hard proof. Dont recommend.",0
"At first, I dreaded taking this class due to many of the negative ratemyprofessor posts. As it turned out, she was a very understanding and helpful professor -- one of the best I have had at WPU. Yes, you have to read and think critically about the text, but this is college -- that's what is expected of you!",1
"VERY awesome and kind professor. He teaches well, teaches a lot but his exams are ALWAYS what's taught in the class. He reviewed every exam we took the day before the exam and including the final. Final was WAY too hard in my opinion but he will work with the class. If a test is too difficult he will eliminate one question or count as extra credit.",1
"Very easy to take --- tests are not difficult, and the research papers are a piece of cake.",1
"Don't take him for math! He's a computer teacher, not algebra, and he can't explain anything. Despite this he was very nice, made lots of beer jokes, and tried to help as much as possible. He was just not meant to teach math. Only take this if you need math courses beyond it or remember a LOT from high school algebra, otherwise take MATH127. l",0
"First off Chemistry has never been my subject, but taking Dr. Perkins was the best decision I made! He made Chemistry super fun! I never made below a B taking him! Few chapter quizzes, which are open note! 4 test and 1 optional final. His lectures are amazing! He works out problems by hand, so if you're a visual learner he is your best choice!",1
Assigns homework and goes over one little thing and proceeds to talk about it the entire class. I've had to miss a couple classes due to death in my family and she got annoyed with me. I tried emailing her three times and she never read or responded. I even showed up to her office hours and she wasn't there. Safe to say I'm nervous about passing.,0
"In three years at this school as a science major, I've found there are only a handful of good science teachers here. Gerritsen is definitely one. Gives short lectures before lab on the science that we're doing and 90% of the time I didn't understand from class, and after his mini-lecture, I do. My grade would be so much better if he taught lectures",1
"I'm an older returning student, Dr. Turkovic is a gem of an instructor, you will know where you are at grade wise throughout the whole semester, gives extra credit.",1
"He purposely leaves out content in the slides so that you have to go to class. No participation grades. Interesting subject, uninteresting professor.",0
Too much emphasis on group projects. Unclear presentations. Power point after power point.,0
"It's one of those classes where it's supposedly an easy class, but it just isn't. She makes the assignments much more difficult than they actually are, and the instructions are never clear. She's a nice person, she just isn't clear at all which makes her class difficult.",0
"While I don't think I would take the class again just because I wasn't interested in the material, Dr. Ramey is a very understanding and does not try to make his class any harder than it needs to be. You won't have to study very hard for tests if you just show up to class and take the review quizzes.",1
"As head of the GW math department, one would expect a professor who is knowledgeable about Linear Alg and able to help students learn Linear Alg. Half the class dropped after the first midterm, and the professor did not curve the class at all. Professor failed to discuss the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Save yourself the mental headache.",0
"great professor, takes attendance daily , not a lot of homework the practice test is really helpful  participation is encouraged but not mandatory ",1
"Dr. Evans is one of the kindest professors there is. His classes are not the easiest thing in the world and he expects critical thought, so it can be intimidating, but if you communicate with him and create a relationship he will help you. He is very kind and understanding and facilitates great discussion. Best poli sci prof!",1
"You can tell he really loves teaching and it's refreshing and interesting to hear about his life's work. Very accommodating, MUST read or you won't pass. 3 reading quizzes, midterm, final, and a term paper. Highly recommend this professor!",1
"Good guy, know's his stuff, successfully engages individuals in class concepts and conversations.",1
"Outstanding professor!  I have learned so much from him and taken so much away from his classes.  If you pay attention to  his lectures and read the majority of the reading packets/text you will receive an A.  He may go on tangents quite often, but he is one of the best professors I ever had!",1
Taking his online intermediate algebra class is doable even while working full-time. He creates videos which give you the basics and book he uses it helpful. Also forums where students help either is really awesome. I would take him again. Final in person exam you can bring your own 1 page notes. Problems resembled Homework.,1
"Terrible course structure, so disorganized, still shaping the course so prepare for challenges. Nice guy but poor lecturer, EXTREMELY UNCLEAR, treats students like we're writing our PhD thesis, tons of work for small 2-5% grades, 5 blog posts/3 papers/2 presentations/2 reports, the list goes on.... lectures are a waste of time'",0
10/10 would take again. Microsoft god!!!,1
Great!,1
"Really great technically, not so good conceptually.  Wonderful person and really cares about the students/department.  She also has a lot of connections to the outside printmaking world.",1
"She was great! took both of her online classes Anthro 1 and 2 and I love them, especially 1. She cares about her students and is very nice and understanding. Loved everything about the class.",1
He is a wonderful person but as a teacher he is not as good. He gives a lot of notes so be ready to write. His only grades is tests. Although he drops one they are all very hard. He gives study guides and tells you what to study for but most the time what he tells you study is only a few questions where as what he says not to study is all over it.,0
Dr. Beckman clearly has passion for his subject matter and inspires his students. He is the best professor from which I have taken a class. He is always helpful and will go the extra mile for his students. ,1
Ms. Peggy is awesome teacher if you apply yourself you will get an A.,1
"Talks about the same things over and over, but has a exit slip each period over a chapter in the book so you cant skip all the time, otherwise I would. Unnecessary lectures and lots of class participation where everyone around the room says their answer.",0
"I took her for Editing and she is very clear, very into editing and shes also involved with the Paisano. Most hw is out of workbooks and she likes us to bring our small textbook to class. There arent any tests, just quizzes. We had four this year including the final. Overall easy. Takes attendance. three absences is two pts off total average.",1
"Great guy, thinks he's funny but he's actually a really good teacher. I don't like history and he made it semi-interesting half the time. I plan to take him for all my history courses, hopefully I don't have that many left because history is boring. Nice guy though.",1
"He is very good professor for accounting. He write everything on board. He explain everything slow, so no one stays behind. If Final exam grade are grater then all other text he will ignore the other grades. Get ready to take notes. He give study guide for exam which is a great help.",1
Professor Blake will forever be my favorite NOVA professor. This is the second class I have taken of his. I will be taking another class of his. Show up to class and turn in your work. Be respectful during class. He responds to emails fast. He doesn't make class hard.,1
"By far the worst professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking. 100% biased and disrespectful as well as unprofessional. does not care about your grade and does an inadequate job of teaching the material. He basically turned the class into a debate hall and sat back instead of teaching. His averages on every test were horrible, DOESNT TEACH.",0
"Dr. Hanson is a professor who teaches cohesively and honestly.
 
 The class contains a heavy workload of note taking and small and large papers almost weekly. Although it's labeled as a freshman level class, it feels more like an upper division class.
 
 Not recommended to non-History majors as a class to fulfill your History requirement.",1
"I was so intimidated by Professor Swartz at first, but once you get to know him he is such a teddy bear. Dont be scared of the silent lab he gives at the beginning of the year, its meant to scare the ones who arent meant for natural sciences and medicine away. He is super flexible with office hours and helped me with a lot of stuff.",1
"don't take this class with her.  She is out to fail all nursing majors and to crush your dreams.  Also, she was never a nurse herself - only her MOM.  How can she judge other nurses....",0
You are supposed to be in class and if you miss too much she will report it but your camera doesnt need to be on and you dont need to talk so you can just mute her if you want. Lectures make NO SENSE! But you can find everything you need on Quizlet. Shes nice but is not a good teacher. I do not recommend!,0
"She is a PhD student, but she is very good at teaching the materials.  It is an easy class. In order to do well, you need to do all the practice questions at least once, and I guarantee it that you will get perfect score on the tests.  ",1
Eric is not a good teacher. He will have you do all your homework online and he gives a quiz every time your in class and they are timed. He's not helpful.,0
Talks too quietly and has a really thick accent. I asked him THREE TIMES for the answer key to the midterm and still haven't had it. The class isn't too bad but hes just not much of a teacher. If you want a good result study his assignments - his exams are almost exactly the same in format and questions!,0
"Professor Justice is awesome. He has his own blank notes that he posts for discrete mathematics that you can fill in and follow along with in class. His expectations are clear, and he takes his time to answer questions with a calm approach. I highly recommend him to my peers.",1
Hes' a good guy. Pretty funny and laid back but be super prepared cuz there's A LOT of reading. he's pretty good at lecturing and kind of bringing people in. but that gets off track sometimes. Some students found him kind of intimidating. He's travelled like everywhere and talks about that a lot. I learned a lot from him.,1
A great teacher. He tries very hard to make sureeach and every student understands. HE is helpful outside of class as well.,1
Larson is a great professor! I recommend taking as many courses with him as possible. Content is super beneficial and he is a great guy.,1
Very laid back teacher. He explains everything clear and precise. The class is pretty boring but tries to make it fun. Simple class.,1
She is literally perfect in every way.,1
"This is a difficult class, but George is excellent. He uses different teaching methods to ensure the lessons are learned.",1
Shaikh Karim is lovely. he explains Arabic well. I like him. I hope to marry him and become Muzlim. Love you teacher KOKO!,1
"Lauries class is very easy. You should definitely show up as the online quizzes are very very easy if you have notes. Questions are taken directly from what she says in class. No homework, just 4 (easy) essays and 5 (25 Qs) quizzes thats are all online. And no final!",1
"The top ISOM prof. at GMU. Took him for MIS310. Homework, quizzes and exams are challenging, but as long as you attend the class and read the slides, you will get a good grade. In my time at mason, I never learned as much as I did in this class. If you get a class with him, you are in luck. His seats are in high demand. I would highly recommend.",1
"She is definitely passionate about polisci. Definitely do the reading as much as you can and HAVE A STUDY GROUP. It will make things more easier if you have a study group. I won't lie, the work does seem extra at times but, you will definitely learn in her class, so that I give her credit from.",1
"Legend and likeable. The one freebie class first year. Easy assignments, but you don't learn much.",1
nice prof,1
Good prof.  Lectures are detailed and his exam reviews are exactly are what on the exams.  Grading criteria is high (88 is an A) but does everything he can to get you there.  Two projects are worth more than the three exams (15% each). Buy the textbook as he takes terms directly from there and puts on the exams.,1
"You have to take responsibility and put some effort into this class, otherwise you won't do well. Listening to the lectures is not enough: you have to read the chapters, take notes, and study. Use flashcards for key concepts: it helps. Daigle is a good professor, and he's willing to work with you, but only if you put forth the effort.",1
"I took her summer class; it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be! She definitely cares about her student's success! Show up to class every day, complete the homework, complete her reviews, and you'll do fine. She's willing to help you pass, but you HAVE to do your part!",1
"Prof. Kumari had one of the most enjoyable online classes I have ever taken! Her expectations are clear, each Module structure is easy to follow and understand, and she provides personalized feedback. The course itself is tough, but Prof. Kumari offers generous extra credit, and no proctored exams for this class. Would definitely take again!",1
"Erik tells you he is the hardest English Comp250 teacher on campus on day 1 and hands you a 10 page syllabus, and yes, you will do everything you see on that syllabus.  That said he is fun to talk to, loves his subject, and will proof read essays before grading them during office hours if you take the time to see him.He'll make you a better writter",1
One of the best teachers I've ever had. I could listen to him lecture for hours. The analogies he uses are easy for anyone to understand. His clarity is unbeatable. He has the best way of explaining things that otherwise would be hard for some people to grasp. I STRONGLY recommend taking one of his classes.,1
Dr. Maril makes class super interesting. He doesn't use power points because his class is mainly open discussion based on facts. I would take him again just because I actually wanted to go to this class. He made it interesting and he was straight forward about whats going to be on the test. Make sure the take notes on the discussions and youll pass,1
Fantastic! My favorite teacher so far at UB. Nice guy. Very good at keeping students interested. Easy tests. Couldn't ask for better.,1
"Professor Aguilar is terrible. She gives so much homework, her lectures are ramblings, she does not ever speak about the assignments. She is a rough grader but if you feel you deserve a higher grade she does listen and if you make a good argument she will bump it up. Be ready to read and to do A LOT of writing. She does not make directions clear.",0
"Dr. Zarb is one of the best professors in the College of Business at Embry-Riddle.  While the subject matter is kind of boring, he does a good job at keeping you interested.  He makes me wish I were as enthusiastic about this stuff as he is!  Awesome guy.",1
"Swint is a really good professor. He's pretty interesting most days and has a low key, pretty chill approach. He's also pretty funny, which makes it easier to come to class.Take good notes and don't miss too many classes.",1
"I had a lot of good things to say about Russell, but they've been clouded by how she correlates eagerness to use quarantine productively with having all the time in the world. Course never had a set schedule (we don't know in advance what to read, when to meet, etc.) until 18 hours prior. Made life miserable & quarantine time even more uncertain.",0
"Mrs. Perez isn't bad as she's described here. I do agree with others who say she is tough bc she is, but what most ppl don't understand is you actually have to actively read to understand the material. It's not a hard course. It takes discipline to properly prepare for any class. If you genuinely want to take this class for its content, go ahead",1
"Hands down, one of the most inspirational teachers I've ever had! She truly cares about her students and helps them succeed. Her lectures are highly engaging, which encourages genuine student participation. Even if you're shy or have an adverse view, her class is a safe space that welcomes students to express themselves without judgment. TAKE HER!",1
When she lectures you'll have zero clue what she's talking about. She will go rant about anything she feels like and its not related to Sociology at all. As long as you show up for attendance points and print out material she emails out for exams you'll be fine. It's an easy A but I don't understand how she's a professor at YSU.,0
"Alice is so nice! You can tell she genuinely enjoys teaching and loved her students. She's very kind and motherly, but can still be stern. One of the best teachers I've had.",1
Prof. Abdallah is an amazing lecturer and I cannot emphasize enough on his teaching style. His blended teaching style with the online system is incredible. He is very caring and accommodates to the difficulties we face very well. His marking is fair and is straight up the best prof ever.,1
Was a great professor!,1
"Professor Crumpler is super sweet, nice, and caring. He has a huge heart, and wants everyone to do well. He is a nice person",1
"The guy is a total scatterbrain, he lost several of my assignments.  He mostly follows directly from the readings but the prompts for the papers are often vague, confusing, or just poorly written/worded.  Overall, he has a very dry and far from engaging speaking style.  I would NOT recommend taking this class with this guy.",0
One of the best teachers in U of M. Her enthusiasm in teaching the material is contagious and has definitely sparked my interest in pursuing medical anthropology.  ,1
"David is extreme boring and unorganized. He makes 9am lectures a snooze fest when all he does is read off of the slides.  His assignments have not been modified since 2009 and his required readings are just way too much. Course is great, the prof not so much",0
"This class was my earliest class, but the class I wanted to attend the most.  Professor Nurick makes each class interesting because he is very funny and tells really good stories.  There are no tests in this class, only three papers, and he grades very fair.  I only read my textbook as I was writing my papers, and I got a 4.0 on all three!",1
"decent teacher, but he is really strange with grades.  It seems like he just pulls a grade point average out of a hat to determine your grade.  Makes you believe you are doing better than you actually are as well.",0
"Wonderful professor! My only complaint is at times she can be too easy to pass. If you are not self motivated to learn the material, you can still get an A with very little effort while learning very little. Otherwise, helpful with good lectures and very easy to talk to. ",1
"Would NOT recommend taking any class with Eric. He does not teach well, few examples, would rather talk about off subject topics. He will grade you well if he likes you as a student, otherwise you fail. One of the worst professors out there.",0
"We rarely had class due to his absences, which made it very hard to understand his unorganized lecture notes. Class was long and dragging, and don't expect to know what your grade is until after finals. He openly insults all questions, and never gets us feedback in a timely fashion. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"This professor may be ok in person but DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS It is so hard I literally can't get over a 70 on her quizzes. She gives no extra credit, and is not helpful at all!!!",0
very good teacher. recommend to all!,1
Very good teacher!,1
"Great professor, great feedback and easily accessible outside of class times",1
"If looking for a class to learn, but not too hard - you found your professor. Not too much work, nor was it hard as long as you have your book. She explain thoroughly and great reviews for tests. Extra Credit available & willing to help & work with you. I also took the class during the Stoneman Douglas tragedy & she was very supportive. Take her.",1
"Pretty straight forward and you can tell she cares about the class and subject, great teacher.",1
This was a great class! All of the readings and assignments we had were interesting and thought provoking. Professor Tisdale was also super sweet and easily accessible outside of class. I would take this class again or any other taught by her.,1
"She is the best Phil professor.  Your grade is composed of 4 forum debates, 4 essays, a midterm, final, and participation. She is there to help you succeed. Go to office hours and she'll give really good feedback. Really really great professor.",1
Wonderful teacher. Makes class fun. Material starts easy but it's more deficult so you need to attend class. He does talk fast and it's kind of hard to take notes. Lets you use the formula sheet with your own calculator notes during the tests. All homework is done online.,1
"Professor Aviles-Santiago was extremely helpful over the semester. The class was fun and interesting, he was flexible with assignments and went out of his way to help me succeed in this course. I would definitely take a class from him again. ",1
dread going 2 that class. doesn't talk about anything that is on the tests just talks about 1 topic for more than 3 weeks at a time but than expects you 2 know all that is on the quiz/tests. extremely boring and has too many readings. each assignment is doing a reading from each book which makes things a little confusing. DONT GET HER FOR A TEACHER,0
Professor Vutha makes math quite easy. His lectures keep you engaged and he devotes extra time on the weekends for review sessions where you can ask him to cover the more difficult concepts. By far the best math professor I've ever had. The math department needs to promote him.,1
Joy V'Marie gave me the inspiration necessary for me to go on to earn my Masters Degree.,1
"She is very nice, personally I thought it was a lot of work for being a 105, but if you put in the effort you should do fine. Written response due every class & also a quiz. She gives a lot of reading-can be different plays for the same day. Make sure you get started on the group project early because it is a skit & you have to memorize your lines!",1
"I've taken Will's class from LFS250 to 350 and found myself lucky for not required to take LFS400. He is the most unaccessible teacher ever in my whole school life. No email response, and he's not willing to help students.",0
"Professor Wigginton knowns her stuff really good which is good, but not so much for the student. She definitely teaches like you are a graduate student but it is an upper division course. I only relied on the powerpoints and somehow managed, I would not recommend it as the quizzes HEAVILY rely on the textbook.",1
Farzin Irani is a great professor. We did our quizzes and case studies online on mindtap. The quizzes are based directly from the book so you cant go wrong. You will get an A if you put the time into the class. She knows a lot about psychology. ,1
"Awful teacher! Rude, unprofessional, & completely uninterested in teaching this class. No wonder people don't enter the field of sp. ed! Dresses in tacky attire. Does not teach, prefers to read from ppts. Makes Ben Stein sound like an awesome public speaker. Yes, her voice is THAT bad! Not clear in assignment expectations. HCC should be ashamed!!!",0
"Precalculus is a ridiculously hard class so do yourself a favor and take it with Ryburn. She is so nice and always willing to work with you. She gives great feedback and actually cares about her students passing, no that doesn't mean its an easy A so be prepared to put in work!",1
"I dreaded this class every day! The class was so unorganized and not very interesting at all. The tests were common sense and never opened the book. As long as you go to class you will do fine on the tests. Marty is very credible and has a lot of accolades, but the other professor I had, You Li, was nice but not a good teacher.",0
"Literally the best professor I've ever had, and one of the most astoundingly interesting lecturers I've ever experienced. ",1
"took her for kickboxing, super fun. got a good sweat, she's funny and makes you feel comfortable. Lots of extra credit if you miss classes",1
"I loved this class. Animation is not the easiest thing in the world to master in one semester, but this was a great intro class and I can't wait to take another advanced class with this instructor.",1
"Great teacher! Very kind wantS her StudentS to paSS ! Read chapter, write two page paper due at the end of the week. USe turnitin, informal writing baSed on material and opinion.",1
Kinda awkward but funny. he can be a bit random at times. homework everyday and a straightforward guy. You don't understand something ask and he explains. Good professor hope to take him next semester for 121.,1
"AMAZING teacher! I'm trying to take his class again this semester! I took this class in person, so it was super simple! He has a great outlook on life.",1
I have taken him for microbiology twice. He has improved so much. I was worried at first but i am so glad i took his class. He is a great guy! Show up to lecture and study. You will do fine.,1
"Todd is a great professor but since he is so confident in the material he's teaching sometimes it's discouraging to sit through lectures when you don't understand the material yourself.  Three exams, four assignments and a 5 page paper - overall, would recommend taking this class with him.",1
I can not say enough good things about Dorthea Michael (aka Mama Michael). She makes lectures interesting and includes class discussions. I took Prof. Dorthea's ENGL 051 class first. The following semester I went out of my way to make sure that I would be in her ENGL 101 class. All I can say is TAKE ANY CLASS WITH DORTHEA! You won't regret it.,1
Paul can come off as a bit stoic at first. This is not true at all. He cares about his students and is very accommodating. He is willing to set times up outside of class to meet and go over things. Paul expects improvement and pays attention to pronunciation and grammar. So practice before oral exams and have a Dane run through your essays.,1
"One of the best professors I've yet to meet. If you don't pass her class, it's because you didnt try, or didn't attempt to read the book. If you have questions, it is imperative that you ASK her bc she will do what she can to help you. Some people say she is intimidating,  but she just means well. She gives quizzes every or every other week, STUDYY",1
She is a great teacher.  Makes you think outside the box a lot.  Plus you don't need the text book!,1
"An enthusiastic teacher. He tries to make sure everyone understands the material and is very helpful in office hours. He does rush at times. His test are easy if you do the hw however, the material for phys331 is difficult. THe only way to pass is to keep up with the readings and lectures. Compared to other phys profs he is slightly above average.",1
I really do not like the way that Mr. Dasgupta teaches. You really have to teach yourself everything to get an A in this class.,1
Prof Partovi is a very knowledgeable lecturer and can be surprisingly witty. Can come off as intimidating but really cares about your learning and success. Good use of media in lectures. Be warned: he has terrible handwriting! Heavy reading but not impossible. Participation in class is required. Was patient and accommodating during Covid-19 crisis.,1
"This class is very easy if you go to class and pay attention. The material is not hard to understand. If you dont understand, he will help you understand. Very great class and professor!",1
He lectures the entire class period and is very boring! He is very scatter-brained and goes off on random stories about his life. His tests are very hard!! and there is a lot of memorization and reading involved! but he did give you study guides for the tests.. that were 30-40 pages long! definitely dont recomend!!,0
Do not get me wrong English 1020 is the definition of boring and basic however this professor exceeds even that. Not only was she rude to certain students but she treated us all like we are in 2nd grade. Every class was mandatory and if you are not the best writer don't go to her for help because chances are you would be even  leaving.,0
"Ala is amazing! Physics is a hard subject but if you put in the work youll definitely pass! She was always more than willing to help me. Utilize her office hrs! Shes also extremely caring and makes her lectures fun! Take her, you wont regret it!",1
"Vague rubrics for projects which sucks, but he had good availability outside of class.  Funny, interesting lectures, he seemed to actually like teaching so that was great!",1
"She is a good teacher, and well organized. She grades relatively fast, but at the end it was a little slow. You know about all the assignments before school start, because she emails you. She is kind, but does not take late assignments so please do your work. She give ample time to do them for the most part.",1
"He is an okay professor, but he is terrible with technology and told us no to email him. He definitely knows his stuff, but he is just not cut out for teaching. ",0
"This is a computer class, but you have to write 10-20 page papers and use a pencil on paper tests. The homework is extremely tedious and long, and is not weighed fairly at all. For example: I spend about 10 hours on a lab (which consumed my whole day), and I only got 5 points for it. The class has 500 total points. Lectures are very boring too.",0
"Prof. Brown really cares about his class/students. Go to class BEWARE everything was graded based on participation and then the Midterm came out of left field, he was SUPER critical. Do the creative option - he's less harsh than the analytical. Great lectures, but he gets bird-trailed a lot. Would recommend. He also is very into indigenous culture.",1
"An excellent teacher. Although your entire grade is based on essays, and although she's a hard grader, she is so nice and down-to-earth that you HAVE to fall in love with her. She is also extremely helpful, whenever you need something just ask.",1
Prof. Rich was the most down to earth professor at York I've met so far. Very approachable. Very funny. Lectures are fun to attend and material is presented and taught in an engaging way. A grade of 'A' is achievable through use of textbook for exams--READ WHAT SHE TELLS YOU TO. Lectures will also be on the in-class tests.,1
"Discrete Structures is a boring course made even more dry by Ratana Ngo's somewhat robotic teaching style. He really tries to make sure the class understands, but his presentation leaves many falling asleep.",0
"I wouldn't say the class is easy, but if you do the work you will get an A. 2 Homework, 2 reading assignments and a quiz every week but its not super hard. 3 exams and 3 discussions, none of which I would consider hard, you just have to be willing to put in the time and effort.",1
"I took the 468 topics course in Environmental Cultural Studies and loved it! Kata was really flexible and obviously really into the subject matter. The class was discussion based and there was a lot of reading. There was no textbook to buy, just mountains of articles to read but they were all really interesting so I never really minded it. ",1
"His class is really fun to be in. He tries to make sure that every student understands the lessons, and will challenge you to speak to him in as much Japanese that you can. I took the May term for 102 with him, and manage just fine even though the course was intense.",1
"What's not to like?  We learn about things we requested from a survey of topics, we watch and talk about films that are fun and interesting, we discuss topics as a class (Not just lecture) and watch clips from good movies and if you do your work you get an A. Class was really great!",1
"He only assigns two tests and 4 essays, so you only have a few assignments all semester to make your grade. As long as you attend almost every class and put effort into your papers, you should pass. He also never cancels class and assigns a bunch of reading, but it isn't that bad. He is really helpful and a good professor though. I'd recommend him.",1
It was all Greek to me. When he teaches he expects you to know everything there is to know about Finance when the class is supposed to be an Introduction to Finance. He made it harder than it had to be.,0
He's such a cutie and funny.,1
"He gives you everything, its up to the student to do the things he assigns. He responded fast and questions were not difficult. Perfect 201 level class.",1
"Excellent teacher.Made hard subject bearable.Read the text as well as powerpoints, especially for the FINAL!She's not bad to look at either..funny/goofy personality.Ashame this is her last semester at MC3!Recommend!",1
Such a sweet teacher. Just do your assignments and pass. Not much else to do.,1
"Tells you the first day that you should quit your job or drop all of your other classes and just have his for the semester! He expects your to study minimum 2-3 hours a day. If you're 100% that you'll be in the medical field, then take it. A lot of people dropped his class within the first week. He made me feel like a dumb college student.",0
"Class notes are scattered like the lectures.  He can't stay on point and jumps info all over the place.  Took his class for part of my nursing, no nursing info was taught.  I don't know anything more than when I started except about fermentation which he must like.",0
"Required attendance, but the class is minimally stimulating unless social work is your major. My major was social work, but this class is what made me change my mind.",1
"Ms Carter is a great teacher. She is professional and discusses the material only required for the class. She will help if needed. She tries to make sure everyone understands the subject. She gives notes and reviews for every quiz and exam. Don't try to take advantage of her. If you think it's going to be an easy A, it's not. You have to earn it!",1
she is very nice and caring however you must work for your grade. you must study. ,1
"Dr. Miller's classes are purely lecture/lab exam based with ability to gain 1 extra credit point per chapter finished through critical thinking questions. Exams are tough - from every detail of the textbook and lecture. He wants students to find their own way to study and learn, but is available outside of class for any questions.",1
"Dr. Hanson's great.  He's helpful, passionate about what he teaches, and he's willing to help his students.  He can be a bit intimidating at first, but he is so smart and has this really great ""intellectual"" sense of humor.  He requires a lot of work, but if you do it you will really learn a lot.",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. Joyal.  His lectured kept me very captivated and he was extremely crystal in explaining details and would be very fluent in the topics discussed.Very easy to approach in office hours but best to ask him in lecture if you can visit him in his office.  Very long tests, make sure to listen carefully in lectures and you'll be good",1
"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations. Boring, hard to listen to sometimes, somewhat opinionated. She is a good person at heart though, and you will see that very quickly in the class. Does give help if asked. Do not call after 10. ",0
"The professor is a legend ! Teaches like magic, explains the most difficult concepts like butter.",1
Highly interactive class. Cares for his students.,1
the best professor i have had in college so far..hes hilarious wish i had him every year,1
great teacher she makes the students feel comfortable in her class and she is a geat person to be around.,1
Awesome Prof!,1
Prof. Engelhardt is a very knowledgeable professor. His class is very lecture heavy and he organizes his lectures a bit differently. His exams were quite challenging and you will definitely have to apply yourself. I'd recommend reading the textbook and doing the practice exams. There are 3 exams. You get a cheat sheet and the final grade is curved!,1
"CHEM 205 is a heavy course, but Dr. Rogers makes it bearable. Fantastic lecturer, and is very clear as to what will be on exams. Practice her past midterms and finals, study her lecture slides, do OWL practice problems, and most importantly, show up to all of her lectures. Rogers wants her students to succeed and is definitely a top-tier prof.",1
"First time taking this professor. Above all, I learned a lot about Spanish literature and its awesome writers. It always involve the students hard work in order to get an A. Dr. Hess  is knowledgeable and makes the class interesting and funny. I highly recommend her.",1
Tony Bass is awesome! His online class last semester was great!,1
He is so rude. He yells and slams his hands on the table if you don't understand the material. His test suck and his study guides are horrible. Do not take his class.,0
"Christoph is a great professor! He is super approachable during and outside of class and really wants the best for his students. At times he can be a strict grader but he really wants to see the best for his students. Lastly, 452 is one of the hardest resec classes and Christoph does the best at explaining everything",1
"Shef is the man. Clear study guides for midterm and final which reflect each other. gives you a chance to argue your own participation grade. lots of reading and writing, but so are all UNF history classes at this level. Tough grader on the paper, but very fair all around. 2 5 page papers that both require you to read 3 books each (yes, read)",1
"Probably one of the best teachers i have ever had, the class is not hard to understand and it is easy to pass if you just study. He is very understanding, he says he doesn't do extra credit, but there are plenty of extra credit opportunities. The quizzes are mostly short answer and he will count off if it is not the exact definition or missspelled",1
"Dr. Vutha is by far my favorite professor ever. He honestly cares about each and every student and wants them to succeed. The class is difficult due to the math department. A weekly quiz, homework, and five exams made up the course. Dr. Vutha does everything he can to prepare you for exams. We need more teachers like him. Take this course with him.",1
She is the worst teacher ever! Sucks you have to take this crap!,0
He is an excellent instructor! I've taken a couple classes with him and he is truly dedicated to teaching the subject. You will never encounter a type of problem you haven't already solved and he really gives you the tools to build a solid math foundation.,1
LOVED having her! Tells great stories...very easy to get along with.,1
If you havent been in math recently make sure this is your only class in the semester. There is a good amount of work but its fair.,1
"Teaches decently with good examples that help with understanding. Very engaging with the class and is very helpful and accommodating outside of class. Only downfall is the exams are very challenging and points are assigned heavily. The exams really bring your grade down, even when all other material reflects understanding.",1
"Yvonne looks for passion, and creativity. Show interest in the subject and show up to class and you will have her respect.  There is a million humanities classes at normandale, talk to her why you choice this one.  She will be understanding and lenient on grading if you talk to her about it, but she does have basic expectations.",1
"Nice professor. Classes are really relaxed, he lectures on some interesting topics and relates to students well. Fairly easy course (as it is a lower division GE)...few reaction papers (1-2 pages) quizzes and tests are pretty easy if you go to class (though a lot of the course is common sense, or easy to absorb). Great professor.",1
Worst professor I have ever had!,0
She was a super great ENGL 100 prof! She gives very good feedback so you know exactly what you are doing wrong. She had a weekly forum or zoom meet (you only had to do one). There was a lot of reading but it was worth it and the essays are fairly open topic (lots of topic choice). She also answers emails within a day.,1
"Take this laboratory for BIOL1406 if possible. As long as you attend and turn in labs, you are sure to pass. Mrs. Zitrick clarifies and provides additional information which is helpful to the lecture as well. If you communicate with her, she is very responsive. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1
"Outstanding instructor. Knows her stuff, and very dedicated to the success of her students.  ",1
"Great class, I would take her again. Clear on requirements although there aren't too many. She had a lot of experience and it shows in lectures. Show up and you have to take notes, but I liked the class a lot.",1
This teacher rarely assigns homework and has a take home midterm and final. Only asks that people pay attention during class and participate.,1
"He is not the worst or best. You will have to work for you grade and spend hours on math homework so be prepared. There will be days you will multiple assignments due and some days you will have 0. Get in the mindset to put in the work and you will pass. Will it be an A or B? Most likely not, but you will pass if you do the work.",0
"Took 446 with him and LOVED it. Awesome course and materials. Want to take 494 but now have learned he is not teaching it. Ah man, terrible. Other students disappointed too. We respect him for his teaching prowess. Also because he catches plagiarizers. I wish others would teach w/ academic rigor like him. Thank you Dr. Alderete, a role model..",1
"I felt like I was getting a lot out of the text/discussion boards until I took the midterm which completely plummeted my grade. I'm a senior, and an A student. Studied very hard for this test. Questions are very tricky. I didn't feel like the exam was testing my knowledge, but rather, trying to trick me.",0
I don't understand what he says half the time. He looks like he knows his stuff but he does not seem to be able to teach us the material. Disorganised. The lectures are difficult to follow.,0
I got an a but you have to buy the textbook!,1
Super perky and enthusiastic about the class.,1
Professor Hayes is a excellent instructor because I was able to take the knowledge I acquired in class and  integrate it into my day to day life.,1
Suck,0
"Interesting class, im majoring in cj and his class is great for beginners, no hw and open book tests! there is a fieltrip to a prison but i didnt mind. overall i enjoyed the class and i would take him again.",1
"One of the most lenient math teachers ever! If you understand the topic but mess up the numbers, she will still give you full credit! Take home test really help in this class because the material is so thick. Take her if you can for any math class. Kind of goes fast, but in Diff Eq there is way too much material, especially for a summer class.",1
"I was honestly worried about taking this class because it's notoriously hard, but it isn't that bad. You have three HTML coding assignments for your website, a midterm and a final. The tests are pretty difficult, requires you to really read the book and study. Part of them are hard multiple choice and then coding. She does offer extra credit.",1
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
"I liked this class and the topic was really interesting. She really involves her students and lets them talk about what they feel relates to the topic. Since it is child development, there are people who have their own experiences (own kids, cousins, nephews, nieces) and its always interesting to have a group conversation with Athena.",1
"Hilarious- keeps class interesting/worth attending. Hard topic- must study + do hw. Labs + bonus hw saved my grade. Very helpful, reminded us often of hw + tests. Attendance mandatory to pass, doesn't post slides online. Appreciates students who participate. Keeps it real with grades and life. Made accounting bearable. Can't find a better teacher.",1
Gives homework on stuff he was not able to cover in class. Expects you to get 100% of homework done or he'll give you F on your midterm.  Dropped class & fighting to get my money back which is a pain with Delta.,0
"One of the best courses I've taken at TC, one of the best teachers I""ve encountered at TC.",1
"Its definitely intimidating and overwhelming at first. But follow every tutorial she has, step by step and you will make an A, plus bonus point if you do it all right the first time. If not, shell tell you to fix it and give you full credit after. Failed the midterm but aced the final. 3 assignments, 2 tests and EC! Quizlet helps for the final!",1
"She's the nicest professor I've ever had! The layout of her courses may be unusual, but she really does try to look out for students best interests. Do the readings. They are very important. Also her lectures might be a little boring, but she really is very knowledgable and you learn a lot by doing all the assigned readings. Loved it!",1
Love this guy but the material is tough. He really tries to help students btter understand.Although there are a million students taking the class (about 250 avg).He scales so thats always a plus!,1
"He is great lab professor. Seems really scary at first, almost made me cry. But after the first two labs he is super nice and will really dedicate his time to help you learn. Lab write ups require a lot of time, they consumed most of my semester. Swartz is almost always in the lab to answer any questions you have though.",1
Such a nice person! Very understanding of challenging circumstances in a pandemic.,1
"Jill is a wonderful professor who truly cares about her students. The class is extremely difficult and dense, but she makes it fun and is there for you. I had a very difficult time learning to ""think like a nurse"" in this first semester, but really started to get it by the end of the term! Would definitely take her again.",1
The subject is not horrible with him but you need to go to lecture because he adds a lot to the slides during lecture. What he writes on the white board has a VERY high chance of being on the exams. He gives 'study guides' that are quiet vague but if you find the answers then you are great for the test. Not entertaining but very knowledgable.,1
"Professor Kim is very kind and really tries to help you understand the content to the best of her abilities. Going to class is a must for language development, and the class will become difficult if you don't go. She is very understanding when it comes to late work and the works.",1
Great teacher learned alot of things about sports which i love,1
"she condescending and a showoff. i dont she realizes that some of the students are only there cause their major requires a writing intensive course. she expects ivy league work from average students. the readings are dry as the Sahara desert, its like pulling teeth. she will call you out if she knows you dont like her. she has spies everywhere!",0
He is literally my favorite professor here! He is very understanding and lenient and willing to work with you! He is very passionate and facilitated amazing discussions that make you think deeply and critically about things you may have never even thought about! Definitely take a class with him at UR!,1
"She was not able to answer a lot of questions from students because she was  not able to understand them. When she doesn't understand your question, she makes other students to explain, which is sometimes inaccurate and hard to understand because they are also puzzled by inadequate explanation.",0
"One of the finest Professors on this campus. You will work hard, and you will learn. He is an open book and will answer any question you have from the course to the India culture and religion. I respect him because he cares, talks from his heart, and shoots straight. You may not like his opinions, but they are coming from a very intelligent man.",1
"Prepare to do a lot of reading 150+ pgs a week. You have 10 quizzes, 3 journals, 5 discussions, and a 10-15pg final paper. It's a ton of work, but it's something you can use in everyday life.",1
"Took Business Calc summer class and she was a terrible teacher. Didnt care if you understood the material or not, she just had her agenda. When students asked questions she answered in a way that put them down and that made students afraid to ask questions if they didnt understand a problem. Overall she was not good and strict grader.",0
"Really, really awful professor. He's intelligent, but not at all helpful, and doesn't really want to make things helpful.",0
"I had taken 13 years of French before and placed into 101 because I wanted an easy A (I don't recommend this in 101 levels you have class 4 times a week instead of 2 or 3). I was comfortable with the subject matter so I skipped class a lot, she doesn't take attendance. Assigns a lot of busy work and keeps you until the end of class. Nice lady.",1
"Christy is a great teacher. She's really nice and is always willing to sit and make sure you know what she's explaining. She can be blunt and specific sometimes, but just ask for help and fix your errors. If you do so you'll do fine.",1
"Nelson is a great professor.  The paper is tricky, so you must be creative. DO NOT MISS LECTURE, ever. I loved this class so much that Arch. History is going to be my minor.  Take this class!",1
I loved this class and Im not even a History major. He is super nice and understanding and I thought his lectures were very interesting. Only Midterm and Final with four 1-2 page responses on books we read. (super easy) I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a fun class and very little homework.,1
"Amazing Professor, show up to class; study the notes for an easy A!",1
"I took this class as a Hybrid course, half online/in person. I have to be honest, her personality is intense but if you get to know her, she's a sweet person. Just get your work done and don't miss class. Expect quizzes every week. The questions aren't hard, answers can be found directly in the textbook (even online). I recommend online.",1
"He is a wizard in mathematics, I personally used to think maths is hard, but he made it way easier than I thought. he uses more than one method to teach, so its left for you to choose what you are comfortable with. He is a good listener and very patient. There is a lot of homework and assignments but he will give you time to do it. Lots of fun.",1
great teacher! so helpful!!=),1
"Hands down, the best professor I have ever had. Her assignments are fun and engaging, but they are a bit time consuming. She is a strict grader, but teaches all the material well. She takes into account the students' opinions on assignment deadlines, and homework. Absolutely take her if you get the chance. She's an amazing educator.",1
"So much reading and memorization for a level 200 course. Quizzes are open book, yet they are built to trick you. The final exam is on all course content which is 15 weeks of slideshows, videos, articles and textbook. Teachers are nice but they don't realize how difficult they made this course especially as an elective. Would not recommend at all.",0
"Easy to understand, but he is a bit lazy... haha",1
Many guest lecturers from MAE department.  Kept things interesting.,1
"easy to get a good grade if you follow her instructions and show up in the class. attendence is IMPORTANT!!!!i guess she mark it every class. lecture is a little bit boring, repeating ESLI things, the LITTLE BROWN HANDBOOK is more useful than her",1
"He is a great professor that is very passionate about what he teaches. He uses clickers to take attendance during class, but it only counts for a small percentage of your grade. A lot of the material covered for the exams can be found in the textbook.",1
"If you are looking for a CGS professor, take her you will not be sorry. She is so sweet and understanding and literally helped me through every single problem I had. Yes the work load is sort of heavy but that's for every CGS class you take. She even goes the extra mile to walk you through the steps in class and she genuinely cares that you learn.",1
Professor Romani is one of the best hpe teachers they have at ccc. She loves what she does. She teaches in a way that is fairly easy to grasp and makes sure you know the material before moving on. She knows what shes talking about. Doesnt like when youre late so be on time. Take notes and youll pass the class. Tests are on what she lectures about,1
"Hes a good teacher, very willing to help, easy grader. but you do have to study for his tests. the tests come EXACTLY from the HW and book examples! GO TO CLASS",1
Awesome and Friendly Guy.  Brings a lot of current situations and news to the table to make things interesting besides just reading the boring old textbook.  If you're looking to take a HR or Communications Class. I recommend Woodcock A++,1
"Do NOT take this professor. I don't care if you have to wait a semester; it is not worth it. You will not have a good time with this guy, even if you think you are an awesome student. No study guides, just burns through formulas with very little explanation, no curve, no extra credit, easy to fail tests, and is kind of condescending.",0
"Professor Dunham is quintessential of what an instructor should be. FSCJ has indeed strengthened its faculty with him as a member. He is ready, willing and accessible to assist the student with questions or concerns. He gives a positive direction for the student to obtain satisfactory results. Simply put, Professor is truly a real gem, awesome.",1
"Kata's take on environmental studies in the hispanic world is one of the most engaging Spanish classes I've taken at UW. Great balance of readings/documentaries for pre-class preparation; the class is mostly discussion based. Kata is both passionate for the material and compassionate for her students. Truly wonderful class, even though it's online.",1
"The tests ARE HARD! They are essay question formatted and if you aren't specific about every little detail you are going to fail. He grades extremely tough and he as a professor is extremely tough and opinionated. You CAN NOT miss his class. And I thought he was funny for about a day.. This is NOT an easy A, or B.",0
"Take Ms. Hays; you will not regret it! She's very sweet, and makes learning easy. There are 5 tests. If you come to the chapter review, then you are sure to ace the test. Unless you are trying to fail the class, then you can easily end up with an A+ in her class. I learned a lot and found the class very interesting!",1
"Had Dr. Kim for O-chem Lab and loved her. Wish I had taken her over knight for lecture because apparently she grades more easily. In the lab, she's very attentive to students questions and keeps a close watch over  everything to ensure that everyone is doing things correctly. Lab Exams are surprisingly tough. know the structures of lab compounds.",1
I wish I would have taken another professor to be perfectly honest.,0
"I love the hands-on assignments, but I hate how she doesn't show/tell students what notes to take. One time, I didn't know that we had an assignment due which she handed a month ago, but she managed to let me turn it in late and I still received an A!",1
"By far the worst teacher I've ever had. She thinks she's a good teacher... but she's not. She begins every class by telling us we suck and that its our fault for not understanding the material. From a student that has attended every class, I can say shes terrible. Lot's of work, never a break. Maybe if this is your only class you can succeed.",0
"Too Many notes and are not specific too test. Flash cards did not help, had to read book over and over again. Test questions do not at all reflect what he goes over or focuses on.  demoralizing and threatening. Most students dropped  psyches everyone. Tells us to quit our jobs . threatened extra credit if we did not retake a test I pass already.",0
"We did easy science labs in this class. Now I know some simple experiments to do with my 3rd graders. This class is not that hard, you just have to keep on top of the material.",1
"The class is easy enough, she's very clear about the characters she wants you to create and there's a big group critique at the end of every character makeup application you'll do for her and she gives good feedback.",1
"My favorite professor. I learned a lot, and I never felt stressed in this class. His lectures are interesting, and I honestly wanted to come to class. There were 3 mandatory paper, and an extra credit 4th paper. Use peer-reviewed sources on papers. Absolutely no reading or homework required. I love Dr. Solari, highly recommend!",1
"I absolutely loved Jose! Amazing and inspirational! Great lectures and truly made me excited to come to class everyday! I took so much from this class, HIGHLY recommend !",1
The most thorough lectures I've ever seen. He manages to cover every type of homework problem/test problem you're going to see. Always go to class and I recommend re-tracing through his lectures (from your notes) before you start homework assignments.,1
"its her first time teaching, she's very caring, and if you need help she'll do her best.  MC tests ARE evil, its true.  but she is taking class input and wants to make the class better!",1
"This class was alright. He's not a bad professor and can explain everything well, it's just that his class get's boring quickly. It was hard for me to pay attention for the full 1 hour and 20 minutes. DO NOT miss this class. If you miss one day, it will honestly set you back the whole semester. The class is boring, but it's important to go.",1
"Students should only take this course if they are serious about working in the medical field. Dr. S provided weekend classes to further explain the material.  Read the book, his PowerPoints, watch CrashCourse on YouTube, take advantage of LearnSmart features.  You will study your ass off but you will KNOW the material very well and feel prepared",1
Very hard and extremely picky instructor. Student be aware!,0
pretty easy teacher but man boring. I couldn't help sleeping. I would have to leave to buy chocolate just to stay awake in that class. If he made the class more interesting maybe I would have taken the time to actually go to it. He is a very lenient teacher and I did learn alot but only when I was awake.,1
Fenster incorporates Chemistry into History making for great lectures and an even easier time trying to learn the material. Solid Prof!,1
Save yourself she will mess up your average.,0
"Schilling's lectures are boring, but if you just do every single reading, this class is an easy A. Tests are all multiple choice, including the midterm and final, with some easy short answer extra credit questions.",0
Wow. I had his class in 1987 and because of him I took 3 more years of chemistry even though it wasn't required for my degree. He made me fall in love with chemistry and see the world through the eyes of what an electron would do.,1

"The sweetest professor ever. I had her for Span 101 and Span 102. I never took Spanish in high school, but Profe Ana made the class easy. She knows that there are a lot of things to memorize, so she sometimes gives hints on her quizzes or exams. Restarts Wiley problems when you run out of attempts. The best prof ever! Take her class if you can :)",1
"Excellent, knowledgeable and very considerate when it comes to due dates and helping you out. Exams are based on the handouts you get in class, lots of homework and long lectures but they help you out in the end. One of the best professors ive ever had very nice person!",1
"Phil was the craziest professor I've ever had. He's a wildly interesting guy, and he lets you know it. We had lectures on everything from lie detection to resume building. Quizzes are insanely difficult; study the board and videos until you can repeat them verbatim. He threw out half of the syllabus assignments and takes attendance every day.",1

"If you want to take a class and memorize definitions word for word and get points taken off if you alter one word, hes your guy. Ask questions but beware hell make you regret it. Good luck (:",0
"Please take Prof. Dunham he is one of the best Professor I ever had PERIODT! this man needs a raise. Work load is heavy but not hard at all. He is full of knowledge, I enjoyed every class. Do the work, take pride in your work you will pass. He gives great feedback and he is so funny. Cant wait to have him in spring semester!",1
"Yvonne is the absolute worst professor in the Art Department. She doesn't trust that you are honest or dedicated, even if you show up and work hard in every class. Her assignment instructions are not instructions at all and her feedback is completely nonsensical. She will try to make your work fit her style instead of clearly outlining expectations",0
"Excellent.  Keeps class interesting, and is super helpful at office hours.  Tests and all work is very fair.  Good medium between Murphrey and PJ.",1
"Dr. Evans is a great professor-- he is witty, intelligent, passionate, and personable. He is understanding/encouraging, but also expects you to work hard and strive for excellence. Although I took it as a requirement, it was my favorite class of the semester. In PSC-211, he led a discussion based class with reading/lectures as homework.",1
"Dr. Johnson is a caring professor who is very knowledgable in her field. She organized the course extremely well during the COVID-19 crisis and transitioned us to online learning much better than other professors. Tests are based off of the textbook that she wrote, so just know that you must read and take notes thoroughly to ace exams.",1
"I dont remember what section I took with her, but she knows her stuff she is awesome dont listen to these two bad comments she is awesome! You have to read you have to do the work otherwise she will call you out on it, but do the work ask questions in class and pay attention and its worth it i have learned so much in this class",1
I would definitely recommend her as a prof. She is very clear about HOW you are being graded as well as your progress (unlike my last teacher). She clarifies things very well! Really enjoyed this class despite taking it in the 7 week summer session!,1
"4 people in our class of 32 passed Professor Konya's Calculus 1 class. I understand that this is not an easy subject, but when 8% of the class receives passing grades it is no longer about how the students are failing to understand the concepts, but rather about how the teacher is failing to teach.",0
Ms. Feagin knows a lot about American history but I feel that she tries to cram too many activities into one semester.,0
Nicest most caring and understanding teacher ever! He is super passionate for it and you can tell he works really hard for all of his lectures. Such a nice smart man!!,1
"Demanding, but the very best in regard to getting an education in English.",1
"SON COURS EST SUPER PLATE!!! 
 iL NY A PAS DE FIL CONDUCTEUR!",0
"Great choice for Psych, it's always an interesting lecture. Do the homework, which is super easy, and you'll pass every exam. Gives extra credit every once in a while which can be helpful during exams. Highly recommend this professor!",1
"she is extremely helpful and doesn't mind explaining topics over and over again if someone needs the help.  her tests are easy and you can finish them in 20 minutes and leave.  only complaint is that she spends more time going over homework than she does teaching concepts, so she spends the last 5 minutes teaching and then assigns a ton of homework",1
"Every class was professor Amey talking about random stories that kind of relate to the slides. He gave random pop quizzes almost every other class which were fill-in-the-blank with no word bank on really specific details that he didn't mention in class. I asked him my grade and he said ""he didn't know"". He's nice but doesn't know what hes doing",1
"I took the online summer class. The class was super easy. Grades were based on 4 exams, 3 quizzes before each exam (so about 12 quizzes total) that could be retaken in five tries, and 3 assignments. If you read, youre sure to pass (since material exactly comes all from the book). I highly recommend this professor.",1
very good teacher has good humor. does give alot of home work and strict on writing essays but is willing to work with you. to fail his class you must be an idiot. if you try you will pass.,1
"Prof. Arnold is tough, but yet she is helpful and very understanding. Attendance to her class is a must because she takes points off from the grade when you don't. Yet Prof Arnold is awesome and passionate about her science teaching class.",1
"Honestly the best Chemistry Professor I have ever had. His lectures really make the material easy to grasp, he has so many resources available to help you. The best part about him is that he is passionate about what he teaches, is never in a bad mood, and comes in with a smile every day. He wants you to do well,if you do better he boosts your grade",1
Doesn't know what he's doing. Disorganized for every class,0
"Prof is knowledgeable. Very difficult, read lec. before class. 12 online quizzes (7 Pts each). Answer will be either on PP or on ur class notes but not online. 3 exams (the last exam was cumltv). After class lecture, class assgmt needs to be completed before class ends worth 1/2 a pt takes 20-30 mins to complete. 3 individual case assgmt.",0
"She was the sweetest professor, thanks to her I discovered my love for Sociology and Social work. Her class isnt tough the PowerPoints and self explanatory and so are her reviews I really enjoyed her class. I was a Sociology major, which is why I was interested in taking this course. Her class is an easy A if you just show up and pay attention.",1
No Comments,1
Strictest teacher I've ever met. Her rules are insane for lab she will kick students out of lab for wearing ankle socks! She also never posts grades so it makes it hard to tell how well your doing in lab. She also doesn't teach how to do any of the calculations or go over parts of the lab before you do it so your left to your own devices.,0
Very upbeat and helpful professsor. Is all about the essentials of nursing and how to be well versed with policies of nursing. Class is very easy.,1
"In 102, there is daily homework and a lot of exams and you need your textbook all the time, but Erin was enthusiastic about getting us through the material and I felt prepared for the exams. good TA and always willing to answer questions",1
"Awesome prof. Extremely entertaining, fair grading, great guy- definitely recommend him.  I wasn't looking forward to the class, and it ended up being my favorite.",1
"You either love him or you hate him. Personally, I loved his class, his anecdotes and his sarcastic sense of humor. He knew the textbook inside and out. Sometime you just need to take a day off from classes from burn-out, but I was always in his class because it was so fun and he made the material entertaining.",1
"Great teacher, great man",1
"He gives amazing options for outside sources, so the textbook wasn't the only option. The video he posted for topics were fun and helpful. Will continue to be one of my favorite Professors, I will be taking another one of his classes next semester.",1
"She was an okay prof, in terms of teaching I would never take her again. She reads of the powerpoint without properly explaining and a lot of times her review slides DO NOT MATCH HER EXAMS! she teaches something else and gives us review on something else. There are quizzes to boost your mark but doesn't really do anything.",0
"Bio 2 class had 3 exams, 1 final, and 1 presentation. Exams are a big part of your grade, as there is no homework or quizzes, but the labs do help out. Attendance is mandatory for the lectures and Dr. Sunny knows biology like the back of her hand! She wants you to participate and invites questions. Study hard and review the slides if you want an A.",1
Do all the readings and the tests should be easy. Can't just listen to her lectures because they were short and just skimmed the information. Readings take a while but they are engaging because the online textbook includes a lot of pictures as well as vids and practice questions along the way to make sure you understand. Tests were multiple choice,1
"If you have little interest in math and are expecting an easy A from an online course, FORGET ABOUT IT! This class is by far the most challenging class. The quizzes are hard and the exams, well forget about that too because it's no material you've gone over. I would never recommend this class to anyone!",0
"A bit intimidating to speak up in class because he will question everything you say, but he seems to genuinely care too. Going to office hours helped.",1
"Great guy, hard class.  It's important to do at least some of the reading and listening before each class (and there's a lot of it).  In other words, don't be surprised to have over 2 hours of HW a night.  Other than that, the tests are hard, but every other class period is fun.",1
Really good teacher took him 2 times. He tries to help you pass. As long as you put effort youll pass. Would definitely recommend,1
Worst professor at Uconn. I am regularly an A and high B student but she gave an absurd amount of papers to write and even as a good writer I struggled to get good grades. She acts as though this is the only class on your schedule. Emailing her complaints about the situation and she doesnt care. You have to agree to her beliefs & opinions to pass.,0
"Professor Chase does a good job of running his class. Lectures are easy to follow along with and interesting as well. Homework consists of multiple questions, you'll take a quiz on that HW when you turn it in. A few big exams, nothing too big to worry about. No textbook required which is a plus. You'll learn a lot in this class, would recommend.",1
"Professor McClay is one of the best teacher I have ever taken. She is willing to help you as long as you ask! Come and be on time for her class, study her power points, read the book and you will do great!",1
"If you just want a self-learner that wants a GPA booster then sure take her. But if you actually want to be taught and learn something out of it then maybe not, can easily do the same by just doing readings on your own :) She's really nice though!",1
"He's a little bit awkward, but you could see he tries his hardest to prepare us for the realities of the Music Industry. Not really the most interesting and engaging, but there are some important lessons to take away, especially with Copyright and Contracts. I probably wouldn't take him again though.",0
"prof gilbert is awesome at what he does. not only is the topic interesting to begin with, but he makes it come to life.. he really knows what he's talking about. more importantly, what he talks about really makes you think. and isn't that what higher education is all about? but be prepared to do some MAD writing for the exams!totally worth it tho!",1
"Ms. G is a nice person, and Im sure she is a great nurse, but she should not be teaching NSG 120. It's a horrible class to begin with (boring, dry, IDGAF about nursing history, sorryNOTsorry) but she honestly was not trying at all. Didn't really cover material throughly. I never felt well prepared for the tests. Rushed through lectures. ",0
"Professor Selph is an excellent teacher. He can be a bit quiet at first, but he makes an effort to reach out and help students understand the material. His grading is very fair and gives students the best opportunity to succeed. He makes himself available outside of class, and is always helpful. I absolutely recommend him!",1
Rachael Smith is 100% the best prof i have had at Ball State. Yes the class is difficult but she tells you what you need to know for the exams. Going to class and paying attention is a must but she makes lectures interesting. She overall is an amazing prof and person and cares about her students.,1
He is the best.,1
"This prof is great and made Comm. sys a real joy to learn. Likes to make sure students understand the material. He's pretty funny although most of ppl are too slow to pick up on his subtle jokes. Book is followed closely, but doesn't have everything, GO TO CLASS. For comparison, Adve writes better notes than Kschichang, but both are still good.",1
She seems great.,1
"Professor Stockton is amazing! I always looked forward to going to class due to his zany nature, good humor, and the interesting lectures. It is evident that he really knows his stuff. There's no required textbook and attendance is optional, but I never wanted to skip class. Even if you're not a philosophy major, take Phil 101 with Stockton!",1
"Best professor that I have every taken at CBC! He is so kind and passionate about art and is very approachable and easy to speak to. The lectures are long and a bit boring but take notes and you'll do just fine! He also gives extra credit which is nice. Also, accepts late work. You can find the book online for free!",1
"Very difficult class, not sure if this is SCC mandated but this class really needs to slow down on the homework and give students time to learn the material vs rushing through it. Mrs. Conrad really cares about the students and wants them to succeed; but when test averages are in the 65% range it is time to reevaluate how the material is taught.",1
One of the easiest classes I've ever taken. Nice lady. Goes over test for review. Take this teacher!,1
He is awful. He comes to class unprepared and shows us videos of other people teaching. He says he has office hours to help but he's just shames you for not knowing. He goes fast and writes SO sloppy. He gets flustered if you ask him to explain something again. He starts every class with a lecture about how we're all lazy and stupid and terrible.,0
"One very sweet woman. I felt guilty on the days I would miss class, when I was there she would always end the class with ""Thank you for being here"" D': . By the end of the semester there was a handful of people that would attend. -.- Her lectures are more like stories and she really does make you feel as if you are there. An easy class (:",1
Great class! His lectures were easy to understand for a difficult topic. He gives attendance extra credit points on random days.,1
Dee is a great teacher but has a smart mouth and is extremely rude towards some students... She makes a huge difference in students and has her picks. Her rude CAN BE VERY OFFENDING!!!,0
"Professor Washburn is an excellent instructor, having a broad base of both theoretical and practical knowledge. The class content was a great balance of individual and group work. The class culture was based on mutual respect and participation was highly encouraged. The class materials were great, excellent textbook and video, while dated, valuable",1
"This is an extremely easy class, but also extremely pointless. None of the information is useful, so she does try to make it a little interesting but it is hopeless. You print out the notes for class so there is little effort involved. Just memorize and know the general concepts for the test and it is a breeze.",1
She is a tough grader.,0
"Fast Eddy is awesome, kept the lectures quick and concise. The only teacher in my school career that sat in each lab for the full three hours. Great teacher",1
Extra credit at start and during quarter. Do it! This is 30 points if you get full credit. Test weekly on previous lecture (some have extra credit). Clear questions. Group project is graded as group. Want an A? Put in the effort. Ride the slackers. The other project is the unknowns. Like a CSI game. Stick to logic when run tests. Great class  &prof,1
Must take one of his classes. If you take one in Spanish make sure that you are fluent/advanced or else you will have a very hard time. This class is very interesting. He really cares about his students.,1
"Inspirational professor. I learned to appreciate math in his class. He posts helpful practice questions, is reliably available for help, and is a comfort when you have a problem. Great at sarcastic deadpan.",1
Mr. Prey is my favorite teacher of all time!! Took him in high school and then again at rio. He makes every class fun and interesting and really cares about his students and their ability to understand and learn the material. He is the smartest person Ive ever met and knows everything about science.,1
"Prof. Dierwechter is an academic. He is not there to be your buddy or pal. He is there to broaden your understanding of urban development. He is very approachable outside of class, the catch is you need to bring him intelligent thoughts and questions. If you appreciate the European model of university level studies, you will love his courses.",1
"Professor Shine is one of the best professor's on campus. The class has only two exams and no other graded material. For the mid-term you can continuously turn it in, all the way up to the final, until you receive an A. Sometimes his lectures go off on tangents, but he gives you the answers to the midterm and final questions. Super Easy!",1
"He will mostly teach his own tool - JDeodrant. The mid-term is 50% of the total grade with no clear instructions at all. Just handed a project which we have to refactor within 3 hours, in addition to explaining reasons on GitHub. The main issue, no guidelines on number of refactoring. He deducted marks for issues his tool itself didn't detect.",0
"As a word of advice do not take Mrs. Wang's summer Calc course unless you are currently an 'A' student in Pre-calc. Perfect attendance, good grades on homework and class participation  0 if you do not nail the tests. Earnest effort 0. The test scores are the only thing that matters. If you are not comfortable taking difficult tests-drop.",0
"Every calls him really conservative. He is more conservative than most law professors, but is right down the middle. He DOES say when he thinks Scalia got something wrong. Its refreshing to not have to listen to left views the whole time like almost every other class. A single class NOT hard left causes such uproar! Silly. Great class!",1
i took him for bus-101 and now for bus-201 he is cool teacher his test are all multiple choice but they are challenging if you do not study. But you learn a lot you will laugh at his stories that you will hear multiple times. ps he likes donuts and coffee no sugar with milk,1
Toughest grader I have ever come across.,0
"His powerpoint slides are poorly organized. His explanation does not make sense. The test was hard, and he likes to test on something that he didn't talk about in the class. In the class, he just mumble on and on. The laboratory program is also unorganized and is lack of sufficient guidance. All in all, he doesn't like teaching and not good at it.",0
"I took her class online so I never actually was in a classroom with her but shes such a great professor! Shes very caring, doesnt give a lot of homework or quizzes, always answers when you email her, and always gives a clear grading rubric. Take her!!",1
"Seems like a great guy, teaches a very easy class. Not much material, can learn everything in a day or two. Exams were very simple, basically just use the formulas he gives you.",1
"The 2-5 pg journal entries each week will keep you up very late if you put them off! Research paper is intense, but can really help your grade if you're lacking in other areas. Attendance is graded, as is participation, so don't expect to coast through! Very rewarding class, you learn a TON!",1
"Extremely hard corse no matter what professor you have.  Extra work in Bridges vs other friends with different teachers.  She moved very quickly and left no time for questions or confusion.  Pop Quizzes about once a week, class handouts for homework, online homework, and you are assigned questions from study guide to turn in every day.",1
Whoa! Dis man be da best teacher i ever done have. Can't say nuff good tings bout dis good sir. He be forever my favorite. He is be a famous man too and not just to me's. I's evens passed his class so dat is a darn good ting also's.,1
"I've taken 2 classes with him, Art of Wondering(introductory phil class), and Critical Thinking. He is a really cool guy, clear level of respect between teacher & student. Don't show up late, he hates it. If you show up, pay attention, do the readings (not crazy amounts but they're really interesting) and participate youll pass. Love Mr. Anderson!",1
"Linguistics in itself is not the most interesting subject, but Barret does try to keep people interested. He presents the material very effectively and is always available for extra help. He gives lots of hand out (not a lot of note taking!!) and his test are easier than the homework. If you can do the homework you'll get an A. I'd recommend him.",1
"She is all over the place, she tries to assign us homework that we've already done. I don't blame her though, all the busy work she gives us is the same. She gave me a 0 on accident and I asked her every class period for two weeks to change the grade on moodle and she still hasn't. Get it together girl.",0
"Dr. Searfoss is a nice lady, but this class is hard if you're not an English major! She assumes you already know a good deal of the material and some of her examples are hard to follow. There's a lot of homework and the tests are hard, but she always encourages us to go to office hours if we need more help. Thought I knew grammar before this class.",0
"Best Class at UT- Brownlee is an amazing professor, attendance is not mandatory, material is actually interesting. Would take another class of his again. If you memorize the class made study guide, you will get an A. 3% extra credit. Highly recommend.",1
"Dr. Cochrane is extremely smart and makes lectures interesting if your interested in the subject.  Class is necessary to go to because she doesn't post notes anywhere.  Great Professor, study and it's an easy A.",1
It is not easy to get high grade. But he allows you to revise. You can learn a lot from this class.,1
Be prepare to read a lot and to write a lot of notes. Study the review sheets. Not just the definitions but know how to apply them. With that said once you do your papers and be in attendance you will pass. Easy A.,1
Tests are much harder than presented material in class.,0
Dr. Lyall is a MUST take! Hes one of the best professors I ever had. I enjoy going to this class and never missed one. I learned so much from this class. Hes truly one of the best professors in the Psychology department. Two required videos and weekly summaries. Test are very easy he prepares you!,1
"he was a terrible teacher. honestly worst i've ever had. leaves you to teach yourself the course. he would overload you with homework and never even went over it and was always in a bad mood. he told my class, ""guys i could be doing something better than be wasting my time here"" but isn't it your JOB to be here??? definitely do not recommend him!!",0
I had to take this guy's class twice. I failed the first time & failed again this semester. He's very passionate about the subject but he makes it hard for some people to do well in his class. Quizzes are super easy but the tests and homework's are super hard. If you're good at science you'll be fine in his class but if it's your weakest good luck.,0
"Took an A session course. Did enjoy it very much it was kind of just something I had to do during the week, but it was not hard at all.",1
When you actually aren't miserable sitting in your 8 am class is when you know you have a good professor! Nelly likes to tell personal stories which is great because it helps pass the time. She lets you work in groups which is awesome and guess what!! YOU GET TO PLAY KAHOOT. . . A LOT!!!!,1
"I was so impressed by the content and the lectures. Every day, I left with something to think about. Very challenging materials to process but worth every minute. You don't know what you don't know about the subject of human rights until you take this course.",1
"I have taken public speaking now with 3 different teachers now at GRCC, and Melissa is hands down the best. She is empathetic, she doesn't grade excessively hard, over half the class grade is based on NON speech work (not including some of the participation points), and she is very willing to help, plus a great listener. This sets her apart",1
"Dr. Epstein is a very kind man.  That is the only positive thing I have to say about him.  He is tough, very tough.  I am a physics major,and his lectures and tests destroy me.  He puts everyone through their paces.  if you take him, you will learn to fear him.  YOU WILL FEAR PHYSICS!!! take him only if you have to.  I would avoid him at all costs.",1
"I can't understand why people think that he is so hard.  He honestly tells you exactly what you need to know on the exam and only tests on about 10% of what is in the text.  He could make this class A LOT HARDER if he wanted to.  Whenever I needed help, he was always available and willing to help.  One warning though, he isn't going to spoon feed y",1
She's an okay math teacher. I think there's a simpler way she can explain the material at times. Also I don't like being graded on information we have not yet learned. There's a lot of homework but really I feel that's any math class. her test are a bit lengthy so keep track of time. Also complete My Math Lab work on time to avoid a 75% reduction.,1
"He is the most funny man alive. his lectures were never boring and there was alot to cover. Showing up to class and doing the work shows enough participation. he is a tough grader but will help you succeed. as long as you show him respect and understand his jokes, your on his good side. i would highly recommend him. i have learned alot from him.",1
"Despite getting the highest grade on all of the exams (90 avg), I still almost made a C in the class because of pop quizzes. Asks extremely specific questions and sometimes counts AGAINST you for getting it wrong. Burghardt is laughably condescending. You'd think you're talking to a celebrity with how self-important he is. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"Saralina is a great person and the class isn't difficult at all, but it is a speech class so of course it comes wit a bit of uncomfortableness . She makes the class as caring as she can though and is not super picky if you need some time to yourself.",1
Class was hard and teacher went off on random talks about her views. I wish I could say something good about the teacher but it was the worst experience in my college career.  If you want less stress and more time in your life than please dont take this teacher.,0
Professor Kaur is a very nice professor. She is very caring of her students and very passionate about her teachings. She does give out lots of pages to read from the textbook. You're mostly speaking and doing powerpoint presentations in each class. Overall the class was okay.,1
Amazing professor and a very knowledgeable man who loves to share his intelligence.  You learn a lot about the subject being taught and his feedback on your papers are very helpful.  Being able to resubmit papers as many times as wanted in order to get the grade you desire is a big help. ,1
"Her class is not very hard, however,do not miss class and homework. do well in the research paper.",1
Many students in our class opted to not attend lectures and study the textbook on their own. Dr. Sander reads directly off of her slides which can be difficult to follow. She offers bonus assignments and group quizzes to augment your grade. 2 midterms - the last 10 minutes of which were spent in a group setting. She is helpful during office hours.,0
"Best Professor I have ever had! You definitely have to work hard to receive an A in her class, but you can tell Mrs. Feagin wants her students to learn & earn a good grade. Very responsive to emails, very nice, & very helpful. This was an online class, & I think I learned more than I ever have ina history class before.",1
"I love her, she loves us and inspires us to be a better person! I am an international student and have learned so much from her. If you do need a class that will help you with your writing and change your life, this is your a must-option!",1
O'leary will communicate clearly what material you are responsible for learning and is passionate about the subjects he teaches,1
"He almost never had class, but when he did all he talked about was Carnegie and social mobility. Then he would give us online quizzes worth 100 points that were impossible to pass, and I ended up getting a C because he never actually taught but still gave us the weekly quizzes. His tests are all essays and he never gives you your grades back.",0
Very passionate about his area of study.,1
"Professor Medlin is a great professor and he truly cares about his students. He wants you to do well in his class and he also wants to be sure you are ready for the real-world. He give practical information to help prevent malpractice claims. His exam is multiple choice, but he gives you an opportunity to explain your answers. Wonderful professor!",1
"Dr. Swint is a very good teacher. He is pretty funny and his classes almost always hold your interest. Attendance is important, and taking good notes is also important. And he's on Twitter!",1
He is the most specific grader i've ever had. his lectures are good and you'll understand the concepts but his grading on tests is enough to drive you crazy. You have 4 tests and a final and one of the tests are dropped (if he didnt drop your lowest grade you wouldnt pass). try and take someone else,0
"3 quizzes over terrible movies. 3 essays, final essay is 3000 words (tons of reading involved with these). 1 group presentation, which was stupid. 4 Absences and he will fail you. Very difficult to stay awake in class. If it's not required, don't take it. It's not a blow off and you have to show up, plus there were no good movies on the curriculum.",0
"Avoid!!! Nice lady but she is by far the most unorganized professor I have ever had. Posted every week's assignments late, grading criteria was unexplained until semester's end, and she never graded anything on time- seriously, not once. Can BARELY get a hold of her by email. Posted final paper guidelines 10-days late too. Not worth the headaches.",0
"I have taken multiple online classes with him so I like his structure. 6 discussion boards must reply & reply to 2 others. 4 quizzes 25 pts. 1 midterm 1 final both non cumulative. 1 10-12 page paper due at the end of semester on our own ethical process, it was easy bc its about us. this ethics class is a lil harder than other classes, but passable",1
"I side with the last commenter on Professor Gilbert being deliciously attractive. He is also creates the most inviting seminar atmosphere, it's definitely a treat attending his class.",1
"Monotonous. If you need to catch up on some sleep, just listen to his lectures.",0
"She is a very sweet person but I can honestly say i didn't learn anything. She gets off topic all the time, she takes forever to grade your papers, she's never prepared for class. She doesn't know what we've covered or what we haven't. Very unorganized mentally. It was very frustrating being in her class. But she was very nice.  ",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER!!!! Her class is only worth 500 points with about 6 assignments, so if you don't do good on an assignment you have no chance of getting a good grade. This class should be an easy A class but she does not explain any assignment, and she is a hard grader. She also takes forever to grade so you never know what you have in the class.",0
"This class met once a week.  There was a lot of material to cover in that time period.  While there was a lot of lecture, questions were always accepted, both before class and by email.  Office hours were also useful for getting clarification.  He let us use class time to organize study groups as well.  ",1
"Great teacher, the school needs more like her",1
She is very nice and understanding! There's a great amount of homework but it's there to help you. She often extends deadlines. She genuinely cares about students and doesn't mind giving extra help Tests are in class but she gives a study guide and works on it in class. She is also very organized. TAKE HER! There is no way you can fail this class.,1
Awesome teacher who is super passionate about her current and past students. Her lectures are great and very interesting because she tells personal stories that relate to the content. One con is that she posts nothing online so it's on you to keep up with your grades. Several group projects but nothing too crazy. READ THE CHAPTERS BEFORE THE TESTS.,1
Montero assigns a lengthy amount of reading through out the course. class notes are not  very important in her 101 class but reading is a must and she only uses 2 text books for her course.,1
He makes you work probably harder than any other WU prof but u will learn your stuff.,1
"Absolutely amazing TA -- among the best I've ever had. She goes above and beyond to help students succeed. Extremely knowledgeable and prepared, class-time is put to effective use. Couldn't have succeeded in Calc 2 without her. ",1
"Professor Brown is a great guy, who shares really funny stories. I really like him! He was helpful during his office hours, but his class was impossible. I worked my butt off, read the book, took lots of notes, and studied for days for his exams. But that still wasn't enough, if it wasn't for him curving, I would be stuck with a C in his class. ",1
Tests are tough but he curves generously.,1
"WORST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE!! AVOID HIM!!! He's awful, the grading is completely inconsistent, he's hard to understand because of his accent and he's extremely rude sometimes. Don't expect help from him!! He is an awful professor and I wish I never took him. SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN!!",0
"Easy, Easy, Easy. This class is basically a highschool review.",1
"It was pretty challenging, but in a good way. You're going to have read allot of material and be ready to talk about it in class. But I learned so much. About allot of different things, and the class was really interesting because so many people participated. She never said your opinion was wrong coz your didn't agree with hers, which was cool.",1
The last comment is totally not true and the most foolish thing I've ever heard.  Kristy invests herself in her subject matter and her students.  She is smart and creative and fun.,1
"I had Dr. Irani for a hybrid abnormal psychology class. She was so sweet when our classes did meet. It was an easy A, but her exams were nearly impossible without the quizlets online. I did all of the readings and homeworks but man those exams would have been impossible. I would definitely recommend her though",1
"He is mad boring...it's like watching paint dry..hes a nice guy, but hes an accountant not a teacher so he just tells you how it works instead of teaching it to you..",0
"If you want to pass, you will need to teach yourself. He is extremely smart, but too smart to be teaching lower level. He said our class was a disappointment. also, his study problems were easy and seemed to trick us on the test (Extremely hardunclear)",0
Did not enjoy this class at all. Her lectures are really boring and she doesn't clarify much... She is a really hard marker. ,0
"Dr. Borglin was very helpful. Will come to lab an hour or so earlier to go over anything students need help with. Ask for help, and you shall recieve. Fair grader, easy to understand. Do the work that is assigned and you will do fine on the quizzestestsexams.",1
"She seems nice enough, but her classes are amongst the most boring I've attended. I never leave with the feeling of having learned anything. She spends most of her lectures asking students to talk between themselves before she writes their answers on the board and her voice can be distracting as it sometimes cracks and comes out squeaky.",0
Dr. Fan is really a great teacher. She is helpful and understanding. There is online homework due monthly but it is very easy and you get three tries on each question with explanations on how to do it. There is one 2-3 page paper due and 4 exams (multiple choice) with the lowest score dropped. You should have no problem getting an A or B!,1
"Gave papers made classmates revise or else itll hurt your grade.. didnt have class the last two months, still had essays due tho!",0
i called him professor fidel nicastro all semester.  the online homework is terrible.  a lot of memorization cause he doesnt give you the equations you actually need.  huge curve at the end becuase everyone fails.  he gets really pissed off if the class doesnt answer questions so just hope theres someone who knows what they are doing.,0
GREAT TEACHER! I would take her again!,1
"Her personality likes to change on a dime, from pure positivity and joyfulness to yelling at someone if they come in a little late. Your grade counts mostly on the essays, and it isn't easy.",0
"Great class, great teacher, and interesting class. Take it! Be sure to stay caught up.",1
Aren is amazing. His class is fun and exciting. He's always available anytime you need. Definitely would recommend any class taught by him.,1
"Cultures of Africa was an amazingly easy class.  I think Dr. Cochrane needs to challenge her students a little more.  I never read the assigned readings, showed up about half of the time, wrote a pretty pedestrian research paper, and still ended up with an A for the class.  Most of the exam questions could be answered just using common sense.",1
"Best professor I have had at DePaul. I am an English student so I have been around the department and experienced much of the staff. Morano is extremely personable, interesting/interested in you, and makes an effort to get to know her students. I recommend her, as I will continue to take any course that she teaches!!",1
"He is a nice guy, but admits the first day that he is monotoned and prepares us for a boring course.  His quizzes are hard for the pure fact that there is so much material to cover for a 10 question quiz.  He isn't helpful outside of class and is very hard to get ahold of. DONT TAKE. Take learning!!!!",0
"A fair grader, though she does get harder as the semester goes on. She knows theory like the back of her hand. Took two classes with her and I don't regret it, she is amazing!",1
Music Theory: he's great. Will clearly explain things & make sure you understand. We do lot's of practice before the test. Aural Skills: sooooo slow. He will NOT challenge you. Take him if you struggle with aural. Do not take him if you're good and wanna be pushed because you will fall behind. He's a lovely person though.,1
"Professor Nelson has an obvious passion for history, which makes his lectures entertaining because he is so passionate. However, if you're a visual learner, you will struggle. No Powerpoints, hand writes everything. Tests are strictly based off of his lecture notes. I personally wouldn't take his class again.",1
prof. goldner is very unorganized during lectures. good luck taking notes because he jumps around from topic to topic without making anything cohesive. his study guides are useless as nothing listed on them correlate to the exams. he's very rude and patronizing to his students and his classroom etiquette is ridiculous. history majors avoid him.,0
"He was an amazing professor, I took him twice at Hofstra. I know he is now teaching at a college in New Jersey, Kean University. A shame he left Hofstra.",1
Took a class on social movements with her and had a great experience over all. Each class was based around discussions about assigned readings along with two weekly reading logs. There are multiple 4-7 page papers leading up to a final project but you are given ample time to complete it. Maria is awesome so as long as you do the work you will pass.,1
TAKE HIS CLASS!!! He is an amazing professor that makes class interesting and fun. He uses a lot of video clips and humor to keep you awake. Plus he's British!!,1
"Class is really not worth taking. Did not even come close to getting through all the material. Lectures are incredibly boring and he just puts up pictures on the board, no actual information. The information he says in class is generally useless. The papers are not long but he grades them extremely tough and it is unclear what exactly he wants.",1
"Renfrow explains the entire class in just a few pages: Syllabus, assignment due date list, homework questions for each chapter. Basically, he says read the chapter, do the assignments by the due date, if you have problems let me know. Easy peasy!",1
"Class is easy, but she is unhelpful and sometimes even rude when i try to talk to her outside of class or ask for help. She picks favorites, and makes assumptions about students. She also spend all of class rambling about her son.",0
"Friendly lady, not a great teacher. Don't get me wrong, if we were out of the classroom I would be her friend. She does not say what she means when it comes to the assignments. Make sure you are thorough on your on account. She will act like it's all good, but when it comes down to grading she will say something like...well want I wanted was this..",0
Shon is a great person and really does care about his students however his teaching style is very hit or miss. He puts excel on the board and tells us to print it out so we can write out our own notes on it but his edits throughout the class are too much and hard to keep up with. I learned more from teaching it to myself than from class.,1
he never cares about attendance and loves the students who participates in lectures.,1

"The WORST professor I've EVER had! absolutely does not care about students success, unhelpful, does not reply to emails and or calls, extremely rude and inconsiderate. AVOID TAKING HIM PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
Gail is an amazing yoga instructor. Crystal clear instructions and always made sure everyone did everything correctly. I loved this class every M and W and it helped me unwind after classes/work.,1
"I had Dr. Lim for both Thermo 1 & Thermo 2 and he is by far one of my favorite professors. He provides written notes for all of his lectures and they are EXTREMELY thorough, even including some example problems. His tests are not that difficult if you know how to do the homework problems and the example problems in the notes.",1
"I couldn't believe it, but somehow Tax Accounting was my favorite class. Way to go, Dr. Smith. I took the class online and as long as you watch the lectures and do the reading you will do fine.",1
almost through with the class and still dont know whats going on. not recommended! ,0
You will need the textbook as he gives the two midterms and final exam reviews by giving you the page numbers and concepts of what to study. He gave basic criteria for the group projects and feedback afterwards on what could've been done better. Exam was one essay question which he gave out beforehand. The two midterms were multiple choice.,1
"Take her online if you can because it is a lot easier than in class. There is 1 quiz, 1 assignment, and 1 discussion for each unit. Quizzes are easy, assignments you have to write a lot of short responses, discussions you have to read and explain your thoughts. Study guide for every test. The more you write the higher your grade will be.",1
"Stay away, teacher is very tough! expects too much!",0
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
"Amazing prof, very clear as to what she wants , go to class and u will pass , don't show up and ur lost",1
"Lots of weekly modules and assignments due but she provides great feedback and communication. She lays out the assignments on the syllabus and as along as you follow it and turn in everything on time, you should easily get an A.",1
I am so glad I signed up to take this class.,1
"Goes off topic a lot, tries to tell ""funny"" stories to keep everyone paying attention but in reality it just puts everyone to sleep. Easy class to get credits but can be boring at times. Older guy who tells the same stories over and over because he teaches many of the same classes and does not remember which class he told which stories to.",1
BORING,0
"Prof. Miura moved very slowly through lecture, so it was often hard to stay focused. He was a tough grader because he required all definitions and explanations to be exactly like his (oddly-worded) defs/explanations. Exams were conceptual and inconsistent with lecture material. It was helpful to read the textbook outside of class!",0
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE HAD AT DAVIS. Im a math major. Temple is not a good teacher. He may be good at his research, but he is deplorable at teaching. Look at all the other reviews. I cannot think of one thing I like about his class. No textbook, no homework, no feedback, no communication, no planning. Only take him if you are an effective self-teacher",0
"Dan is amazing, he got me my first internship based off of one assignment. He is inspirational and insightful, his courses are tough, but you just have to talk to him about what your doing. He does talk a lot, but it's always useful information or amusing anecdotes. TAKE HIS CLASSES.",1
"Every class was a complete mess. We spent about an hour talking about pure nonsense. She was almost always late. Every paper we did made absolute no sense and her notes were completely illegible, she can't even read it. The only thing I appreciated is the comprehensive steps each paper had, made it easy to write. She's really rude and judgmental.",0
"He would be 5 minutes late a lot. He was nice but the class was a little confusing. Still, it was easy. You have to pay attention to him in class but he gave a review sheet. He told a lot of dad jokes. Kind of funny.",1
"I had Dr. V and she was really good, everything that was on her power points was on her exams and if it wasn't on there you didn't have to worry about it popping up on one. I had her for bio 1 and I got her again for bio 2. Best decision, just make sure you study in advance, this isn't a class you can go in without preparation.",1
Professor Harris is a very good professor. You do have many speeches that you will have to write but if you follow the rubric for each one you should be fine. Allows for you to use notes on midterm and final. Would say he is pretty easy overall.,1
"Tests are based on lectures and he doesn't upload slides. But if you go to class and pay attention, you'll know all the information on the tests.",1
Easiest science i have taken i really recommend this class if you need to get your science credit,1
"The best teacher I've ever had. He will go out of his way to help anyone, plus he's hilarious. You do have to do the work or you won't pass, but all of the work is online & fairly easy. No tests either. He makes the class very enjoyable. HIGHLY recommend him!",1
"Professor McCarthy was one of my favorite teachers this semester, she made the class fun and genuinely cares about her students. She leans on the tougher side of grading, but she gives out clear rubrics and good feedback. There's a lot of readings and short homework (like reviews) in this class but if you do them you'll have no problems at all.",1
"I loved professor Vlachos, took him for 3 classes. Enjoyed his Greek sense of humor . He's timely and to the point. Of course like any other class you must put in time to do well in the class and he offers an extra credit presentation in some of his classes for the extra boost in your grade if needed. He is very understanding.",1
He was the most intelligent prof I have ever had! His lectures were extremely engaging. Definitely a reading and writing-intensive course and NOT an easy elective. But I thought he helped me become a better writer therefore I am taking another one of his courses.,1
I love Fenster!! he is a great prof. His exams are super easy. Make sure to listen to all the details in his stories during lectures because he puts the stories in the exams. The materials he cover are really interesting too!,1
"I have a sarcastic personality and strong opinions about millenials, therefore he and I got along great. He makes you think for yourself and participate during lectures (the horror). Tests are all essay questions, and you get them emailed to you ahead of time to study. Plenty of opportunity to do well, and he's passionate about teaching. Take him.",1
He's a legend at Penn State. Take this man and get ready to learn a lot.,1
"She is a very nice lady. She really knows her material, and really has a passion for it. You can tell she lives by what she teaches. She is a little bit scatter brain in her teaching methods, but most information is relevant. Her grading methods are a hit or miss, sometimes kind of confusing. But she is definitely not a very difficult grader.",1
"Everyone loves Betsy! She is a super lenient grader who really cares about her students and their success. Sure, she asks that her students do a lot of reading, but that's part of going to college, and all of the reading is super relevant to learning in the courses. She makes her students feel loved and inspired to do better.",1
"Dr. Ramey is a very good lecturer and really knows his stuff. He doesn't say attendance is mandatory but you have in-class assignment every class for credit. Show up, do the readings, and study the night before each test and you should get an A. Highly recommended.",1
Awesome,1
"Reading isn't necessary, so you really don't have to put much work into this class for the first half of the semester. However, after that, you have two big research assignments. Requirements are excessive for an elective course and while she is clear about her expectations, they are very high and she will take off points. Follow rubrics closely",0
Absolutely awesome professor. Very helpfull and has a very creative teaching style.,1
He is the best ever,1
Love her!!!,1
"Very enthusiastic and friendly. He made Advanced Writing as fun as it could be. Lots of writing assignments and verbose rubrics. Class was enjoyable, though, and he's definitely helpful and committed to his teaching.",1
great prof!,1
No Comments,1
She is a great professor who works great with students its a hybrid class so you must pay good attention but an easy A.,1
"After taking both Seminar and Management with Monahan at the helm, I quickly realized what a star of a professor that SCCC has on their hands. His lectures are like no other, and he truly cares about his students. The next semester, I chose to do what so many others do, and take a third Monahan class, completing the ""experience"". He's the man!",1
"Really funny professor, his lectures were always very entertaining, there was so many MEMES! The only down side with him is that you have to read sooo much in order to pass the exams which are written exams not mc. Attendance is 25% of you grade so definitely cant skip, offers a lot of ec so take advantage of it, no homework except to read",1
"Like someone else said, homework every week of end of chapter questions, quiz here and there but based on questions. Discussion boards, a paper and that's about it. I also agree that his class is very based on personal beliefs. It's a good class though, turn stuff in on time and get  an ""A"".",1
Inconsiderate and  i wish Could give him a 0 out 5. Really tough grader.,0
"She really is a sweet lady, but not the best teacher. Honestly could not learn one thing during class. Frequently went to her office hours which was SOMETIMES helpful but still did so poorly on exams and will probably fail the final. She scales the course and wants her students to do well, but doesn't go about it the right way.",0
"She seemed to be very caring, but was a terrible teacher. We never once actually went through a power point. She would always leave it on the title page and then go talking about her life. Though we never once went over any actual material she still expected us to take the test which proved to be very difficult. Must buy textbook to pass.",0
"Absolute beast. Lectures are fast but clear, but the slides are online. Problem sets are pretty hard, find a friend to do them with. His tests check for understanding, not memorization. Best experience in the Econ department I've had so far.",1
"Its a summer writing class so its def going to seem like a ton of writing. Ive take class with her during the year too and it's also a lot, but spread over a semester doesnt feel so overwhelming! Anyhoo, she really does want you to become a good writer, so if you make an effort, she'll really help you! Also, she's really friendly and funny!",1
"DURING COVID Prof Wu was very clear from the start with his syllabus. We only had 2 test (mid term and final) and a project that you work on the whole semester and turn it in at the end. Does have a heavy accent, but he tells you exactly what to do for your projects and powerpoints had all the answers for the quizzes so study those. Great class!",1
I agree with the few previous responses. There is absolutely no learning of Nutrition in this class. It's actually Advanced Biochemistry. A is possible with memorization word for word of his little book.,0
Gartland is horribly unorganized and unprofessional. She goes on and on about her personal life. I'm not paying tuition to listen to her actively try to avoid teaching us the material. A number of us are considering complaining to the department chair.,0
Loved the experience in class. Just wished for more trans exposure and centered narratives.,1
"If you do poorly in professor Butowsky's class, it's your own fault. You are in college. Do the readings, watch the videos, come to class and you will pass with flying colors! He's passionate about the subject. I really enjoyed his class. I'm taking him again in the fall. ",1
Paul Sanfran is an overall great teacher!!! He has a great understanding of technology and it shows through his teaching!!!!!!,1
"Alright. She is such a difficult teacher. You have to work for your grade, which isn't the issue. The issue is your work is probably not sufficient enough. Show up, try hard, and be nice.",0
class discussion was interesting,1
Petty work load.. Busy work,0
"great professor. He was a little scattered when it came to assignments, but he gives you plenty of time to complete and they are really easy and straight forward. If you are looking for an easy a and a good professor, take him!",1
"Mrs. Jacobson's class was straight forward and she makes it simple to excel in the class, while you also learn about some interesting things in society.",1
. I took the Business of being an Artist with Prof. Hoover  and all of his classes were very informative and interesting. There are no tests only projects and they aren't hard or time consuming. You just need to be thorough in your work and you will get and A. He is focused on his students and wants then to succeed.,1
He is funny and really chill with the course.,1
"LONG AND BORING LECTURES. have to read like 8 books, i read none of them, its best if you do though. But that is because Dr. Dewald  gives a lot of information and details about what you need to know and emphasizes important info. he is very repetitive but i guess his tests are fair. go lecture, research the books, you be fine. 2 midterms 1 final.",1
"Professor Lichtman is great. He has lots of knowledge on business. Gives feed back and his test are easy as long as you pay attention in class and do the work online. You don't need a book because it's included in the MindTap. You must show to class, you skip class and you won't pass. Test  are normally 75 questions long.",1
"Dr Cash is a really good professor, Very passionate and knowledgeable. There is a lot of readings for this class and quizzes for each reading. To do well you need to read all the readings and watch lecture videos. tests are in depth and you need to make sure you have a good grasp on the topics to succeed. try to stay on top of readings and review",1
This is the worst teacher I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"a very nice professor but does not do well with reminding students about assignments. She allows students to talk during class discussions. Can be sarcastic and snarky at times. Lots of reading, not many assignments, one partner project, and a 10 pp. paper. Be sure to read syllabus before paper is do; she won't talk about it until last minute",1
"BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! ignore whatever you have heard about her, I promise she is the best. She knows exactly what she is doing. A lot of homework and quizzes and tests, but it is all worth it. The quizzes come from the homework and the tests come from the quizzes. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. She is an angel though. She wants all of her students to succeed",1
"I was overly disappointed with Professor Freeds English course. I took her class for my English capstone, looking back I really wish I selected someone else besides Freed. Hopefully this post can help people to avoid this Professor at all costs. Freed is a nice person in general, but when It comes to being a good educator she fails miserably.",0
"Responds to emails and grades fast. Will occasionally give great feedback. Average workload of average difficulty, but the videos can drone on sometimes. Very accomodating for quarantine. Throws random questions on quizzes that were never mentioned in the module's material.",1
"Professor Steiner is a wonderful professor. She cares for her students. Besides this, how she weights assignments is 100% fair. She isn't out to fail you or make the class overly difficult. Though, you still need to put work it obviously. There's 3 tests and 1 final. The final is cumulative. She gives practice tests. Gives extra credit as well.",1
"Operates with a flipped classroom, so you read the textbook and he touches on the important parts. In class activities aren't very helpful and neither is the homework. Get ready to use youtube to learn the majority of the info.",1
Very rude and sarcastic ... IF YOU HAVE DREAMS PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS PROF. She will make you feel stupid and that you are unintelligent. She is literally the worse and wont help anyone. She does not deserve to be a professor if she keeps acting like this. She is extremely careless and doesnt teach nothing ... do your self a favor and skip her nam,0
"Dr. Beaty-Nosco grades very strictly throughout the first half of the course. I feel that she did not thoughly explain things when questions were asked, it was like she was speaking a different language. Nice lady though. Makes lame jokes, but laugh anyway. Hard tests, must get a 60% or better in all aspects to pass class, and that's with a D.",0
No Comments,1
He is the best professor at ONU.  I love Prof. Gerber!,1
"Not feeling this class. All the people who said to avoid it are right. This class is hard for no reason. It just is. The lectures are ridiculous, because literally speaks at a million miles a minute. Tests are crazy, too. My biggest gripe with them is that they are just terribly worded sometimes. which is annoying! Just ask the question clearly.",0
"The class is about cultural literacy with special focus on African and African American World Views. Be ready for interactive discussions, video assignments and more. I appreciate the way Dr.O. instructed the class in a simple and interactive manner, including the useful feedback he provided on assignments.",1
"Tabea is a very good proff she gives good feed back and responds to emails in a timely manner. The class is fairly easy but you have to work for it. Majority of the class is a group project which she picks your group members, just pray you get good ones. Downside to her class was that 47% of your mark was all due within the last 2 weeks of semester",1
"I've only had her for one course, but she is a very caring professor. She really cares how you do in her class and takes the time to help you on your assignments, ensuring that you understand concepts clearly and correctly. I recommend taking her classes.",1
"Very easy to follow his notes as he writes on the board. Unlike other math professors, he takes he's time and you won't need to ask him to slow down. He has written text books in the past, and it shows through his teaching methods. He even shows compassion for his students.",1
"He's very fast pace and his lectures are heavy. The readings are long but he gives many extra credit opportunities. Your grade is made up by individual and group quizzes and exercises. The midterm, four projects, and the final. If you're a lazy student I wouldn't suggest taking the class but if you're actually going to try take the class.",1
"So Ibrahim is a great guy, but I will warn you of two things: First is there is a LOT of reading. If you're a history major, you are already used to this, if not, just be ready. Second, because the subjects are so passionate, sometimes students get into arguments and he just sits back and waits instead of managing the sides like he should.",1
"Professor D'Sa is understanding of his students and is willing to help if you ask for it.  Lectures just breeze by, and tests are sorta easy.  Yes there are pop quizzes, but he basically announces when they'll be and what they're about.  Tips: Understand the homework rather than just doing it; study in groups; and review your exam with him.  ",1
I love her! She scared the crap out me on the first day with no English spoken for like the forst 20 minutes. She is super cute and approachable to ask questions. Looking forward to French 102 next semester!,1
Take this class! SO easy only 3 essays and an optional one. class never went longer than a half an hour we were in the computer lab so you can just play on a computer the whole time. He accepts any excuse to miss class. No homework no final. I hate english and didnt care and still got  C+. If you are a slacker like me and just want to pass take him,1
"Intelligent. Probably knows a lot about physics. Though, it is too bad he is unable to communicate that to his students. Wish the university would let this dinosaur go. His views are antiquated, and close minded. Which is odd for a science professor.",0
"Professor Lee does have extremely challenging tests in terms of the way questions are worded especially for a 101 class. However, he does have multiple and I mean multiple chances for extra credit if you apply yourself. He is a jolly teacher and is passionate about teaching. The only hard part of this class is the tests.",1
"David is not a great lecturer he often goes off and does not stay on topic of slideshows. Lectures are very long and boring material, he has a very monotone voice making it nearly impossible to stay engaged with topic son hand. I would not recommend the class to anyone. Assignment given often are very vague on what they want it written on",0
The best course I have ever taken on human rights. Period.,1
"If you're taking this just for an easy Phil perspective- don't. Intro to Phil & CMP are easier. That said, Ehring is a pretty good teacher and explains logic well. However, his grading is very frustrating as he only gives full letter grades (A,B,C) on tests. So getting a 100 is no different than a 90 as they curve to the same thing.",1
"Dr. Lyons is a very nice prof, but her lectures were dry. She is extremely intelligent and well spoken, but the lectures were hard to pay attention in. The lectures don't prepare you for what is going to be on the tests. The tests were all MC and written, and there was no way to know what you would be hit with on the written. Not the easiest class.",1
Dr. Kueger is the best! She truly cares about her students and their success. Her class will teach you things that apply in the real world so it can be useful if you want it to be. The more time and effort you put in the more you'll enjoy this course and you will have a higher chance of making an A.,1
"Terrible teacher. Gets off topic during lecture, and highly subjective grader. By the end of the semester the teacher did not input at least half of the grades i received in the course, only the final letter grade two weeks after taking the final.",0
"If you hate math, she is great! She is very easy to comprehend and she tries hard to help you. She's so sweet and I appreciated how helpful she was. Never miss a class and ask lots of questions and you'll be fine.",1
"Loved this class, one of my favorites! Take her, you'll learn a lot. She has a lot of experience and it shows in lectures.",1
"Easiest english class ever, attendance is not mandatory. I barely showed up to class, you basically only need to show up to turn in your essays. Overall his class is very easy! TAKE HIM!!",1
"Took him for calc 1&2, he was always so helpful and he explains complex materials in a way for everyone to comprehend. Definitely take him. Also, his tests are pretty easy if you know what youre doing.",1
Straightforward and charismatic professor. Really cares about the material and his students success. Tests and quizzes are easy if you take lecture notes and actually do the assigned readings.,1
Very nice and caring professor who explains thoroughly.,1
Shenoy was my favorite professor this year. What I like about the way he teaches is that if there is something in the textbook that he doesn't use in his engineering job he just won't teach it to us. I felt like I was learning about things I would actually use in my job which is great. He also gives extra credit opportunities. Hw is sometimes hard.,1
"Terrible teacher. He can not hear so class is just him asking for people to repeat themselves. One midterm one final pretty easy since the ta's held review sessions, but I never knew what I got on the final. 4 crucial projects, a lot of work, but doable. Finished the last 100 point assignment in one day. Barely went to class. No feedback.",0
"Mrs. Noland is an amazing teacher. Shes super funny, very easy to understand, and she makes it easy for you to do your speeches. For someone that has extreme anxiety for speaking infront of other people, this class was a breeze.",1
"Dr. Cochrane is one of my favorite professors I have ever had! It's a interesting class. It is a WI class so there are readings but they're pretty easy and all you do is discuss them the next day in class, no quizzes on them. Only one 5ish page paper and 1 project. 3 tests, all are easy if you show up and engage. Dr. Cochrane truly cares about you!",1
"Beba is the best! the only thing was this was a visual imagination class and when she got busy doing the show she would end class early and would want everyone to go help with costumes for the rest of class, i didnt mind but some did. you need to be there, and she has trouble explaning what she wants someties but you will get it! loved her class!",1
Daigle's microeconomics class was very difficult for me. He's not a good lecturer. He mumbles a lot and doesn't want to explain things to you when you ask him about them. He is quite sexist also. His tests are very hard and even with a curve applied. I got a's and b's in every class but his.,0
"Cynthia was awesome, her directions weren't that clear, andor confusing but she was very helpful in making sure we understand. There was no lectures, no mid terms, final exams and really most of the learning is from the readings she assigned and research from other students or your own. ",1
"I took her BUS028A online during the summer. It is the -most-easiest class i have ever had. You only have to do 1 quiz per week, 1 midterm, 2 discussion, 1 final that are multiple choices and there is no time limit. It means that you can do half of your test, and then going out with your boyfriend and then finish the other half when you get home.",1
"He has some good lecture notes, and this is the only good thing about him. If you think you can learn Matlab, latex, or maple with a book by yourself, don't take the class. If you need someone to teach you, find someone else.",0
"I thought that John was a very good teacher.  Even though you can really understand him, he know what he's doing. If your having trouble in the class just ask and he will help. Good Choice!",1
You will hate this class. Whether you like it by the end or not is up to you though I guess. Weekly he will assign 5-8 journal articles that span from 15-50ish pages long that take forever to read There are two exams and he gives you two essay weeks for and a term paper and a book report/presentation. He rambles. Far from easy but I hear most pass,1
"If you have the chance to take a class with Rusty, I highly recommend it. His lectures always make sense and he takes care to make sure everyone understands the content and feels respected. His lectures are right off the PowerPoint, so no need to really take notes. Just pay attention in class and study a bit, and it should be an Easy A! Love him!",1
He failed me even though I got  an 80% on the group project... Terrible prof. Not responsive to emails at all.,0
"Dr. Falvo is INCREDIBLE.  He is very skilled in Alexander Technique, which means lessons are full of life advice, relaxation, and GREAT music making.  Falvo stresses that music is about opening yourself up to the art and magic of it; not nervousness and sweating and crying and ""I have to get this right.""  INCREDIBLE!  But you HAVE to put in work!",1
2 part exams. Pretty tough. 2 homework. The rest of the week he is showing how to work with the software. Pretty interesting but sometimes he doesn't zoom-in or out which kinda confuse you in his video tutorials. Follow his instructions word by word.,1
"She's a lovely lady who loves to talk about her life. Lessons are clear, all you need to do is take notes. Tests are easy.",1
Connie is such and amazing and caring instructor. You do have to be in class in order to get points for classwork. Also she is very clear about how she wants assignments and projects done! She is just amazing,1
"I took Professor Kelson for an accelerated summer A&P 1 course. Lots of assignments (mastering homework, and quizzes, as well as lab handouts and weekly discussions) but he gives you enough time to complete them. He answered any questions pertaining to the course in a timely manner and always provided feedback when grading.",1
Great Guy. Memorized everyones name. Great reading material. ,1
"I loved the course materials, but dreaded Sheri's lectures. She basically just reads off the slides, so I just watched them on 2x speed. The one in-person exam was pretty easy, and she switched to open-book quizzes and discussions when the semester went online. Quizzes weren't too bad, but the integrative essays had very ambiguous grading criteria.",1
shouldn't be teaching intro,0
"All test are pop, only 2 make ups, don't show up to class and you will fail the class, I passed with an A but I worked for it. If you don't ace the papers or get B's you won't make it with an A or B in the Class. If you are lazy or want an easy class don't take this one",0
"Summer social problem online class, so much assignments, 2 big papers, 4 tests, and lots of activities and discussion board",0
"Wonderful professor. I learned so much. He uses many historical examples to drive the material home. He loves to post articles on TWEN which clarify and are very helpful (at least scan them prior to class). I can't say enough good things about Professor Haney. If you get a chance, take his classes!",1
Sometimes she is confusing and she is very strict sometimes here classes time consuming.,1
the best history teacher when history is not your best!,1
"Lectures a lot, but the material is vital.  Every time I was thinking of a question, he would end up answering it a few minutes later.  Very thorough with his explanations. Participation is a heavy factor and only 1 person will get a 100%.  He's fair and willing to help.  E-mails took a few days sometimes.  3 papers 3-5pgs.  Final paper is 5-8pgs",1
"Always comes in late, always has an excuse",0
Jordan Ochs is a wonderful professor and a pleasure to have as a professor.,1
"One of my first Professors at Harper. She is amazing. Her homework and lectures are straight. i.e you will get an A if you learn. If you can't pass the class or find programming is too difficult, I suggest you shouldn't take higher-level CS classes after CSC121. Take time to practice and learn more.",1
"I've taken courses at two different colleges now, and at both, Garry Lang is by far my favorite professor. He takes a MASSIVE amount of material and makes it seem simple and elementary through his detailed (and often humorous) explanations. I liked his Astronomy course so much, I even took his Earth Science class just to see him again!",1
"Took Prof M for summer B. Syllabus was modified for the short time, exams every week with inclusive review. Labs are full points for participation.  Always responded to emails.  She is such a really NICE lady. So show up for labs study the review it's an easy A.",1
Nice Prof. - Lectures Are Powerpoint and Out of class work only a reflection due on exam days and a 2 person team project (both easy grades.) Exams are medium difficulty - definitely look over key notes in the book. Overall I think she's great.,1
Took IDIS304 online. Very straight forward and easy. Not time consuming at all.,1
"Easy class, she does space out your essays which is really helpful but overall extremely boring lectures and you can't doing anything else but bare through the monotone for an hour and a half, would not recommend this teacher.",0
"Took her for all of my MTE's. Nice, is there for you, communicates well, helps you with any math you need and will even meet you online.",1
"I've just got B for HIS 1111 with other instructor, and i have to withdraw this course when i had Mr. Crew. I wish, i'd found this website earlier. No instruction or comment during class at all. The worst of all when you have to take the test without resource allow for proctor. All exams are multiple with 6 points each, so don't miss any.  ",0
"She sets her deadlines for 10:00pm instead of 11:59pm. She won't accept ANY late work even if you have a legit reason and proof. Hands down the worst instructor I've ever had. She also requires sources for trivia? Don't bother taking her class, you won't actually learn anything anyway. She just posts tests. Listen to all these bad reviews, all true",0
"She's a tough grader, which is bad enough considering she doesn't teach class online. It's basically do it yourself. The deadline is at 10 instead of 11:59pm like the other classes. She's very strict about turning assignments in on time even if you have valid excuse as to why you couldn't turn it in. If you take this class, be prepared.",0
"Incredible Teacher. Extremely Smart and Knowledgable, but totally down to earth and real. Very funny in a subtle way. Probably around Mid 30's with young kids. Very Approachable.   He gives about 8-10 short quizzes over a chapter. He will tell you which chapter and the questions are fill in - with a word bank. Study the keywords of each chapter and I'll do well. A MidTerm and Final are only two tests but it's over things covered in the lecture, so take notes. 1 RP and 4 short essays (easy).",1
Decent professor. I do not like anthropology therefore the teacher needs to be very enthusiastic about the subject. She was enthusiastic but not as much as I would have hoped especially being a biology major. There is also a lot to read in class. Tests aren't too hard however.,1
"Solid lectures, good at explaining stuff, and cares about our progress. The books were all cool and we got to talk about dystopias, human motivations, and social structures. Felt like I learned a lot.",1
I really like this professor. He shows his respect to his student. The lectures were interesting and helpful. Class materials were organized.,1
"Team business simulation was fun, but we had members who did not pull weight. Points system he uses does not fairly reflect that. Possible 575, and only 20 reflect team support. Two of us worked tirelessly, and other two got gifted 117 points for our work. Unfair system. Directions on assignments left much to be desired as well.",0
Worst professor I have ever had. She sent a document into the Dean saying I plagerized my final paper just because I used larger words than she must be used to. Also everything she talks about is her opinion no one elses.,0
"Professor Guerra is one of the coolest professors in UCF's College of Business. He used tiger king to make concepts such as litigation and common law much more interesting. His videos aren't boring, and the content just isn't very challenging to understand. Watch the videos and read the assigned readings and you will undoubtedly get an A.",1
She is the best!!,1
"I didn't really learn much in this class but it was still super enjoyable. She's very sweet and caring and will be understanding if you're struggling, she's also super accessible through email and tries to make her class fun whenever she can. She does give a lot of papers though and ""makeup assignments.""",1
"i have taken her 3 times. comparative pols, women & politics and feminist theory. she's the best professor i have ever had. she makes you want to read and the classroom environment encourages it as well. tough grader, but you can definitely get an A if you try hard enough. highly recommended. not for the lazy",1
Meshelemiah is very passionate and knowledgeable about what she does which makes her a great teacher. She's fair and challenging but her class is very interesting; you'll want to go to get the credit and to learn. You do have to to do the studying but she gives out ample extra credit and tries to make the class interesting!,1
terrible. rude and goes way too fast on the power points. expects way too much out of you.,0
"Not hard at all.  You really don't have to do any readings but you still learn a lot because his class lectures are very encompassing.  A bit on the dry side, but very nice and tries to be funny all the time.  He puts the Science in Political Science.",1
"Great instructor, very helpful, grades fair.",1
"Julien for eon 102 was a waste of time. First and only live class was a disaster of random questions and him having no lecture plan. after the first week it was very unclear on what mindtap readings and assignments were to be done. Besides that first lecture he did not teach, only assignments and short videos which weren't super helpful.",0
"I failed the class, so I might have a bit of a bias. That aside, I found O'Leary's lectures very dull. He struggles with technology more than most and tried to stop students from using laptops for notes (we used 'em anyway). He moves through the material at a good pace but doesn't really explain much. The Tutorial is a must.",0
No Comments,1
She's very nice and helpful with work. Attendance is very crucial for the class but she does drop 2 labs and a few quizzes. Her work is very easy to understand but she will meet with you if you don't understand.,1
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it wasn't even for my major. Do NOT choose to take LAS with her. Like another post on here, I did have a 4.0 but I struggled by to get a C with her. Grading on papers is unfair for freshman level non-English majors.",0
"Dr. King is laid back and  funny, or tries to be. I enjoyed his class and found it interesting. He tries to connect with the students and knows what he is talking about. If you learn the material you'll be fine.",1
"La Profesora Fletcher, I can't say enough nice things about her. She has a great sense of humor and is an extremely talented teacher. She is also very helpful and cares a lot about her students. Spanish is easier for some and harder for others, but if you do your HW you will earn an A. Take her class!!",1
I really enjoyed his class last semester.  the stories always went along with what he was teaching and they really made the subject more interesting to me.  I wish more professors had some real world experience so they could be more interesting.  The notes are easy to follow if you go to class.  If you spend some time studying them you'll do fine!,1
"Great class, great professor, responds quick and works with you. Definitely take this class..",1
"He's an amazing teacher. The class is very easy as long as you show up. The syllabus is clear and detailed so there is no reason for your to ever act shocked when things are due. He is very caring and has a no questions asked rule when you miss class, he will simply just let you make it up, Lots of reading but AWESOME CLASS. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!",1
Great professor but the exams were not easy. You have to study and he does not accept late homework.,1
"The material is alright, Dr. Simerka is very helpful. Expect pop quizzes (12 but she drops 2), 3 ""freebies"" for absences, 2 papers, midterm and final. You can rewrite your paper to get a higher grade and she will help you to write it during her office hours.",1
"Good teacher, he explains everything very well. Some questions are unclear in the Ferguson book tho, and you might have to read on your own for certain details. Other then that, he knows how boring his class is, and he's trying to make it fun. Repeats everything lots of times.The midterm = super easy, the final = long/weird questions but doable",1
I learned some helpful information in this class but I could have googled how to be a director and received the same level of education.,0
Melissa is an awesome teacher. Her online course was well organized and I was rarely confused about what I was expected to do. She is clearly very thoughtful and cares about her students. Would highly recommend!,1
"ERIK DEMAINE IS FANTASTIC!  I want to be him when I grow up.  Fascinating research and a really engaging lecture.  I would take any of his classes, even if they're not in my department (18).",1
Dr. Bulinski is very smart and cares about her students. Her lectures are fun and she's very engaging. We went on field trips that were very fun as well. She's a great professor and easy to work with outside of class too,1
awesome teacher!,1
Amazing professor. I took him for PHI 111 and you are only graded on fifteen 300 word papers.,1
"It is a very interesting course and Professor Robert's is very knowledge on the subject. She is also a great lecturer. The material it itself was very dense and theoretical. I would advise against taking this course during a rough semester, particularly to all those that are Pre-Med. She assigns a lot writing and tons of readings.",1
"You would think in this day and age a professor would be able to use a computer, but apparently not. This teacher gives messy hand written notes. Gives notes strictly by talking which is hard to understand,talks fast, and just gives his view of the situation. His tests term part and essay part. Marks answers wrong even though they are right.",0

I have had many tough professors in my college career but this man is by far the worst. His tests are impossible and his communication is subpar. The one good thing I will say is he knows what he is doing in the lab and can give some helpful feedback on how to improve on techniques. Other than that I would recommend taking another professor.,0
"Can't use computers during class, very hard grader on papers. Lectures teach you nothing so you'll learn the final material on your own",0
One of the best professor's I've had so far in college. He's a hoot and will keep you paying attention during lectures even if they are over an hour long.,1
"Professor Blake is an outstanding educator. At first, it was difficult for me to establish myself in the classroom because I was shy. However, I realized that I needed to create a relationship & properly communicate. The worksheets for SPA 101 have the same questions that will be on the quiz & exam. Pay attention and get the answers in class.",1
glen is awesome! he makes his classes entertaining not dull,1
"Good class, enjoyed it up until the end. I received a 94% in the class and a 103% on the final and she gave me an A-. I reached out to  her after the semester and she basically told me that is how it is and if i wanted an A I should have done more extra credit but she keeps the class interesting and if you put in some effort its easy.",1
Has a talent for conveying information in an easy to understand and friendly manner. Also hysterical and really cares about his students in and out of class.,1
"Dr. Kunz is my favorite professor at UD! He is so kind and really wants his students to do well. The lectures can be boring, but he does his best with videos to keep everyone interested. Online quizzes are easy and just like the tests, text questions are all simple and were stated in class. 100% take him!",1
"very nice lady, very funny. take her if you can!!!",1
"Lots and lots of reading. You have a quiz, DB with 1 response and a web assignment for each chapter and then a final quiz at the end. The assignments were not hard. Only downside is it takes forever for DB and Web assignments to be graded. Link to book is included so don't purchase one!",1
"Anyone that can make Plato, Aristotle and Cicero interesting has to be doing something right. VERY easy to talk to and always willing to lend a hand. (And yes, easy on the eyes as well). Grades are based on 2 papers and essay tests. Grading was a little on the hard side, but well worth it. Best class I've taken thus far.",1
This class is hard for anyone that has not taken BIO. She is super sweet but her powerpoint's are too much. She gives us a study guide but its up to use to study the right material. I passed her class with a B but it wasn't easy.,0
"Great class, great professor. The only thing that can be challenging is the group project. Other than that pretty easy.",1
Learned a lot- made me see things from a different perspective. Fun learning activities,1
"finished this class today and wow, I really don't care what I get. The class was made sooo difficult. just glad Im done. ",0
"Good teacher. She expects discussion every class, so you need to read every night. You MUST buy the textbook to pass this class. She is VERY anal about reading and paying attention in class. If you don't do either of these things, expect to get chewed out.",1
"Easy (A) class, but he singles people out and attacks them in personal ways, about inappropiate subjects. Not sure if he trying to be funny, or if he is on some sort of power trip? Take at your own risk!!!",0
She's amazing!!! I have had her for biology and microbiology and passed both classes with an A. Make your life easy and take her class!,1
"I loved every minute of Professor Gonzalez's class. He's hilarious, personable, and knows what he's talking about.",1
"I love Mr. Fultz!! He is so funny, cares about his students, and makes anatomy fun and interesting. Granted, he gets very sidetracked and distracted, but he is a great professor and I would recommend taking him.",1
"Mary is a great teacher.  I admire how excited she is about her subject.  At times her class can be a bit overwhelming because she has soooo many things due at once, but if you do the work she will give you 100 percent credit.",1
she was an amazing professor and was very funny and cute! lol she has such a fun personality therefore makes psych that is a pretty boring class so much fun! great prof to have to start your intro psych,1
"Pretty easy teacher. He changed the test date on a day I would not be able to attend class. He is willing to work with you as long as you let him know in advance. His lectures are based off his powerpoints, but it helps a lot to read the textbook. We took 4 tests and did one project that was easy. He's really laid back.",1
"Very clear and organization. Take Tabea's class if you actually want to learn something. Do not use your phone/laptop in class, and participate as much as possible. Super knowledgeable, accessible, and cares about your success. This class was the most ""worth my money"" course I've ever taken.",1
"Gives quizzes every day. Do the homework and go to homework hotspot and youll do fine on quizzes. She drops two lowest quizzes. Test is like quizzes. Tests are easier than homework problems. If she puts an extra review sheet online do it because its almost identical to test. She is a confusing, jumping all over the place when she teaches.",1
"Bridges almost every lecture gets off track with different topics. which makes lectures a little confusing sometimes. She tends to make a lot of arithmetic mistakes, however her tests are fairly easy. She gives written homework as well as webassign homework.",0
"I have had her for two classes, and she is now my adviser. She is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is very scatter-brained, but she knows what she is talking about, and she teaching it well.",1
"Class was easy and discussion-heavy. Live classes were entertaining and insightful and he seemed to care about students. However, feedback on my final essay for this class felt rude and unhelpful. He spent more time writing hateful assumptions about what guidelines I had or hadn't read rather than offering any other feedback. (Pandemic stress..?)",1
"Professor Stralka was recommended to me for 0910, as I really needed my hand held through math. Her teaching method was so helpful. She is really one of a kind! She was great at explaining everything step by step to the class and took the time to make sure we understood the material. Diane is a caring, smart, and silly. I'm so glad I took her!",1
"She is not helpful at all; Probably one of the hardest teachers Ive ever had. Studying, taking notes, and looking over h/w is not helping. I'm still enrolled in this class because I have no choice.  She does not give extra credit or curve your grade. Take another teacher if you can you will regret it unless you're good in math and word problems.",0
"Professor just reads the slides off in class. He gives lots of study material but he never posts the answers so you never know if you're doing the right thing. The formula sheet that he gives for exams is insane and really hard to use. Ive never been so frustrated with a professor, I have a 3.6 gpa always done pretty well in school but I may fail.",0
"Warner is a boss.  In every single way.  That might not seem like a useful review, but he is an amazing professor.",1
"Mike Hunt is inspirational. He is the kind of professor you take home to you parents and shove in their face and say ""LOOK! LOOK MOM AND DAD! LOOK AT MIKE HUNT!"" Mike Hunt will be there for you in the toughest of times. All this being said I really wish I never took his class because the tests are so hard. Mike Hunt is the bomb but avoid his class.",1
He is a god!  Really he's an awesome instructor and a great man. Take him! You'll be glad you did. He explains EVERYTHING down to the bone and makes sure you understand the material very well before he moves on. His lectures are very easy to digest and he makes the class fun!,1
By far the funniest professor I've ever had or will have. Lectures were fun because of him and I actually wanted to go to class. He dumbs it down for you and the tests are easy if you pay attention. ,1
"Our class gave him the nickname ""Swag Master Jones"". He is really quirky and funny, but you get used to it. His lectures are really interesting and easy to follow. Just don't interrupt him during a lecture. He hates that.",1
"He uses a blend of live and recorded lectures. He does explain concepts clearly, and tells you what to expect for tests. He gives you optional readings from the text book. He gives you lots of practice in the assignments. The 2 midterms are fair, the final is too long, and I didn't have enough time to finish the questions.",1
Shes a very good professor and explains the topic with many details Would definitely take again,1
"Okay, Professor Gartland is a sweet lady but has to be the worst professor at YSU. She rambles about absolutely nothing for an hour and 15 minutes. Often times I found myself in disbelief. A lot of students will just get up and walk out of her class because it is a complete waste of time. Extremely easy A. The questions on the exam are a joke.",0
"He's such a great professor! He's incredibly knowledgeable and really makes you ponder about everything.  You start to question yourself and the life around you. The course was eye- opening and great. Classes were pretty boring and slow,and sometimes got a little repetitive. I really liked his teaching style and really emphasized individual growth.",1
"Class is very easy, never opened the book, and everything is right on the slides. I never bought a finance calculator, but my TI-84 was good enough. You don't even need to pay attention unless he's going over a problem. Exam reviews are very helpful in knowing what's going to be on the exams. You also get a formula sheet for exams",1
Hands down one of the worst professors at the University of Hartford. He never responds to students asking for help and will take points off your grade for any stupid little thing. He is out to get students and if he doesn't have a good feeling about you from day one drop the class because you don't have a chance at passing.,0
Next to no one,1
Fantastic professor. Made accounting easy and gave lots of real world examples for application for accounting basics. We had a lot of schedule changes but he was consistent and understanding. Quizzes and HW are once a week and he gave extra credit for every test. I enjoyed the class greatly.,1
"The tests can be a pain and studying can take hours.  Lots of reading and on average three papers are due per week.  He talks very fast.  He gets off topic during lectures and doesn't cover much of the reading, or if he does it's not in much detail.",1
he is really strict regarding grades.,0
"The graduate classes taught by the professor are challenging and but overall noteworthy. Basically, keep up with your readings and you won't fall behind. Do the work and she will grade accordingly. Don't take her class if you are a lazy student that tends to procrastinate. Do take her class if you like to learn and participate in class discussions",1
"You go in blind to all of the exams and final. There is no study guide. When asked, she does not even divulge how many questions there will be and if it is multiple choice. All she says is that whatever is in the book, lecture or previous courses is fair game. It is a incredibly difficult class and extinguished my interest in accounting. ",0
"Sheffler is what you want in a professor.  He is just challenging enough to weed out those who cannot read and write clearly, but very approachable and willing to help everyone if you make a small effort.  Will sit down to go over research problems, easy to chat with, etc. The research paper in non-negotiable, the rest is pretty fluid",1
I do not recommend taking this class unless you are exceptionally well at writing papers. You do need the book and he will want plenty of quotes from it. He is a hard grader and give vague feedback. I have received only Cs on my papers. Also the only grades we get are from the paper so if you dont do well on them you are SOL.,0
"very sweet, smart, and excited about topic",1
"Mook is the Bob Ross of engineering. Honestly he has one of the best lectures I've ever attended. Pros: super willing to help, will spend as much time as needed to make sure it clicks, great sense of humor, prepares you for cumulative final which is worth most of the points. Cons: notes have typos make sure you correct them as you go, time consumin",1
She is great and knows her stuff. She does powerpoints and test reviews. no trick questions or crazy assignments. If you show up to class take notes as she's talking and study the test review you'll get an A.,1
We all love Doc!!!,1
"Class is extremely easy. Its made up of 4, 600 word papers written in free form. There are no MLA or any other notation requirements. She uses Turnitin as a plagiarism deterrent, but as long as you put subjects into your own words there wont be a problem. I highly recommend her class for an easy A!",1
pretty good. simple work. teacher is helpful. teaches you have to use window programs. sometimes kinda difficulty if you don't know how to use a computer very well.,1
It is helpful if students are proficient in APA style of writing.,1
"Seems like an easy class at first, however the amount of assigned reading is insane. Little gets done in class, and all the pressure is put on you to learn the material as well as do the outside readings on your own. Lectures connect little if at all to textbook/reading material and is super vague, which leaves you scrambling for the final.",0
"She is a riot, but the class I took was a bit like a tour of a museum of exploration.",1
"DO NOT TAKE COURSES WITH PROFESSOR RYNER! He is inconsistent in his grading, very vague in his assignments, and overall very boring. He expects you to be an expert on the subject matter beforehand. He will take points off for extremely minor grammar mistakes, while filling his feedback with typos. Terrible instructor!",0
"She is so sweet and such a great professor! It's an easy class, but you still have to learn and be attentive. She makes the class very fun and interesting and makes you want to participate instead of feeling like you're forced to participate. Love her!",1
"I thought this class would be interesting, but he provdides no chronological order to his lectures and its very hard to find a link to all the info he is giving you. A nice man but expects alot out of his students, and a hard marker.",0
She is great. She explains things well and speaks very clearly--I'm not the best at Spanish but I could always understand her. Recommended!,1
Ana is great. She can be a little all over the place but her class is super easy. It's not a class where you sit down and take notes the whole time. She likes to give lots of interactive worksheets. Would reccommend if you're looking for a GPA booster.,1
"Open to help students, approachable, great personality",1
If you want to pass A & P Dr Lewis is the best professor. He teaches so well .his is a gem.,1
"Raquel is very personable. She gave my class 3 days to miss class, helped us with tests, and really gave us good advice on how to public speak. If you need to meet with her, she will make sure to do so. The class is very easy going and I personally loved going to her class. Her tests are based on notes taken and on videos watched in class.",1
Robyn Proud is an AMAZING professor here at SUNY Oswego.  As an education major she is a must have!  I had her as a 3 hour night class professor and she made the class time fly by.  She in engaging and really cares about all her students.  She has effective teaching experience and is always willing to share with her class.  ,1
"Very caring, helpful & accommodating professor. Valuable to students entering the medical field. Lectures can be long but it's an upper level science so to be expected. She acknowledges they can be tedious. Focus on power points, study guide & short answer question prep for exams.  Labs are easy. No paper/presentation. Highly recommend her.",1
She thoroughly went over everything that she knew you would encounter in your homework. Always gave numerous examples to clarify the subject. Anytime you had a question she was more then happy to answer it and even explain it in a way that you would understand it. She really is passionate about what she teaches! I highly recommend her class!,1
"I love this man.  Seriously, he is contagious.  He makes me want to attend class (and that is saying something).",1
"Solid professor. I think the participation points are good, it makes the class better to because it's not always just him talking. Would take him again",1
I loved this class to say the least. Stockton was hilarious and had great lectures and he knew what he was talking about. I am a health science major but this class made me want to learn and love philosophy all thanks to Stockton. Great experience!,1
"She is probably one of the top 5 best professor at Westfield State. Not only is she super ultra helpful and gives reasonable but helpful assignments, but she does not favor students and does not say or do anything that will irritate or rub the student the wrong way. ATTENTION ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS MAJORS! Take her, take her, take her!!",1
Dr. Currier explains a difficult subject very clearly.  This class does require you to study.   Attend class and take advantage of the extra credit and C should be easily attained.,1
As a lecturer not that great. Seems like he hardly knows material while speaking during lecture but when you ask him questions during office hours or after class he gives really good concise and clear responses. Definitely knows his stuff just poor presenter/lecturer. Subject material is not difficult. Fairly easy class to pass.,1
"Do the readings, show up to the classes, give her just a little indication that you care and you're GOLDEN! Miss out on any of those and it's much harder to do well in her class because she won't see that you're engaged. Have fun with it too, I loved this course and she's clearly passionate about the material. She marks on her own deflated scale.",1
"Professor Mclaughlin is a great man who enjoys life and doesn't want his students to stress too much over college work therefore he is easy going and full of joy. To be up in class at 8 am he makes it so fun with his jokes, I only been absent 1 time the semester and I apologized due to the respect I have for him. I would definitely love to retake!!",1
"Shef is a bit unorganized and scatter brained, but he is a decent professor.  He requires A TON of work but its craft, can't except anything less from Craft.  He's there for his students and very helpful if YOU ask for it.  Super tough grader on his papers so be prepared.",0
"Very interesting guy and youll learn a lot that will be useful in the real world. That being said, if youre looking for an easy A in the 478 class take another professor. Our project was a semester long group project that ended up being over 100 pages. No rubric either just his subjective grading. Youll pass but it probably wont be an A",1
"lectures were very clear. He only tests on what was covered in class, but you must understand everything to do well.",1
"I actually didn't mind this class, everything is clear and straight forward. She allows you to submit late assignments but don't make it a habit. Her quizzes and exams can be found online but you still have to complete virtual labs and discussion posts. The discussion posts are pretty long, but you can honestly just copy the PowerPoint.",1
"Professor Benfield made this rigorous class enjoyable. It's a very writing intensive class, so expect that. She gives great feedback and overall, wants her students to succeed. This class is challenging, but getting a good grade is not impossible. I am grateful of all that I learned under Prof. Benfield, and would gladly take this course again.",1
Best professor I've ever taken. I loved coming to her classes and her choice of reading assignments. Easy A.,1
"omg i suffered throughout this whole class. I bought all these materials for basically nothing. She tells you to buy all these colors. You only need one of each trust me. All the hw is drawing and painting which I suck at. Beba herself is a nut but she's understanding so it evens out. Overall, I did not like this class but it was a gen ed so idk",1
"She is the best accounting professor I have ever had. She sets up class in a way where she lectures, but you do the work too. The homework she gives is completely relevant as it preps you for the exams. Accounting can be a hard subject so it is very important to have a professor who knows how to teach. She would always answer my questions perfectly",1
I loved Mrs. Fletcher!! She was a wonderful teacher! I did struggle through her class but without her I probably would've failed.,1
"He is a really good professor. He gives very specific feedback of the group assignment and quiz. His exam is very easy, just ask questions like some formula variables meanings. But his team assignments are a little bit hard. The most important thing is DO NOT MISSING ANY CLASS. He has no ppt, so you must take notes that is important content in exam",1
Very knowledgeable professor. He knows his stuff. Only problem is that he goes too fast when showing his slides. His exams are half the quiz and half class notes. Very hard class. Must be willing to memorize a lot of information.,0
I loved this class so much! The exercises he used for the Actor and the Moment were quirky and so much fun. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in theatre.,1
"Pat McKean is a very hard working individual who does his best to be forthright and honest as possible. I will make myself as clear as possible. If you show up, do your work, and actually put effort into the work you do, you will do very well in his class. If you are lazy student who won't show up and doesn't do your work, you will be eaten alive. ",1
He thinks his students know the same things as he does! does a poor job explaining anything in detail. wouldn't take him again and his tests are hard!,0
"She's awesome and super nice. It's a pretty easy class to begin with, but she throws in stuff we probably didn't learn before so we don't get bored. I took it as a Hybrid but the amount of work was easy to balance with everything else.",1
"Mrs. Noland was such a great teacher! She gave lots of good feedback, sent weekly reminders of the things coming up for that week, wanted your best and was willing to help if needed. I also appreciated how she gave us the freedom to choose the topics for all of our speeches (only 3 total) and learn more about things we find interesting. She's great",1
"The only redeeming factor of this ""seminar"" is that you don't have to attend to get an A.",0
"BEST TEACHER EVER! This is a difficult class that involves TONS of memorization, but he uses notes handouts for study tools and everything comes straight off of the notes. He's funny, easy to get along with, and knows a lot! It's hard, but definitely worth taking!",1
"Pretty awkward guy.  Monotone lectures. HOWEVER, i really enjoyed this class. He is there for you, answers questions you have and is helpful.  had him for 120 and 121. his 220 class didn't fit my schedule but i definitely would've taken his class if i could've. I really recommend this instructor. P.S. his awkward character + random stories  FUNNY",1
"I wouldn't really recommend him because he has a thick accent and made it really hard to understand him a lot. Plus the material was really dry and he couldn't engage our class a lot. There literally was no sound in our class, just him talking. Take someone else!",0
"Fabulous!  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll definitely be inspired!",1
Erin is super friendly and one of the better TA's I had at UW-Madison. She will do her best to answer any question. Likes to use a lot of Spanish music which is a plus. Pretty cute too.,1
"Professor Murata is a wonderful teacher and she's very intelligent. However, if you want an easy class this isn't it. Her workload and expectations are through the roof and she is a pretty tough grader. That being said, she made me a much better writer in 4 short months than I ever was in 4 years of high school. You WILL learn with her!",1
"Wonderful teacher, made a tough subject easy to understand. Pay attention and you will pass. Better than other electricity teachers on campus or so I've heard. Make your life a lot easier and take this class.",1
She's really not that bad. If you go to class and make sure you get a study buddy or get in a group you are good. You have to focus and take good notes during class because there is only one test and it's the final worth 50% of your grade. Overall I only had the class once a week and it was really nice. If you're willing to go to class its worth it,1
"this is a tough class, you really have to be dedicated in your work to pass. Getting an A isnt impossible since i surprisingly got one. LOTS of hw. She talks fast in lec but go bc participation points could add into ur final grade as EC. 4 lab and lec tests. final isnt cumulative. study guides dont really help. good luck!",1
i never showed up cause his lectures were boring and i couldn't keep my eyes open. So i would procrastinate and i still pulled an A in the class cause he has a policy where he drops all of ur lowest grades if you score high on the final. Would recommend 10/10,1
Love this class! Professor Hernandez is caring and gives feedback on time and make sure you understand the materials. Just make sure you did all the homework problems and you sure will pass the class and have a good grade.,1
"Terrible terrible teacher!! Very disappointed with her teaching methods, tests are hard and confusing I can't believe I ended up with a D I wouldn't take her again!!",0
"She's seriously an awesome teacher - willing to work with any student to help them get a better grade; even if it's turning in a paper a little late. She's interesting, helpful, funny, charismatic and EXTREMELY intelligent. She kind of reminds me of Temperance Brennan from the shoe Bones, but a lot less conceited. TAKE HER CLASSES! You won't regret",1
"You do not learn much in her class. She is a bad teacher. She lectures very little and the class structure is very disorganized. She knows the info but does not transmitted well to students. She does not know how to teach. This is a self-taught class. At least, she is very easy and her tests are very short. Most of the class is just busy work.",0
Dr. Liu is an amazing professor.,1
"Hands down, best accounting professor. Her lectures are very self explanatory & if you get lost or don't understand don't be afraid to ask questions she is glad to go over it. Has extra credit opportunities throughout semester. Overall a great professor, has a passion for accounting and if you put in the work and time you will pass the class.",1
1. He does not understand a thing about what he's teaching;    2. He does not understand your codes either;    3. Constantly asks for help from the student next to him and 'his old friend'--google;    4. Takes points off for no reason he could explain;    5. Read directly from class notes he posts;    6. Can't prepare you ready for anything.,0
really boring.... no will to come to class,0
"Amazing teacher! I took her for an 8 week summer course and was nervous about so many speeches and tests in a short time. She is a motivator. She will help you in the direction you want the speech to go. She made the most dreaded class for most absolutely great. If you try, you will do well. ",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. Mahosky, she really cares about Disability Studies and has a lot of experience. Lots of writing in this class but most are just opinion based so they are not terrible.",1
"Mr. Gerritsen is an amazing professor and overall just a really good guy. He wants to see effort and if you put the effort in, you will be rewarded. Not only does he have a great understanding of biology, he tries to go above and beyond for his students and teach his students life lessons that no one else does. Genuinely cares!!!!",1
"Terry Miller-Herringer is an AWESOME professor! She is always friendly, helpful, and accommodating to students. She presents the course material in an understandable way and really sets the students up for success. I would recommend taking ANY of her classes!",1
He is a great teacher.,1
"He's a pretty funny guy but won't answer questions one on one (emailing him, after class or if you go to see him during office hours). Overall he is an ok prof but he doesn't like to support students. For example, if you ask him a specific questions or problem you having, his response will be ""Read the textbook and review your notes from class"".",1
Dra. Graves was super nice. You can tell that she really enjoys teaching and she's travelled to tons of Spanish-speaking countries so she knows a lot. She's tries to make the class fun and always plays good music at the beginning,1
Awesome prof!,1
"everyone seems to be complaining about her, but she really isn't that bad. Class got cancelled half the time but we still had to assignments from home that were due at the time class was normally over. Those are easy because you can work with a friend. so just have a smart friend in the class. you don't need the book, but you need the course reader",1
"Took Business programming and software development, lectures are clear and he expects you to do according to his specifications, the sky forest project is not east but he is very helpful",1
"Dr. Zhao was a very good professor!  The lectures prepared us well for exams, and the homework was also helpful and not too difficult. He also posts study guides on blackboard which outline the topics on the exams.",1
"My only class out of 5 for the semester that did not adjust to this ongoing, world-wide pandemic. I let her know my work schedule was not consistent due to the virus, and my internet connection was terrible and I was not able to do my work because everyone in my area is home. Work is also due by 8 and not midnight, and assignments almost every day.",0
Great teacher. Very helpful. Pretty easy. Recommend you take his class.,1
"She does lecture, however, she makes the class go by fast! I loved her and everyone in class enjoyed having her as a professor!! She knows the material and teaches well! She is respectful and professional. This gives students the confidence and the motivation to work hard and achieve their goals! TAKE HER!!!",1
She wants you to get a good grade. Lenient in grading and wants you to learn. Encourages in class participation and goes over material clearly before exams. Great prof if 211 is your last Spanish.,1
"She's a very eccentric teacher and is funny because she's very forward and blunt.  She tells you exactly what will be on the test, so it's easy to get a good grade.  She is very willing to show you how to work problems and will help you any time if needed. She is also funny...her behavior, and she's only like 4 foot something...tiny little Indian.",1
"She is a horrible professor, absolutely horrible. She tell you you're doing something wrong and will tell you how bad something is embarrass you in front of the class and not even help you to do better. She always brags about how much experience she has yet it doesn't show. I have never met a professor that almost every student has a problem with.",0
"A nice guy but not a great professor. Exams were hard, not enough time, made up 85% of grade, you needed to remember EVERY topic he taught in class. His bad microphone made lectures hard to listen to. Idk the other Econ 302 professors, he was good not great. Dropped lowest midterm grade, HW was easy. He was nice to give a 1% curve at semester end.",0
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER. She is by far the worst professor i've ever taken. No one in my lab passes with an A. Her averages on her lab quizzes were always 6/10. Her lab quizzes are extremely hard and she's a tough grader when it comes to lab reports.,0
"Her test questions are taken word for word directly from the book, and have nothing at all to do with her lectures.",1
His class ROCKS!!!,1
"He's a young, down to earth dude who understands what it's like to be a student. His teaching style is straight forward. If you do the homework, do the quizzes, and study you should be fine for the test. He makes you work for a good grade though.",1
Was her first semester teaching Crim Pro. Slides were very helpful. Exam wasn't bad. Essay was one of those you can never finish bc of some many issues. She was a good teacher. Would take another class with her.,1
"Wanda Jones is a very nice lady, you can tell she genuinely cares about her students. However, I would not recommend her to anybody. Her teaching style is not adequate for this course. She requires you to show up to every lecture, yet she rarely ever lectures. You have to teach yourself and if you get stuck she is not really good at clarification.",0
Just amazing ��,1
"Great professor, great class.",1
Brown is very passionate about Ecology which makes me very passionate about Ecology. His lectures are very entertaining and are pretty much straight out of the book. Read the book before a test and then you'll do good. His tests are very challenging but not impossible. You will be working for your grade.,1
material is challenging but he makes it easy to understand and emphasizes important topics. take good notes during lecture and you won't need the book. LOTS of tedious hw on MyLab; ask for more time if you need it (within reason). email > canvas. lots of personal life tangents but it makes him more personable in my opinion.,1
"Great TA. Super awkward, but doesn't mean too. No one talked in the class so she had no idea what to do. She does take attendance with a sign in sheet. I went up to her saying I was doing pretty bad (C) because of the test and she asked if i needed extra credit. Bumped up my grade. Very caring, very cool.",1
"I thought she was pretty good. Her lectures are kinda boring. I didnt read the textbook, just do her study guides because its basically the same as the test (I usually found the study guide answers on a quizlet)She says shes a hard grader but I got As on both the papers we had to write. Go to class bc she gives random extra credit!!",1
"I took Janey at UVU and she is SOOO good. The class is challenging, as is learning any new language, but she is helpful and knows the material. If you come to every class and are GENUINELY trying, she will bend over backward to make sure you are successful. She always responds to emails within a few hours. Can't say enough about her!",1
"Definitely my favorite professor, Im about to take my 3rd class with her. Its important to show up to class and participate. If you study what she tells you to and do the homework youll do good.",1
Has an excuse for everything and does NOT give useful study tools! He even brought his daughter to class during a midterm which was very distracting. Would not recommend this prof. He is a nice guy though,0
"Great prof who is passionate about teaching. If you ask a question after class, be sure that you have time for the answer b/c she will talk for days. Nice, approachable, smart and fair, exactly what I hope for in profs. Her exam is moderate and if you kept up all semester, you shouldnt have too much of an issue doing well. Do the reading!",1
This was a fun class and not stressful.,1
"Clear instructions, simple weekly discussion posts, easy assignments, and three online exams. There is a lot of material given as a resource and the book is definitely handy (most of the discussions/assignments come from the book). Overall, clearcut online course that gets you an easy A. She is also helpful with email questions and grades fair.",1
I HATE public speaking but this class was amazing! You do have to find 12 people for your speeches! There's 3 speeches and she breaks them down to help. It did take a while for her to get grades in but she mentioned health problems at the beginning of the semester. She wants you to pass and her assignments show that. 10/10 recommend!,1
"This class was very straightforward and easy. We had to purchase an online textbook that had the course system build in. We had a discussion every week based on the chapter we read in the book. We had a test every 4 chapters we read. Overall, the class was very easy and informational.",1
"Great professor. Very knowledgeable. He has an MTax, MAcc, MBA. He teaches and works at a local accounting firm. He knows what it is like to be busy and is willing to work with you if you need extra help or start to fall behind. His classes are fun and informative. I hope to take many more classes from him, especially if Dixie gets an MTax program.",1
"Horrible teacher, offers to help but never takes you up on the offer, i emailed him several times for help on the final paper and never received an email back. Then has the nerve to give a bad grade. Also takes up the entire class time talking about nothing and yet attendence is mandatory? He enjoys hearing himself speak about literaly nothing.",0
easy a,1
"You're grade is mostly from exams, so take them seriously! Spend a lot of time studying, PAL helped me ace my Lab Practicals. Read the book, because although most of the exam is from lecture, the book really helps you understand the lecture better! Take advantage of Lab time. It's hard, but if you put in the effort, you can succeed. ",1
"TAKE HIM! Pat is a true career and life mentor. He encourages students to go after big stories, even if sources seem unattainable to new writers, instills journalism ethics, praises those who listen and seek advice. Pat is always willing to write letters of rec for scholarships and internships and always helps find other journalism opportunities.",1
"Rusty is great!  The material is a little confusing at times but if you go to class, he notices and is willing to help you. I also took him for 211 and he was also just as helpful!",1
"Absolutely awful! Was extremely disorganized and appeared confused by the material when questioned about it in class. Very dry to listen too, as well likes to say the word 'um' or 'uh' several times in a sentence. Two assignments were easy, however, her exam is over email which makes me nervous as she appears to have no skill with technology.",0
Professor Daigle has got to be one of the most difficult professors I have ever had. He doesn't care whether you get a F or an A in the class. I'm sure there's better teachers at the mental institutions. there is only 3 grades the whole semester and its insanely hard test. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MR. PAUL DAIGLE! he's a trash can,0
Good class. Pretty easy. Hartman's a good professor.,1
"He's really funny and his lectures are interesting, but he's hands down the hardest grader I have ever had in my life. I never get B's on papers and my oh my. But apart for that as long as you read, take notes, come to class and participate, you'll be fine.",1
"Being a psychology major, I had taken her previously last year (first class on campus) and have noticed a significant difference in her demeanor and teaching rapport. Communication with her is rare at best and instructions on assignments are susceptible to changing weekly. Only recommend to those with lots of open time for studying.",0
"Very hard,does not give no breaks do not take his class,he does not give feedback. You will fail his class!!",0
"ALa,gk, is such a good teacher and human. She is easily accessible and understanding if you need her help. The work load is fun and light . Math can be tough, she only gives a couple of math assignments with none on the final.",1
"He's a talker so take lot's of notes. He gives about 1 quiz a week and sometimes it's a pop quiz so make sure you know what's going on. No tests other than the final and for that you just need to review your quizes so make sure you have the right answers. He gives some easy assignments, but doesn't grade them just for class use so do them for credt",1
"Just one word ""amazing""",1
"One of the best professors I've had in my college career. Among his strengths that really sets him apart from other professors is that he sets clear expectations, so you know exactly what to expect in his classes, and how much (and what) to study for his exams. Very professional, consistent, and caring.",1
Very nice teacher. Have your book or just take notes.. Passed easily with an A..,1
"I loved Mr.Nelson! He is a very sweet old man and he really does care about his students. He is willing to sit down and help you with whatever questions you might have, his hand writting is alittle messy but overall easy to understand. I would recommned his class to anyone!",1
"Super nice, and his accent is pretty easy to understand, but his artistic range is pretty outdated and limited. We're still doing PowerPoint-style gradients and physical portfolios instead of web portfolios. Maybe if someone revamps the department up to the current decade students would be better prepared for a real career.",1
"Bulinski really is  a fabulous teacher.  She's passionate, kind and very knowledgeable about the subject.  Her lectures are chock full of information you need to know, so try to take thorough notes - she goes quickly, so you're going to need to adapt to that.  Her test are pretty tough, but definitely passable with decent studying beforehand.  ",1
"SHOW UP TO CLASS!!!! While I loved her class, showing up was essential. Not only did you miss her lectures but you missed her talking about related subjects and movies that she was showing. Also, if you show up to every class for the semester (and talk to her/ask for help on the final paper) then she will most likely let you out of the final.",1
"I liked learning about health, since my brother studied that in college. The discussions were the best part, since people made thoughtful insights on controversial topics. The quizzes were fun, as were the exams. The exams took some thinking, so you need to study the study guides to do well on them.",1
The workload for this class was way too much. Many late nights were spent working on this class when I shouldve been focused on classes related to my major. Attendance is a must. Shes a very harsh grader. Be prepared to spend 1/2 the class talking about BS. After wasting class time she will throw in assignments at the end. Class never ends early.,0
Mr Woods is a very good instructor.  He gives great feed back on papers and allows you to be able to receive the best grade if you just listen to his advice.  I would take over and over again.,1
Ms. Parker is a teacher that has you teach yourself but expects you to be at every class. She tends to have favorite and tends to them more than the rest of the class. She gets mad when she has to answer questions from people who arent her favorites and usually makes the rest of the class figure it out themselves.,0
Most of these reviews of her here are not very accurate and are way too harsh. Professor Bauman is great. Work hard and listen in class and it will pay off. Her class is very interesting and shes a great person and teacher. She is very helpful but can be a strict grader.,1
"Great Professor! Extremely helpful, and very easy class! Take Professor Galan! His class is fun, he's very funny, and a really nice professor.",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. Doesn't make students memorize meaningless information like most teachers.  He teaches you how it is in the real world. Classes are more of a discussion than a lecture  Open book tests,  and his grading is very fair.",1
"She moves fast in lecture and lectures almost directly from the book. I ended up teaching myself more from the textbook, but that's pretty terrible too. Lots of homework and tests are unpredictable (no practice exams)! If you take this class, be sure to be in a study group from the beginning. You're gonna need it.",0
She has a clear criteria on written assignments and will make the assignments reasonable and doable as long as you put the effort in. Her exams could be quite tough since it's a lot of information. She's try to help you as much as she can but you need to reach out for her for help.,1
She arbitrarily takes points off for small things that don't even affect the final answer. Very confusing and rude when students ask her questions she thinks they should know. It's tough material but she flies through it and doesn't help that much. She was also gone for a month and we had a sub and she didn't review what we all basically failed. ,0
Obviously there is a lot of presentation.  Feedback is helpful.  One main project with a paper and powerpoint and 7 minute presentation for the final.  Smaller assignments and group projects due throughout the course.,1
Fowler is an interesting lecturer (animated and energetic) BUT it's really hard to understand what one is supposed to take away from her lectures.  The final for Fall 04 was KILLER.  If you take this class know EVERYTHING for the final b/c she tests on really obscure poems that we didn't discuss.,1
"Dr. Watts is an amazing professor, she was very laid back and interacted well with the class. She gives amazing feedback on your essays and if you ever need help she will always answer emails or will meet in her office. She super nice and a great professor to take English with.",1
"MY FAVORITE TEACHER EVER. such a sweet woman. she helps in every way possible, and makes sure all your assignments are done before giving you your final grade. very flexible, and understanding. TAKE HER CLASSES",1
Dr. Amey is probably one of the most responsive professors I've had for online classes. Had a lot of trouble with the WileyPlu site and didn't hear from him from weeks at times. If I had a question he answered it quickly and was really laid back on the tests due to the many problems we were having with the website.,1
"Really nice class for one of my first being a DE Student. Class was online and strictly through MyMathLab, which allowed multiple attempts on HW questions and 2 attempts for the quiz after. Depending on holidays, she gives extensions for the long homework assignments. She also gives a lot of reminders so you get your homework completed! Recommend.",1
"He is the best professor ever in Fullerton College. Show up take good notes and you won't fail, you can use your notes during the tests and finals. Seriously he is the best professor I've ever have for math especially when I struggle in math, go to the math lab for extra credit and keep up with the homework it will help you. Hands down take him.",1
"the professor was very helpful. She made the class interesting and is willing to help students. She answers any questions. Her class is made up of quizzes, and discussions. It is recommended to show up to every class for notes. Quizzes are based on the lectures. She is a great teacher. I would recommend students to take her class.",1
I had Professor Z for Physical science and really liked him so I decided to take him for geography. He is a super nice man and is very knowledgeable about science. He always answered every email in a timely manner and let me do a make up test last minute. He is very accommodating. His tests are very HARD. His study guides are only phrases.,1
She's a pleasant lady but she expects you to remember waaaaay too specific of material that isn't relevant to archaeology. It's more just memorization.,1
Super easy class. Watched movies every now and then.  No tests at all. Lets you out super early. Not always straight forward but a super easy grader and lenient on late work.  Looking for an easy A? TAKE THIS CLASS ,1
"She is AMAZING! You'll miss out on your undergrad experience if you miss out on Yates. You DO have to put work into it...attend lecture, etc. She doesn't test you on anything she hasn't taught you, so as long as you follow her study guides (And study them) you'll be good to go. Again, she gives you these study guides before each lecture.",1
"Very nice lady. Pretty much an easy A. Gives you about 8 essays, no penalty if you hand in late work. She allows you to pick you own essay topic. Also NO textbook needed!! Took her Spring '11",1
"Engaging professor, great class. Start your research paper early! Really enjoyed Prof Anderson.",1
"For an art teacher she does not promote artistic writing. She is judgemental and taps into students personal affairs, not only must you teach yourself the material she grades easily. The woman is very one sided and not interested in her students ideas.",0
"Worst I've ever had. She doesn't give any bullet points for the tests, the material is extremely long with tons of new scientific terms. She reviews the chapters AFTER the test is taken, which proves her lack of professionalism. Gives you Ds and Fs no matter how well you do the homework and refuses to give clear explanaitons. She will ruin your GPA",0
"She's really nice and cool, knows a lot. The class was kind of boring in my opinion. All powerpoint lectures",1
"Great teacher makes everyone feel comfortable when it comes to presenting, she helps you a lot and gives a lot of feedback the only way to dial her class is if you don't do anything at all.",1
"The class is easy if you have programming experience(any kind of C is even more helpful). He gives extra credit opportunities for doing extra programming on lab/homework assignments and is helpful if  you can not get something working, just make sure to address it before its due.",1
Is an excellent professor and I wish to have her again for all of my classes. She's the best.,1
"I'm not even finished with the semester yet, but I just hafd to leave this review. Adam is an amazing professor. He is very clear, straightforward and in-depth. With all of the math teachers I've taken over my life, he is the best. He explains things in a variety of ways to make sure you understand. Isnt afraid to slow the course down if you dont.",1
"Im really bad at math so I was honestly confused the majority of time in this class, his way of teaching was different than what I am used to, and his creation of GERMDAS was even more confusing. He was funny though, if you are good at math already you wont have any problems with this class.",1
"Kim is a nice and down to earth guy BUT he never answers emails, he confuses himself when he talks, and he goes through the lecture so fast. The class is a teach yourself course and half online. There are three tests, 10 connect HWs (one extra credit), and different assignments here and there.",0
I LOVE THIS WOMAN! her class was a little exhausting (shakespeare) but Laura is such a gem. she makes the class interesting and will keep you engaged throughout the semester. she really gives good feedback and her office hours are so helpful. would take her again if i could!,1
"Fowler is a fine, quirky professor. I personally enjoyed her class, but some people found her lectures to be cloudy and non-topical. All in all, she is a great professor for those who are confident with the abilities of their TA.",1
"Okay, relatively easy class.  Proffessor Brandt however does not attend office hours, his quizzes the 'TA's make' are made by the book and are ONLINE (with the answers), and he overall doesn't seem to care about his students. The tests are about 50% quiz questions and 50% lecture questions which you can get from the power points he posts online",0
A very boring lecturer. ,1
"I was taking this class for a minor and it was a waste of time. I could have taken it online. Dr. Lynn is so nice and fun to chat with, but she sometimes seemed to be learning the material at the same time she was teaching it... She wants everyone to do well. Tests and homework are online. It's hard to fail!",1
"He's a bit snooty and pretentious. He has sometimes discredited film as ""art"". The philosophy book you have to read is super confusing. He is also a bit extra for an assignment where you have to write four sentences (ie it's not even an essay or anything), we had to print it out as apparently handwritten is not good enough for him.",0
"I took Scott for Calculus III during Spring 2018, and he was great. I felt like the tests accurately covered the material that was covered in class, and they were fair. He did curve one midterm, which the curve was very fair. He was always helpful and was good at explaining the material when you needed extra help. Overall, a very good choice!",1
Dr. Goodyear is an engaging communicator and fun guy to be in class with. He is unbiased in presenting different political idealogies and can turn what may be a boring subject for some into an interseting and interactive class period. I highly recommend him for any poltiical science course. I will take him any time I can.,1
Dr Delius is one of the best professors I've had at Fordham. Her assignments are actually fun to do and her lectures are very interesting. Participation matters a lot though and can seriously affect your grade. Highly recommend taking Urbanism with her.,1
She is by far the best professor I've had.  Her lectures were interesting and she has a great sense of humor.  I enjoyed going to class,1
"Mr. Boyer was an awesome professor! He made Math114 so easy; definitely and ""easy A"" class. I would definitely recommend taking him for this class.",1
Must do assignment. Not allowed to go against her ideologies,0
"She is very disrespectful to students in lecture and lab. She's a hard grader and will take points off any little mistake you do on exams. Her extra credit isn't all that good and won't really help you out. However, I do love her PowerPoints on each lecture but some PowerPoints are way too long for no reason. I wouldn't want to take her again.",0
"BE PREPARED TO READ A LOT! I understand this is college and there will be a lot of reading, but the amount of reading he assigns is crazy! He had us read about 6 articles 20+ each for an essay, and at the same time he wanted us to read 4 other articles 30+ pages each for our discussions. I've done more work in this class any class I've taken. ",0
She was eccentric in her teaching style but made class interesting. Very down to earth and relatable.  I would take her again!,1
Read chapters over&over. Do Learn Smart quiz over and over. Ask questions in class & participate. DR schwartz is misunderstood. Work hard & he will help. I passed & retook quiz(got lower grade).Good teacher will get better. Nice guy. Gives extra credit & 2nd quiz could raise grade. I have A. Go over models in lab. I speak up to much. He respects.,1
"I tried to give him a chance throughout the year and not be mean on this website but he is  the worst professors i have taken my entire 3 years in college...... WAY to much work, unrealistic expectations for class, and in my opinion is your students are consistently failing your test and you have to cure them by 30 plus % then something is wrong!  ",0
"My favorite professor at West Chester. She is so helpful and kind, and makes a dry subject interesting. The bulk of your grade is a research paper and she helps you along the way so that it isn't so overwhelming. She is a must-take professor. She's always available and is really fun and sweet too. Love her!",1
Awesome teacher not big on due dates however if you fall behind it's a great deal to catch up there isn't anything doesn't know about english very willing to help teach you if you are willing to learn,1
He is very nice and knowledgeable about the subject.,1
"I don't know if he'll teach 290 again, but if he does, the combination of his great teaching ability, knowledge, and the funness of the topic of modern physics makes it so that noone should turn down the chance to take that elective.  Don't let himself or anyone else lie to you either--he is not a difficult teacher, and taking his classes will help",1
"Unfortunately, I agree with a lot of the other comments -- if I was going to skip a day of econ, it was always Marty's lecture. Attendance isn't really necessary; you can easily fly by using the powerpoints online -- even the reviews were kind of pointless. She is very nice and does offer a ton of extra credit, so at least her course is bearable.",1
The professor was really great and hilarious!! I would recommend taking notes when he lectures so you can use them as a study guide because he goes based off mostly notes. I highly recommend this class to anyone wanting to take a history class.,1
Very hard to understant do to her accent.  Class was taught at a graduate level over our heads.  Did not like answering questions.,0
"This prof. is the best I have ever had for history. He is very passionate about his job and relates history with the real world. He can grades the essay very easy, but the multiple choices are a little tough if you are not paying attention in class. Gives extra credit also. Recommend this teacher highly",1
"Dr. Pittman is by far one of the sweetest and most highly educated professors I've had. I have her for Comparative Religion and Cultural Geography, both good classes. Her lectures are very interesting and packed with interesting, but it's not always relevant to the online quizzes and tests. Overall, wonderful woman and professor!",1
"Alyssa is incredible and makes sure that all students are confident in their work. Despite the numerous papers and homework, the deadlines are reasonable and she is always easy to contact. Great professor (don't forget your jellybeans)!!!",1
Professor Rauschnabel is hands down one of my favorite professors I have ever taken. He loves digital marketing and wants to see his students succeed. Very understanding and gives great feedback. Would highly recommend taking this course!,1
"She is a nice professor who really cares her students. She gives extra credit projects to improve ones grade. She has lots of knowledge about Chemistry. Do study !!, and it is an easy A.",1
Mr. Lovio was GREAT he is an easy teacher and makes class so much fun. I missed 4 classes and turned in all my homework assignments late and still passed the class. He is A wonderful teacher and has lots of knowledge.,1
"Course consists of daily lectures from PowerPoint slides, occasional class activities based on nutrition/diet, 4 exams, and a presentation. Grading criteria is very straightforward and Dr. Ferrero is super smart. Be sure to pay attention, participate, and review the exam study guides for an A!",1
"Such a great professor. He is passionate about what he does which is the most important thing. He made a subject I didn't find particularly interesting in neuroscience (sensorimotor system) really interesting, and he's so cute! Very knowledgable, and sweet.",1
Lots of work outside of lab.,0
Seemed like a good guy. Was willing to stay late with students like me who wanted to really get this stuff.,1
very good prof would recommend. raised GPA but requires work,1
Throughout this class I questioned if Dr Lee really knows what he is talking about? Maybe things are lost in translation but content he is teach is just plain wrong.,0
"Dr. Currier was an amazing instructor for Micro lab.  I wish I could have had her for lecture also.  She was very helpful & always willing to answer any questions.  This is a tough class, but she made it much more manageable.  I highly recommend her for Micro as it is a very tough class.",1
"Professor Pearce is a nice guy, but he didn't do well transitioning online due to COVID-19. His lectures were long and boring, which was hard to deal with online. I feel like I didn't learn anything from his class. Do not take his class if you are not good at teaching yourself the lessons.",0
Great Professor with a wonderful personality.  If you ask a question about advertising you know he is well versed in the category and is more than willing to answer questions.,1
Professor Jones made psychology interesting and fun to learn! I highly recommend this professor due to his engaging and hilarious lectures!,1
First let me start by saying this professor wants you to think in his frame of mind. Many classmates would not participate because he would shut their answers down. Repeated himself quite often. He also will fail you if you miss 2 classes. He was aware of situation and went back on his word and failed me anyway with no explanation stopped replying.,0
Really explains things well and gives you help when you need it.,1
Hate all the class activities waste of time and exhausting just stick to material keep it simple,0
Good Professor.  Provides good directions for completing assignments.  Those that do not read the requirements will have issues as many of my classmates did.,1
"She is passionate and give the best of her on class. She helps a lot but she grades are hard, fair but hard. The best teacher I had.",1
"Great Professor, very smart guy! This is an ID course, Not an easy A and lots of work!  If you think Nanotechnology sounds cool, don't take this class.  If you are an engineering student or have taken chemistry or calculus you might enjoy this.  Very informative but not fun. I think the only bad grades are those who don't attend.?.?",1
Professor Worrall really cares about her students. The course work is fairly easy and allows a decent amount of creative freedom. Overall this was a fun (and not too stressful) class!,1
"Searfoss isnt a bad professor, shes just very opinionated and doesnt really care about other peoples opinion. Nightly reading but if you read cliff notes youll be good. A few pop quizzes if she notices people arent participating and reading.",1
She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had!  She goes through the material very fast; the problems we do in class to practice are nothing like the problems on the test.  I think she intentionally tries to confuse everyone.  Do not take her if you don't have to!,1
"Dr. Bouzouita is extremely good at what she does. Please don't listen to what these other comments say. She has study guides which replicates many of the problems she has on the exams. If you study, you will be fine. Finance isn't the easiest class in the world, but Dr. B does a fine job teaching the course.",1
Professor Kildea is the best professor ever! He is SOOO nice. He is SOOO funny. I love him so much! <3333,1
Great class do the readings and hw and quiz and you will pass!,1
Knew he would be a great time when he walked in with awesome energy.,1
"She wasn't bad at all. My biggest issue is the homework. She will definitely assign homework at like 10:45 and ask it to be done the next day. Once she assigned it that morning. Personally, I think she expects too much during class but it works out in the final exams.",1
"Dr. Ryner is scary smart. He thinks like no one else I have ever met, and I mean that in a good way! He is probably one of the most intriguing and kind professors at ASU. Admittedly, the theory he introduces can be hard to grasp at first, and his papers, while short, are still rather hard. However, it's worth it. Also, he's always there to help!",1
Aren is really helpful and always makes lectures interesting. The topic changes each week which keeps the class moving and prevents you from being bored,1
Hes really nice and caring. He keeps the class interesting and he cares about his students and their learning. I would definitely recommend taking his class,1
"Stephen Is my all time favorite math teacher. He teaches at a great pace and explains concepts in an organized simple way. However, I did not like the online math 111 class. If you are very good at math then go for it. If you are not good with math then never take and online one.",1
"His online Abnormal Psych class is split into 5 modules, where each module takes about 3-4 weeks. Each module contains about three discussions about case studies or other topics, and every other week, there is a quiz in which answers come right from the textbook or video lectures. Very generous professor!",1
"Thick accent and just moves to hard tricky problems to give for your test. Has a complicated grading system of extra credit and quizzes and tests.  Really beware of pop quizzes, it used to be open book, then it wasn't. Multiple choice tests-very hard and no partial credit for problems (150 pts)",0
"She is such a nice lady, she even bought us donuts on exam day!! There is reading assigned to be done before each class but interesting so not too bad. She wants to hear your feedback and wants her students to do well. Grade is pretty much just 2 exams which are straightforward and clicker quizzes which are super easy! She also offers extra credit",1
"Extremely nice teacher, approachable. She replies to email quickly. BEST to go to class, she test on things discussed in class. Attendance is mandatory. Overall, awesome teacher. Easy A if you study and listen in class!",1
Dr. Wigginton is not a good professor and will ruin your whole semester. She has never responded to any of my emails and during class says she doesnt work Friday - Monday so we need to ask all questions in class vs. email. I went to her office hours twice and she wasnt there. Class content is easy but I hate the way she talks down to us.,0
"She doesn't mind helping students during her office hours, however she made a lot of mistakes when teaching in class which then will confuse you a lot.  If you want to do well, attend her office hours, she might give you a hint what will be on the mid term, which happened to my friend. Overall, not a great prof. Come on U of T!!!",0
She acts like this course is the most important course of your life. She is very rude to students and yells at you if you try to leave early. She definitely has a superiority complex and took this job so she could bully students who need her class. She gets even worse after the drop date passes. She knows were stuck with her So she makes it hell,0
"Literally the best teacher I have had. Supported me through class and beyond. Is passionate about both learning and teaching how biology can cure some of the most difficult health problems. Her class is designed so that you can learn which ever way is easiest for you, tests are fair yet tough, and you have chances to recover from a poor grade.",1
overall interesting class. she posts weekly discussions regarding the material given. be sure to read and study for exams! she assigns a powerpoint and paper that is worth a good chunk of your grade.,1
"Very good professor. The subject is somewhat boring, but he always has a joke in his sleeves, which makes the class more enjoyable. The test are multiple choice, but sometimes too long, and if you take too much time in one or two question you're screwed. But he's a good guy and is always helpful.",1
Probably the worst experience I have ever had with a professor. I got an A in his class but still i would not suggest taking him. The amount of material you have to teach yourself is ridiculous as he chooses not to teach the material necessary on the tests. He comes off as rude and unprofessional to those who don't agree with his personal views.,0
"great guy, a bit boring and not so clear sometimes. but sometimes can be great",1
I had a rough time this quarter (personal stuff) and Professor Nedd was super supportive the whole time.  If you struggle at all in his class he'll go out of his way to help. He's passionate about his subject (esp. Russian art) and was engaging and entertaining. Definitely the best art history experience I've had so far.,1
Tests are impossible unless you can memorize tons of reading. Tests are almost all essays and he is a harsh grader. Also he is BORING and it's hard to pay attention during his lectures.,1
Really consider before taking her. She doesn't do a very good job explaining the material and her PPTs are bad. You have to read the book if you want to pass because her lectures aren't good. She gives you a list of possible essay questions on the test so answer them before hand and send them to her so you know how she wants. She's kinda rude.,1
I loved this class.  I found it super easy to follow...call me a nerd but I really liked the formulas :D  He is super helpful and really wants his students to succeed.,1
"By far, she is the most warm and welcoming professor I've had in college. She provides great feedback and excellent story telling when it comes to lectures. I couldn't imagine taking psychology classes with anyone else.",1
Excellent professor. He was very helpful and provides great feedback.,1
I took a class that was a boring subject but he somehow made it interesting. Super funny and laid back.,1
"She believed in not using powerpoints to assist her lectures, so it's important to go to class and be able to organize your own notes. I found the discussion questions that she posted for every reading to be extremely helpful when I use them. The weekly papers, though long, helped a lot. Just be ready for roughly 16 pages of philosophy every night.",1
She is a great teacher! I had night classes and she keep me awake and interested. I learned so much. She helps to clarify things and is always willing help you understand something. But like with every BIO class you have to put over 12 hours outside of class if you want to do well,1
She's a great teacher. You have to attend each class because she has an exit slip worth points everyday. Build up those easy points for an easy A!,1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had! He gives 'recall' tests and they are pretty hard to pass but only because he wants you to not just memorize things but understand it fully. He is so good at explaining things, and his lectures are extremely interesting, and I am not really a psychology kind of person. I would def take classes by him again! ",1
"he is very helpful,but needs organization. Mid-term exam are fairly easy,all you have do is attend the lecture and do some problem from the homework.",1
"Just an awful experience. People are right, you do learn a lot. But it was definitely the most stressed I have ever been.",1
Best person to teach me.,1
"grade is based on a point system, not percentages. no tests or quizzes. final project and exam, but don't have to take as long as you have enough points added up by then. lot of writing assignments for homework, very interactive class.",1
"hard teacher, looooong powerpoint lectures guys a genius so i guess it just comes to him while the students blankly stare at his examples as he zooms through them. one midterm and a final. tough class make sure youre a math wiz and quick learner",0
"Melanie was a great prof, i took her English 100 Class in highschool and she made me ready to start university and excited for it. There was a lot of readings. Every Thursday she expected a written analysis for 2 different readings as well as a new essay every 2 weeks, it was manageable but stressful, to this day highest uni mark i have ever gotten",1
"Best professor ever! Passionate about her field, engages with students, clear grading criteria. Participation can make or break your grade, so make your voice heard! The rest of the grade is determined by 1 test, 1 project, and 1 final paper. Not much homework. Thank you Prof. Delius!",1
"I took philosophy as an extra class for fun and Stockton was by far the best teacher I have had. He is funny, blunt, and knows what he is talking about. If you take notes in class he has you turn them in for extra credit. I always ended up getting A's on the test because of the extra credit.",1
"I would not recommend anyone take this class online with this instructor, unless you are already fluent in Spanish. Does not teach,& does not provide feedback at all to students. DO NOT let the words ""Beginning Spanish 2"" fool you, as it is anything but beginning. All instructions are typed in Spanish. I am dropping before it ruins my 4.0 GPA.",0
"She is a GREAT teacher she trys her best to help you understand she gets to know her students on a personal bases, so she gets upset when you don't do the work but she means well. She's a great teacher I would tell anyone to get her class she's worth it.",1
"While Dr. Leflouria is a good professor, I felt as if her class was overtly opinionated. I thought I had signed up for American history, but the class I took should've been more appropriately titled American History (of slavery). The subject matter was interesting &you will know ALOT about slavery at the end of the semester. Not an easy A ",1
This is one of the easiest online classes. She has recorded lectures that you are supposed to listen to just like you're in class. She posts discussion questions that are either based on the lecture/book or on your own experience. There are also homework that are short answer questions. She is very helpful!,1
Hard Tests. Rambling Lectures. READ THE BOOK.,0
"I was nervous knowing class participation was a must and we had to sit in a circle but because it was mostly discussion it was so much more interesting then other courses I have taken. This class was too short so the papers and workload ended up creeping up quickly, but this class maintained my interest...I enjoyed it!",1
"Dr. O'Quinn is incredibly intelligent and this shines through in lecture, but never in a way that seems cocky. He genuinely tries to make harder ideas more accessible - for instance, he will use simple ideas that build off of one another to lead you to a difficult concept. I would absolutely recommend him!!",1
"I took this course over the summer. His homework is online, and he lectures the whole time in class. He is a fair teacher, if you do the work and pay attention during lecture, you should pass. He is also open to questions and answers. One big project at the end of the semester, but other than that, the class wasn't difficult. He was a great teacher",1
"I can't see how anyone can not like him! Having to take religion, I only took him and refused anyone else. I thought it would be religion shoved at you but no, it's the values and theology behind them. Plus, you learn a lot of valuable life lessons. It's the one gen.ed class I didn't mind at all and think everyone should take. WONDERFUL professor!",1
"I found her to be a wonderful, warm person who was willing to help anyone and did. I was impressed with her and was quickly able to pick up on how many people she went out of her way to work with them on any issue. She makes you want to learn more.",1
"i thought Mattson was a great professor. he really knows his stuff.  can be a lil boring at times, but is a fair grader. i loved his class, i thought he was interesting",1
"Best french class ever, you'll learn a lot.",1
"Gerard is one of my favourite instructors. He provides thought-provoking lessons and the work he assigns really requires students to think critically, engage with their learning and self-reflect. He is easy to talk to and you can tell that he cares about his students. I really appreciate the creative approach he takes in this course and others.",1
"If you study (which you should), you'll be just fine. He is a charismatic professor who cares about his students and makes lectures interesting, I would definitely take again!",1
Doesnt provide help and your whole grade is based upon your test and quiz scores which she doesnt provide much help with. IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. One person in my class got an A 8 people had Bs and the rest failed. More than 60% of the class got D's or F's. Bad teaching. she ruined my college career,0
"The best professor at Hamilton College.  The guy keeps it real, is the most well-read person I've ever encountered in my life and goes out of his way to see to it that you are comfortable and getting the most out of Hamilton College.  There is no doubt that my education is that much better because of Rick Werner.",1
"His notes suck on the board, you cannot read them. He is kind of rude but if you just sit back and go to class its not bad. I liked how the homework was all organized out for the semester and how it was online but his test suck and are hard and LONG!!!",0
"Feel kind of bad making this review but I'm going to be honest... She's a nice professor but the workload for pre-calculus is a bit ridiculous. Anyone who has taken calculus knows that pre-calculus is basically an illegitimate subject, so to dump a huge workload of concepts that will soon be replaced is inefficient and tiresome.",0
the subject in general is super boring but so is the professor so it doesnt make it easier. Also class is not mandatory which is great but if you have zero self discipline you will never show up again and fail. the tests are all that matter especially the final you could fail everything then get an A on the final and that will be your final grade,1
"My favorite English professor of all time, she's very nice and funny. She cares about her students!",1
"I took Chem 102 with Prof. Organian a few years back and really learned a lot from her. Sadly, she has passed. RIP professor and thanks for the A grade.",1
Medlin might be my favorite professor in the law school. He's an outstanding teacher and a genuinely nice guy.,1
"MA structures this class in a way that if you want a good grade, it will consume your entire semester. I can't think of the last time I wasn't swamped and worried about what accounting homework I should be doing. She makes things seem more complicated than they are because she knows the material so well. Expect at least 20 hours of homework a week.",0
"Dr. O is a pretty good instructor. As an admin she's firm but fair unless you are like some of the dummies here who cheat and get caught. Work hard and you pass. PTA isn't rocket science but there is quite a bit of work. She's the boss of the program, so you enroll PTA at BC, Ordonez is boss. You are in good hands.",1
"Mary is great, she is so enthusiastic. English is her life and she brings herself to the students level and builds from there. Loved this women, definitely recommend her for any class.",1
"Lit. of Ethnic America was very easy, but was also easy to fall behind in. She was a good professor but her grading was all over the place. The class is reading heavy but it is easy to manage. Not much to complain about because I am taking one of her courses again.",1
"Didn't post the syllabus until a month into class, sent an email taking us all by surprise saying our reading load had doubled for the night, expects you to get make-up notes before class when you don't have people's numbers/emails and cannot get them until class. He's very unclear. AVOID. This /WAS/ going to be my research area. Ruined it for me.",0
"This is late semester wise, but took her for MTE's 1, 3 and 4 in Fall 2015. Always willing to help if needed, and compassionate. Loved her! If you're struggling a lot, she can make recommendations that will help you. She helped me get into a classroom setting for MTE 5.",1
"Dr. Evans-Nguyen's class is very difficult. Your grade is 95% tests and 5% homework. He does ALL sample problems for you, does not explain well. ""Review"" sessions are the night before a test and you can't ask what to expect- entire semester is fair game. Never unwrapped book. HW is very time consuming (2-3+ hours/chapter). Very poor experience.",0
"Dr. Schellhorn is a very nice woman and clearly knows what she is talking about, however she think everyone should just automatically getitand if you don't she essentially tells you that you shouldn't be in her class.  Also, grade depends on just 3 exams with unfair grading scale - if u get just 5 wrong youre already at a 60% and she does not curve",0
"It is very obvious that Prof. Smith wants his students to learn and not just regurgitate information on a test.  Online classes are more challenging to have good discussions but he does a great job of coaxing students to ""talk""by giving feedback and by presenting case studies for extra (fun) discussions. He wrote the text and it is a great read!",1
"Professor Bonner is very clear about what is expected of you for the class work and attendance wise, he gives quizzes (which he calls opportunities) every week or so with no more than 2 or 3 questions regarding the chapters recently covered in lecture, which are very useful in reviewing for the exams. The lectures are always useful and not boring.",1
"She lets it be known from the beginning that it's a TOUGH course! There's too much material to be covered in 10 weeks. She has extensive knowledge and compassion about this subject. Her lectures were very clear. However, due to the amount of material the tests were somewhat difficult. I struggled on short answers while others struggled on M.C",1
Awesome teacher very laid back and was an easy class. I will admit I thought this class was not gonna be very fun but it was  and he made it very relaxed. Attendance is mandatory after so many absences it will start to affect your grade. Text book was used in class.  I highly recommend him.,1
"He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations. Seems ignorant and didn't spend much time teaching.",0
"Great guy. Do your homework for credit, you get an extra credit assignment worth 10 points for your final, then two midterms and a final. He is very straightforward and makes things easy to understand. Plus, he's hot and has a cool accent so you really can't go wrong.",1
Science Methods for Elementary Teachers is one of the best and most practical classes I've taken at Cornerstone. We teach real kids and I learned a lot that will help me in the future!,1
"Hard to understand because English is not her first language, so she's unhelpful just because it's hard to know what she's saying. If you've had a lot of art instruction in high school, she probably won't teach you a thing - your best bet is to submit a portfolio and try to place out of 1005 altogether.",0
Professor Hoover is a great guy. He gives lots of extra credit and does the homework in class. He gives study guides for every exam and if you can do those you will do great on the exam. Accounting is dry but showing up for class is important!,1
Avoid!!! I wish someone would've told me about her earlier. Slick throws the shade if you don't understand something.,0
"First off, HORRIBLE professor. Don't even take him at all. Avoid at all costs. Don't expect to make up or re-take a test if you fail. Theres no chance of improving your grade. I have an A on all the homework because I dedicate my time, yet I am still failing.  Tests are not even as close as to the study guides. This is CALCULUS. It is a hard class!",0
"ASL is a hard language to learn but with Cheryl it was very easy. She is very knowledgeable of what signs are used around this area. She makes class comfortable, organized, and fun. She cares that you are retaining what you are learning and wants you to succeed. I will definitely take the second AMSL course. If you need an elective take this class!",1
"The poor guy is an open book. His insecurities, in reguards to intellect, are quite apparent. It really shows in his pompous, arrogant, and jugemental behavior. I think Steve would benefit from a good self evaluation before classes begin in the spring.",0
"Incredible workload but if you apply yourself, it will change your view point.  McHann is very helpful.",1
"During my stay at Calhoun, I had an opportunity to take Mrs. Hays class. She was very sweet and kind to everyone. As long as you came to class, took notes, and showed up for the test review, you'd walk with an A with no problem. My regret is that I couldn't take more of her classes because of my major. Take her if you can, you won't regret it.",1
Very tough class,1
"Professor Cramer only gives out about two museum paper assignments and 2-3 exams, which are non-cumulative. He has his own website that lists all the works and terms you need to study for, but you still need to take good notes to succeed on his exams. He rewards active participation and improvement too, and is an all-around excellent professor.",1
She is very nice and makes you work hard on project but helps you a lot. Overall she is very good grader.,1
I love this dude! He is so passionate about math that it almost makes me want to be a math major. The accent is not a problem if you really focus in class. You're 100% prepared for tests and he is so helpful with questions. I really hope to have him for differential equations next semester!!,1
"Professor Appel is truly one of the best teachers I have ever had. I took her Math course at ASU and she explained everything, took the time back to respond to students questions, was quick in replying to e-mails, and made me feel like I could succeed in Math. Her teaching style shows that she really cares about her students. Best Professor!",1
"Pretty interesting class. A few essays and free writes are all the grades. No textbook. Attendance mandatory. Can be a bit of a tough grader, go in for office hours, they help a lot. Really invested in his students and wants to help you do well! Let's you revise papers. He's a great (although a bit eccentric) guy, I would definitely recommend him.",1
No Comments,0
"Mi Sook was not a helpful teacher at all. I worked my butt off in this class and she did not even notice the dedication me and other students put into our work. Although she was nice at times and tried to help, she usually ended up messing up your project. Try not to get her for a teacher!",0
"Dr. Ramey is a solid professor. He knows what he's teaching, and he does it well. It's an easy class, and it's pretty interesting. There are some easy and short essays on the tests. Attendance is ""mandatory"" because we have in-class assignments almost every class that are weighted pretty heavily. Nothing flashy, but not bad at all.",1
He doesn't do much lectures and he gives short examples but most of the time he missed an example that we see in homework that we were not taught yet. It's very confusing but if you study hard and you'll pass the class & tests just fine. He does one day in computer lab to assist you on your homeworks and does other day in a classroom for lectures.,0
"I had a family issue that caused me to miss a few assignments. Not only was she more than understanding to the matter she also let me make up my work at a later date without taking points. She also cares about her students, as more than students. If your new to college or have a huge load one semester and need this class, She's the best!",1
"I have never learned more nor enjoyed a class more than Spanish with Professor Dattolo! I am sure that you will feel the same! He is respectful of his students, dedicated to his work and very organized. Learning is easy and fun with professor Dattolo.",1
"The amount of growth I've had from this class alone is AMAZING. Stef brings a different energy into the room... In a good way. She taught us how to be vulnerable actors with the Margolis Method, and I can honestly say I'm a totally different actor and person in general. She definitely cares about all her students. I would totally recommend !!!",1
"Professor Tran is SO sweet and passionate about the topic. She has a lot of useful material in her lectures, plus attendance is mandatory, so showing up to class is a must. Her tests are open note which takes off a lot of pressure. She's super smart and friendly! (Although I wouldn't say she presents strictly objective material like others said)",1
Mr. Prunty is a good math professor. He will help you understand what your learning. He is very thorough on teaching stuff especially stuff he knows his students will struggle with. He responds well to emails and is understanding. He is very nice and respectable. I reccomend taking his class.,1
I took her 1040 class online over the summer and it was a breeze and same with the 1050 in the fall. I'm not much for accounting so this was great. She offers a lot of extra credit and is quick to respond to questions. I recommend you take the class online.,1
"This class was quite easy. You would be fine if you study the powerpoints. Homework is not bad at all. You get plenty of time to do it.  Overall exams were easy. He curves grades. A very good prof., I would def",1
"Horrible professor. He was never in class due to countless excuses.  Word is he's an ****, and it shows in his horrible teaching methods.",0
"She grades you by her opinion on you. My friend and I took her class together, and had similar answers on an assignment which she gave me a B and him a D. Totally unfair. Her slides are unless, so you need to rely on everything she says in class. Sadly i had her during corona season and it just got worse as she barely uses technology correctly",1
I enjoyed this class. It was online so I can't comment on the lectures. But I enjoyed the course and was happy with the feedback and the timing. She took the time to read everyone's responses and respond as needed.,1
"Sister Kirkham is a phenomenal professor. This is my 5th semester at BYUI and she has been my favorite teacher. She cares about you, and she shares stories about her personal life that will strengthen you. All of the material that I learned in her class will help me in other classes as well.",1
"Humber is one of the nicest profs I've met, but I hated taking MATH 213 with him. He wasn't prepared to teach for two hours straight. I found his lectures very difficult to engage with, which was unfortunate because the textbook was not helpful either. His homework was really difficult, but tests and quizzes were easy.",0
"You should take Professor Cote if you love science in general and chemistry in particular. The things you will learn and the study habits you will develop will prepare you to succeed in your future classes. You have to ask yourself if you are ready to get serious about your education. Otherwise, take another section and short-change yourself.",1
"Sunny was an amazing professor.  I learned not only how to be a better student, but a better person. Be SURE to ask for help, because she ALWAYS seems to find time.  She may not always tell you what you ""want"" to hear, but what  what you ""need"" to hear.  She is entertaining and funny  the only complaint I could see is her mind is everywhere at once",1
Tough but worth it!,1
"Interesting material, but the GSIs are extremely picky.  Bound to lose points for almost no reason and they refuse to even attempt to change.",1
Amazing professor. Would take his class again.,1
"If youre about to take AP with this Professor, BUCKLE UP! Professor Sexton is an amazing teacher that youll learn a lot from but this is the hardest class Ive ever taken! It is AP so thats expected but I BARELY made a B with a 79 in her lec and lucky a 85 in a different lab! Her exams are HARD! She wants u to succeed tho & will help in anyway!",1
"Don't take marketing with her. Night class sucks the way it is; she makes it worse. She reads directly off the powerpoint slides the whole time, but takes attendance for points so you have to go. You'll have a marketing plan that gives hardly any direction & takes hours of outside work & still fail. Her tests are nearly impossible, so good luck.",0
"First day was really mean and strict, but it's an act, he just want to be clear.  He's funnu and really helped me understand something during office hours",1
"Good teacher tells you what you need to know for the exams. Lectures are boring at times. There are several papers 1-3 pages (at most, usually 1 page). Need to study, you may not always use the book he makes you get but it is very useful for the papers & exams. Theres a final presentation (in a group), a final exam & final paper.",1
"Prof. Hernandez is awesome! He really cares about his students. As long as you work hard, he will see that and help you out. Always happy to answer questions, and gives great, in-depth explanations. My class was a condensed, 4-week summer course. If you struggle with the subject I recommend waiting for the full 16 weeks because it is a TON of work!",1
"This class was great. My ideal English class. No group work and very few essays. He basically holds your hand as you do them. There is very little reading at all. Just go to class and closely follow his directions for the essays. Don't be intimidated by him on the first day like I was, he's a very nice guy and very VERY lenient.",1
Tough material however professor Moore tries her best to make it interesting! Do the homework and pay attention in class! ,1
"I took INR2002 and CPO2100 with this professor and got an A in both classes, he is amazing, and if you take two of his classes he'll give a recommendation letter. Lectures amazing and all tests open book. Recommend 10/10",1
Forced to take this class because I'm premed.  I hate chemistry but learned a lot in the course.  She makes it easier by giving examples and providing lectures online.  would take again.,1
"She's pretty cool, lost sometimes, but she's nice. Your textbook will be your new best friend.",1
She is an awesome teacher. She knows the information and explains it in an easy way to understand. I only wish she was teaching A&P II. I would indeed recommend her to my friends.,1
Super nice! Take him if you want an easy pass. Homework is there for practice but not mandatory. Offers extra credit on almost every quiz. PRINT OUT THE CHEAT SHEETS ASAP!,1
The Best BIO 131 teacher EVER!!!,1
"Professor Field is the best. He cares deeply about his students and wants to see them succeed. Always willing to help, always willing to give you advice. Take him!",1
"Eng 102 was exactly what I expected it to be. He made the class fun for the most part. Attendance is important, however, it's not the end of the world if you miss a few days. His 102 focused on dreams, so each essay had something to do with dreams. His essays are okay if you are a decent writer. He grades slow, however, gives good feedback.",1
"I liked the way she taught math, it was easy to understand. Kari is a caring teacher, she accepted all late work and gave students a chance to re-take missed tests and quizzes. She assigns a lot of homework.. too much actually. Attendance matters, so are sure to attend all the scheduled zoom classes if you're taking her class online.",1
Lectures are long and sometimes he is hard to understand. Tests are multiple choice and include an essay section which is easy to do well on. Dr. Jian also provides a study guide with essential terms before each test. He is very helpful and flexible with students.,1
"Terrible, terrible, terrible.  The woman is completely pointless.  Why is she employed here at all?",0
"Dr. Vohs is a great professor. His lessons are clear, to the point and prepare students for his tests. Don't expect to just slide by without doing any work, but if you so much as show up for class and pay attention the class will not be too much of a struggle. Tests are cumulative.",1
"She is a nice lady, but that's about as good as it gets for this review. This class was very disorganized. The TAs made a complete mess of the ""project."" If you really want to learn OS, I would hold out for another professor.",0
"Her lectures are funny but she is a tough grader on the lab quizzes and 2 writing assignments. Assigns more papers than other BIO130L classes, and really need to understand the materials and memorize them before going to class.",1
Profesor McCarthy is a very nice but I would not recommend taking her class! She is an extremely tough grader and will not give out an A. I am an A student and I got a C on my first paper. She allows you to correct your paper which is helpful. You are given 3 papers but she just expects way too much. Assignments are unclear.,0
"Several heavy readings assigned specifically for each week. Recommended to do them before lecture but not mandatory, cause he'll talk about them. 1 group project with your discussion group as your final project. 1 take-home final at the end, super easy! A couple papers, and thats about it. SUPER light workload, and Aren was a funny guy",1
"I missed an important assignment and she was very fair in her approach to letting me make it up.  She is responsive to e-mails with questions, the materials are clear and easy to find, and the material is challenging but not overwhelmingly so.",1
"This was an online class, so can't comment too much about her. Little involvement from her however. Everything was self lead.",1
"Newhouse is the most boring speaker I have ever encountered. Do yourself a favour and take the online INDG class for the 1000 level. Everyone is unorganised, assignments will say one thing but the syllabus says another. If they want people to continue in the indigenous studies stream, they should at least make this course enjoyable.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! She was terrible before the Covid-19 pandemic and worse after, she has heavy tests, high standards and isn't helpful when you're struggling and need help. If you take this class except to teach yourself, she isn't reliable or helpful at all.",0
Omg!I have lots of things to say here!He is the worst class ever in my life!It was horrible!He is very unfair and he expects his students to be professional!He is not helpful and his explanation is difficult to understand!He should know how easy other lab class was at least!It is very unfair!I really hated this class!he is hard grader. Very bad!,0
Down to earth teacher. Clear teaching methods. Do your homework and study the textbook and you will pass.,1
This class was awful for an online class. Lots of assignments and discussions that took weeks to grade. Lots of them were assignments that provided little to no help in actually learning the content. Felt relatively hard for a non biology major class.,0
She don't teach,0
"tests were HARD but obviously doable, people were getting 100% on her tests. Very funny in class but I found her to be harsh during office hours which caused me to stop going, she made me feel less than and a bit dumb to be honest. Her class is hard, just do the work, go over lectures and you should be fine",0
"Not the best, doesn't keep the classes attention.",0
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He will start lecturing about material in test 4 before you've even taken test 3. He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
Nurick is the man.,1
"Took my Inq Seminar and a few history classes with him. Also I see him on campus quite a bit. Real inviting, nice guy that loves his research. Class is usually a discussion of perspectives on history, as would be expected. Lots of reading. In general he's not too exciting, but if you like American history he's your guy.",1
"Sister Kirkham is awesome and inspires her students for good! Participation does matter in this class, but she makes discussions fun and very insightful! You also have to make sure to read the book and take good notes. I learned so much from this course and from Sister Kirkham, I would highly recommend!",1
"I took this class to fulfill a requirement. Did not expect much. Not really interested in politics, but the class fit my schedule and I had heard good things. Glad I took the class. Gave me a whole new perspective on politics and really kept my interest. I really liked all the current articles he sent students to illustrate course material",1
"Mary Callaway is a legend. She teaches by asking questions and encouraging you to come up with meaningful and well informed answers. She runs an engaging and relaxed classroom, and her assignments are geared toward your freedom. For example, a good chunk of the grade comes from writing 8 micro essays, but you have dozens of options to choose from.",1
"Great prof. He's very clear and fun, so class goes by very quickly. He also helps foster good classroom dynamic. ",1
"Dr. Dubovskiy is a great professor. He's hilarious, thorough, and passionate about math. The real question is whether or not you'll understand any of his jokes through that accent. He doesn't give as much feedback on his grading quizzes as I would like. MA124 is definitely a class you'll have to work in, but he himself is willing to help you.",1
Would not take again. Very unorganized !,0
"First offering of the course so marking was extremely lenient. Clear teacher, definitely would take the enriched again.",1
"Tests are the only deciding factor to your grade. Four taken not including final. Very hard to follow sometimes, tells lots of stories that don't pertain to the subject. Difficult class, mandatory to go into sequence.",1
Willing to help students. Understands people have lives outside of school. Highly Recommended,1
"David is incredibley intelligent however not a good prof. Rambles, spends the first hour of lecture playing music videos, repetitive and monotone. The content has the potential to be so much more interesting. This course has really put me off from indigenous studies. However it's an easy A, attendance is not mandatory and marking is very lax.",0
"If you don't already have a decent grasp of grammar, do not take this prof. She's a nice enough lady, will work with you both inside and out of class, and knows the material she is teaching, but her examples were often hard to follow. She also contradicted the book a lot. I had to really fight for my grade, but it wasn't impossible to get an A.",1
Mr. Gandy is awesome! He's fun to talk to and cracks jokes during his lectures. He doesn't assign homework other than the occasional extra credit. 99% of all learning is through his lectures. His tests are reflected off the in class notes. Just take notes and review them the night before the test and you've got at the very least a B.,1
"One of my best prof I've had in a long time, she spends lot of time with you if you need it, one of the most dedicated professors i've met in a long time.  This class is by far one of my favorites",1
"I have had a difficult time with math throughout my college career. Stats with Susan was the first class where I enjoyed going to my math class. She is helpful, homework isn't too bad, and she is extremely helpful. She's the ""student's teacher"" ",1
she is a good teacher but she is kind of crazy. It is hard to understand her because of accent. but she Is pretty good,0
"If your skin is made of glass she might offend you, but I think she's hilarious. Who thought Accounting could be fun. ",1
Great class. Professor Dutta went above and beyond. I am not a math person and his Videos really helped me learn the material and pass the course. Always available and helpful.,1
"Easiest class I have ever taken. I enjoyed learning as well. I suggest taking this class with a harder class (like micro, anatomy). All exams are open note and open book. Theres no way to fail. I have no idea how he is not 5/5! Great class and professor!",1
You need to read the text to do well on the exams (3-non cumulative). He says the answers are right in front of you (multiple choice).  You have to read to know what they are though. He tries to stimulate class discussion in weird ways.  He'll know your name the minute you walk in and use you in wierd examples.,1
Awesome professor; basically guarantees you an A if you meet him half way. Class material was dry at times but he did his best to make it as interesting as possible. Class activities done for attendance points. 3 term papers; offers plenty of time to complete and provides feedback if you ask. Midterm and final are online. TAKE HIM!,1
Its like watching George Clooney lecture intelligently on the most interesting topics in the world.,1
"I absolutely regretted signing up for his class. My cumulative GPA, as a senior at UT, is 3.88. Needless to say, I am neither unintelligent nor a slacker, but this class was just miserable.",0
SHE RESPONDS QUICKLY TO MESSAGES BUT TOUGH GRADER AND DISSCUSION BOARDS ARE LONG AND REPETATIVE .,1
Julie is nice but a bit unorganized. Maybe she is well organized but overwhelmed with responsibility. This class is pretty basic. It's pretty easy to get an A in it.,1
"I dont even know who she is! She's a myth! I never see her before, I'm taking her online, and I'm scared. I'm just scared okay? I'm taking fireworks and if I become anymore confused than I already am I'm going to become a firework!",1
"I've loved all four of the Spanish professors I've had so far at UNT, but she has to be my favorite. Her class isn't super easy, but you will come out of her class SO much better at Spanish. She is always willing to help you and talk to you after class, she teaches things in ways that totally make sense, and she brought us homemade cake twice.",1
"Professor Stevens is great. I found Calculus class very difficult but she helped me to stay on track. She always responds to emails and answers questions in weekly forums. One can clearly see that Prof. Stevens cares about her classes, from neatly organizing Canvas and material to answering the students and helping them understand complex concepts.",1
He is pretty tough but if you show up and seem like you are trying he will give you a decent grade. I did horrible on the labs but the sign in sheet got me a B- in the class.,0
"If there is any possible way to avoid his classes, DO SO!  He is a very smart man, but has absolutely 0 teaching ability.",0
Nan is a great lady but she grades really hard. If you are having trouble go to her office hours or ask for help because she will help you with a lot. She does have a bit of an accent but her lectures are very clear and concise. She gives a couple quizzes on the reading (which is a free online textbook) and tests on lectures.,1
really sweet and caring. actually teaches but she's a tough grader and assigns a lot of readings. she's a tough grader on the paper but allows for rewrites and tells you exactly what needs to be changed. she really makes you work for your grade but doesn't make an A impossible. final is all open answer but was relatively easy.,1
class is definitely challenging. you have to buy a piano to practice otherwise you won't do well on exams. i do recommend the professor. if your serious about learning she will teach you.,1
"She was awesome. You can tell that she truly cares about what she's teaching and wants her students to show interest and pass the class. She responds to emails quickly and is very accessible before or after class as well. She is an encouraging teacher, and if your do the work, the class  is easy. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
"Nedd is such a great professor. The class was all about Provençal history, which is relevant to where we were, and he really knew the content. The projects were easy and the essay was short. I learned a lot. His awkwardness is really what makes his class interesting. Love this guy.",1
"Easy A, just watch the movie and get ready to write your 500 word essays. Test are easy and online not at the testing center!!!",1
"Professor Andrews makes the class engaging, but the online exams are extremely difficult and it is easy to get a C or D on them even using your notes. They are insanely specific and cover a lot of readings and materials. 300 word responses weekly and 3 term papers. An interesting class, but this is not just an easy elective. Only take for ur major.",1
"I very much enjoyed this class, we did group projects, she understands everyone and their fear of speaking in front. She did not only made the class funny but we learned as we laugh which made it memorable. Going to that type of class you need to pick this, you wont be dissapointed at all, I highly recommend it for anyone. She knows how to teach !",1
"boring you want to kill yourself. I had Chaucer in high school and couldn't wait to take a course in college. HS was better, we learned something about the middle ages. The one good thing is that  its an easy A.",0
Very passionate during lectures and entertaining throughout. I always left the class wanting to know more. Very clear expectations on assignments/exams. Don't fall behind on reading or read just enough to answer the assignments. Has a really strict no bathroom/water rule. Overall fun class to take to learn more about why the world is the way it is.,1
"Syllabus was unclear. When you asked questions for clarifications on assignments or just in class, she was extremely disrespectful. She looked at you like you were stupid. When I asked for feedback, she barely gave any and said you were doing fine, then you would get a bad grade on assignments. Overall, she is disrespectful. Do not take her class!",0
"Weil is a terrible professor and really is not a teacher. He's a bully and gives zero feedback on papers. Watch your word count, yes he counts words and doesn't read your content of your assignments if they don't have enough word count. He's pompous and ego driven (his ego) BEWARE of this professor and do NOT take him for a class!",0
"Amazing prof, don't drink the Kool-Aid.",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. McCullough's class. Some of her rules may seem a little strict, but she's nice. Everything was well organized and straightforward. Assignments were fairly easy and quick. You're allowed an index card for a cheat sheet for each exam.",1
He's a good teacher but also pretty specific about what he wants as far as assignments go.,1
"You must go to class. She does not put the information on PowerPoints, she only gives verbal lectures so you have to pay attention and take notes fast. No textbook, only some online readings that you have to write responses to but it's easy. She gives a study guide before each exam, overall definitely recommend.",1
"I took Professor Lusk on my second semester at Collin. I loved her class right away because her lectures were very interesting and thought provoking. She is incredibly smart and her tests are not difficult as long as you spend some time reading the material. She also expects you to participate in class discussions. Overall, she's great!",1
"Mus 7 was a dope class, even though its late class don't be afraid to take it. Stewart is an awesome teacher and teaches an interesting subject. Just do all the assignments and you should pass the class easily.",1
"Loved, loved the class. She is there for you, great lectures, would take her again. She is highly recommendable. Take her class.",1
"She is off topic during lecture and gives lots of trick questions on her exams. Her reviews are not helpful, so it is really hard to study the right things for her exams. I recommend going to class, even though it is not mandatory, because she gives clicker point extra credit.",0
Awesome teacher! Very inspired and knows a ridiculous amount. And he's totally hot!,1
"Truly a terrible teacher. She is a very bias grader, holds grudges for unknown reasons, constantly contradicts herself and offers no helpful criticism or guidance. Hard to believe gets paid to do what she does. My advice: stay far away",0
"Best teacher I had all semester. Was very nice, brought treats for the class, encouraged open discussion even if you have an unpopular view point on the subject discussed. Would love to take her again if I could.",1
"His lectures are interesting and easy to follow, he's very clear about the material that will be on the tests, and offers extra credit for the final.  As long as you do all the homeworks and study the stuff he tells you for the tests you should be fine, but the class itself is not an easy A",1
"99.9% students dont want to take speech class. I was one of them, and if you are one of those students, then take her. She gives u an A as long as you try. She is also very funny. I was scared at the beginning but she makes u feel comfortable. Easy A as long u come to class everyday and do the 4 speeches through out the semester. I loved her.",1
"First teaching assignment ever... She was not versed with the textbook and was unwilling to help struggling students understand. Quote: I am not responsible for your learning, I am resposible for your grading",0
"She's definitely a good teacher, just pay attention in class, make sure you read the readings that she assigns so you can participate more in class. gives some essay quizzes, its not too hard to get a 9 on them, 10s are definitely possible. The mid-term is 3-4 essays, she gives you the questions before hand. kind of a tough grader on them.",1
I like that this professor had alot of talks about how this stuff we learned is in the real world. I also like that he graded the tests quick. He always asked us our opinions of things we were learning about and made everybody feel comfortable and told us there is no wrong opinion in his class. I recommend him alot.,1
"For US Politics, Lois is really easy. All you have to do each week is fill out a ""Study Guide"" and that is mainly graded on how well you cite your sources (Use Chicago or APA). It may seem useless to do them each week, but the midterm and final are completely based on them- so study them and you'll do fine. If you want an easy A, take her",1
"Class consisted of reading the textbook on TopHat and answering module questions. Her lectures are 5 minutes long and only help understand general concepts. They try to give you ""application"" questions on the quizzes but the questions are not specific and you have to make tons of assumptions on what its asking. 1 error  6-10% down on your average",0
He's super into golf and it doesn't make much sense but he's hilarious,1
He is a very hard teacher to understand. He does not give you a study guide for either the midterm or final and does not tell you what is on either. He just expects you to study everything he's told you in lecture and material you have read. I barely passed with a C and i am an A student. Take a different teacher if you can.,0
"Had him for methods last year which prepared me well for stats this term. Heard he's away this year. Bummer, wanted to take his perception course before graduating. Exceptional professor.",1
"A lot of reading and writing!!!!!  Only two tests with a majority of the class grade based on writing assignments. TAs do most, if not all, of the grading. I should also note that assignments are graded very critically and harshly.  One must be willing to work to get a good grade on anything in this class.",1
"she was very awesome to have as a prof for someone in their first year.  she was very helpful and made the class interesting with her group discussions. i highly recommend her to first years, just make sure you show up to class.",1
The class is pretty easy and there is no excuse anyone should fail the tests. There are quite a few writing assignments but they aren't too difficult and they are spaced out nicely. She can grade pretty hard on written works but high test grades help. Ms. Nelson loves participation and expects questions asked and answered.,1
Really enjoyed him great guy lots of test but he states he easy but he is hard give extra credit alot.,1
Just go along with the class. Doesn't take opposition well. Well that's The whole social work dept. You can and will be able to tell if she doesn't like you. She takes things personally.,0
"Prof Elliott offers a ton of EC and allows you to redo papers if you don't like your grade. She's boring as hell sometimes, but such a chiller. Also, she lives off of Diet Coke and Jane Austen novels. So that's something.",1
"Nice lady, not a very good professor. For Asian Art she blows by things so fast and goes off on tangents so when you leave the class you're thinking, ""what just happened"". Do not take her writing intensive classes.",0
"I took her 111 course last year. She truly knows her material and presents it well, and she wants you to know your stuff and will help you with it. But be prepared to work because you need to practice and practice and practice again.",1
"She was very clear on assignments, the few times I didn't understand the assignment she was very fast to email back and help to solve the problem. Was easy for me to take, only because she was very descriptive and easy to understand. I defiantly took the skills she left me with and use them in life today!",1
"I think Prof Arnold on here trolling. There is no way this many people in the class enjoyed the couse. I thought it was a bit of a waste of time. Did I learn a lot? Meh. I certainly wont remember this course in 5 years. The workload is a little much, but its not like anyone really teaches science anymore. If you take her take it during MLB season.",0
"Nice enough guy and knowledgeable but extremely hard to learn from him in an organized way.  He jumps around, and often forgets from class to class what was covered in previous class so likely missing something.  He talks so fast you cant take notes.  And we dont know what we need to know or not know.  Is all over the place.  Should be easy. Not.",0
"He is very nice & his class is easy, interesting & his knowledge in the field enhances learning. Few easy quizzes, grp. presentations, & fun personality assessments plus easy 2-3 questions on company cases. Well balanced class. I am definitely going to take another class with him.",1
"Great teacher!  My writing is horrible, but I learned a lot.  He is really able to put writing in to a formula that I can learn from.  He tells you exactly what he expects in your paper, so if you put in the work then you will get an A.",1
"Having Abrams as a professor is pretty much an easy A so long as you pay a decent amount of attention. Only had 2 papers and a final which he's really lenient about, just write down what he wants. He's incredibly passionate about what he does (participate for xtra credit) so DO NOT let him see you use your cell phone because he dislikes it A LOT!",1
Orgo is hard enough as it is. Do yourself a favor and just take Flemming if you want to understand anything at all.,0
Rombo is a very nice person but a poor teacher. She is very knowledgable but is not very good at explaining the concepts. She gives study guides but be prepared to study 2-3 weeks before an exam because they're not specific or accurate to what she says in class. Her lectures talk in circles sometimes and we spend half of class talking about nothing,0
Dr. Wydner is very helpful inside and outside of the lab. She's easy to contact and gives a lot of extra credit. ,1
"lectures are pretty straightforward. take lots of notes because those will help. the study guides will help too, but still take notes! it's not too boring. he's fair enough, and the class is pretty easy. tests are short answer questions, but know a lot of the terms.",1
"Very understanding, nice teacher, and clear on her lectures. I wish she taught chem 120.",1
Prof Sigal is great. He's far from the stereotypically boring history prof. He really encourages you to be creative which is refreshing. I took his course on colonial Latin America and enjoyed it a lot. Whether you're taking a course in history to fulfill a general req or for your major I definitely recommend him.,1
"She is the most amazing teacher, I wih she taught all the science classes. She does everything she can to prepeare us for tests. She;s also very organized and gives us everything ahead of time si if you are lost or not prepared its only your fault. I never liked science in my life but she makes it so enjoyable, I've learned so much!Great teacher!",1
"I took Linda for my A&P 2 Lab, wish i had her for lecture also, she was awesome. She loves teaching and makes you enjoy it also. She is not easy, but is very fair, she explains what is to be expected of you. Do not miss a class, she grades you on attendance also. Wish she taught more classes!!",1
"I took this class during the fall semester of 2020. His lectures were interesting. He has a lot of meme content which kept it interesting, but it was kind of excessive. We were only graded by 2 midterms and a final. He pre-recorded lectures and he hid the final lecture in a lecture without giving a clear date for it and many people missed the final",0
"Stay with it.  It may seem counter-intuitive at first, but it becomes something much more than you could have ever thought by the end of the course.  It is not only about a paradigm shift in the study of argument, but about promoting tolerance, patience and pedagogy in a field where these things take a back seat to a pissing contest.  Worth it.",1
I took the accelerated 2040/2050 course. She is amazing! It was fast paced but completely manageable. She is very sweet and makes the goofiest comments. She will follow the syllabus exactly as laid out by the department so don't expect anything under the table with My Spanish Lab or extra credit. Her handouts are a great help so do not lose them!,1
Ms. Noland is fantastic! Shes fun and energetic so I always looked forward to her class. She motivated me to not be afraid of public speaking because its a way to make my opinions heard. She gives really clear feedback and cares about her students. She makes public speaking fun and I recommend her to everyone. I give her 10/10!,1
"Amazing teacher,  easy A for Prob & Stat. Very funny and it might take the whole class to explain one problem but that means no homework",1
Avoid and take someone else. Was nit-picky about testing on irrelevant details that didn't aid in learning.  Top-down sort of teaching. Ruined clinical for many students I talked to. She may be a good researcher but teaching is another story. 23 of students stopped showing up to lectures because they said they weren't usefuljust read the book.,0
"You enter this class thinking that you will feel better about your efforts, when in contrast you leave feeling like a idiot. He makes it out that you will succeed, but makes it near impossible to get a decent grade. VERY monotone, so I warn you DO NOT TAKE HIM",1
"If you're the type of person who likes to do work on their own time, this is the class for you! Daniel Baker is a great teacher, cares about the way he teaches/runs his class and your feedback, and gives extra credit. I was really interested in what he would teach to our class always! Super easy class, all you need to do is do the work! 10/10",1
"Brilliant man. Great actor. Teaches to each student's level. Also, he's beautiful.",1
"Nice guy, as long as you show up you'll pass.",1
Good at presenting concepts clearly in class - especially grammar. gives good feedback as well on exams. Wish we had more communicative activities though. Helpful and doesn't make you feel bad for asking questions.,1
Mrs. Parker is a very good teacher. She understands that people have lots to do and is willing to help out in any way she can. She would talk me thru the math problems and I understand them better. she is always there. if you put the effort in that you want to learn she will help you pass this class. Thank you,1
not so great teacher.,0
Too much sass. Very disrespectful. she made one of her students cry. Shows no remorse. Speaks in 3rd person. worst accounting teacher  ever. look somewhere else or you will get the worst time of your life.,0
"Diane was a great teacher. She was very clear with her notes, and always took the time to help any student who didn't understand. She wanted all students to be on the same page! she actually cared! could get off topic about her family, but for the most part she stayed on task! ",1
"He has an accent, but easy to understand.  He has a good sense of humor and tries to answer questions. He had to cover a lot of material so recommends that you get a tutor if you cannot understand beyond the classroom.  He does give opportunity to go over HW questions on following week. Very fair teacher. Don't miss class - you'll miss a lot!",0
"Mr. Miller is an excellent teacher! The book is confusing at times, but his lectures helped me ALOT! He would use real world examples and make it easier for you to understand. Always there to help even after class hours while people were studying in the lab. Read the book, attend lecture, study, and ASK questions!",1
"He is a really nice prof, he really cares about every group and how their project is coming along. Every week he will check up on groups and gives good advice on how to plan and complete the project. He is clear and concise and a fair marker.",1
"Once gave a pop ""TEST"" ""TEST that is"" NOT a pop QUIZ, ""POP TEST"". And his tests take like 2 weeks to complete. He should also be retired/gone since he sits in his office 70% of the time!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Took both 1078 and 1088 with him, and I've definitely learned a lot. Homework is optional if you need the extra help, but tests are pretty tough",1
"Hall went above and beyond, she's extremely caring, funny, and very helpful. It's a lecture heavy class so don't do the 3 hour long class even she hated talking that long, but overall I'd recommend her to anyone who needs Bio 121. I just wish she would teach Bio 122! ;)",1
"If you need to take Biology 2401, take her! She is funny and crazy (in a good way). She is hands on and helps you in any kind of way!",1
She is a great teacher. She taught me a lot about English and writing. She makes class interesting and fun.,1
"Dr. Andrews is a fine professor. The hour and forty-five minute lecture, combined with the quiz and mini-essay was a lot to handle each day, every day, for three weeks. Dr. Andrews doesn't show quiz answers, making it frustrating when you don't get an 100 on the quiz and you want to learn from your mistakes. Take his class Fall or Spring semester.",1
I am so glad that I took Professor Dattolo for Spanish! His lectures were amazing and very clear to understand and his kindness towards his students was always evident. If you take Spanish Professor Dattolo goes highly recommended.,1
"The content of the class is not difficult. However, instead of teaching the basic concepts, he mostly uses his example problems and goes off on useless tangents, which only leads to class confusion, which leads to wasting time answering questions trying to justify himself. He never uses the book, but to get an A, I'd recommend reading it.",0
Great.,1
"Took the 6 week class. Very hard, apply yourself, he will NOT baby you. Come to class & pay attention, no texting oror side conversations, he finds it very disrespectful, and it is distracting to other students.  Bottom line he helps, but will not give you the answers before you try. If you don't study you will not get a good grade. Read chapters!!",1
This is one of the best teachers i have every had.  Her test are very hard so study you packets that she gives out.  Her quizzes that she gives out really aren't hard but you still need to go over the information.,1
"Cramer is brilliant! He's so intelligent and explains everything in detail, with that and studying a day before the tests you should be fine! He's very helpful and understanding, I handed in two papers late because of personal problems and he was so nice about it! A little monotone but he throws in small dry jokes, a very interesting class!",1
"Hes very passionate about his job. The lectures can be boring from the book but when he talks about more updated topics or on the lines of history, its interesting. He grades mainly on tests and writing assignments. Do great on those and you will pass!",1
Great professor who really knows his stuff. Pay attention and do the homework and you will learn to like the challenge that accounting presents. Tests and quizzes are very similar to practice quizzes that he gives you. Put in the work and see the results.,1
"This is the single worst class I've attended at JHU, virtually or otherwise. Here is everything you need to know. In response to COVID, the professors chose to make this class asynchronous. This is useful for reviewing material. However, the problem that arises when you have an asynchronous class with no grades other than exams, is that students",0
"Maybe it was just me but I was bored out of my mine in this class he has a strong accent, he just talks and talks with out letting u get a word in about what he's speaking on as he's speaking on it. In overall hated this class. No lap tops no cell phones but others in class said they would take him again just because they know what to expect.",0
"I took Alex for Business Calculus and have only one this to say about the woman: I love HER as much as she loves CATS (that's a hell of a lot, people).",1
"So easy. Everything is spelled out in her handouts, which are available online. The assignments are right out of the textbook. She is readily available in her office for questions, problems, and troubleshooting. Easygoing about attendance, as long s your work is submitted on time. Will even review before submitting, in case you need to make changes",1
"He is nerdy (duh, he's a science professor) and entertaining (he likes comics). He takes his time to explain things so it is well understood, and this will contribute to his being continuously behind. Don't let it bother you, it's his laid-back style. Don't complain, or be that rude old lady giving sass. Remember: you are in COLLEGE! Go to learn.",1
Very nice person. She is patient with her students but marks fairly easy. You will get what you deserve in this course. Her lectures can get little boring but it's useful anyway.,1
"His class was the strangest I have ever taken.  He has so many personal issues, all of which he shares, that it's amazing this man functions.  He actually showed up to our class over medicated, and we were afraid he would pass out!  Although it's an easy A, the stuff he puts you through is not worth it.  I can't ephasize this enough- AVOID!!!",0
"Mr. Pode is one of the best math teachers I've ever had. He's incredibly helpful both in and outside of class and definitely wants his students to succeed. The class is tough but as long as you go to class and do the homework, you should be fine. I would recommend him to anyone!",1
"Tabea is hands down the best instructor I ever had at NAIT. She really cares a lot about her students. If you put in the effort, you'll get the mark you deserve. She's a very very easy marker, she focus more on the content rather than the presentation, grammar and such. She's very inspirational and takes the time to help you improve.",1
"I really enjoyed James's web development class. The course was a good balance of real world projects, experimental work, and fun challenges. I really appreciated his patience and clear explanations.",1
She will gladly answer any questions you have,1
"Difficult class and subject material but Professor Grange did a good job of teaching it.  Requires a lot of homework and tests are difficult, but you learn a lot.",1
Mrs. Shade was an amazing teacher who helped me get through geology.,1
"In this class I read an ""article"" of sorts and review a power point twice a week. The power point was super helpful and I probably wouldn't have done well without it. If you put in the work and turn things in on time you should get a good grade.",1
"Kanetis's excitement and energy will show you how much he loves teaching philosophy. I didn't really enjoy this class as much as I thought I would, but having Kanetis as a professor really helped. The only thing that I didn't like was that his lectures lacked variety, meaning it was the same routine every day.",1
"Great teacher. However, your GPA will not thank you. He is overly ambitious with the amount of information he tries to teach. His expectations for essays are ridiculous; papers that would easily get an A in other English classes will bring you Bs in an O'Quinn class. You need to think like him to get a good mark. Good teacher, evil marker.",1
I loved Professor Henry-he was great! I would take another class with him given the chance. He gave clear direction and was extremely helpful. He doesn't move on unless the students understand what he has taught thus far.,1
"Span. 101 5 wk course in the summer. The professor seems like a nice person where she will answer emails, but I would advise NOT to take her (or maybe any other..) language class during the summer semester, its intense and her workload is insane. Remember, you have to memorize a language in a matter of 5 weeks. Do not recommend.",0
"Al-Marashi is one of the best professors I've had.  He makes class so interesting and fun.  The class has 4 quizs a midterm a final paper and a final.  The study guide for the midterm and final were  helpful.  He does take attendance so you need to go to class, but it is worth it because we will learn something.  Defiantly taking from him again.",1
"Honestly, great professor. This man really cares about his students and gives you every opportunity to get an A in the class. He makes class fun and current with the time. Gives extra opp as well  The only downfall was grading happened slowly. Overall he is the man and even tries to meet students outside of class.",1
"He is one of the few good professors,I have had the privilege,to have taken at this University. He is extremely passionate about his field of study. When I saw he was British, I knew he would be great!",1
"Her class is easy as long as you complete assignments and listen to her lectures. She also posts the powerpoints online if you can't attend class. Very easy, great professor",1
"Luis is obviously really smart, but is too scattered for a position like this. He relies on shorthand in his emails so heavily that it sometimes hinders understanding. His feedback is late and confusing, and the icing on the cake was when he talked about my class performance with another student without my consent or knowledge. Avoid.",0
Her class was amazing and she teaches you from the minimal basics. It really did teach me a lot and gave me something to look forward to twice a week. She was very nice. An easy A.,1
Definitely one of the best nursing instructors I've had here at hfcc!!  If you get the chance take Mrs. G,1
He makes students life hard; very egotistical and rude.,0
"I took about 3 or 4 classes with Dr. B and she was also my research advisor. While her classes require a lot of attention, if you actively participate, you will make it through. She is very kind and welcoming and loves when students ask questions, so don't be afraid to speak up! Also, just be prepared for her to take your phone during tests :)",1
Awful grader. Even if you got every answer right she can still take points off  for millions of reasons. She made a lot of mistakes in class but she wants you to be accurate as a machine in the meantime. In order to get a perfect score you have to split hairs on every question even if it has nothing to do with math.,0
"Super funny professor with great lectures! Tests are easy! You will notice something in common with complainers, they don't go to the lectures or don't watch them online. If you watch the lectures and READ the book, you will get an A on the online, open book, open notes test. This is the easiest class, I've ever done at MDC. Take him!",1
"Dr. Victor Montes-Jordan By far the best science teacher I have ever had  , Dr. Montes is intelligent beyond words, you can ask him anything health related and he knows the answer. I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a strong grasp of the material. HOWEVER if you don't study you will not pass, you will  have to EARN your grade. ",1
"One of the best professors i have had in my 3 years. He actually takes the time to make sure we understand the material & readings. Even though i had no interest in the subject, he taught it in a way that allowed me to actually pay attention in class. Assignments are easy - mainly busy work, exams are fairly easy -MC/blanks/short answers.",1
"Great prof, dry sense of humor is good for the tough course. He's a genius programmer, if you need help, ask him! He will explain it. Some people think he makes students feel dumb for asking questions, but he doesn't, he cares about questions, so he will answer them the best he can.",1
A brilliant Professor that made the study of psychology fun and interesting.,1
A legend in his own mind. Fun and involved. Hands on teacher.,1
"Antibiotics Research was a blast! Anitori is a good-humored guy who knows his stuff. Always felt like he gave us all the materials and information we needed to succeed in his class. He has ""pop quizzes"", but he tells you a week ahead of time that they're coming and what'll be on them. He (thankfully) doesn't know how to do a pop quiz.",1
"Took her for Into to old testament. She was okay. Made you write 8 1 page responses for the whole semester. Readings you should do because they will help you in class and finals. I stopped reading because I already knew about the Bible and I got a B+ on the Midterm. Grading, maybe kind of hard, the usual.",1
"Professor Lorentz is hilarious. His lectures make me laugh and they help me remember so much more. He makes everything in the class very interesting and explains things in detail. Show up to class, try to avoid taking a class that is more than an hour a day with him because you will get distracted from his lecture. Other than that, he is GREAT.",1
BEST ART TEACHER! Took Drawing and photography! Must take a class by her!,1
"I miss this professor!! he's the fairest professor ever, no ugly attitude, ALL UNDERSTANDING. group talks, he likes your feedback to improve & i respect that. GIVE him a RAISE!! his examples are well explained too so keep your mind opened. he is very cool and his final was optional: if you liked your grade, you didn't need to stress taking it ;D",1
Professor Ordoñez is an amazing educator. She cares about her students. She is tough beacuse she wants us to be good clinicians. She does not sugar coat anything. I like that about her. She is straight forward about her tests. She is a very knowledgeable DPT,1
"Wonderful Professor, even online class is fun with Prof. Dewald! Definitely recommend to any history majors that you will enjoy any class he teaches!",1
Super prof très interressant!!,1
"you basically need to study on your own, lectures are super boring and no quizzes to boost up marks. He is also very picky and a tough grader when it comes to wording for the written part of his exams. If this is your first time taking the course, you should probably get someone else to really explain the information since bio is generally hard",0
"Took an online class psych 105 with her. Absolutely HORRIBLE. Use you own words and cite- most likely you will still have her saying you plagiarized and will get a zero. Only had 3 tests including the final, 5 assignments, and 3-4 discussion board. Every thing needs to be cited in APA format and she is a very tough grader.",0
"COVID  online course. I think its bcuz its a language class but this course and 4920 posted up a recorded ppt, a pdf version, AND the transcript of the recording. I am a visual learner and this was amazing for me! I would recommend listening to the lecture and watching the videos, reading the book gives you way more clarity and in-depth info.",1
"PSY230-Professor senters is a very nice teacher who always makes the classroom a fun environment. All exams, quizzes, and hw were take home. There wasn't a ton of notes, (he recommends printing the pwrpoints)just lots of stats practice problems. All hw is from the textbook and he goes over every step in class. Make sure you organize your notes well",1
DeMello is a great teacher. I was worried as he is from India but his accent is not distracting at all. Weekly assignments and only 3 tests the whole semester. He assigns homework for extra credit on the tests and gives a curve as well. Overall I would take a course with him again. ,1
"I took him for eng 101 and 102. For 101 he was in hospital and literally only assigned to papers whole semester. If you did good on them, it was an easy A. For 102 he was a bit more challenging. Lots of essays and readings with questions. He is very hard to get a hold of, so hopefully you understand his syllabus right from the start.",1
Hard ITM class but this professor grades on a curve. He also allows you to have 2 full sheets of notes front and back. What helps out a lot is that the Homework assignments were 20 percent of the grade and quizzes were another 20 percent of your grade do well on those you will pass. Midterm and finals are hard but the cheatsheet helps.,1
This class was a tough class but if you are willing to put in the effort is a really great class to take! I suggest taking Philosophy with this professor. ,1
"Ramey is awesome. He teaches religion where non majors can understand/enjoy it. Weekly quizzes based on previous lecture and reading, but the textbook is just a nonfiction book he likes. Really easy. I rarely read it and did OK. Two group projects, really easy. 4-5 tests, moderately easy. Great lectures, lots of extra credit, really cool dude.",1
"Professor O'Gorman thankfully was not a boring, by the book teacher. He keeps you engaged in the conversation, rather than just talking at you, he talks to you. Thank you Professor for treating us like people, not just a job.",1
"Please get another professor, I'm writing this review because I use the website for reviews but I never wrote one so I realized that we as a student need to help each other! I'm helping you by saying this professor is no good!",0
"Accounting isn't an easy class, but she is a great teacher. Some people think she gives too much homework, but really she's spoon-feeding you with so much practice for the test. Tests reflect the homework exactly. If you keep up with going to class, taking notes, and doing homework, you will pass with flying colors. She is good at what she does.",1
Danny is a great teacher.  He makes everyone feel very comfortable and class is fun.  He is very knowledgeable and he is easy to talk to.  He gets annoyed when people are not prepared or when you talk when he's talking or while people are performing scenes so don't do that.,1
THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER. Professor O'Quinn makes class interesting and engaging. He teaches in a way that forces original thought from you and makes you a much better writer/thinker. Get ready to work hard but it is SO worth it!! The man is a genius.,1
"Do not be intimidated by Swartz the first day of lab. When you get to know him he is one of the nicest and funniest teachers you will ever have. His grading system is frustrating but he is ALWAYS available for help (I've stayed for office hours until 11:30pm before). If you do not understand something, go for help and try your best on every lab!",1
Professor Power is very smart and shares her life experience with the class. She is pretty general about grading and isn't too tough on students. There is a lot of busywork in this class and lots of group projects.,1
"Absolutely love Ryburn, she is super sweet and cares for everyone. She is super easy to reach and provides amazing resources to help you succeed. Take her! Thought I was gonna end up with a B and pulled an A towards the end.",1
This guy is an actual joke. Went to class prob. 5 times still got an A. take this clown,1
"Took him during the summer. His class was an easy A, but it it was also important to participate. We did two papers, two speeches (one group), and had a midterm and final. The questions come straight from the review. He uses powerpoints for lecture. Textbook wasn't a must if you want get by. He was funny and laid back.",1
"Teacher is ok, about only half there. No response to any forum posts one week. Class is all writing, forum + 1 essay, 2 weeks have 2 essays. Grading expectations are clear, if you follow instructions and write like you actually read the topic then you'll do ok. Knowing APA style is a must. Read her feedback, essays will make or break you",1
"Great Professor. I had him for Macro and I am currently taking him for Micro as well. He is one of the few professors who really know how to explain, and really want you guys learn the most important stuff. I really enjoy his lectures and if you study the notes you will be more than fine. Take him for Econ. He is the best in it.",1
easy if you attend class and take notes. other then that dont expect to pass.,1
"Hannah is intelligent, approachable, and fairly engaging, but her grading schemes are arbitrary. It's as if she's trying to compensate for the class being a fluffy social science by aggressive grading.  It's nearly impossible to study for exams without re-reading nearly a thousand pages.  A good mentor, but lacking as a professor.",1
"Great professor! You need to attend every class if you intend on making an A and do his assigned readings. All test information will come from lecture so you need to make sure you take good notes and keep up with him. Not the easiest class, but one of professors you will ever get.",1
"She is tough! I took her for Anatomy and Micro and enjoyed the experience. People aren't used to having a confident, strong willed woman teaching so it can be hard to get used to. I'm still not sure if I'm prepared for it myself and I've known her for two year haha. She loves what she does and it shows in her work ethic. I'll miss you Mrs Elizondo.",1
nice guy. was not easy class.  real tough on grading. no curve or extra point. take him if you are science major or considering transfer,1
One of my favourite professors of the program. Very knowledgeable and interactive.  A highly recommended prof.,1
He's really nice and pretty laid back. He is always willing to help. One time I and nearly the entire class hadn't written a paper that was due and he gave us all an extension. Such a sweet guy!,1
"I've had her for fiction writing and travel writing, and she was wonderful in both. She seemed a bit spacey at first, but she's truly a knowledgeable writer who takes a lot of time to help her students. Her returned papers are always very thoroughly critiqued, she has a sense of a humor, and has a wonderful workshop format. A must-take for writers.",1
"Ms. Hutton is knowledgeable about SpEd, but seems to have another agenda...not sure what. She is impersonal, unapproachable, and has a chip on her shoulder. Her appearance is questionable, with unprofessional and unkempt clothing.Also, reading from ppts is not a teaching method.  HCC should take a closer look at this...she is a real turn-off.",0
"IDK what everyone is talking about, I took Zann before him (same class)& Zann didn't care at all & I ended up failing. Jingpeng did livestreams so we could ask questions & actually taught. It was great! He stutters but I watched the streams afterword at 1.5& had no problem. He helped me out with projects t me turn some in late Give him a chance!",1
I am also a student at ASU and i decided to take this class at AWC since it is on zoom and cheaper than if i took it at ASU. Prof Gier is alot better at teaching economics than the other economics professor I had at ASU. i definitely recommend.,1
Don't expect to do good if this is not your major. You definetly need a piano the exams are extremely hard and the assignments are too advanced for mus 101.  All homework is not explained in class and you have to research in class. Most homeworks are very irrelevant to the coarse and what she teaches. ,0
"A very nice man, but, he really needs to keep political views out of class.I don't care if your views agree with mine or not. I'm paying 14 grand a year to learn, not to hear a bunch of political propaganda. Any person that starts a class with the number of deaths in the current war isn't right in the head. Oh,and reading the material for tests, an",0
"This class was asynchronous so I don't know much about him as a person. He seemed caring and willing to help. His class was pretty easy. Each week was a new chapter with a quiz at the end. There were also 3 tests. His lectures were easy to follow and the tests/quizzes were easy. The quiz questions were the same ones on the tests, so it was easy!",1
"She does not teach. She rambles on about irrelevant topics and really does not enjoy being there in class. She basically just wants to get through the material and receive her paycheck. If you want to learn accounting, take someone else. You are stuck fending for yourself in this class, and it is not enjoyable. Easy due to ex cred, but not helpful.",0
He gives pop test so make sure you READ the homework he gives out. There are up to 6-7 essays but they are easy topics,1
"Super relaxed political science class. There are a few discussions, two test ( all answers online) and she gives great feedback on assignments. Take this class with Professor Cordova!",1
"Clear about what he wants from his students but its alot. Way too many quizes that require meticulous reading of 20+ page almost every week. 2-3 essay assignments each semester on top of that and lots of memorization (ALL of the quiz answers, plus notes) for exams. Too much for a core class even though he lectures well.",0
"Good class, he knows his stuff.  His test questions involve alot of extra information you don't need to answer the question so watch out.  Very helpful and friendly.",1
"The lectures are pretty interesting if you're engaged. The tests are super easy if you properly prepare and study. HIGHLY recommend going to the test review session before an exam, they'll help you so much.",1
"He tends to be sarcastic and sadistic, including when giving students feedback in front of the class. His instructions were sometimes unclear. When asked for clarification, he can be quite mean. His criteria for speeches sometimes seem to reflect his personal interests, and he sometimes gives contradicting parameters.",0
"She has an accent and she repeats herself a lot, which makes the class boring. She use Aplia and Google Classroom, there is no physical textbook. Take this class only if you dont mind Chinese accent. Other than that, shes an experienced teacher and can help you in class.",1
I took Psych 110 with Professor Nolan and it was great! Her teaching style is mostly lecture but she gives good examples and is very clear with the content. There was not much work besides reading a textbook chapter each week. I am taking another one of her courses next semester. Wonderful person and makes you feel comfortable in class.,1
"A very decent class. Not a huge amount of work, but there is a 12 page paper at the end and a weekly discussion that really isnt bad at all. Tests are annoying though, they are very complex with multiple essays and he only gives you 24 hours to do them so sometimes that causes issues if you have other obligations. Other than that he is great!",1
"His lecture exams are horrible each multiple choice question is 3 pts so if you get 3 wrong you are already 90%  I am really disappointed taking his class I just did not have any choice he was the only one listed for bio 242. Boring lectures not helpful for exams. His study guide is useless, don't spend your money and time.",0
Awesome professor. She gives out a lot of helpful examples and is very helpful during her office hours. You do need to work for your grade but it's not too hard. You'll do well as long as you study and do the extra credit,1
Ana is my favorite prof at Chapman!! She assigns the necessary homework and really cares about her students. She is so sweet and has a happy disposition every day. I learned quite a bit from her class. Make sure to take her class because she is an absolute gem. It's a great class to take over interterm.,1
"Alex is probably my favorite professor here at Pitt. If you see that her rating is a 4.9 and assume it is an easy class, you're so wrong. It was probably one of the hardest classes I have taken so far (I took up to Calculus in high school). Be prepared to do a lot of work. She is super nice and absolutely loves cats and is a great teacher",1
"Bogdan is a great teacher who really knows his stuff. Hes a very relaxed teacher and his lectures are great. He is one of the best professors that I have had, if you have the opportunity to take his class take it",1
I had a wonderful experience in her poetry class. She is laid back and cares about you. Critiques were fun. Gives clear info on how you can improve your poems. Easy poetry assignments.,1
Best teacher Ive ever had!!!,1
The single hardest and most rewarding thing I've done at KU. I apply dense feminist theory from this class to real life. We had a group project on human trafficking policies that we literally presented to her personal friend at the Department of State. Brilliant professor and person. My friend cried in her office hours and she was nice about it.,1
One of the most intelligent professors I have ever met. Slides have clear logic for students to follow. Definitely should take it if you wanna gain some real perspective in bio.,1
"Very passionate and knowledgeable! Statistics is a very dense subject, but he made it very easy for me to understand! There were times when I struggled, but he was very open to answering my questions before and after class, and was patient and friendly the entire time! Beware: he only helps those who put in an effort! If you're a slacker, avoid!",1
a very nice guy. class discussions were always interesting and he makes you think about the topics. will spend a lot of time with you on your essays. really good,1
"Professor Montanari is really knowledgeable of what she teaches and provides great examples. Theres 8 timed quizzes, 3 assignments with a partner, a midterm, and a final. Everything is in the PowerPoints and on what she posts. Its an overall easy A. Just do the work.",1
"Love this woman! She is very fair with her grading, and gives you several paragraphs on her opinion of your papers. She uses all of the textbooks (the entire thing). According to other students I talked to, she teaches different things that other ENGL 101 teachers dont teach. She is very interesting and loves her students. A must take class!",1
Fun easy class. ,1
"I really like Angela as a person, and she's clearly knowledgable, but her First Year Seminar was a bit tedious. She only had three books on the syllabus but they were all difficult to find and once you got them you only used them maybe two or three times. If you do what little assignments there are you'll be fine.",1
"One of the best math profs I've ever had, a lot of examples in class and mini assignments that force you to stay on top of things. Very understanding if you need extensions and super nice and reasonable if you go talk to him outside class. Hates phones going off in class but super chill :)",1
"She is a great professor and is more than willing to help if you have any questions. Some of the material is difficult to understand, but she goes over it in class to try and make it clearer. Very little homework, mainly just some worksheets that go over the math that is introduced.",1
"NOT a fun course to take. The material is interesting. I like the narrative format of the online discussion questions. He is a HARD marker. You have to somehow know exactly what he wants to hear otherwise it is wrong. Multiple choice is written to confuse, not prove your knowledge. Felt like he was on an intellectual power trip with grading.",1
"Amira is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had! She did an excellent job introducing a difficult language to us. But don't take this to mean it's an easy A: you have to participate in class if you expect to be learning the material. Amira really DOES care about her students though, so absolutely go to office hours to talk about anything!",1
"I had him as my prof; when he loses his temper, he will become a wild aggressive attacker. why is he teaching us?",0
"Oh boy, this was not what I expected when I signed up for his class. I barely passed this class. Its true, he didnt teach and he didnt prepare us for the longest and worst exam of of life. Pure hell with him. At the end he let us retake exams and that helped me pass but I wouldnt ever take this again. F ++++ for his teaching! Worst professor!",0
"Madame Reisinger is a kind and wonderful lady, but she will make you work for your grade! She gives difficult quizzes, multiple difficult and time-intensive projects, and lots of readings. If you can manage the workload, the class is very good and will definitely improve your French.",1
Overall tough and unfair grader. Would not take again.,0
"Bob was one of the best professors I have had here at Keene. His class was so interesting and fun that I never wanted to miss class. We did a lot of speeches but, everyone in the class had become more comfortable with speaking. I would recommend Bob to anyone, he not only wants to see his students succeed but also cares for them.",1
She is a wonderful professor. Very bright and cares about her students and whether or not they are understanding the material. If she teaches a class that you need to take I would highly recommend taking it with her. She is wonderful!,1
Pretty much just talks about himself for 3 hours. Very boring class but I would recommend you bring other homework and it can become a very nice study time. Study his study guides and you will be fine. Only 3 tests make up your grade.,1
"Took for kickboxing.  She's great, upbeat, positive, and pushes you.  Lost 20 lbs in her class.  I'm a male, I have a black belt, and she still made me sweat and sore.  She always has more tricks to workouts to work u harder. Games are great, she kicks butt, very strong and competent.",1
I am a full time student and employee. I have test anxiety and this professor is patient. He will let me sit in on other lectures if I miss any. As well as is flexible with letting me take tests later on(and I haven't even told him about my anxiety). He is very nice. He isn't one of those professors who takes a bad day out on you. Very proffesional,1
He is very clear and his lectures are very organized. He tells you everything you need to know for the exam. Use his powerpoints as a study guide. He is also very caring and inspirational.,1
"He is one of the best math teachers Ive had. He goes out his way to make sure you understand whats going on. Hes a very brilliant professor. Hell even bring in snacks to class. Like cupcakes before spring break! If you have to take stats, I highly recommend him. He returns emails pretty quickly as well.",1
"She is so nice. I very like how she organizes her classes, how she communicates with the students. She is cool.",1
Mi-Sook is a fantastic professor who gives great feedback and cares a great deal about her students. I have developed so many new skills in this class! Do not be late or turn in assignments late and you will succeed. I would definitely take a class with her again.,1
"He is very clear, clever, committed to committed students, makes social commentaries so that people learn. An excellent, compassionate (about art)teacher.",1
"Professor Mancini was pretty good. Some of the homework seems overwhelming, but if you do one by one and read all the instructions, you will pass them all with 100%. She is a very easy grader, just participate! Read all the power points (a few times) which is summarized from book, all the answers to the tests are there. Grades super fast which I 3",1
Prof. Dattolo really cares about his students His lectures are clear and well organized and he is always available to help us if we need him. His kindness and respect are greatly appreciated. He goes highly recommended!,1
Avoid Dr. Kim. She is INTENSE. She doesn't understand that not everyone wants to get their masters in chemistry. She rushes through complex subjects because they are easy to her. She said that other professors make her life hard because they dont teach what she teaches. She was rude to me when I went to her office. She is a VERY tough grader.,0
"(Note: Class attended at University of Houston Victoria MBA Program)   Dr. Singh shows up to every class in high spirits. It was the highlight of my day to participate in his class. His lectures expand on the assigned chapter. He was always insightful and attentive to student's questions. Show up to class, put in the effort and you will get an A.",1
great person but awful professor. she never lets you out a second early and be ready for a huge homework load.  she seems to think that her class is the only one students take.  if you don't want to be stressed out and annoyed all semester DONT take her,0
"Very nice professor. Tests are difficult and sometimes seem unrelated to the lectures. He does curve which is good. About 10 cases studies as homework. Pick a good group for the project and don't slack off. Lectures are long and sometimes boring, but he offers a lot of real world insight and advice. More than willing to help you if you need it.",1
"Good teacher, definitely a take. Not too difficult and expectations are very reasonable. Pretty good amount of reading, and if you read it all an A should be very easy. Not a tough grader.",1
"If you are thoughtful with your responses, you will do good in this class. There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. He replies to emails quickly.",1
You use wileyplus instead of blackboard. It costs extra and honestly is pretty confusing. He barely remembered to post anything on time. Honestly for as little as he did to teach us I think he should have gave us all As. Dont plan to learn anything in his class. Not good for students who do not want to teach themselves the material.,0
I thought his lectures are interesting but not mandatory if you study the powerpoints. Tests based on online quiz and lecture. MC tests were easy but you don't know what questions that are based on lectures will be in it. Some online quizzes answers can be found online but don't count on it. No curve so don't mess up on your exams.,1
You hardly have to pay attention in class in order to get a good grade: everything is common sense. Lockhart is a really nice professor and he is really funny. I enjoyed the class a lot. ,1
"Great physics teacher! Has accent, but you'll get used to it quickly! The way he teaches lets you to truly understand the material. He does practice problems in class and assigns hw and make sure you pay attention because the bulk of his test come from these places. He is really helpful and wants you to do your best! Get on his side and he can help",1
"She is very knowledgeable about pediatric material and her power points are very clear.  She expects you to read the book but only the parts that she discusses in the power points and she gives you hints throughout the class on what might show up on the test.  Very fair tests!  Great professor, I wish all the nursing profs were like her!",1
"Patient, knowledgeable and accessible. Pushes you to do one step more than you thought you could do. Good at bringing out people's talent. Excellent teacher. Professional at what he teaches as well.",1
"I've had Dr. Ryner for a few classes, at first I was concerned because he spent so much time on obvious stuff, but that was in his ""introductory"" class and things can get VERY intense later on! He's extremely smart and he loves the subject. He's always helpful outside of class. TAs are lame, but he only uses them in huge classes.",1
"Professor Carson is literally one of the sweetest professors Ive had the pleasure of meeting. His class is easy and all you have to do is write a few paragraphs. He cares and respects all his students, he is highly respected.",1
"This professor doesn't curve the test or do anything when the class average is below a passing grade than tell you to drop the class, no extra credit or anything. So if math doesn't comes to you easily then this teacher isn't the best teacher for you. You can be dropped from the class because of attendance but it is not apart of your grade.",0
"Ins. Warden is a kind woman and her lectures aren't bad. I only go to class to be counted for attendance and in-class assignments. She doesn't give many test or papers, just one long paper. The class is not hard, you just have to do your homework and pay attention to what you write. Don't make stupid mistakes and she will help you if you ask.",1
Dr. Vohs was an amazing professor who was always willing help students. He even gave out his cell phone number so that students could text him questions. Would definitely recommend.,1
"Lectures are clear and thorough, and he often takes time in his lectures to have the class discuss the material or work on activities that model concepts being taught. He grades homework and tests pretty harshly, but everything on them is material covered well in class, so study and go to class and you'll be fine. Likeable and very willing to help.",1
Great prof! Very funny and great guy overall! He teaches the material VERY well. He gives you notes and posts them online. He really wants his students to do well. All of his assignments and projects are group work!! He's available often after class. Doesn't approve of phones ringing in class. Fair grader as well!,1
Overall a good teacher.  However I did have some difficulty understanding some of his instructions.,1
Really cool teacher with a great sense of humor. I learned a lot too.,1
"This professor is the best for MIS 310. I am not sure where the negative reviews are coming from, but I have yet to learn so much useful content in any other class at GMU. This class is structured to have a 1/2 point quiz before classes, three individual assignments and three exams. The expectations are very clear, and structured.",1
very nice professor.  he sets up conferences when you write your essays to work with you to make your paper better.  he is always willing to help and answer questions.,1
"Class is disorganized and doesnt have clear expectations. Lectures are long, boring and not organized. Doesnt have the ability to connect with any students, and often asks questions that only he knows the answer to. If you think you know the answer he probably wont accept it. Noticeably annoyed  when answering any students questions.",0
"He is a Superman! A brilliant performer,  a prodigious mentor and just an exceptional human being!",1
"Dr. Schore is a great professor. Orgo is a hard course, so it takes more than just listening to lectures to pass. Get the textbook early and read the chapters before class. Also do the end of the chapter problems to help you get a better grip on the concepts. Do (or attempt to do) all the problems in the discussion manual as well.",1
"I LOVE Dr. Searfoss. I had her for ENG3300 and for ENG3610 and really enjoyed both classes. She teaches in a way that really makes sense to me, and she's always willing to help! She is not going to beat around the bush though, so just remember that you're in these classes to LEARN and not to be right all the time, and you'll be good.",1
"I was never good at Math. In fact, I had to retake stats this semester with Susan. I no longer am intimidated by math and currently have an A in the class. She is caring and wants to help her students out. Homework is not extensive and her exams are identical to practice test given in class. TAKE HER!!!!",1
One of the best science professors I've had!! He really gets his students motivated about the subject and wants to see everyone succeed. ,1
Professor Lane teaches well and will make sure you understand the material. In Cisc110 we were given quizzes weekly that usually allowed you to attempt it 3 times. Having the multiple tries was nice in understanding my mistakes. Highly recommend her.,1
He's a pretty fair grader and the course it set up for students to succeed. The only thing I would criticize is that he's a little scatter brained and isn't really too organized.,1
"Great prof. Was a bit apprehensive since this was my first seminar course. He made it really easy though. The course isn't too heavy but you do have to go to class prepared. Had a few short assignments, one final paper and a presentation. You'll also be graded on class participation as well. This is a seminar after all. Highly recommend.",1
Great class!,1
"Had her for peds lecture. She is nice, and lectures from power point slides. The exams are pretty easy if you read the chapters and mainly study the slides.",1
"Jay is one of the best professors at Bentley. He knows so much about audit, and is truly dedicated to educating people on the subject. There would be no reason to take anyone else for audit. So passionate, very entertaining, and gives so many opportunities for extra credit. Great teacher, highly recommended, and you will learn a lot.",1
Great Teacher! He wants his students to do well and will go out of his way to help you. Really enjoyed his class. Looking forward to taking Span 2 with him next semester.,1
Prof McGlynn was a lovely teacher. Shes very passionate about education and her lectures aren't long and dragged out. She's very fun and encourages student interaction and there was a lot of moving around for assignments. Very easy class and insightful as well.,1
Prof McLeod was such a great guy as well as being an amazing professor. He genuinely cared about his students and their performance. He enjoys the material he teaches especially when his students are able to connect and understand it. Class was just graded on a few homework assignments and exams but was very easy if you knew what you were doing.,1
"Prof. Drumond is crystal clear in his expectations, organized & made learning Spanish fun. Good for NON Span speakers to take. You WILL talk to others and do group work often in cls. Provides review sessions for his quizzes. Attendance IS taken. Avail after class for ?'s.  1 Oral presentation. Online hw. Book includes book for Span2. Excellent prof",1
"Take him!!! Best professor I had for my last semester at FIU. He is VERY clear on everything, explains everything very well, answers emails quickly, and easy material. The only way you'll fail is if you don't do the work.",1
"I understand both students and professors are having a hard time with COVID. But even now, this guy is still such a harsh grader and is still teaching religiously by the book, exceptions are very limited. Even if wifi is hard to come by, Zoom attendance required. Difficulty for exams and labs is ridiculous, pls cut some slack for your students.",0
"Worst professor in modern history. Teaching is just not for her. She made up an imaginary periodic table for exams, she doesnt care at all. Im begging every student do not take her classes if you want to learn and pass. She is just awful. I wished I read the comments before taking her class. Absolutely do not waste your time and money with her.",0
Needs to repent...very creepy..lots of perversity going on there,0
"If you have never had any PR writing experience, at least you learn something. But if you've done an internship or been involved with Cardinal Comm, you will be told you're doing everything wrong if it's not ""her way"". Also she changes the assignments at the last minute and you want to smack your head on the table repeatedly every day. Good luck.",0
"He is more than clear, giving insight from real world situations and examples. If you pass the class, you will definitely have a solid understanding of the material. The tests cover the basics and you better practice plenty of problems or you will stumble. Overall, one of the best professors Ive had so far.",1
"Very sweet woman, caring, and puts her students at ease.",1
"EASY A, but he did pick on me alot through out the semester. He seems unhappy in his marriage and belittles you when your proud of your happy marriage. Like I said, EASY A, and gives extra credit as well as extra redit for attendence. Also, no need for book..",1
I do not recommend this teacher at all. I took the online course and she is very bad at responding to emails in a timely manner. She does nothing to help the students and grades unfairly. People who do horrible on their speeches seem to get better grades than those who are actually good at public speaking. DO NOT TAKE HER if you want a good grade.,0
Awesome and very Professional! I am able to use everything he taught me.  He keeps it real and exciting! I would love to work with him the field.,1
"First of all, its not the easiest class in the world, and it certainly didnt help that Rayburn didnt seem to care to actually TEACH the material...pretty much he just told you to do it and whether you not you already knew how to do it or not didnt matter. Hopefully if you take this class, you are able to look at the book and just teach yourself...",0
"OMG MR. FURNO!!!! This was one of my favorite teachers ever! Mr. Furno is HILARIOUS! I had doubts about this class at first, but Mr. Furno made the class so fun, by the end i didn't want to leave! I wish I could take all my classes with this professor! Easy A in this class if you participate and pay attention! He makes learning fun!",1
"She is very tough on papers. She gives good feedback, but it is mostly little things that she gets you for. I rarely got anything less than A's last semesters english class, but I got a C on the big paper. I've had others honestly tell me what they think and I have been told it wasn't a C paper... She is sweet and definitely not boring! :)",1
"Professor Fan is generally fantastic, she has genuine interest and experience  in the field of environmental economics and it shows in her lectures. She's friendly and easy to engage with in and out of class. She has a bit of an accent but it's more endearing than it is problematic. Listen to her lectures closely and you shouldn't need the book.",1
I did not like this teacher he is very boring and will not go on until someone answers a question in class. His tests are easy and gives you what to study. He never takes role but goes over alot in class and sometime has assignments due at the end. He gave a lot of extra credit opps. but he is a nice professor. He can be an easy A!,0
If you want to learn accounting principals throughly take her class. One of the best professors at Westfield in my opinion. She is definitely the reason accounting is my concentration.,1
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
"Really straight forward class that  includes two midterms, one book review, and a final. Exams are multiple choice with one short answer. The study guides she post make studying for the exams super easy. Questions from the readings and inclass videos are on the exams. Doesnt require too much effort to do well.",1
I dropped this course and decided to take it instead with Raney over the summer and it was the BEST decision I could have made. She found a way to make calculus easy and relevant to SLHS majors and I am so happy I took this course with her. She took a class of students with math phobia and made them feel relaxed and I truly feel like i learned.,1
"Her class wasn't that bad if you are not a CS major.  You won't retain anything that's covered in the class.  The class is one of those ""write it down, memorize it, and put it back down on a test.""  Since I wasn't a CS major, I could care less.  It was one of the few A's that I've gotten.",1
"Difficult classes, but very interesting. Dr. Evans is a really nice guy and is always willing to help. Very fair in grading.",1
"Lecture's optional but I would recommend going because they are entertaining and he includes real world applications to what you're learning. He cares that you learn the material and succeed as opposed to trying to fail you, which is a nice change of pace in the ME college.",1
"Seems like a great teacher if you take his class in person. I, however, took his class online and it was not great. He words instructions poorly, his grading expectation is that you photograph your notebook work and submit that instead of using ExploringStatistics or another online module (What?) for homework, & doesn't list test dates in syllabus.",0
Dr Borglin has extreme difficulty breaking down and building up on important concepts. She jumps from one thing to another without explaining the first one. Her inability to break concepts down and poor organization skills is a major reason why I struggled in this class. I got paid with an A but it was all through my own effort not hers. ,1
"Cynthia is an awesome teacher but I did not get anything out of this class. What I learned in this class was based off my own research or other students presentations. Ask her a question once, and she'll confuse you even more. You have to keep asking her the same question to get a clear answer. But at least she helps!",1
"Professor West is very caring and patient. This is what kept me coming back to class. I have to admit, I struggled with the content of this course, however, Professor West was able to break it down to where everyone understood enough to get a decent grade. I highly recommend taking this class! very chill and laid back. We only had 3 test.",1
I took this class as a hybrid course.  We met twice a week in the classroom.  She is an amazing instructor and loves what she teaches.  Very informative and cares about her students.  Loved this class!,1
"If speaking isn't your thing, he's the perfect professor. He is really easy on grading and format for speeches. Impromptu speeches make it so you need to show up to class and he subtract a lot of points for not being there for others speeches. The people who didn't get As are the people who missed multiple speeches. If you try you'll get an A",1
"He's very nice and will help you if you need it. He hands out notes for each class and gives out a review before each test, which are very helpful. If you put in the effort, you should be able to easily get an A. One of the best MCC professors.",1
"I just finished my third chemistry course with this professor. I wish she could teach all of my science courses. She is clear, organized and easy to follow. She assigns worksheet problems that really help you learn. She told me what to do to learn. When I did what she said, I aced the tests. Her tests are fair. Chemistry is hard, she really helped.",1
This professor is so hard if you do not know spanish and to top it off he is a prefectionist. If you miss an accent or mispell somethings its wrong. He is boring and his class is to hard.,0
"You will LIVE in your textbook. She is a loving person but the worst professor I have ever taken. Unfortunately she is just uneducated, a bad teacher andirresponsible. She DOES NOT HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING, lab or lecture. ""What does the book say?"" She simply doesn't know the material well enough toteach it the 1 time she answered me, she was wrong.",0
Best teacher I have ever had. She wants you to succced and makes herself available for you even if it cuts into her own time. I highly recomend her.,1
"I'm not good at politics at all but this class helps me stay on top of what's going on and also it's very interesting. She challenges you to think ""outside the box"" so to speak, and encourages debate & disagreements. No papers for this class, only quizzes and exams that are all essays. I thought she's an easy grader given how I've done so far.",1
"Dr. K is amazing! I loved her class so much! Lots of reading/writing, but that's to be expected for an english class. She truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She does give out reading quizzes, but they're not difficult if you've read the material. I wish more professors were like her!",1
"I took online, had he is VERY hard to reach by email, he'd take more than a week and a half to respond; sometimes the thing I needed from him was already passed. 4 quizzes,2 exams, 5 discussion boards, and 8-10 page paper. There is an extra credit class on a Saturday; just go it is super chill. QUIZZES ARE HARD, READ BOOK!!!",1
You get distracted by looking at him,1
She is super nice and tries to be very helpful but the textbook is very dry and so is the material. ,1
"Instead of set hours of lectures, she posts short and concise videos going over materials you read in the textbook, which is a nice review/summary if you are into that. You do need to read the textbook though, just watching the lectures is NOT going to be enough. She also holds review sessions before each quiz which is very helpful.",1
"This man was one of my favorite professors. I had a great time in his class and his papers were always incredibly fun to write. Oh yeah, call him Doc.",1
"Professor Lang is so far the best professor that I've had at UB. The subject matter can be dry, but he makes the best of it and keeps students entertained. He is extremely knowledgeable and is the definition of a great professor. Take his class!",1
"his lectures are pretty rough bc he's kinda hard to hear/understand but he's a really nice guy & he isn't one of those professors that tries to make exams impossible. even if the exam was super hard and everyone fails, his curve will save you. theres a reaaallyyy nice curve in the end. (i had a 64% which got curved to a B)",1
"Marty's portion of Econ 1051 was a breeze. While she occasionally rushes through lectures, she's insightful and incredibly helpful, both in and out of the classroom. I look forward to taking a class with her again, if the opportunity presents itself. She and her co-instructor Dr. Chikhladze complement each other well.",1
Very nice professor. Will help you if you need anything. Tough information that he explains really well - so go to class and make your own notes in the sidelines of his slides so it's clear to you. Tests are based only on what he talks about in class (somewhat hard).  Suggest buying the book online through Aplia (he will explain that) saves MONEY!,1
Dr. Grover is the best professor in the entire university. He knows how to teach students in a fun and enjoyable manner and his lectures very easy to understand. He is a unique professor who likes to make sure his students understands the lessons being taught in the class all the time. Do all the design challenges and you will surely get an A+.,1
"Mr. Gerritsen has showed me what a true professor should be like. Not only did he teach us the importance of Genetics, he taught us other vital information. He prepared us for possible interview questions, gave us helpful advice, and went above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable with the content. HIGHLY recommend.",1
"I took this online, and it was probably the easiest class I have ever taken, BUT do every study guide for each test which requires you to read the book to find the answers. The study guide is usually 100 questions and the test is composed of 50 of those 100 questions. Tip: highlight the answers in Word, then when it's time for the test, ""ctrl + f"".",1
"Math is my weakest subject, but professor Crocoll was a great professor. It's exam heavy, doesn't require homework, though recommends it for the quizzes. 5 Exams (18-33 questions each,) 17 quizzes. + MAJOR extra credit for (persistent) math lab hours. Also drops lowest score for exams and two lowest scores for quizzes.",1
"Has a unique way of capturing your attention by approaching his lectures every time with a positive attitude and a smile. he makes history not at all boring, but fun and interesting.",1
"A very heavy course, but taking it with Dr Rogers makes it a lot more bearable. She is extremely passionate about the subject, and makes it hard for you to not be at least a little interested in it. Even for someone like me who went into the class dreading chemistry.",1
"Honestly probably the best professor I've had at FandM. She comes off as tough at first, and she can be if you slack off, but she is also very understanding and caring when needed. Her lectures are amazing - she is incredibly knowledgable about her subject. You will learn a lot from this class if you put in the effort. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"Had her for lecture and lab. She was very personable and always nice to talk to. She really wants her students to succeed, so she gives a lot of participation marks and even bonus questions! Her online class was structured and organized!",1
"good course, timber is good too but have calculations",1
Just got hired as a 3rd grade elementary school teacher in a charter and find myself drawing on many of the ideas I learned from taking this class into my instructions. Technology was heavy in this class and now I use technology a lot in my class. The professor is smart and supportive. Met with him a few occasions I needed extra help.,1
"Not my favorite English professor here. Her exams are nearly irrelevant with remembering dates that books were written and petty chosen quote IDs that were completely irrelevant to the book themes. Rarely discusses the reading, heavily philosophy based. She could use  improvement.",1
"best professor, he is fair and his class are good. these students that complain seems to have a bad grade which means that they did not do any work. this guy courses are easy to pass. i guess that these students want special treatment to do work when they want. I hope he continues to prep his students they way he is doing",1
"Stay far away from this course. Journals are tough to understand and the course is based off of them. She is really bad with giving back marks so you won't know where you stand until final grades come out. Also, she is the worst lecturer I had in uni",0
"Intro Biotech class, had a lot of material for a 2 credit class and spent a majority of the time talking about plants and roses.",1
"Margarita is a wonderful teacher and a very nice, intelligent person. It's true that her classes move fast, but there is a lot of material to cover in 10 weeks. That's why LBCC offers free tutoring. I took SPN 102, 103, 201, 202 and 203 from her, and loved it.",1
This is one of the best professors at KSU. He's prepared and knows his field. Fair tests and no BS.,1
"Hersha is a great teacher.  She knows a lot about what she teaches and has worked in the business.  Her lectures are interesting and she has a great personality, making classes spunky and different.  This particular class is pretty relaxed, but that does not mean you don't have to read the book and research.",1
When it comes to motivating students Professor Sekta is an absolute genius in delivering motivational speeches. I can't begin to imagine the number of lives this guy has changed. Respect.,1
"I've taken this class three times, and have had two drop twice due to personal health matters. Mrs. Johnson is honestly one of my favorite professors that I've had thus far. Her class is very interesting, however it does cover multiple touchy subject in which she approaches with respect and facts. Even though I passed this class, I would retake.",1
"I'll give you an honest critique. The professor is okay at best. He can be funny at times, but I would stay away from him altogether. The class content is bland, he's bland, it's a horrible combination, snore-fest. Class is v difficult, you will have to work your ass off for an A, to get a C, you can get by half-assing it. Stay away please.",0
Dr. Montanari is amazing. Her lectures were online and were very clear & not too long. Clear on her assignments. Quizzes are on the PPT. Midterm & final all on the PPT. She literally holds your hand in the class. TAKE HER SHE IS GREAT,1
Do not take this professor. She is extremely rude and inconsiderate. I went through horrible family problems and she was not willing to accommodate for me. This professor really made my mental health worse. All I learned from this course was that she needs to be more compassionate...,0
I don't recommend her if you need extra help. I couldn't understand her very well and her method of teaching made it extremely frustrating. She likes to do the hard way before she shows you the easy way and won't fully answer your question. Even if you're good at math i would still hesitate to take this class.,0
"I failed his class, It was super hard and his exams was hard also. will not take again ",0
"Such a disappointing class. A lot of reading dense and irrelevant articles, limited class discussion, no organization, vague assignments, unrealistic expectations. Don't take her for CF!",0
Made this French III class harder than it needed to be in terms of us adding to previously gained knowledge. She could take more time in explaining grammar. But she was okay in general. Going from Mme Vitaglione in French 2 to her was more difficult than it should have been if the point was to have people leave being fluent in French.,0
The professor is good at in explaining concepts but what was taught turned out to be not so helpful for graduate students.,0
Professor Vutha is the best math teacher I've ever had in my life. He legitimitaly cares about students understanding the material and he holds review sessions where you can ask about anything and he explains it in full detail until you understand. I struggled with calculus in high school but now calc is one of my favorite subjects!,1
"This class is all reading. There is a 3 question quiz everyday based on the reading the night before and you need to be there to get the questions for it. His lectures are designed to build upon the knowledge of the last readings. I never read a single paragraph and I made a B, so do with that information what you will.",1
One word defines Chet: Exquisite,1
"He is a good professor orgo is not easy. He does not require attendance but he knows who comes and who doesn't. He is willing to help you, and giving a lot of additional resources to help.",1
"Grades reasonably well, gives great feedback for the group project. Group project isn't too difficult as it is broken up into pieces throughout the course. Tests were the most difficult portion of the class.",1
"Absolutely horrible professor. Completely unorganized, has no understanding of the concept of explaining assignments. Terrible at giving instruction and when asked for help, she's totally vague and doesn't help at all. Would NOT recommend this prof. Take another class.",0
"He is a very interesting teacher to have, he knows what he's talking about. However he grades way harder then my W131 English teacher did and his tests are ""brain dumps"", essays that require you to memorize as many as the random numbers and facts he tells you and then writing them down",1
"a complete mean, arrogant man. Had for visual fund. He recently told the class that we deserved to die if we did not vote (in which it is against some of the classmates religion) and also that 85 percent of the class is waisting their time in school and will be working in retail in their future. Forgive me if i am wrong, but teachers are to help mo",0
"If you're looking for an easy class or even an elective, go for this course. The content could be a bit dry and the lectures are pretty boring, but I'd say Catherine is an easy grader. I was at most of the lectures but did not engage much so participation (or just attendance) doesn't matter much either. So just do the assignments & you'll pass.",1
"She really truly care about everyone in her class. Some of the projects are hard to really get into because its just basic foundation. If you turn your projects in on time you will get a C no matter what. She is very nice, but sometimes hard to understand. You can only miss up to 3 days in this class. Very helpful teacher in the long run.",1
She is nice throughout the semester but does not give any updates about grades. At the end of the semester she basically gives you what she wants you to have. No matter how well you actually did on assignments. She gave our entire class a letter grade below what we actually had because she felt like it. Take her at your own risk!,0
"He has a very thick accent to the point where he cant  pronounce the names of half the people in the class.  Many times nobody in the class understood what he was trying to say.  But he is nice, helpful and understanding. He will keep trying and trying to get across what he needs to for you to understand it. Test are hard but there is a nice curve.",1
"Professor Zlesak is one of a kind! He is very easy to get along with,  and goes above and beyond for his students. He is availble outside of class if needed! He cares about his students, wants to make teaching fun, and he brings snacks to class!!!",1
professor JACOBO  is the greatest professor that I have ever taken at valley  college.  we need more professors like her,1
"If you're like me, PS is not your strong suit. I was nervous to take the class at first, but he made it interesting. He has a way of explaining things that doesn't leave you so confused after. There's not a lot of homework either, he's good at spacing it all out. Not a stressful class at all. He's been very accommodating with the online transition",1
"Professor Tanoukhi is by far the most invested professor I have ever had. She truly wants your reading and writing skills to improve and really puts the effort in to see results. She is very strict about finishing readings by the deadline & expects the most, but with good intentions. She wants people to succeed, and if you do the work, you will. ",1
"Prof McKean is the only teacher for this course.  He IS hard and says it on day 1.  Marks your papers up and does not take time to help you when you come to him. Notice other students papers received an A for the same issue I got a D. Rude, caters to his former students, treats others like in kindergarten. Not patient. ""Pay attention in class!""",1
"Padgett is really knowledgeable, but she's hard to parse. I took ENC1101 and 1102 with her, and while it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, I came out better for it. Papers are now easy. She tends to drift off topic in class, and if you listen to her and can write with your audience (her) in mind, you'll come out with a pass grade.",1
GREAT professor! Really cares about his student! His class and tests are hard! If you are not willing to put in multiple hours worth of studying or want an easy A do NOT take this class - 3 essay questioned test make up ur grade and 1 extra credit paper worth 10 points which is added lowest test grade- I learned so much! would take again!,1
"Assigns online homework on this program mymathlab. It is horrible. I did really well on the my math lab assignments, however once he decided to give us assignments that were 4 sections of the textbook and 90 some problems a piece. absolutely ridiculous! also gives you weekly quizzes with like 8 mins to do them. Completely outrageous!",0
"Outstanding class. Read the text, use the online resource from sagepub, show up, and succeeed.",1
Solari is hands down my favorite political science professor at state! His lectures are engaging and he often shares personal stories to relate to lessons or shows relevant movie clips which makes class more interesting. Your grade consists of 3 papers and participation. It's not difficult to do well so long as you listen to his feedback.,1
"Dr Abdallah Mohamed is the best possible professor anybody could have. He is very helpful and gives a lot of feedback. He explains concepts clearly and he does everything in his power to make sure nobody faces any difficulties, especially in the online environment where technical difficulties are common place. Best prof ever. Thank you Dr Mohamed!",1
"Dhavan is legit the man. He is very knowledgeable about advertising, PR and media with a background in real world experience. He isn't cocky, but just a  really cool dude who happens to be a great teacher as well. Always willing to help out if you see him, canceled class so we could watch the Badger national championship game. One of the best here.",1
"Had Lim for 4 classes, he was my only option for each. I consider him to be the worst professor I had at any point in my college career. I did not receive good feedback on questions I asked. Graded homework did not give feedback. Only benefit seemed to be that many students quit trying, while I did try, leading to me having decent grades. Terrible!",0
Mr. Drumond is a great professor. He is caring and well prepared when it comes to delivering lectures. I took Spanish 1 with him and loved his class. He makes sure to explain material and engages the class often. He loves when people participate. Do the homework and follow through with class lectures and you'll pass easily.,1
Gives a lot of information to learn but her exams are extremely fair.,1
"Lectures were entertaining and informative. He wrote the notes up on the board for everyone to copy down, and these notes were the main thing needed for the tests. Pretty much all grades were just tests. If you miss class, make sure to get the notes because you'll be lost without them.",1
Professor Valltos is awesome. His lectures are engaging and extremely interesting. He does an excellent job using real-life scenarios to explain class material. He's comical and tells it like it is. I would definitely take another class with this professor.,1
"Cool Professor, he's fair and helpful. Has an accent but he's still clear and easy to understand. Group projects, Lots of HW, and 2 exams (mid term and final) which are somewhat difficult. Only annoying this is his grading scale. ex. 93% is an A- rather than the standard 90% being an A-.",1
"Gets off topic a lot, but won't test you (usually) on what you don't cover. I've had four classes with him at this point and if you don't mind tangentially relevant storytelling being tied into the lecture and a quirky sense of humor then he's pretty alright. Nice guy, and was willing to grant extensions for papers, he'll help if you need it.",1
Nice lady.,1
"I thought he was boring and sometimes difficult to understand, but his class wasn't unbearable.  I took Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, so he only taught for a few weeks.  I wouldn't take another class with him.",0
"Good professor. Hard grader with both exams and essays, but if you go to Prof. Major for help, you will deff get a good grade, because he tells you exactly what you need to know and what he is looking for to get the best grade possible. Participation and attendance are a must but  the better your attendance and participation the better your grade.",1
"Wonderful teacher! Gives great insight and advice on professional business writing and communication. Very professional. If you want the grade, you gotta work for it! Go to class, office hours (critical), and keep constant communication. She truly cares about the development of her students and you will gain an excellent experience out of this class. I highly recommend Jeanette!",1
"Greta is a great teacher. We had a lot of papers to write in her classes, but with every one of them she sat down and helped you work your way through it. She is funny and contacts with her class. I recommend her!",1
"Professor Olsson is very sweet and cares about students however, shes very bad at responding to emails. She doesnt give much homework but her assignments are difficult, she doesnt respond to questions about the assignment and grades very hard. Her lectures are more or less reading from slides and when she goes off its very complex w/ no explanation",0
"Melinda is good professor. She reads students work carefully and gives her suggestion. However, she is a tough grader. If you want to have a good score, make sure you spend a lot of time on this course.",1
Best Spanish professor at CLU,1
Do not take any of her classes. I am in FAMS 160 with her and she is so unorganized and never gives clear directions. She never tells us ahead of time when we have projects or tests and does not follow the syllabus. She also does not have any clear grading criteria and her tests are horrible.,0
"Chemistry is a hard subject anyways, but some things he does make easy for you. I personally found his tests to be very difficult. He's a good lecture teacher though, tries to be funny and lightens the mood. I learned more from him than my high school teacher.",1
"The workload isn't crazy but she's picky with your papers. You write 3 stories and you'll need to interview at least 2 people for each of them. No book, online quizzes help your grade, the week before a paper is due you don't have class but you go to her office instead so she can look over your paper",1
Soil Science would be the most boring class ever if it were taught by anyone else.  Dr. Ptak is a good lecturer and he is so willing to help.  He sits down with you and will make sure that you get it.  He teaches some really in depth stuff but you end up walking away feeling like you really know it.  ,1
Epley's class was the best class I took my first semester. In class you focus a lot on discussion and learn how to form your own opinions on controversial matters. As long as you follow instructions and want to improve you will do well. She puts energy into the class and is accepting and encouraging of students. You would do well to take her class.,1
"This is my second course with Dr. Palmer and he's my favorite psych professor at Truman!  His classes only have 2 tests and a few quizzes, so make sure you study hard for the tests.  Read the book and pay attention in lecture, which he makes into a sorta group discussion.  He definitely values everyone's opinion., which is awesome.     ",1
This teacher was easier to work with than some of my highschool teachers.,1
"Some people are really tough on Jesse, but she is pretty cool. She definitely knows her stuff and there are a lot of group discussions in class. She gives you a good taste of what news is like.",1
"She is really great, shes fun, really smart and teaches a lot but doesnt give much work. Expect to get let out about half an hour early, shes super laid back and it wasnt a huge deal if you missed a couple classes she always posted the notes. Like i said almost no work just study for mid terms and finals. Really enjoyed her class.",1
"Super nice teacher. Information was very interesting. No text book, just read case studies, discuss, and write papers. Would recommend this teacher to anyone.",1
"awesome (and im not a history person!) easy class. she is interesting and thorough. I personally did not use the book at all.  I would definitely recommend her,.",1
"If I could give him more than 5 stars, I would. He actually made this class enjoyable, and I truly liked learning throughout this class. Hes extremely accommodative during this pandemic as well. Honestly, just do all your work, have the textbook with you during tests, follow the rubric of the discussion posts, and you will pass.",1
He is simply the best professor to have.,1
Prof. Dattolo made class interesting and fun. I learned so much from him and we really appreciated the kindness and respect he gave us. He was always available outside of class if we needed extra help. He is a very special professor and WPU is lucky to employ him!!,1
gives little to no instruction on the labs you are doing. extremely tough grader. I will never take her again.,0
"Professor Graetzer is absolutely lovely and gives solid feedback. She encourages participation, and teaches in a more loosely structured style which really complements that. I ended up dropping her 103 this term due to it being above my level, but she was completely understanding about that, along with some personal issues I had before dropping.",1
"Nice guy, and truely is a good teacher, but his class is H-A-R-D. I would not reccommend taking him. You have to read the book, do the book problems, always go to class, and the homework is VERY difficult and is graded for accuracy.",1
"Professor Carson was one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He was so caring and helpful. Rather than going straight into talking about school, he made sure to take time to check on each student and even remembered things they told him from days before. He is so kind! Very easy grader but also a great teacher. Looked forward to this class.",1
"Her lectures are a bit scattered, but she's really passionate and engaged with the material, which makes up for it. She gives pop quizzes based off of the readings of that week and there are 3 papers you have to write for this course. She's clear in what she wants from them, but if you need the extra help, she's always there, as well as her TAs.",1
"Dustin is a great teacher and very willing to help outside of class if you need him to. He lines out on day one what is expected of you and by when, his deadlines are actual deadlines so don't miss them. I have taken multiple classes from him. I think he's the best (NOT EASIEST) professor at WSU. I've learned more from him than any other professor.",1
Dom is the best Professor I have ever had! I would highly recommend Dom over Tammy ANYDAY!! He is very understanding and will work with you until you have it figured out :),1
"I haven't taken the final yet and this is my first online math class, I honestly suck at math but this teaches is been really helpful with all of my questions, she answers right away and you have quizzes every week, tests every 3 chapters, and participation every week, she includes videos for every chapter and also notes that are really helpful.",1
"Great professor. He makes sure his speeches are interesting and straightforward. He encompasses the exact material that will be on the tests during review days, so passing them is pretty easy. In all likelihood the best professor, I have ever taken. His positive energy is really contagious. He reminds of an older edition of Chris Traeger !",1
"Professor Abara is hilarious! He makes class interesting, however, a lot of what he says in class doesn't pertain to what's on the test. He seems to get carried away with certain topics. However, he tells you exactly what to study for your tests; the homework is easy and helps A LOT. Go to class, do the homework, and look over his ppts to get an A.",1
He is a professor that doesn't care for his student's grades. He gives the same assignment multiple times and is not specific with what he wants so he will take off unnecessary points just because he feels like it. Wouldn't recommend taking him. Also makes you buy textbook and we NEVER used it.,0
I found the teacher tough but fair. Good feedback on papers and he will read drafts and comment so you can get a better grade. Incredible lectures. How is it that Dr. Solari is not a regular member of the faculty of N.C. State?,1
"Professor Hess was pretty okay. She doesn't use titanium, so when we had to switch to virtual is was unorganized. Her lectures seemed to have no real structure to them. If you have a friend who can proofread your papers, it will make the class easier. but beware of her tough grading.",1
"Best Prof, I feel the students that complaining that he is bad are the ones that think they can do what they want in class. The prof. do not allow disruptive behavior in his class and some people dont like that. I like that the prof follow the rules and try to show us how to be prepared for work",1
I have Holliway for Sociology although he teaches anthropology and psych. He is a super easy going great guy who brings great topics to the class and makes it interesting. I plan on taking his psychology class. participation will get you a long way with him. not much homework or tests.,1
"Good microbiology professor, I would recommend him as one of the best teachers in the CUNY system.",1
"Grading was unclear and inconsistent for detailed reports  for the simulation. He assigned a lot of busy work and some that does not seem to have any value or take away for the purpose of the class, wasted time. Group project was a problem, unfair structure and not all students are held accountable for knowing basic concepts prior to the project.",0
I had Professor Johnson for my first Web Development class. It was easily my favorite class in the program. Really great videos and super helpful. Felt like I learned a lot!,1
"She is very inspiring and motivating, but don't miss too much class.  Your scene partners will not appreciate it and she does not like it either.  And with good reason.  Its hard to perform with someone who doesn't show up.  She appreciates effort, even if you are not especially good.  She just wants to know that you are trying.",1
"Really don't understand all the frustration. She was a great teacher, not all that exciting, but I learned a lot in her class. She even helps everyone out with a grade boosting assignment to finish the semester.",1
SO. MUCH. CONTENT. You are essentially teaching yourself with this online class and in my opinion this class is probably better taken in person. Reaching out for help does nothing and feedback is very generic. The only positive is that Prof. Kumari is an easy grader on discussion posts but that only helps so much when the tests and quizzes are hard,0
"Prof Stockton is awesome, and is such a caring and hilarious man. He is well seasoned and it was great to hear some of his life stories in between the philosophy lectures. I will definitely be taking his classes in the future!",1
"Luigi make the effort to teach the content the easiest way possible. Well prepared for his classes, usually gives homework that covers what is going to be on the exam too.",1
"his class is pretty straight forward, pass the quizzes and do the homework and the tests will be really easy, plus he drops certain assignments which helps a lot. he conducts fun experiments and takes the class to the planetarium which was really fun and interesting. Plus he likes The Beatles! so why not take his course.",1
Great guy whos knowledgeable and cares about the subject. The class is a lot of work though about 12+ readings and 2 short papers per week. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU DONT WRITE WELL YOU WONT PASS THERE ARE NO GRADES OTHER THAN PAPERS/DISCUSSION POST.,1
"EASY CLASS . EXCELLENT PROFESSOR. I took this class for 8 weeks and it was such an easy A . Attendance is mandatory, she will go over the chapter every class and the reviews are awesome, you need to buy the book in order to pass the test, its very helpful.",1
"awesome teacher, dry sense of humor and makes class interesting. He relates class lessons to every day life and makes students leave better critical thinkers. Encourages and pushes students to do their best.",1
"Dr. Wilhite is an extremely difficult professor. She's hard to learn from, but if you're interested, you're guaranteed to receive good grades.",0
"This professor is super hard and doesn't really "" teach "" persay, you want history to be like well history and not english. there is a TON of work, and if you don't read the book you are screwed. she doesn't give notes and what she does give its words here and there, i hated this class and she makes me glad i'm not a history major.",0
He's a good person. Everything you could ask for in a professor.,1
"Honestly one of the best professors I've had at U of M. Provides a fun learning environment, as well as real life tools, and skills to utilize them. His teaching style helps you understand the topics very well and critically. Lots of fun examples, and in-class discussions. Tests are difficult, but what test isn't... Projects are actually fun though",1
"First math prof. at MUN, great guy and great teacher",1
"Dr. Mikhaeel was a very nice professor. He cares about his students and wants them to pass. However, he did not update us on our grade at all throughout the semester - so it is a guessing game for what my final grade will be. He is very lecture heavy and I found it hard to keep up with him/comprehend the material. Overall not a bad professor.",1
"Professor Hinshaw is simply an amazing person. His class was phenomenal. He is one of the most engaging lecturers I've encountered at Cal and a truly good person. Office hours were such a joy, and I always left with some nugget of wisdom. I wish this class were a year long. I would take any class with this professor! He's one-of-a-kind.",1
"She really thinks she is an intellectual, and will hold it over anyone who doesn't meet her standards. Snobby and unpleasant to learn from. Demeaning. She needs to work on her personal issues and know when to leave them at the door. There are better teachers at BCC.",0
"Don't listen to the people saying that you CANNOT understand him, yes he has an accent but you get over it after the first class. 20% of the class is online homework and if you utilize his office hours you should get 100's. Three exams and a final, with your best exam being 30%, second best 20%, worst 10%. Very helpful outside of class!!",1
"He is no help at all and is just awful, don't know how he has a teaching license.",0
"Super funny guy. There are random in class assignments so its your best interest to show up. 2 test, 3 quizzes, 5 assignments. 10/10 would take again.",1
This might be the easiest 3 credits you will get in your academic career. He is entertaining and the slides provided are all you need to get through the class. Take this class if you need 3 science non-lab credits.,1
"Took his for Phys 2211. This class is a tough class, however, this professor makes it much tougher. There are only 3 Tests (60%), Homework (10%), and the Final (30%). The tests only have 3 questions which are extremely hard.  I beg you, do not take this professor. Wait a semester if you have to. Pick ANYONE else.",0
She is super willing to help you if you ask her for more clarity. Willing to explain why you got the grade you did.,1
"She is a really nice teacher, always helps if you need it gets the class involved and keeps the topic interesting as much as she can. An excellent professor to say the least",1
"Awful! Wouldnt recommend to anyone. No help outside of class. Has an agenda and wont slow down to help students. Knows her content but isnt there to teach, just there to collect a pay check.",0
LOVE him! He's so smart and interesting. Approaches literature in a way I've never been taught before. Take him rather than take the class- you will not regret it!,1
"Inspirational, hilarious, there for you, would take all my CJ classes with him; great instructor... and the hotness .... ha-ha :)",1
I took Math 1000 during the summer 2020 and Dr Dyer was extremely helpful for getting through the course. The textbook he used was free online for us and was okay but the videos he provided as well as the extra help really made the course easier.,1
she wants all of her students to pass the class but she doesn't really teach. You MUST learn from the online homework or you wont do well in this class but she is  very helpful if you don't understand.,1
"The first professor Ive ever rated 5 stars. I absolutely enjoyed myself in his class. Attendance is mandatory if you want an A and doing the homework will save your life on the quizzes. It took some effort to keep an A in his class, however, he really made learning the material exciting and hes always so willing to help. Favorite professor by far",1
"If you study as days go by as how he throws questions on his exams. You will be just fine. Some of his questions on his exams are repetitive, but different numbers as you take next exam, especially piecewise defined functions. If you don't pass his exams, you'll have a chance to correct them and math center will help you if you don't get it.",1
"He always picks the hardest things to do a paper on. Can we ever get a topic that does not deal with plato. PLEASE grade easier on the papers, and exams, have some mercy on the grades. And try to rethink a grade sometimes. That would be very, very nice to do for a person.",1
"Mr. Carson was a nice man, however as a professor he would often treat us like freshmen in high school. The first 3 weeks were about MLA. The class became tedious and almost painful to go to. He would provide good feedback on papers, however there were ALOT of them. I liked him just not his class. He said attendance was mandatory but never checks.",0
"Overall, she's a solid choice! Her exams are straightforward and the lectures before the exams are dedicated to a small review which usually outlines what you need to know. If you study a minimal amount and review her powerpoints, you should be good to go. During lectures, she has a tendency to talk a LOT, but she's extremely kind and eloquent :D",1
"I like most people found this class to be very easy. Her exams are just like homework. It may be challenging if you are not a native speaker of English due to the nature of the topics - syntax, semantics, phonetics etc. I enjoyed this class and found the topics interesting. Professor Macauly is a nice professor. I would recommend the course.",1
"I LOVE LAURA ZINK! I. LOVE. HER. SHE.IS.AMAZING! Such a great teacher, very passionate about the subject she teaches, open to talking to students after during office hours about ANYTHING. Every single hand out and lecture contained meaning and was very useful. Take her class if you want to learn to write well.",1
Professor Allen is ALL lecture with very unhelpful outlines. Always left class not knowing what I learned. He wants people to participate but then likes to disrespect people's thoughts. He is knowledgeable but constantly gets off topic and is painfully boring. I won't take him again. Study guides are broad and tests are blue book and writing heavy.,1
"Shah is a great guy who loves all areas of strategic communications. His background in advertising and public campaigns provides the framework for the course and gives you a taste of the real world. The tests are not bad, but the J345 project will consume your life. However, you will learn a lot from the project and enjoy it.",1
"Compared to other professors, she is expremely organized and amazing. She provides great lectures in-person and online and she also recommends watching other online lectures from other professors, which really helps to understand the material. She is the type of professor to want you to learn rather than fail. I 1,000% recommend taking her class.",1
You really will work for your grade more than any other class honestly. Try Not to take her class if you have a lot of other classes as well her class requires a lot of time. Studying is mandatory as well good luck youll need it.,0
"easy easy easy A! He uses a website that shows videos on how to do the problems, and then you have a problem just like the problem in the video. If you get it wrong, you get reattempts to do them over to get them right. Make sure  you don't slack on the due dates of the assignments because you don't want to be behind. Take forever to catch up.",1
"Park required me to take this course for a pre requisite for their BSN RN program. Any of the science courses are hard, it requires a lot of attention to detail and hard study time. I dont think its just this professor its science courses in general.. I took this course over the summer 8 week class received an A, just be ready to study hard.",1
at first i was dreading this class. But Prof. Kaur is very helpful and her class goes by very quickly. their is a student presentation every class which makes time fly by. She assigmens alot of reading which isnt bad as long as you keep up. Three tests and a final paper. She is a sweetheart and really cares about her students.,1
"I enjoyed taking professor Abraham. The class was easy and I felt that I did learn a decent amount. However, she rarely responds to emails and her assignments are always lacking in explanation. I do wish we got more feedback from her and not my peers. Overall, it was a decent class and I learned from it.",1
"Mr. Nelson is a really nice guy and very understanding, but he lectures every day, nonstop. It is tons of note taking, but the tests just consisted of choosing vocab words and writing the definitions, then a couple pre-chosen essays. You have to go everyday as he doesn't use Blackboard to post notes. He's an ok choice, but a super friendly guy.",1
"I have never once had any issues with any professors at Clark, but Jamey Marsh is not one that I would recommend taking. I would not say that Professor Marsh cares about his students success because he purposefully sets you up to fail. He is not helpful when it comes to trying to understand what you got wrong, and you only pass because of the curve",0
"He's nice, but I haven't learned squat from him. You can come in 30 minutes before class is over & he won't count you absent, takes late assignments, won't drop you, lets you text in class, etc. He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations.",1
"Alyssa makes you work for your grade, but if you attend her classes and participate you'll get a good grade. She lets you revise papers and will give good feedback on how to improve it.",1
"An excellent prof who truly cares about his students. ""Abdu"" has clear grading criteria. I would DEFINITELY recommend this amazing prof.",1
The only professor I have had at Roane State that actually uses Powerpoint. I came from a 4 year University and appreciate this so much as all my other teachers seem to be stuck in 1982. If you study the Powerpoint and Homework assignments you will do well. You have to study the material! Always willing to help and answer any questions you have.,1
"Gives directions very quickly and sometimes makes it hard to follow lecture/lessons. Often says he'll ""lecture for 30 minutes and then you'll have time to work"" but frequently the lectures lasted much longer, resulting in little in-class time to work & ask questions. Though, he is helpful when you ask questions.",0
"She is a caring professor who is passionate about teaching. The homework assignments were quite easy. There were hardly any tests or quizzes, mainly essays and papers. She makes herself available outside of class and really wants to help students. If you are willing to put in a bit of work, her class is an easy A.",1
Awsme prof!Vry hlpful!she warns u 1st day of class that a lot of it is on u to study. she's not a magician!she really tries to help u get a good grade and provides review but u have to study!it's a bio class n this is college so what do u expect?Hole's pre/post tests=best friends4lec exms.practice labs everyday!no joke!put in the wk u will succeed!,1
"Honestly, this class was pretty easy. There is only one assignment a week, if that, and we only had 2 big essays. Lectures weren't mandatory and were recorded, all lectures are easy to understand with some tangents. Prof Peters was a tough grader for the essays, but if you do the weekly assignments you should get an A easily! Lots of extra credit.",1
"Louis Nelson is a great guy and a great teacher.  His lectures are interesting and well organized. Also, he is reeeeeeeeally hot.",1
Awesome teacher. He gave out a lot of note packets but i did not read any of them. The only articles i read were for presentations. Just review his study guiides and write them down on index cards. I was really nervous abou8t his midterm but i over stresse about it. It was so easy i got 100 on it. American People II if you need it take it with him,1
You could actually watch the oxygen leave the room.,0
"Reddy is an awesome teacher and is very kind and seems to enjoy biology. The class is fairly easy. Don't skip class because there's clicker questions each class (download the app). Also DO cogbooks because it's a lot of points! The tests can have tricky questions but just really study the lectures and cogbooks and you'll be fine! Easy A, good class",1
"This class met once a week for about 3 hours or so. He spent each time playing music while talking over it trying to describe which genre the music belongs to but Its incredibly hard to memorize which genre a song aligns to when he talks over it the whole time. Some of his teachings are outdated and when you try to correct him, he gets mad",0
"Dr. Callaway is an energetic, engaging professor, and her class was an amazing experience! She was helpful, if a little vague, outside of class, and her paper-comments were honest and helpful. Tough grader on papers, but her focus on participation should boost any ""off"" grades.",1
"3 chapters in the 1st week with 10 assignments that took multiple hours to do each. He lets the book teach, I outlined the chapters & did all the extra problems from the book. He is very strict about the academic code. You have to make sure you re-word everything into your own words. Syllabus & FAQs are frightening. Math was easy.",0
"Prof. Smith is incredibly knowledgeable. While his lectures were informative, at times he went a little too quickly to keep up which made note-taking difficult. Tests and quizzes hold the most weight, but he lets you have a note-card for tests which are a MUST. Make a good note card and you should do well on each test. Overall, a great professor.",1
"This class is easy as long as you stay caught up on all readings. He gives quizzes on random days and he assigns a reading every single time you meet in class. EXPECT TO READ (it's a literature class, duh). You must participate or else he will call you out and he will possibly mark you absent if you do not pay attention when he is talking.",1
"Keeling is a great professor. There is a lot of reading, but it is a literature course, so that is to be expected. You can't really get away with not doing the readings because there is a class discussion of each text as a whole. All in all, the content was interesting and I learned a lot from this course.",1
"Dr. Stone tells you what you will be tested on but in order to succeed in his class you have to do a lot of practice problems. His exams are not straight forward because he likes to challenge his students to make sure they know the material. If you do take him, then do as many practice problems as you can. Quizlet will not help you in genetics.",1
"Professor Stewart in one word: awesome. His dry humor kept me awake throughout this intro level course that I'm sure would otherwise be rather dull. He makes the content engaging and interesting, and is always up for a quick chat during office hours in case you missed anything during lecture. If you get the chance, definitely take Stewart.",1
"Dr. Thompson is good, shes frustrating sometimes but overall her lectures and homework are clear and passing her tests isnt too bad. I recommend studying by watching the amoeba sisters on YouTube not with flash cards. She tries her best to relate it to an elementary class. The worst part is the lab, it has nothing to do with teaching!",1
"Great Professor, the text book is a must, fun and interesting class",1
"Very intrerested is seeing your progress throughout the class and wants to help you in a any way possible. Wasnt much to teach, just told us what to draw and thats what you did the whole time but very nice teacher! always happy!",1
"Dawn was a very hard teacher, she expects you to know all the material already. In class there is 5 mins of instruction and its basically her telling stories about her job that don't connect to what you are learning. Class time is 2 hours of study so be prepared for that. She doesn't teach the material, you will have to learn it on your own.",0
"I took Tanoukhi's Epiphany class. Tanoukhi's classes are always a lot of fun because they are discussion driven. Tanoukhi isn't afraid to call you out on weak interpretations, but that'll only help you grow as an English major. Her class improved my writing like on other class I've taken. If you're lucky enough, take one of her classes.",1
"He is a very hard professor.  He does have favorites, but he does not punish those who are not his faves.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but he does it to make you think through what you learned. IF you are up for a challenge and really want to learn something- he is the prof for you!",0
"Takes too long to answer your questions!!  Assignments are too long.  Overall I would take this class again online however I think she needs to remember that she does have students Via Online and she needs to respond to our questions and concerns in a timely manner.  The class info was good,nonetheless.",1
"I loved this class. Liz was a great instructor and as long as you read and ask questions you'll be fine. With papers, the key is having the right GSI or you end up with a problem. Liz has rubric that explains paper expectations and my GSI definitely adhered to it. Be prepared to read ALOT -most of the readings were really good but a few were dense",1
"Awesome teacher, not a tough grader and gives a lot of useful feedback and advice!",1
She is an awesome teacher who gives great lectures and keeps you engaged the entire time during class. I took her over J Term and despite three hour class sessions she kept us entertained and learning. Great professor!,1
"By far the greatest teacher I've ever had.  Super smart, super dedicated and teaches you past history with modern Flair.  Expect to work pretty hard and dedicate your time to it.  Totally worth it though",1
"Great class, great prof. Would definitely take Prof McGlynn's again for another class. All of the assignments were well organized and descriptive, and some were even fun to do. One tip is to definitely get the book, it is a bit expensive, but all of the quizzes and exam are based on info in it.",1
"Very fun teacher! Show up and try hard at each project and your sure to get a good grade. Study hard for quizzes, they were a bit challenging even for someone with photography experience.",1
Kim is an awsome person always willing to stay after to help and clear up things with you if you dont understand the lesson. Some might get a bad impression because of her accent but hey its a math class number arent diffrent. She always gives awsome reviews for test that help out alot.. Overall awsome teacher just do work and ask questions!!,1
"I had him for American People II, he is a little boring but he knows his stuff and I did learn a lot. It's not a hard class and should be an easy A if you do the work.",1
Dr. Ryan Hunt was amazing as always.  This semester more so - my dad had a stroke mid-semester and ultimately passed away.  Dr. Hunt was so kind in allowing me time to get work completed.  The night I came for an exam he told me I didn't have to take the exam that night I could have another week or more whatever I needed to study.  I took the exam ,1
"Most caring professor I have had in a while. Genuinely wants his students to do well, and although his quizzes are hard, he will help you get the best grade possible (if you go to him with questions). Love him!",1
AMAZING TEACHER!!!! As a transfer student Ive had a lot of exposure to many teaching styles and Prof Schore is by far the most incredible teacher Ive had thus far. Yes it is ochem so youre going to have to try! But he teaches so well and Thoroughly that the material will be enjoyable to you (he helped write the book AKA READ THE B O O K),1
"I was very apprehensive to take Experimental Psych, but I ended up doing well.  Dr McLaughlin is a fair grader, and good teacher.  I am very glad I took him for this course!",1
"Took her class at Penn State Abington where she teaches as an adjunct prof. Modules are well-organized, she responses to emails in 2 days, and your final grade heavily depends on the group project. Make sure you get into a good group!",1
"The lectures are dry, but, do your best to push through them and take excellent notes... You need to go to lecture to do well on the exams. There are two exams and one final, and one two-page essay.   You will be required to read many texts, although, I got an A without reading any of them. Don't waste your money, find them for free.",1
Terrible! He is truly all over the place with his ideas and thoughts. His exams do not relate to the lecture or the readings. And why does he make us watch a movie about CORN?!(great nap time though),0
She is caring individual who inspired me to continue with the field of education,1
This is my 3rd year of post secondary and he's by far my favourite prof! He really cares for his students and always willing to help. Everytime i visited his office it was like i was going to a friend for help. Hes a funny and nice guy to have a chat with. And he always you to redo 1 question after each exam! Got an A in the course,1
"Mr. Prey is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His lectures are interactive, thoughtful, and detailed. Mr. Prey uses cool analogies to explain more difficult concepts and cares A LOT about student success. I was a senior, didn't need to take another class, but I took Anatomy only because Mr. Prey taught it. Totally recommend taking his class",1
"His exams are based off his lectures and book, so make sure you attend class and read what you're supposed to and you'll do fine. He comes off kind of rude, but he's a great professor if you show him respect. If you're not willing to work for your grade, or show respect, don't take him. Learned a lot of real-life applicable stuff in his class!",1
"Dr. Weil is a great professor and assignments are very easy. With the exception of mid term and finals, its only a discussion post each week and module 3 and 6 there is a case study. Great professor and very caring!!! Responds to any questions within 24 hours and very helpful! TAKE HIM!!! EASY A!! ",1
"I love her! So interesting and really invested in the subjects that she teaches. She gives really specific review sheets before tests, so the class is easy to do well in.",1
"He is very good at explaining, but sometimes explains too much which can get confusing.  Expect a quiz weekly.  The questions are usually based off an example he did in class.  Homework isn't mandatory; he goes over the problems in class. Exams have similar questions to the quizzes. Highly recommended!",1
"Awesome teacher and a very interesting class. Fairly easy work load, only two years and two papers. Most class time spent talking about current issues in society. Very good class, would recommend that everyone take this class before graduating.",1
"Dr. Nelson was an awesome teacher! I am a journalism major with no interest in science and I really enjoyed the class. Make the effort to get to know him and you will have a good time in this class. There is not an attendance requirement, the tests aren't awful, and the textbook is really not needed.",1
She is great. Make sure you buy the textbook and not just the online access code. She wants everyone to leave that class knowing at least a little Spanish. She is extremely helpful and will work to get you a decent grade. Do the online lab! It will save your grade.,1
Ala was the best professor I've ever had. She was extremely kind and helpful and really just wants everyone to learn and not be stressed . Her lectures are really good. She uses PowerPoints so you can access the whole lecture during the week too if you miss class or want to go over what she talked about. I'm planning on taking her for Physics next!,1
"Knows the subject and explains it very well. Grading ambiguous in the beginning of the semester I took this class. It felt as though you had to write EXACTLY what he was looking for--not an easy task due to the expansiveness of the tax code, but he lightened up as the semester went on. Very sarcastic, but you quickly learn it isn't personal.",1
"Dr. Keeling is an expert in her field, but treats students as though they are also experts. Class itself has a lot of work - reading children's books, discussion boards and outlines due every week. Essays are tough just because she is a pretty tough grader and final was tough. Definitely can succeed in this class, but you have to work.",1
Staring at the wall is more eventful than his lectures. He is not very good at presenting information. All his exams are fill in the blank with word banks and attendance sheet is there to be signed every day.,0
This professor likes to repeat the same thing over and over. She is great but there are many things she could improve on. If you do all the work and put some effort into your presentations you should be able to get an easy A. She treats most of us as high school students so dont miss class and dont be late.,1
"Stagg was a really straightforward guy. I think he was intimidating, but he gave really good lectures. I chose tough grader because he is very specific about how you complete your essays. Other than that, I learned a lot and I learned helpful/important strategies I still use to this day at SFA.",1
"Simply the best prof you can ask for when taking a difficult course like AP. Excellent at explaining concepts, organized & funny! Has open lab 1X a week to help w/anything. Lots of quizzes & exams but it will work in your favor. Tough course for me but did well thanks to this prof. Shes also a real gem of a person. Wish she taught AP 2.",1
"Many of my friends I have talked to about UI100 say how their classes are blow off classes and they do little to no work. In this class, I felt as if it was all busy work. I was never doing anything beneficial towards my education, I was simply wasting paper by filling out ""workbook pages"" for homework every night.",0
"She is very manipulative and plays the good intention card very well, but when it comes down to it, she is mainly concerned with getting people in honors college to meet her quota.  She puts her own personal goals before those of her students.  She also has the tendency to go to students professors with issues instead of the students themselves.",0
"He is kind of hard to follow sometimes, unless you really know a lot about the subject before you take it.  His quizes are difficult.  His study guides for his exams are just things you need to know, but he doesn't flat out tell you what is on the test.  Frustrating.",1
"Dr. Keeling is such a sweetheart. She's genuinely passionate about her subject, and isn't afraid to let her geek flag fly. You absolutely have to do the reading, and she is a fair but firm grader. Still, she has a huge heart, and you shouldn't be afraid to talk to her outside of class. I only wish she taught more classes!",1
"no one should ever have to take this class, but since we have to Keys is the best to have, he cares about his class and somehow makes it somewhat interesting",1
"Dr. Sharp is a bit ditzy, but friendly. I actually learn a ton (like, expand my mind!) from her class, but I'm not sure how! The books she is currently using for Theories sucks, but she is changing it next year. She chose it because it was a nontraditional author perspective- rad points. Her assignments are a little fuzzy , but simple.",1
Professor Woods is a great teacher!,1
etremely helpful and willing to go extra for the students.. fair grader! take his classes,1
"BEST. PROFESSOR. EVER. Taking one of Constan's lectures was the best decision I've made in my collegiate career. He is brilliant, hilarious, and wholeheartedly cares for his students and material. I loved every class because he made the material something you genuinely enjoy. Highly recommend.",1
She has an extremely great method of teaching mathematics.,1
"Horrible professor for PSY200. Not helpful, confusing, and boring. She isn't willing to give extra credit and her tests are impossible even if you can do the problems in class or homework. (She likes trick questions). Do yourself a favor and take someone else before you put yourself through this torture. I would of dropped the class if I could.",0
"He's a tough grader, his tests consist of 3 essays and 5 glossary terms but essays have to be in depth about the content. He teaches pretty well as long as you study a bit, you could pass this class. I liked him, personality wise, his humour mostly consisted of being sarcastic, but i could see how other students wouldn't like him. Overall decent.",1
pretty easy class,1
"This class got to annoy me by the end of the semester. Its easy and the lectures are interesting. But, I really didn't like this professor. He curses way too much to the point where its just kind of annoying. However, you don't have to go to class. Tests are MC, half lecture and half textbook.",1
I think Will has specific expectations of how he wants you to do stuff when he marks but he doesn't tell you or give good guidance when you go to his office hours. I guess it's hard b/c every group is doing a different project but honestly this course was kind of a mess because half the time no one knew what was happening. He's pretty nice though?,1
She makes things unnecessarily complicated. Be prepare for more peer discussion and online resources to understand what's going on.,0
"Bob is one of the best professors I have had so far. Not only does he do his best to help students, he does his best to focus on craft elements instead of personal taste when grading. His workshops are not based upon perfection, but rather attempting to master craft and the creation of story. He always tried to make the class more informative.",1
"I had Maril for modern social problems and enjoyed the class. Class is lecture based but as long as you take notes on what he says you will be fine. Tests are pretty common sense. You also watch a couple movies in there as well.I would not miss class if possible because the notes from each day are important. Heavy reading,pretty interesting class.",1
"Dr. K is a cool outside of class, but not a great professor. Tests are difficult (multiple choice A-O, extended response worth 30 pts, etc). There was a multiple choice question that 100% of the class got wrong, but wasn't thrown out because we ""should have known it"". When asked for tips for the test, he said ""go to bed early"". Lab is also a mess.",0
"She's a tiny bit passive aggressive and definitely notices when you're gone. Great professor though, points you in the direction of everything you need, but don't miss more than 2-3 classes if you can help it. Wealth of knowledge though, and very intelligent, a pleasure to be taught by.",1
Ms. Ryburn was an amazing teacher. She was flexible with the students to help them achieve the best grade possible. Her explanations gave us great resources for homework. She has a great personality and always tried to make the class as interesting as possible!,1
"Finance is a hard subject. 10 homeworks online, three tests and a final. Also small current event project.",1
"Tyson is a great instructor. He is very kind and is always there to help when you have questions. He made Democracy class painless (I was dreading the thought of taking a government class), because he includes during his lectures (which I admit can be long and sometimes a little boring) examples. I found it easy to take notes in his class.",1
Great professor! She really takes the time in class to explain and make sure her students understand the material. There is homework from the textbook which is for practice and taken for a completion grade. Homework usually does not take more than 30 minutes.,1
"I'm taking professor Ebron's  English 5 online course in the summer and she is great! She's responsive on questions/concerns, she's willing to work with you, the material is interesting & easy to understand. I wish I would've taken her last spring, instead of struggling in my previous class and receiving a D :( I definitely recommend her!",1
"Harsh grading and takes a while to grade. Wont know youre in a bad situation until she puts the grade in, and its too late to try and fix it. Wouldnt recommend",0
She was one of my favorite teachers! I took her for general psych and lifespan and loved her for both. Very clear and easy to understand and the tests were a breeze. Her lectures made the class very enjoyable. She was definitely one of my most memorable professors.,1
"Madame Petcoff is a cute, little French professor, that makes class fun. She's a bit scattered at times, but it's endearing. Lots of in-class presentations, she marks for participation. Google search for additional clarification. Her tests aren't bad, review and be sure to know your verbs/tenses/numbers. I loved her class!!!!",1
"Plan on teaching yourself if you take him! Poor teaching style, you will only learn from yourself, not the teacher. He sux big time! Theres only 4 more weeks of school left and i cant wait till its over so i can be done with his class.  Take professor HEGNER!!! shes awesom!!!!!",0
"Christy is extremely smart, but that makes it hard to learn from her. She tends to put assignments on moodle and never tell you about them until they are due. ",0
"Prof. Montero is intimidating at times. Her class is similar to Gov AP in high school with the amount of reading she assigns. There's also a lot of vocab, in which you have to know the political significance of each term, not just simply define or describe each term. You have to present a news article to the class by Week 9.",1
"Before this class I was always an A&B student. This class I received a C!!! If the average grade for the exams are 60-70, then its definitely not the student it is the teacher! He is a passionate professor and I get where he is coming from, but a little understanding goes a long way.",0
She had a participation grade where we were required to participate in lecture at least once a week to get the full credit. The final was very difficult and different from other exams,1
"EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR,CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS. I TOOK HIS HYBRID CLASS.STUDY GUIDES ARE SAME AS TEST 100-150 QUESTIONS EA TEST. 5LEC EXAMS+FINAL, 2LAB TEST+FINAL. CAN RETAKE LEC EXAM EXCEPT FINALS. TAKE HIM, HIS CLASS FILLS UP FAST.",1
"This class is very interesting and I loved it.  I would deinately recommend this professor, she's great.",1
"First time prof at csusb. Hw is base off the lectures, the book isnt necessary. Her lectures are long but you receive alot of info on it inorder to do hw. She has quizzes everyday and starts and ends on the dot. You will have to purchase tophat. Tests are easy, she takes some q's off of the quizzes. Work hard you will do well. I barely studied.",1
"I had him twice (the second time I took the class solely because of him). He was a great professor who taught very well, but graded fairly tough. You will learn a lot and enjoy the class due to his positive attitude and goofiness. DEFINITE recommendation! If I had the opportunity to take him again, I would!",1
"There is not much homework, but there are a few short papers. You do need to put effort into papers in order to get high marks. I found his lectures to be fairly boring, but informative. He does send out a ""what to know"" list before the exam, which is very helpful. This class is not an easy A per say, but it would take work to fail.",1
Easy A- just show up and do your assignments. Lectures were boring but she has a great personality so it was okay. Met at the gym every other week but she doesn't pay attention to see if you actually worked out or not. Never kept class the full time and the only test was the final. Overall easy class and made me like fitness a little more,1
"Unfair and rude. If he likes you, you will do well on his class, there were only 2 exams during the semester. Make sure you talk to him and praise him, he likes to feel important and he loves it if you tell him that you love his books.  2 students can have the same exact answers on the exam, but grades will be based on whether he likes you or not",0
"If your were good at calc 1,2 then you should be good for his calc 3 class. I barely even tried and i got a B. His lectures were boring and his exams were long. Webassign will teach you more than him.",1
"In this class all, we have to do too many papers. The outlines are not well explained enough and I hate the fact that he believes his course is adequate. As a whole, it is amazing to have an Indigenous member as a prof, but I think the course needs to be updated just a bit!",0
"Clausen is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. She breaks down the material like no other professor can. If you listen in her class, and study, you will do fine. I took no notes in her class but actively listened and studied for her final and got an A in Contracts and B+. I decided to be a transactional attorney because of her.",1
Bon professeur,1
"This professor gave me an extremely hard time. I have a great GPA and am very serious when it comes to my school work; however, this professor discouraged me with his sly comments, anger issues, and condescending attitude. He literally told us ""you don't know anything until I teach you"". He gave me a D after all the work I've done in his class. ",0
He is a real gem! Amazing prof!!! Not many assignments and a really easy grader. Attendance is not mandatory! Just review his study guide before the exam and you will pass. He is really funny during his lecture and really fun attending class. LOVE IT. He really cares about his students !!,1
"Funny as all get out and even gives personal testimony to help you remember things. However, Extremely tough and strict.",0
"I think she was a great teacher. Sure she does kind of nit-pick on tests and quizzes but nothing too bad. You're expected to print out notes and review them in class. I personally really liked this method of lecturing rather than writing in on a blank note book. Business calc is a HARD class, be prepared to study a lot.",1
"Dr Mavica is a wonderful teacher! Yes she involves her personal life in her lectures, but it is only to relate the material to our everyday lives. Her only POSSIBLE fault is that she is too nice to undeserving/whiney students. She is helpful in class and outside of class with whatever you need! She truly cares and I plan on taking her course again!",1
"Friendly, open-minded professor - engages with students and works with diverse feedback. Has high expectations, but makes them clear so you know what is expected. Best way to pass is to engage with her and ask lots of questions. Also drinks a lot of diet Coke.",1
Professor Lewis is approachable and encouraging when he deals with students. Knows the material and delivers  it in a very simple way. Gives everyone a chance to ask questions and answers them clearly. Exams are straightforward with no trick questions. Exams are based on material thought. He takes the time to review subject matter before exams .,1
"6 reflection papers (1 dropped), 2 in-class essay exams, and 1 research paper. An A is pretty difficult to achieve since the class is graded by such few things and Jason doesn't curve, but it's possible. Lots of reading, more than most classes, but manageable. TAs are helpful and participation matters in discussion sections. Class taught me a lot.",1
"Please do not be fooled. He is average at best. I took him and his lectures are the blandest thing you will ever attend. Puts you to sleep every time. The only reason I kept going into class was for attendance points. # exams all consisted of learning 45-55 definitions, so if you can memorize it should be an easy A. He is not a good professor.",0
"Very fun teacher, hard to understand sometimes. Show up to class, do the projects and you will automatically get 100%. Book is used for very simple online quizzes. Gives you lecture notes, but goes over the exam before you take it. Very smart, fun, professor I highly recommend taking",1
great prof -- approachable and smart. Very willing to work to accomodate students but doesn't tolerate whininess.,1
I realy enjoy the cours.Very intelligent person.I find him attractiv.,1
"I could not stand this class. I found it to be annoying since I signed up for an in-person class and got a hybrid class. The lectures were boring, people would sign in and leave. It was frustrating because her class was all based on MindTap. I would not recommend anyone to take her just because her class is a waste of time and money.",0
"BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!  If ur interactive in class the class will be very interesting. It's what you make out of it because there are a lot of small group discussions. Didn't know a single thing about writingstructure before taking this class, and now I write like I know how to write. It isveryhelpful class for all essays you write in the future. ",1
"He's excellent at teaching. He's also passionate, funny, and caring. I learned a lot from him which I'm very thankful for. Class is usually discussion based, so you MUST show up AND participate. Otherwise, he'll take points off. Exams and quizzes are mainly from the readings which are easy. Always ask for help because he loves it. No extra credit.",1
"Awesome guy, quite the character, clearly loves teaching and extremely passionate. If hes teaching you anything about anthropology your in for a treat.",1
Mr. Hughes is literally the best teacher Ive had at this university. Just a gem of a person. Biiiigggg fan of his.,1
"This teacher is easy to take. Do the work and the quizzes and you will pass. Yes, the book is needed but it's not too hard. The Exams are however because they are 100 questions in 1 hour. It's crap but I made a 71 the first time and a 50 on the last one. It sucks.",1
I took Professor Khans 100A class @SSU and let me tell you... I have had a good experience other than all the homework and reading that I had to do.,1
"Shah is a great professor. He gives great feedback throughout the semester as you work on the group project and has a really big personality. Definitely made lecture enjoyable, which isn't an easy thing to do. Definitely my favorite professor in the J School so far.",1
"He was a great teacher! Super lecture heavy but never had them on blackboard. The book would've helped so much more if I had actually read it. He tried to make lectures funny but his lectures are very boring the majority of the time. He's not very available outside of class, although he does ask for questions before every class.",1
"Every poor review you read about Dr. Kovach is true and I cannot stress enough that no one is exaggerating. His labs were unclear as he didn't give thorough explanations. Remote learning in his class consisted of weekly ""quizzes"", which always had 38+ questions and we really only had the book to study from because his Powerpoints were so vague.",0
"I LOVED Susan! She made everything right to the point and clear for every student. She went over every problem on homework students could not understand which helped tons, and she had helpful study guides. It was a tough class but she made it enjoyable and you can do it! Her grading process was VERY fair if you actually studied. ",1
"Nedd is hilarious. He's so easy, he doesn't know dates so he does not ask for them. If you are not an art history person take him. He can be frustrating at times, but you will catch on to what he wants from you after a few weeks. Any of his classes are an easy A. Oh and he is a HUGE soccer fan so just talk about soccer and he will love you.",1
"The best Psychology instructor, students can understand him very well... Gives great notes to refer to...Helps students understand book terminology. Also,very humorous!",1
"The material sometimes isn't very interesting but I looked forward to every class because Mrs. Mattox has wonderful stories to illustrate almost everything that she teaches and I highly recommend her for Psychology of Exceptional Children & Youth. Her tests are 40 questions, multiple choice, and not overly difficult if you've reviewed the material.",1
I had him for intro to philosophy and it was probably the most mentally stimulating class I've taken.  He is great at promoting thought on the readings while guiding class discussion and interpretation.  He's a really smart guy and class was very interesting.,1
Professor Konya is a good teacher. To do well in his class you better memorize the definitions and proofs in the textbook and lecture. It's important that you adopt to his level of detail when it comes to solving problems. Even if you got the right answer on the hw and you have looked at the answer book it's better to meet up during office hours.,1
I took his online music class and it was an easy A. The content is super easy but the listening quizzes are pretty hard. The strike at the university messed up a lot of things and the grade book was funky for a while. When you email him he usually responds pretty quick but he isn't clear by what he means.,1
"If you want an easy A in this course then Dr. Cote is not for you. She is more difficult than other professors but I believe its because she really wants to prepare us. Personally, I can't focus on powerpoints so I would go in to see her once a week about the material and she was able to explain it better. Do all practice questions.",1
She is an amazing teacher that will help you. She is the best at memory tricks and explaining things well. There are weekly quizzes but when it comes time for the final it's worth it! If she had any other classes I would take them in a heartbeat. ,1
really good,1
"Yonn is not only a lovely guy, but also a scholar and an intellectual. The subject matter is always interesting, and his entertaining lectures and fun personality make it all the better. You'll likely have a couple research-oriented papers and a couple quizzes/exams, and that's it. So be sure to do the work and study for tests, and you'll do well.",1
He is good prof.I had the impression he was giving easy assignments so that we get killed in the midterms but was surprised to see he took the assignment and changed the input numbers only.I thought the class was too easy and we would get killed at the final and was wrong. Hard to understand for the 2 first weeks but you get used to it. Recommended,1
He's a pretty rad teacher. Just do your reading assignments and you'll pass all of his tests/journals.,1
"he doesn't care he put resp. on his TAs.  TAs are not helpful. He is unorganized.  His lec. notes don't have title and are bad hand writing.  The TAs were not helpful to answer the questions and hehimself does,t care to listen.  At last some TAs curved and some didn't.  If you don't have to don't take this class. It lowers your grades and takes tim",0
His lectures offer you an insight into the world around you. He teaches real life knowledge.       ~~~very inspirational~~~,1
"By far my favorite professor at LSU thus far. She is really understanding and super cool. This was definitely a class I looked forward to and never hesitated to skipping. She makes it go by so fast. There is a midterm and finals, and quizzes, however, they are really hard. She is a great teacher and I would recommend her to all my friends.",1
She was helpful but she made the class too hard. Has been known to yell at students and make them feel stupid! Sweet outside of class! Just a hard language and a hard class. I dropped it and took sign language (recommened),0
He's so nice.,1
"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading. The study guide that is provided is no help. Whoever is a history major please avoid taking this class. This isnt high school where you can't use the bathroom either during lectures. NO",0
Professor Delius is great and I'd recommend her to anyone who is taking urbanism for core class. She totally understands its a core class and keeps it interesting! Her exams are more fun than they are hard and this class went by teaching me without much work load! Take her!,1
"He come across a little too laid back at first and as a result is hard to take seriously until you start getting bad grades. He does however care and will offer you plenty of extra credit assignments if he can see that you are trying and a good student. Take him seriously, if you don't, don't be chocked when you get a 'D' or an 'F'.",1
"This was my first year in college, and I needed to take Calculus 1, so I took her.  She is  a great professor, and there is no good excuse not to get an A in this class.  She tells you what will be on test and does a review day. Test are 3 free response and 20 multiple choice.  She will try to give partial credit and sometimes let's you retry.",1
"He doesnt teach at all. Goes over the homework and talks about how phones and technology is destroying our generation. Hes not hard to pass tho, just do the work and youll be fine. Id only take him for 304 tho, I wouldnt take him for 401 or 404 because I heard hes worse. Good luck if you take him",0
"The Atlantis Debate was one of my favorite classes at Colgate- Godwin is a great lecturer and fair grader, and the course topic itself was very interesting",1
"If you are about the class, she cares about you. You'll write two short stories and have them peer reviewed. You'll also have to give one presentation during the semester, but everything is a piece of cake. Even if you don't like writing, she makes the class creative & fun. Make friends and you'll feel comfortable. Highly recommend her as a teach!",1
"Easy A if you do the work. We had to do 3 practice interviews, a personal interview project and interviews at the radio station. It was really cool to record at coyote radio and do audio editing",1
"I am a guitarist.  I always had problems learning music theory, but Domonick Tancredi is a fantastic teacher. He explains things crystal clear and I really always appreciated his letting me always ask questions and talking to him  after class.  He has made THE difference for me in music. Hope to have him for another class at CSI!!",1
"Maria is one of the better econ professors there is. She is good at teaching, explain and relating. He grading is also relatively easy. She is always ready to help. Also rmr that she is Greek and not Mexican/latino or indian. I recommend this teacher!",1
I enjoyed her class! She really wants you to understand the material. He tests are much harder than her quizzes but overall a good class. She is also very accessible outside of class.,1
Professor leska is always there for you. Yes lectures are long but if you take good notes and study you will do good. ALWAYS do the extra credit she gives.,1
Homework every class containing about 20 questions. Each assignment takes about an hour to complete. Couldn't fully understand his demos.,0
Probably the best french professor here. She wants you to do good so if you show her you are trying you will end up with a good grade. Super easy!!,1
"I actually learned a lot in this class. Dr Barber was awesome - usually in my online classes I dont ever talk to professor but every time I emailed him he got right back to me. I would recommend this for anybody that wants to be a teacher, some stuff I knew already but a lot was new and he made it pretty fun by having to go do Twitter chats",1
Very interesting teacher loved his lectures he is very big on attendance so show up always. The textbook that accompanies the course is pretty confusing though and so are the quizzes you have to complete every week that are based just on the text and not on lecture.,1
"Allan Crocoll has been an excellent professor when I took his math 100 class this past spring. He gives you many opportunities to pass the class and handled the transition well to online learning. If you are typically not good with math, I suggest you take his class.",1
AWESOME TEACHER!!!!! She wants you to pass so everything you need to know is presented to you in the book review test and in class lecture. If your a visual learner then she's the teacher for you!! You will learn and enjoy coming to class. Don't miss a class or you'll get behind. Don't be late to class either. Best teacher I've ever had!!!!!!!,1
"Dr. Vohs is a very good professor. His lectures won't make you fall asleep, and the class is almost enjoyable. Once test day comes though, it can get rough. He will give difficult tests and will grade harshly. I did not have a good chem class before coming here and I struggled a lot because of it. He's also a great first year sem teacher. (GenChem)",1
"Mangone is a good lecturer, he can be difficult to understand at times, but hes very caring and makes the material easier to digest. His section of genetics is a lot of memorization and has lot of information thrown at you, but his exams are pretty straightforward, as long as you attend lecture and study.",1
"He really cares about his students.  He has high expectations, but he shows you how to meet them.  My writing was terrible at first, and he pointed out every error, but he also showed me how to fix them.  As time went on, things he'd been saying began to make sense and I got much better.  I would recommend him, for sure.",1
"She teaches ""Becoming American"" for an LAS class for freshmen. Very difficult. If you're not amazing at writing, you should probably choose a different LAS class. I had a 4.0 in high school and was lucky to get a C this semester in this class. Not fun.",1
"I absolutely loved this class! Professor Nelson's lectures were the easiest to pay attention to and very well organized. And he tells you exactly what he wants on tests, quizzes, and papers which is so helpful. Also, he has a great sense of humor which always helps makes things more interesting. Take this class!!!",1
"She is awesome! You will have to work hard and do all homework to pass. The exams are difficult and long, but the knowledge you get is invaluable!!",1
"I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and guess that her summertime switch to Canvas screwed things up, but it doesn't account for all of the negligence. As an online teacher, it is paramount to be responsive to emails. She has been thoroughly unresponsive and inaccessible. +tomorrow is the final day, and she's graded one assignment.",0
"This guy knows more about writing good stories than anyone I ever talked to.  His classes are fun and you learn as much as you want to learn about writing.  He turned me from an ""ok"" writer to a ""good"" writer and he inspired me to keep learning.  One of the best at FSU!!!",1
"Does not have the student in mind, not sensitive to lab conditions, short times to complete assignments (3 days sometimes), harsh grading practices, recycles the same two examples, overall poor attitude for a learning setting. Pose a problem- he basically shrugs his shoulders and says you’ll have to figure it out. Worst class experience to date.",0
Prof. Drumond is an amazing teacher. He makes everything so easy. This is my first taking spanish and I did very good surprisingly. If you ever have a problem just talk to him he'll always find a way to help you out. He's the type of teacher that'll cut you some slack with no problem.,1
awesome loves teaching. I wish she taught the whole nursing program!,1
Soh is my favorite professor. She is intense. You need to work really hard to meet her standards. I am still getting an A. I am proud of myself.,1
"not the greatest prof, if you work hard you will get a good grade.  You have to pay attention in class no skipping or sleeping.  A lot of work but if you have the time, then hes alrite",0
"Dr. Vohs is an entertaining teacher and a grade head of the chemistry department. He is by far the most organized teacher I have come across in college, which carries over into his teaching style.",1
One of the sweetest & best math teachers I have ever had! SO caring & helpful when it comes to a students life as well as math in general. Very good at explaining & will answer any question in detail to make sure you fully understand. By being in her class you will realize how much she loves her job & wants to see students succeed. 100% recommend.,1
"Love Furno! He was great, and was able to mix something others may have found boring with humor. He is always there for his students and I highly recommend anyone to take his class. He is informative, and as long as you pay attention (which isn't hard to do in his class)  and study for the tests you'll be fine. There is never a dull day with Furno!",1
Took her Maymester class. I truly enjoyed her class. Very engaging. Will take for my other Comp class.,1
"This man is a real gem, one of the few professors I've had who truly cares about his students and their education. His lectures are great, but he really shines when you visit him outside of class, which there really isn't an excuse NOT to do since he has walk-in office hours pretty much all day during the week and even occasionally on the weekends!",1
I took his abnormal psychology class and loved it! He is very talkative and really teaches with zest. We sat in the front row so we could hear better and ask questions.,1
"Gerard is an excellent professor. He is not a prof that just wants to hear info regurgitated - he wants critical thinking! The creative projects may seem silly at first, but the idea is to look at yourself from a new perspective, and to apply creative and critical thinking to yourself and the material. This is essential in CYC!",1
"Definitely recommend. People are getting A's and B's. So idk why people are giving low reviews. This class is for people who just need the credit. The people giving low reviews are the students who always raise their hands in class just because they want to talk. HW due every 2 wks, not that much. Itudy guide exactly like test, just different #'s.",1
"Professor Schnell went above and beyond for all of us. Anyone can see that she really does care whether her students succeed or not. Her feedback was very helpful and enabled me to become a better writer and a more critical thinker. I really enjoyed her class, her kindness, and her enthusiasm for teaching this subject.",1
Very nice professor. If you are looking for a class to play in this is not it. Professor Schaller pushes you to do your work. Once you leave her class you can say I got my moneys worth. She's always available to help with whatever issue you're having.,1
Easy class. Gives a lot of time to complete tests and readings. Took this class during the pandemic Fall 2020. Definitely recommend.,1
She's ok. I wish I didn't take this class.,0
Dr. McCartney is hands down one of the most dedicated and caring professors at Towson. I took both her POSC 474 Civic Engagement Class and POSC 307 ICONS with her and have never been so encouraged to succeed. The workload is heavy but her classes really help you improve your writing and communication skills.,1
"he helps and wants you to pass. he isn't the most clear bc it's hard for him to get on our level. lol. Wasn't really the teacher, but the subject, Calculus. Really chill with test taking and will do retakes if the class does not do good. need to class bc the material is hard. lots of HW, but w/out it I wouldn't understand much.",1
"I had him online for summer 2020. He is awful. His recorded lectures are him just reading off of his slides. I stopped watching because it was better to read the textbook and make my own notes myself. When asking him questions, he is unclear and I feel like he doesn't really listen to the full question. Quizzes are brutal; exams are fair. Beware!",0
"The class is quite easy. Mrs. Johnson is a wonderful teacher, and she really cares about her students!",1
Prof Kelm is an excellent choice for anyone who needs to complete their language requirement and hasn't taken Spanish in years! His tests are a little tricky but if you listen to his lectures the class is not that hard. Sometimes he gives group tests! Lots of homework but its all online. He gives test corrections to make up your grade!,1
"He's a great Music teacher, very helpful..turns the excersizes into games. Helps you understand scales, and notes...great bass player...Highly recommended!",1
"Dr. Crumpler is an amazing professor. His expectations are clear and gives plenty of practice problems and what he expects from you for his exams. Participation definitely matters, he gives love points at the end of the semester :) (So participate). Don't be intimated by Dr. Crumpler he is really caring and genuinely wants to see you succeed.",1
"She's so helpful. 2 reports, 2 exams, group debate, and a final. Discuss all the readings in class. A bit hard on grading, but gives good feedback. Exams are open ended and she really listens to the student's ideas and helps them elaborate them further. Amazing professor, I would recommend taking her for PHIL 284. ",1
BEST TEACHER EVER,1
"There's going to be a lot of reading material as well as discussions, writing assignments, and 1 Book Analysis.  The material is fun and interesting! If you willing to work for it she will even dropen a few low grades.   Example: only have to do 7 out of 9 Discussions, or do 4 out of 5 Writing Assignments.  Take her she's awesome!",1
Dr. Hunt is a Fabulous teacher!!!! I took his class online and loved it! I never found it to be too difficult.  He truly entertains as he teaches! Loved his class and learned soooo much. -  Business Law,1
"one of the worst profs i ever met he is soo boring staying awake in his lecture is impossible ,the starting material is not bad then it gets hard his midterm was really easy but the FINAL WAS SOOOO HARD  i have no idea where he got it from .AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"If you do the work, you'll pass. Watch the videos, do every single homework assignment, and study for the final. You will pass! Plus, he is a great guy who loves Math and cares about his students.",1
"Online class.  The class is listed under Dr. McHann, the entire class is lectured, graded and instructed by Prof Frost (tough grader).  Gave all 3's because McHann was nonexistent.  Living Case Study of 30 pages, along with a cumulative final exam.  Weekly quiz's and weekly research plus group DQ's.  Spend at least 20+ hours a week.  Good Luck!!!!!",1
Camp is one of the harder graders I have had but you can not expect much else from a literature professor. He is willing to explain anything you need and if he knows you are taking the class seriously he will not grade as harsh as usual. The discussions in class help you to gain an open mind and improve your public speaking. Cool guy!,1
"offers a max of 5min office hours. timed quizzes, hw doesnt match the youtube videos he post on weekly canvas, so your own your own relying on classmates for help for all hw cuz he is extremely unreliable and terrible. awful, dont recommend at all unless u dont mind learning on ur own and spending hours asking classmates for help",0
Prof. Ulrich is the best professor I have ever had. She shows such a sincere interest in student progress and it is clear she is extremely knowledgeable. She is a great person who makes students want to be better and strive for excellence. If you are willing to put in the work you will be rewarded with an amazing knowledge of human physiology 10/10,1
"This was an easy A class. Lectures were boring, but if you go to class and actually try to pay attention (and study a bit) you shouldn't have a problem getting a good grade. Homework was due once every two weeks and very easy. He can be funny at times, but don't expect a really interesting subject where you actually learn something.",1
"If you know statistics and can skip class till the tests your fine. Otherwise she will make you want to fall asleep. Most boring class ever. She gives weekly tests that she says is not for credit but shes a lie. She wants students to fail. She says one thing and then does other things. You can do better than this class, or teacher.",0
"such a good prof. 3 papers no test, no quizzes. participate and write decent papers you will do just fine. easy 4.0. DO TAKE",1
"Overall, he is great! He explains the reading well in his lectures, so it is simply recommended, not necessary, to read before class. Make sure to make an outline for the tests, and you'll be good. He is very willing to help outside of class, and is beneficial in preparing for tests and the paper. The grade is spread out among different aspects.",1
"Had Jenneke for Amsterdam Culture class. Great teacher, great person. She encouraged discussions and and led short lectures on the topic, but we also did presentations and readings (which were sometimes dry). Had us all over to her place for a BBQ at end of semester. Highly recommended!",1
I WISH HE TAUGHT MORE CLASSES BECAUSE HE IS THE GREATEST TEACHER EVER,1
Great professor if you fail its because of you,1
"I had Mr. F-M for ENC 1101 and 1102, and I enjoyed having him as a teacher for both classes! He is very clear on the requirements of the assignment and gives good feedback on the rough drafts. He is very comical and is understanding when it comes to stress level, especially during finals and midterms. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Good prof who seems to actually care about students doing well. She takes time in lectures before tests to go over questions from the class and prepares you well for the exam (she actually gave us most of what we needed to answer the essay q on the final). I slacked off entirely with reading and still got a B+, almost an A.",1
"Great teacher, very nice man to talk to and is very organized",1
"Please save yourself the trouble of taking this teacher. He is very disorganized, lost my essay the last day of class, made me buy an online tutor program which we didn't use, and grades very harshly. He teaches only through powerpoint and is not very good at it. I learned nothing in this class.",0
"best proffessor ever! really passionate. She looks really young so i didnt know what to expect but am pleasantly surprised. Really interesting & engaging class-She asks for ur opinion alot so be ready to give it. Sometimes i get lost, but shes will help u if u ask. Thank god no txtbook. Only downside is she grades hard, i learned that the hard way.",1
"She is a wonderful teacher. Her tests are long, but not hard. If you pay attention in class and read, you'll be fine. A few have said she is 'hateful' but I've never seen or heard of her being rude to any student. She states her opinions but doesn't treat them like facts. A good person and great teacher.",1
"I've never written a review, but I wanted to because she helped me see that law is the path for me. At first I thought she wouldn't be good because of all the bad reviews on here, but its just cuz she's an older lady, with annoying opinions and habits. She really enjoys teaching, is friendly, and most of all passionate about law + women's rights.",1
"Funny guy, obviously loves his job but his class is hard because he talks so fast. He doesn't tell you what you need to know so it's just a lot of information. If your good at studying on your own and understand biology you'll do fine, ask him questions because hes better at explanations one on one.",1
"Professor Shah is a super nice guy and super helpful before/after class. Lecture slides are posted online, so attendence is not mandatory. The bulk of the grade is a big group project which takes a lot of outside class time/effort. The best presentations on the group project do not have to take the final exam. Easy A if you get a good group!",1
"Lamkin is not a good professor as others students rated.   I took her BIO47 and I learned everything by myself.  She didn't lecture much and her tests are nothing related to what she lectured, hard to get what she means.   Bad teacher in bio, anatomy. ",0
"This was a 1 credit course that was super interesting. Nic knows the city of Rome like the back of his hand - extremely knowledgeable and well respected. Take a class with him, and go talk to him in office hours. He's a pretty cool dude!",1
"Professor Drumond is an understanding and compassionate yet professional instructor. He's very thorough and organized in his lectures, and provides all the necessary resources to succeed in his class. I highly recommend this class. Five Stars to Professor Drumond!",1
"A very informative and enriching class. A class that all sociology majors should take, as well as anyone who takes it as an AGNG class.",1
"2 Exams worth 60 percent, 14 quizzes worth 40 percent of your grade. He gives you no reviews also no powerpoints. Stay far away from this class.",0
"Awesome Guy! He listens and teaches well!! not good for students of little patience/effort, but awesome class!!",1
Nobody I knew got above 60% on their tests and we all went to every class and studied before each exam.,0
Kindest professor I have ever taken. His lectures are thought-provoking and he will always engage with students. One of the best teachers at OCC.,1
"I've taken a few courses with Mr. Decker, and have come to know what he expects out of students. While this class (like his others) are paper-heavy, there are no exams, and when submitting a paper he allows you to resubmit it with his edits for a higher score if you are not satisfied with your initial grade. Attendance is options, but recommended.",1
"He is  very smart and speaks in his own type of way. He really wants what he teaches to stick with you, and I don't know yet but I think it will. You really have to study hard to do well on his tests, but I think it is worth it. ",1
"Great professor with a great personality. He emphasizes learning over anything else. Attendance is not mandatory but there are ""pop quizes"" and in class assignments that can affect your grade.",1
"Kelm is a great guy, talks extremely fast and loves to speak to students in spanish. All homework is online so be prepared to do alot of it. Tests are easy. Great at making spanish easy",1
GOOD TEACHER,1
"Def need a hard copy of the book; electronics are prohibited in class. Each class he would call on students to translate parts of the story (if you don't have the translation, then he'll let you know it's ok and go on). Quizzes are given but he'll let you know the day before. The only awful thing about this class was that it was at 7:30AM.",1
"funny guy, confusing lectures, easy tests",1
Most amazing professor I have ever had. She cares very much about you and is an amazing teacher. Even when you don't understand something she will explain it so well that you will understand it afterwards. Best organic professor ever !!!!,1
As long as you put in the effort she will take late work. But make sure she likes what you are doing or she may grade harsher,1
"RUN. Nice demeanor, however she is new to teaching. Requires odd-ball assignments no one has ever done or heard of. Does not really know what she is doing at times. WRITING INTENSIVE!! Group project/PowerPoint, textbook reading, 20+ pg *purchased* case studies, and Memos all expected all to be worked on at the same time.",0
"Mr. Kraft is probably the best teacher I've ever met. I would recommend him to everyone, even if English is your second language. He will make you work harder, but that way you will learn more.",1
"I enjoyed his class, hes very clear on explaining the material and brakes every topic piece by piece for a better understanding, he does give 3 quizzes and alot of reading is required, MUST STUDY KEY TERMS they will definitely be on test. Hes also very funny. American politics is a hard class but with his teaching i passed with a B.",1
This man loves his job.,1
"Super kind and many of my grades were curved into a 100 from a 95 or better. Online class is definitely recommended, but I havent had her in person. Shes wonderful and sweet so definitely take her class!",1
"If you are trying to knock off your pre 1800 requirement, look for a class taught by Fowler. I loved her Chaucer class. She is animated and interesting, and very interested in her students.",1
"Easy A. For a sociology teacher he seems ignorant based on how he talks about women, other cultures, and gay people. Not politically correct. He also allows people to talk, text, come in late, have more than 6 absences, he does not want you to fail. If your a weak student this class is made for you. If you are a good student this class is annoting.",1
"EXTREMELY USELESS. Doesn't get to the point at all. Skips through 10 slides at a time and speaks only about how iPads and iPods are revolutionizing the world. If you get her, SWITCH TO ALEC CRAM. He's much better!",0
Will's a solid choice for a professor. Would recommend.,1
Extremely helpful and caring. Loves his subject and it translates in his class. AWESOME!,1
"Great professor. Very knowledgeable and friendly. I had her for summer session I. We went through a lot of material, the tests were easy, and many extra credit opportunities. If I weren't graduating I would definitely have her again!",1
tough,0
"Dr. Keys is truly one of the best professors I have had! He is very helpful for any classes you take with him and for academic planning. I stopped in his office often to ask questions and talk with him. He has students to his house for game nights and truly cares about them. He classes are tough, but he pushes his students to be the best possible.",1
He is challenging but understanding. Homework only requires you to read and make an effort for full credit. The quizzes on the readings are tough but he drops low grades. I felt stressed about my quiz grades and thought I was doing poorly but when I looked at my grade I was doing fine. Its the kind of class where if you try to pass.,1
"I think people struggle with him because he is their first introduction to a real math class. Expect to get in the 60's on midterms, and there will be a big curve at the end of the quarter. In 21B, we were used to seeing an integral, and mindlessly solve it. In this class, you need to know how the math works; no rote problem solving.",1
"I did everything right: I read, I participated, I studied, I took notes on everything, I went to her to get help on my mid-term and my 1st paper. The only thing I did not do was go to her several times with my paper and midterm questions. She teaches like its an intro class, gives out exams fit for a 2000 class and grades like it is one too.",1
"Professor Baker was an OUTSTANDING professor! He gave the best lectures, & to make sure everyone is involved, he would do mini activities with who ever you're sitting next to which made this class very comfortable to be in. He also provides very good information on every topic, which made learning in his class very interesting. Online work is easy!",1
"Just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam, one year out of college. Couldn't have done it without the building blocks learned through Dave's 301 stories/lectures. The guy can teach, and he's comfortable in his own skin. If you want to LEARN the subject, take this class. However, if you plan on going to his office hours, bring a hazmat suit...",1
"Prof. Law is very understanding and accommodating. A good amount of reading and concepts. He is always willing to meet, answer questions, and give direction. Pay attention and participate and you can pass the class.",1
Easiest class I've ever taken. 3 test and weekly assignment that could be done under 20 minutes ,1
Dr. B is an amazing person and very devoted to his students. This class is so much fun. He makes sure that all the students know that he is there if they need any help. I learned a lot in such a short period of time. I recommend him if you want a helpful teacher.,1
"He sat on his computer the whole class and when you asked for help, and didnt understand the way he explained it, he just got annoyed. He told me that if I was too stupid to learn it in high school, he couldnt teach it to me now. It was a really upsetting experience.",0
"Lets you grade yourself, so you earn what you want. Just put in the work and effort. He did some really neat science lessons with us that I'll be using in the future. He's into the ""formal operational"" thinking stuff when it comes to science which was interesting for me to see. Let's students figure it out, rather than just being told.",1
Compared to the other teachers in the department she is one of the toughest. She goes strictly by the book but also adds a lot of extra grades that aren't needed. I feel like I worked so hard and still don't even have the grade I want.,0
"Really awesome professor. Work isn't hard, readings weren't mandatory, and attendance wasn't taken every class. As long as you sit in the front and go to class and engage with him you'll probably get an A. Taking his class next semester too, really nice guy. ",1
"Very simple class. Only homework is online quizzes which are fairly easy. Grading is pretty much the tests. Ace a tests, get an A.",1
"As I was in my first semester of graduate school, this was definitely a difficult class. Dr. Lorton took time to answer each question without making you feel as though you were an idiot for asking. Be sure to do your homework! Test questions are similar to notes and homework problems. Often, homework is harder than the test. Best of luck!",1
Took Cog and S&P. He is an extremely nice professor. Need to read the book and attend lectures. Definitely need to think deeply about the topic and applications. Your grade is 3 tests. BE sure to ask questions in class because he will explain until you understand.,1
Dr. Borglin was an amazing professor. Though it was her maybe 3rd time lecturing that class she did exceptionally great. She explained the material in an understanding way and her lectures actually made since. You do have to do the work because she does grade it but she was pretty fair and easy the entire semester. She is also very organized!,1
"Hannah Britton is awesome! She challenges you to think in different ways(her classes are not for the lazy). She also cares about her students, a rarity at K.U. I loved all of the classes I took with her!",1
I feel So Smart after taking this class and I learned a lot! Mr. West is so sweet and caring. He may use strong word sometimes that shock you and gets your attention to teach you about the real world and make you more worldly/street smart. I felt like I was playing Puzzle games like thinking how to solve sudoku or writing computer program equations,1
4 Exams and 1 Research Project. Project is easy and can probably be completely fabricated. He grades the project fair. The Exams are all multiple choice but optional essays at end if you're not confident in multiple choice. Hard to pay attention to in lecture but not his fault. Read the book or listen to every word he says should get decent grade,1
"This class was my favorite this semester. He tries really hard to keephis lectures from being boring and offers heaps of extra credit. The tests are really difficult, but the extra credit really helps. Attendance isn't mandatory, but the extra credit is offered through clicker quizes so go!",1
"first midterm was the exact same questions as the study guide. second midterm was nothing like the study guide. midterms were 2 questions. very generous curve. the final was really just another midterm, and really easy. much easier of a class than i anticipated.",1
"He's a great teacher. He was my lab teacher and not only did he explain all instructions in a simple way, he also shortened up the labs as much as he could. He's also a really caring person outside of the classroom. I recommend you at least meet this man before leaving HCC.",1
"He is an amazing teacher and really tries to connect with the students in the class. He helps you whenever you need, and is very understanding. His class helped me realize what I want to do with my life.",1
one of my faves! She really cares about her students and makes class as interesting/fun as she can! She is always there for you during office hours and she is a sweetheart!,1
He doesnt understand what the average person already knows. Bio 101 means you have to explain concepts like DNA and cell division. He expects you to be familiar with concepts without teaching them first.,0
he's great. i never worked with a teache like this. he really cares about what he teaches and really wants you to understand and go for it. now it's almost a pain for myself to work with someone else...!!,1
"Was very interested in topic, very helpful, very quirky with a good sense of humor.  Some times his energy was too much to handle! :)  No surprises on quizzes.  Would definetly reccomend him!",1
I love Mr. Logan. He is an outstanding professor. If you interact with him and ask questions in class he is more than willing to help any student. He is shy but he likes it a lot when students interact with him. He told us our class was the most exciting that he's ever had because most of us ask questions. I'm gonna miss him!,1
"Nelly is the sweetest professor, she is very funny and loves to tell stories and always lets class out early. Tests and quizzes are simple, for compositions she grades really easily. Participation is important, it can actually have an affect on your overall grade but she makes it easy by asking questions to class frequently. ",1
Constant lecture.  Does not ask questions.  Exams questions are very specific and its seems like hes trying to trick you.  Nice but not helpful when I stayed after class 3 times.,0
"Hadara is the best professor that I have ever had. She is inspiring, dedicated, and breathes new life into poetry-- she makes it even more fascinating. Above all, she treats her students as equals and helps them to develop their own voices as writers.",1
Extremely nice!  Class is hard to go to but if you go you will get no lower then a C+.  If you struggle with foreign languages I would take her.  Exams take about 30 min and there is a huge curve (you could get a 45% and get a C on the exam).,1
"Bret is great! He's very funny and expressive. He doesn't hold back. He's also very strict- there's no wiggle room. That said, he's usually very clear about what he wants and if you do it, you'll be fine.",1
The class is really boring. And he doesn't really teach much besides reading from the book.,0
"Good professor. As long as you do the reading and really think about the material you should do well. My friends who took the class said they thought he was boring, and I can understand that. But I had section with him and he is a really good guy and very helpful too.",1
"Koh can be boring, but his sample programs usually give the necessary information to complete the homework assignments. The homework ranges from easy to extremely difficult and time consuming. His exams are open note, so they're not too bad.",1
"Greta is a personable professor. She makes you work for your grade, but she is there alongside helping you through every paper. She always has lots of feedback on papers.",1
"Erin is a good teacher. The material itself was tough to take in only 7 weeks, but if you keep up on your reading and watch her lecture videos the class is not too bad. She is very approachable and willing to help if you ask for it.",1
He loves when is students engage in the discussions! Don't be afraid to talk.,1
Dr. King is amazing! He is one of the nicest professors around and he is very helpful. Try to take a class with him if you can.,1
Great teacher. Wants the students to succeed. Like any class you have to put in the work to do well. I recommend this class and teacher,1
"The hotness, yes, made this class so much more bearable.  Did an admirable job of making a dreadful class interesting.  Tests were very easy, they're just short essays.  He doesn't really give much homework, but you have to write 2 short papers.  Grades easy.",1
"Wonderful instructor very enthusiastic about teaching, which is the only thing that kept me, engaged in the subject. However, the exams were time consuming for a one hour and fifteen minute class. Again, great instructor but if you do not have time to cross all your Ts and dot  your I's go with another instructor. Beware group project. ",1
She is Great! Super friendly and energetic...too bad she will no longer be teaching at LMC.,1
Dr. Falvo represents the ideal teacher that everyone should experience.  He is very insightful and helpful.  He was trained by the best and he performs as well as teaches as one of the best.,1
"Professor Hunt takes a fun approach to teaching topics that many people might find boring. BL431 is one of the most useful classes I have taken at WIU. With Covid-19 restrictions our class was online. I normally try to avoid online classes, but the recorded lectures cover all required topics very well. Don't hesitate to take it online.",1
"If you're going to ask us to supply you with stamps and envelopes as a pre-requisite to passing your course then for God sakes man, at least mail us the darn final exams sooner than 4 months after they were initially turned in.  Seriously, get it together dude.",0
"Don is overall a great prof, but he didn't take the course seriously enough. He makes it seem like the course is a joke and a free A but it's not. The midterm and the Major Assignment are no joke and need to be takes extremely seriously. But overall if you show up to lectures or just read the slides you'll be fine.",1
"Tons of reading, but Haldane is a fair grader. She's nice and seems to really care about her students.",1
"He is a nice guy who loves to joke around. He's not a strict grader, or strict about anything really. Not good for super serious students.",1
"I loved the Course, especially with George. He is very specific in his requirements for the course. You should attend classes because he goes over important stuff too. He is genuinely caring if you talk to him.",1
"Mr Selph was a great teacher high up on my list of favourite teachers I've had. His lectures were clear, he approached problems in various ways so all types of learners could understand. He was very patient with his students and created ways for them to solve and discover math solutions on their own, then walked them through it.",1
"Favourite lecture of my day. Jeff was interesting to listen to, and seemed to enjoy the content he was teaching. Doesn't care if you come to class or not, but I would recommend attending, as he really takes time to explain calculations and charts. He gets a bit miffed if you have conversations in class, so keep it to a whisper.",1
"Shes such a great professor, she cares ALOT about her students and she made me love psychology",1
"Dr. Lyall is awesome. The best teacher I have ever had. During lectures just be respectful and pay attention, they go by quick. You'll learn a lot if you participate and follow the lectures. You have to do weekly summaries from the book assigned, which is easy and not demanding at all. Get ready to laugh, he is hilarious. ",1
A great professor because he knows how to help students understand material. Clearly knows the class material inside and out. Exams are fair and representative of homework and lectures. He makes you actually enjoy coming to class everyday.,1
"Young is an amazing math teacher. She makes everything so easy and straight to the point! She offers multiple opportunities to get your grade to the grade that you want in the class! If you have to take Math211, I wouldnt recommend any other teacher besides her",1
She is the best Math teacher ever. Took her for two semester and she is awesome. yes there are lots of quizzes and homework but there easy and its builds up your final grade. she wants her students to succeed. TAKE HER!!!,1
"Mary, while clearly a kind and smart person, assembles her courses from a collection of half-baked ideas for projects. If you want a rigorous geology class where you learn more than you could from reading a few Wikipedia pages, Mary is not for you.",0
"He is amazing. Show up to class, pay attention to the notes. You need to work for your grade. Great prof.",1
Probably my favorite class i took one semester. Professor Candida really cares about her students and is passionate about disability. Many in class lectures however they were engaging and interesting. Attend and participate and you'll have a good time as well as an A.,1
AWESOME Teacher! Just show up study do the extra credit and listen. She made a point to do extra study groups for the more difficult test.. Love her please teach more classes!,1
"Great Teacher! I loved his class! Straight forward with you and plays no tricks on tests and quizzes. Study your notes because his tests and quizzes comes right from them, you dont really use the textbook at all.  Overall, good class, just stay on top of your work and youll be good to go!",1
"This class requires ALOT of out of class time! Expect to be spending 5 or more hours per week working on you pieces outside of class. Professor is very helpful and is into what he is teaching. But remember, that the more time you dedicate into this class, the better your pieces will look, and the better your grade will be. Not an easy-A class!",1
"He is well planned out. His tests are not easy, but he gives you good study tips/guides. I would take him again.",1
"Very fun class.  Just come to class and listen.  If you put forth the effort, you will do just fine.",1
"This professor is quite funny, but most importantly is quite fair in grading, the possibility to get an A is quite high.",1
"Steve is a great guy for culture heritage, I had him for 1 & 2, he truly cares about his students and wants you to succeed. He has high expectations for you, but he just wants the best for you. There is a decent amount of reading, but usually it is interesting. A lot of group stuff, usually discussions. No final exam, test or quizzes. Just papers.",1
"Very interesting professor.. He isnt the type of professor that makes sure you understand what you learned in class. Sometimes I felt as if his lectures go in one ear and out of the other. Your grade throughout the year is based on your ""portfolio"" which he skims through the hw you've completed and the corrections to the test that you WILL fail lol",1
"Candida is an amazing teacher! She really wants to see all of her students pass, and she really emphasizes the service learning component of the class; which you must do if you want to pass the class. She really opened my eyes on the history of disabilities, and made me think of things that I had never thought of before. Her assignments are great!",1
"Took her for ANTH1 & ANTH2 and received an A for both. She is very detailed and awesome at teaching and loves anthropology. She gives you all the information in class that you will need to succeed on tests and really gets students involved in the world of anthropology, even if it's not your major.",1
"Try to avoid him but, Dr No is inevitable.",0
"I was excited about the class when I signed up, but Bob made is so much better. Really personable and makes class discussion fun. I would recommend him to anyone.",1
please. for all that is holy. do not take this women in any class ever. I got an A and I would get an F if it meant I never had to take this class. Don't do it guys. There's better out there just don't do sonntag. please please don't. Tests are cruel. She is cruel. There are a lot of better profs at dearbon. Shabeb walla ma tekhdoua.,0
"This class is definitely always moving quickly, but he sticks to his schedule and has you learning a lot of information in no time. Very helpful, funny and kind. Do the readings, come to as many classes as possible, and ask questions when you're unsure and you should do well.",1
"Dr. Pasquesi was a breath of fresh air. She teaches us to think outside the box. Use our minds more, not to rely on just books. She's tough with us because she wants us to get it and I'm so happy I had her for my Professor. I would recommend her to anyone who takes English 212.",1
I took this class online and barely passed and I'm an honor student.She did not explain any of the work.She would post the assignment and give vague instruction on how to complete.I tried to set a meeting with her and she wanted me to drive to Springstead High School to talk about my grades.,0
"I have her this semester and so far she is one of my favorite teachers. I got an 84 on my first test, and thats without studying that much. I did the online quizzes and the chapter review questions in the textbook and that was enough for me. I highly reccomend her for general psych, Great teacher!",1
"A very hard class. there are a lot of memorization but he allows a cheat sheet.  Even though he was hard to understand, he was very dedicated to his students and the class. He held a lot of office hours if anybody needed help with homework. I would recommend to read and study the material before you go to him for help because he will get angry if y",1
Excellent Business woman to model in the business world as well as a professor! She is straight forward with her grading and gives extra credit. Since this class is is a pretty simple subject she makes the assignments and exams simple too. She is just awesome and precious!,1
"This is  the most amazing instructors that I have met in my life. This man is the kind of doctor that I hope to be like! This is an extremely knowledgeable, compassionate and funny instructor. He is very helpful but you do have to put in the effort. He is tough because he cares about a students and does not take slackers. Would recommend, gracias.",1
"I took her class on-line for fall semester. Easy A. It was super easy to pass because all her quiz were questions you can search on line as well her hw assignments.. Of course the book helps as well. And you need to do a ""Direct Question"" weekly which is not bad. It usually topics like how much vitamins are in your food and protein etc.",1
"Gail does not take the time to to listen to her students. It is her way, her schedule, all the time. Don't expect her to get help from her.  Instead, she will pawn your need for help onto someone else. If you have a specific way of working she will ciriticize you for it because it is not the way she does it. The Gail way is the only way.",0
"EASY A, IF YOU CAN TAKE HIM. DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH EXCEPT, ATTEND CLASS AND HIS TESTS ARE NEXT TO EASY. Teaches very well. Would definitely take him for following Spanish courses if given the chance.",1
"Great teacher for lab. very helpfull and understanding, unlike others.",1
AVOID HIM AT ALL COST. Do not take his class you will regret it for sure.,0
"Took him for Senior Sem, very funny, cancels class a lot, but is down to business when we have class. Somewhat unorganized and hard to follow when giving directions. Your grade is based on 1 reading  that you present to the class, a final research paper (60% of grade) which is somewhat challenging. Attendance is significant as well. Rate it 7 out 1",1
wonderful teacher! can't find enough good things to say about her! her class is not easy and alot of people dropped out but if you attend every class and learn what she tells you to learn you'll do great in this class!,1
Professor Keith-Serafy is a very intelligent Professor. She is knowledgeable about Anatomy and Physiology and so much more. She is fair and understanding. She will come early and stay late to answer any questions and make sure that her students feel comfortable with the lecture and lab materials. I would definitely take her class again and again!,1
Made politics fun. He is a great teacher who cares about what he does.,1
"Awesome prof! Has fun demonstrations, and explains things clearly. Listen to his random stories though, they appear on the exams!!",1
Professor Hegner does her best to make accounting interesting. Her courses are well organized and the information is explained well. She will call on students randomly and put them on the spot quite often so make sure you know the text and be prepared for class. She is not super strict with attendance and may miss a class herself. Great professor!,1
"I took him online. His work was super easy. Only required a discussion board, which you only have to respond to one person and then a journal. But when it came to the Mid-term & Final, he gave no review. They were each over 7 chapters. The hardest tests I've ever taken. Aside from that his online class isn't too bad.",1
I really like Professor Poole! The textbook is mandatory but it is an easy read and engaging with questions as you read the content. The quizzes reflect what was learned through the readings.,1
She is on of my favorite professors I have had at FSU. She made the class more entertaining than it was meant to be because of her sense of humor and energetic attitude. I highly recommend her. She does not get to create the class schedule or assignments but she does make them more enjoyable.,1
"Easy class. She is super sweet and caring. Took her online & she was always accessible. Only 3 assignments & 2 tests all semester. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS. They are a bit intimidating af first, but once you start it's a piece of cake. I made A's on all assignments and failed both tests and still passed. She gives a couple of chances for e.c. as well.",1
"Dr. B is awesome and so dedicated to her job and her students. She is super tough and expects a lot from everyone, but I think it's a good thing and she is always there to help and answer questions",1
Very rude and slow,0
"Steve's class is methodical and thorough, and he's the best math teacher I've ever had. His lesson plans are step-by-step and build on one another over the course of the term. He gladly answers questions during class and office hours. Tests are difficult, but if you do the required homework, you'll have no problem with them. Highly recommended!",1
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
"Dr. Harris is a very good professor. He cares about his students a lot and is very nice and encouraging. He is more than willing to help, if you ask for it. I had him for Ear Training I. The class is fairly easy as long as you practiced.",1
hard to get ahold of,0
"Nic is a funny man who teaches his lectures with on pictures. You are supposed to take notes on what he says with a picture in the background. The exams were fairly easy if you take good notes. However, each exam was made based on what was said in class, so they may fluctuate from year to year. Overall an interesting class in my opinion.",1
"Jenneke has made me really appreciate the Dutch language. Pay attention in class, take notes. The listening quizzes were the toughest part for me. I missed quite a lot of class and Jenneke was willing to work with me through it. A very generous, kind, and adorably Dutch teacher. Id recommend taking this class!",1
"Bob is definitely one of the best professors I've ever had. He makes the class enjoyable and has a reputation of being a very difficult grader. You have to work very hard to get an A in this class, but he is ready to help you with whenever.  It gets harder as the class goes on, but he makes class enjoyable.  Definitely my fav class so far!",1
Don't miss class & keep up with the work and you will be fine. I enjoyed his sense of humor. Very intelligent and definitely worth taking!,1
"Adrian is very helpful and understanding. However, he expects you to come on time everyday - even if he doesn't. Besides that, he's a GREAT teacher. He made learning spanish fun and easy. Has a good attitude and makes lots of jokes.",1
"Fifty minutes into her lecture and all Ive heard is how great of teacher she is (shes not) and how easy this class is to pass (it's not). For some reason the most difficult class I have is this ""blow off class"" and let me tell you it is not. Her mid term is huge and only 4 days to work on it. ""At least you woke up this morning"" Almost wish I didn't",0
"Super nice lady, and very understanding when we had to switch over to online because of COVID-19. Beware, though, lots of the course is just how to use a calculator and it's hard to find help for it online, so you have to go to class to understand.",1
Awesome class!!! Very laid back teacher who knows his stuff!,1
"The only reason why I would say to take him is the curve. He is rude and mean. And his exams are way easier compared to the other professors. However, I really think he has anger issues. If you get close to him though, I heard he warms up. CURVE CURVE CURVE though.",1
She was  an awesome teacher.,1
great teacher n enjoyed,1
"Prof Qualls is an amazing professor; he is without a doubt among the best teachers I've ever had. While he is a tough grader, and particularly picky about writing assignments, his criticism is always constructive and he is willing to help students improve",1
best computer teacher ever!,1
Class is a lot of work. 3 Exams no final (last exam is final but only covers material since 2nd exam) If you take good note and do the HW you will be fine if you are good at blue book exams,1
"Great teacher! I had him for nonverbal communication.  He is sort of a hard grader on written work.  Also there is a super annoying group project.  The class had 4 exams, two video response papers, and a group project.  Attendance in mandatory. You need the books to do well on tests.",1
No Comments,0
"Ray is an amazing professor, his classes are always interesting, informative and interactive. Personally, I gained a colossal amount of knowledge in his class. It meant so much for me to have a professor like Ray!  His wealth of knowledge in, and passion for Business is commendable. Ray is highly recommended as the best for any business course.",1
"Ken's a GREAT professor. I've done graphic design for a decade, but I still learned a LOT in this class. Funny & honest. A little forgetful, but easygoing about it. If you slack off, he won't give you the time of day. Pay attention, show up, do your work. This professor is worth it. His so-called ""favorites"" are the ones who actually show up & try.",1
Class is enjoyable and pretty easy as long as you show up every day. I loved her as a professor.,1
"Amit was a great guy. His lectures were extremely well done with plenty of example problems. He held a few (optional) review lectures outside of class time, More over for Calc 1156 using the online/MyLab resources really helped. Overall really nice guy who makes sure you understand the material one way or another :) 10/10 would take again",1
He was a really good accounting teacher. Kind of a dry personality but he gives lots of EC and does the homework in class.,1
"such an easy class.. attendance is NOT mandatory, i only attended on the days that he gave quizzes & i passed with flying colors. he posts all of the lectures online and they are word-for-word what is on the quiz. 5 easy quizzes and only 1 paper all semester (he's a lenient grader.) Such a laid back class, i would definitely take him again",1
"Honestly and sincerely one of the most rude professors I've ever had. His teaching assistant, Kelly Budesa is just as bad. He had 'okay' insight but it felt as if they were only teaching because they needed to. In no way did it seem like they wanted to teach the course and if you asked them, they'd probably admit it. One of the worse profs I've had",0
Prof Allen overall just sucks. He's arrogant and inconsiderate to the fact that this is not everyones first priority and mostly everyone only take his class to fulfill a gened. He gives super long boring lectures that no one understands unless you're an expert in Refugee crisis's. Do not take this class unless you have the time to do excess work,0
"The class is very easy in hindsight. The homework is relatively simple and the tests are mainly just rewritten examples in class or homework. Although the exams are easy, there is no partial credit. My exams were 9-12 questions but if you get an answer wrongs you lose all the points. Getting one question wrong could cost you 16%.",1
"Test is very Tricky, and very nit picky when it comes to homework. I wont recommend this teacher at all",0
"I felt that I should leave a comment to redeem Harp here. He is not useless. He gives you outlines and reviews. Use them, you'll do fine! Every question I asked was responded to quickly. I think Harp just has a low bs tolerance. Do the work on time, read his rules, and use the stuff he gives you.",1
"Very interesting teacher, but can ramble on for all of class. He says, ""Yeah....yeah...I see....Yes....I see...."" a lot when you mention something to him. I only had to write four papers throughout the entire term with a mid and final, easy workload, interesting, an excellent teacher!",1
"The class wasn't as interesting as I'd hope (Oceanography). Majority of students zone out in class. 4 HW assignments, go to Discussion to get help, seriously. One redemptive HW, do it. iClicker points each class. One midterm, one final, not cumulative. Studied the night before and got a B on both. I'm sure if I tried harder, I would've gotten an A.",1
I have mixed feelings about Orser. She's a sweet woman and all that and I have taken more than one class with her but she can be extremely unclear about what she wants from assignments and her lectures are very messy. Take her at your own discretion I guess.,0
"Great professor.  The class is easy if you read the assignments and study for the tests.  She is very helpful when it comes to inderstanding the readings.  As a class ask for a study guide for the tests...she will give one!  She also brought in coffee, apple juice, and bagels on the day of the final! Looked forward to going to class!!",1
Do homework. Show up. She's cool and hot! I made an A.,1
Mr. Rodriguez is a great professor. I had small knowledge of the spanish language going into his class but he made it really easy to keep up. I understood what was being said but I could never form a reply. He will constantly ask if there is something you don't understand and that is your chance to ask. He will re-explain to get the idea across.,1
"Finishing up my degree at NOVA so I had to take him. He's by far the hardest Spanish professor I've ever had. Very strict/tough grader and assings a lot of homework! While he cares about his students, he could be very rude towards them during lectures. I normally did well in Spanish, but got a C with hard work. Glad I only had to take him once.",0
"Easy class. One thing I enjoyed was the topics we covered and the television shows we watched. Take this class, even if you aren't a psych major.",1
WORSTTTTTTTTTTTTT              DO NOT TAKE HIMMMMMMM,0
"Fair class. Fair Teacher. Its pretty much if you want to pass, he will help you pass, if you dont care if you pass or fail, neither will he. Do your test reviews,  show your work, and you  can't fail a test. He is also really flexible if you have to take care of work/family drama and cannot make it to class provide you notify him.",1
This is a new program. Ali did well with what he had. I hear he's making the class even better. He's good at letting the students take the discussion. His materials would benefit from a good editing! Better-organized material would make for easier studying for exams. Time will only benefit his teaching and the course materials.,1
"Good lecturer, but can dwell on irrelevant matters during lecture. Disorganized and the load of work he assigns is ridiculous. I did well in class because I find microbiology really interesting. Overall, he is a good teacher, but you're also expected to work a lot for the grade so keep that in mind. ALSO: FIND A GOOD LAB PARTNER.",1
"Five 50 point tests and one 150 point paper. The only time you use the textbook is for the paper. All of the exams are based off of his powerpoint presentations. Such a truly nice guy. I had an 89.75% and he rounded me up to an A. Really cares about his students. He lectures every day from his powerpoints. Low maintenance class, super easy.",1
Very good prof.  His lectures are clear and easy to follow and take notes.  He is very helpful and is very willing to meet outside of class hours.,1
"Read your book prior to the lecture. She knows her stuff. She will tell you whats on the test, her test are sometimes tricky but easy if you study.",1
"This online class was my least favorite business class of all time.  The instructor assigns an obscene amount of homework for how basic the class is.  I was also not a fan of having ALL homework, assignments, quizzes, etc due on FRIDAY NIGHT.  Ouch!  Expect hours of busy work and an absolutely detestable TWO group projects that made no sense!",0
"This guy was a terrible and is always ""right"". He will doc you points for things he didn't ask for. We can't read minds.. you will also never get 100% on anything.I have already learned all of the material before but found a way to doc me points",0
"Be ready to get outside help from tutors, SI, or other classmates from the beginning of the class. There are homework problems. Do them before class he lectures about them! This is a class that you have to stay on top of. He doesn't really explain the example problems in class.",0
One of the worst teachers I've ever taken. Too many assignments for an online class. Too many small things you had to complete in order to get your real work done. Too many things due at once. Too many things due back to back. She was really rude when you did reach out to her. She just didn't care.,0
"Holly is very knowledgeable. Beware-she expects u to know how to hand code before taking her interface class. If u aren't an,expert you will spend many sleepless nights coding. Her class is 90% discussion and 10% designing. Wish she were more,willing to help. Rambles about her,personal life instead of helping you.",0
"Solid professor, the class overall was pretty good. Online homework (Aplia) due every week, you have to really stay on top of it as it makes a huge impact on your grade. Tests are pretty challenging, if you get 70+ on the tests Aplia it will bring your grade up roughly a letter grade. It never hurts that she's pretty hot :)",1
"Good teacher for an online class with the exception that she was often short in her emails and seemed to. It always read them correctly when she would reply with a completely irrelevant answer. However, she was very helpful and did repost quickly. Truly cares about students grades. Assigns alot of homework but it is easy and provides a lot of bonus",1
"Great professor, explains everything that's going on and that he's doing on the blackboard. Lectures are really good, but the only way to stay engaged is interest in the material. Skipping class is not a great idea.",1
No Comments,1
I love her,1
"Prof. Joyal is a great professor who gets to know his students, especially in his Ancient Greek courses. He is adamant about grammar and syntax, but revisits concept often to help familiarise them. His feedback on assignments is valuable and constructive. Make sure you prepare for the class, because he will call on students to translate aloud.",1
"She's an old westbury professor that teaches using video conferencing. Still, she cares about the manhattan students and tries hard to get both classes to participate. She's a clear teacher, and you'll learn A LOT about anthropology with her. Take her if you get the chance.",1
"LOVED THIS CLASS! Professor Hinshaw is the BEST PROF EVER! Lives up to the hype. Seriously, TAKE THIS CLASS, hands down best class at Cal. ",1
"She is a really good teacher and a very helpful one, too.  I enjoyed her class and probably would not have done as well as I did if it had not been for her help and encouragement.",1
"Bob is the best professor I've had at IU. He's very knowledgeable about writing, and definitely helped me develop my skills as a writing.",1
"professor rombo is a very nice lady but honestly a horrible professor. she is very smart, but goes off topic in class and ends up lecturing about god knows what. her tests are kinda easy even if you don't study (if you're fine with a mid 70 - low 80 grade), but shes a super tough grader when it comes to projects and assignments.",0
"He knows his stuff, and will grade you according to his knowledge. The perk is that you can rewrite your papers all the way up to the last day if you want to receive a better grade (You will need this!) The final is take home and is literally on anything talked about during the lectures including random vocab words he writes on the board.",1
"She is very reasonable, she grades her papers easy I received an A on every single paper I wrote in her class. We did done online homework not sure she checks it we also use the books for notes and hw which are pretty simple but her test are very challenging I always received 60 or 70's on the test but I passed the class with a B. I recommend her",1
"At first, I wasn't sure how I felt about her, but after going to talk to her during office hours, she really helped me through some issues. She's totally honest about everything so ask her anything, she's extremely laid back.",1
great teacher makes history more relevant to today.,1
"Literally the worst teacher I have had here. DO NOT take this class. Her lectures make absolutely no sense and it's hard to find anything that seems worth writing down. She makes us do stupid physical exercises that add nothing to the curriculum, and she ruined some of my favorite books by her confusing comparisons and fixations on philosophers. ",0
I really liked her.  Econ is my worst subject but she made it easier to understand.  Offers tutoring if you need it.  She's very nice.  Liked her a lot.,1
Discussions in this class were actually fun.,1
This man would tight rope walk the Grand Canyon if it helped you understand a concept. Awesome guy and really loved the material he taught. I suggest everyone use this class as their Tech Elective.,1
he is a great teacher. Knows his stuff. 2 projects that were time consuming. Atend class.,1
"Fowler is such a smart woman and it is apparent in her lectures. she is so enthusiastic about the material, it's hard not to be interested. her lectures were sometimes unfocused, but fun none the less. with an awesome ta, this class is great and engaging. (and you learn a ton)",1
Rusty's the best!,1
Ram does a great job at making his class as interactive as he can considering the current pandemic. He is always willing to help out any student as he wants us all so succeed. He gave a handful of quizzes and assignments but nothing too crazy. Exams and quizzes are easy if you study and go to class.,1
He can be quite rude and sarcastic at times.,0
Very inconsiderate and answers emails with an attitude. She doesn't care about what happens with you if you struggle. She also doesn't tell you how she translates number grades to letter grades (65D-). TOUGH GRADER! Little mistakes MATTER. Petty and fake. You will not feel great after her class. I've NEVER felt so bad about myself with a teacher.,0
Everett is a fantastic teacher. Knows what he's talking about and is great at clarifying things. Tests are a little difficult and done times weirded strangely.,1
"Took Art History 1 & 2 as well as Art Appreciation. Art History midterms are take home essays and final is one question! A few one page essays are given throughout the semester, but they're one page, no longer. One powerpoint project due in each 1 & 2 no essay required just list of sources. Lectures are dry but manageable. Would take again!!",1
"I have taken all of Professor Deluna's classes that are provided at SAC. He is organized and clear about the criteria required in class. Pay attention to his lectures and final review - that's the key to passing his class. He's not strict, but he has expectations from his students and holds them to a higher standard. He's one of my fave Prof's!",1
Nice guy but his papers are crazy. He wants it a certain way and no matter what it wont be perfect.,0
My absolute favorite teacher! Such an interesting man!,1
Dr. Britton is one of the best at KU! Her passion for her field of work is displayed through her lectures and her excitement is contagious.  ,1
"Prof. Hansen always talked about really interesting topics and if you take good notes and go to all the lectures, you will pass his class with an easy A. His tests are 5 short essay questions but you only have to respond to 4. All the questions should be easily answered if you pay attention and take REALLY GOOD NOTES in class.",1
"Very nice, she knows a lot and if you're struggling let her know so that she can help you. Make sure to check moodle and turn in packets even if she doesn't bring them up.",1
"She's just like any other tough bio teacher. But she's nice and will grade you fairly.  But her exams are not easy.  I hate ssaying so, but there are no easy bio classes here.  You have to study her material everyday, otherwise you'll fall behind.  so far i'm half way through the semester and i have a D.. but shes still a pretty good teacher.",1
"She's an amazing professor. Definitely one of my favorites at Duke! She has all it takes and more to be a great professor-- intelligent, great personality, clarity, passion.",1
Cool guy hard to pass  if u dont like jazz get graded on the 5 exams and participation If ur not going to take time to listen to music posted on bb dont even bother to take class  save ur gpa,0
Very knowledgeable professor and likes to make his students think critically and creatively. dont be late! submit things by deadlines or you won't get a passing grade (there's only 4 graded assignments)! participate as much as you can! very interesting and not extremely demanding class as long as you stay organized,1
Melanie is a teacher who cares about her students her lectures are a bit boring but the slides are very explanatory. Final was easy but REALLY long with 100 multiple choice  worth 50% and 7 LONG answers worth the other 50%.,1
"Great professor. He knows what he's talking about and wants to ensure that you know the material. He's a tad eccentric in the delivery but if you're willing to put in the work, he'll meet you halfway.",1
"I did not like Professor Smith. Her lectures were extremely long with obnoxious background music and lost my attention. She brought her personal political views into HISTORY lectures multiple times, but she does communicate with students well. She knows when students are most likely sharing answers. Stay on top of the work, and you will do great.",0
Professor Ryabova is so nice. In my opinion she is super easy and sometimes that doesnt challenge you if you really want to learn like me. She just reads the PowerPoints and makes you do so many practice problems. Her class in my opinion is boring but you can get an easy A with like 100 points of extra credit that she offers.,1
Dr. Neupane does a great job managing a large class for such specific get it or don't kind of class. He is always very friendly and helpful. Do not let his name and accent deter you he is easy to understand and a hilarious guy!,1
"Terrible professor. Isn't clear with the topics she's discussing; she starts talking about something then completely changes the subject or moves on to say something else. I passed with a B+, however, I would never take her again. I dreaded going to her class and listening to her lectures. She was all over the place.",0
"This professor is the reason I change my concentration  from Ancient Medieval to Latin American History. She is one of the most flexible and understanding role models I've ever met. As long as you participate, and do the readings you will pass the quiz's & exams  with a B+ if not an A for sure. Visit office hours show that you care, its that easy.",1
"Excellent teacher, touch course. You will need a study group and I definitely recommend attending SI sessions. The course is heavily based on anatomy and the majority of your grade comes from your lab. Don't be afraid to ask questions, she's intimidating, but she truly cares for her students.",1
Dr. Stoner is a lovely man and makes the class as interesting as it can be. There are quizzes at the beginning of every class. Tests are mainly participation quizzes and he posts the answers. He also offers extra credit lectures that are very interesting. There are 8 books that you have to read but it's very spread out. I enjoyed this class.,1
She goes through her presentation way too fast for students to clearly understand the material.,0
"He is great for BA 370 but NOT MIS 300. I am very positive towards learning, but I can honestly say, in this class I learned maybe the same amount I could have read on my own in two hours, & I'm avg. at comps. He uses the same tests of the professor who wrote the course. Easy 'A', but if you care to learn, doesn't teach well like he does in BA 370.",0
"The class was online, you had to respond to a discussion once a week, and had 3 days to complete a 8 page papers. Take her if you don't mind all of your weekends disappearing.",0
Very funny guy and interesting class. Exam material is straight from lecture so this isn't a class you can skip (much!).,1
"I love Karen, a really nice professor who tells you everything you need to know to do well in assignments and a genuinely engaging professor",1
This class was the hardest thing I have done in my life. This class made me very sad and depressed when I thought about it. Definitely prepared me for chem 2 but not sure it was worth the stress.,0
"Very funny, loud, fast talking teacher. He gives out very specific study guides and goes through most of them with you in class. Tests are simple and curved. I loved his class the first semester so I specifically asked for him for my 2nd semester of History.",1
A great teacher with sometimes boring lectures. It can be a fun interesting class too.,1
"Yes, finally a real college professor.  He will drive you nuts with all the material.  Then have  test questions geared towards some super Jeopardy of history game.  You will study until your hair hurts & pray for at least a low C on your test.  Then when you feel all hope is lost of maintaining a scholarship the curve will hit & all is okay.",1
"He is an awesome teacher. The study guides that he gives prior to tests are so helpful!The class moves at a fast pace, but he makes the material easier to understand and will answer any questions that you have. Keep up with the homework! I'm not great at math, but with Mr.Logan's help, I did well in the class. I recommend taking his class!",1
Professor Engelhardt is easily one of the nicest professors I've had. The comments hold true about his unique style of teaching. It is very hard to understand the concepts he talks about in class which is why the book is essential in learning some of the topics he covers. This class is by far one of the hardest classes I've taken in college.,1
"I had her for two different courses and she was the reason I stayed in school. She is the true definition of the word ""teacher"".  Without her I don't know where I'd be right now.",1
"One of the better professors at Eastern. Is a fun person, but can get a little boring. I do not reccommend taking the 3 hour class with her. If you hate art just don't even take this class because you'll just complain the whole time.",1
Syllabus says you are not allowed to contact the professors. Backtests aren't relevant to what you will be tested on. PILOT tutoring wasn't helpful. 3 exams make your entire grade. Grading system unfair and system to ask for a regrade basically doesn't exist. I took an exam in October and no one ever responded to my regrade request.,0
"He is an extremely tough grader (looking for specific wording in exams). He also talks about being available for help anytime outside of class, but when you ask him questions or try to reach out he is either dismissive/passive aggressive or never replies (email). I am currently teaching myself with the textbook. Take this class with someone else!",0
"Professor McGlynn was the BEST teacher i have had at SSC. I loved her class! She teaches you so much, not only about the class but also about life. She is so caring and sweet. You will actually learn in a way that excites you. I can't hesitate enough that you NEED to take her class, you won't regret it!! FYI: You will need the book.",1
Its an intro to accounting so material is the same between professors. Very helpful professor willing to meet with students. Tells you exactly what will be on exams so if you don't study blame yourself. Got 100s on every exam but many classmates did not do as good. Just study the material an you'll be fine.,1
"Overall great class. The only thing that isn't that great is that there is so much to cover and Dr. Woodfin can't get through it all. Her lectures are informative, but she sometimes goes off on tangents. Always interesting things, but not necessarily relevant. I enjoyed the class and think she is quite kind!",1
"By far, the most amazing teacher I've ever had. He opens up every door of opportunity for his students to succeed. He deserves more recognition than words can describe.  He's changed my life!                                       R. Harbut",1
Mr. Lee is an amazing instructor but he's forced to teach material from the dept head.  Mr Kraatz didn't email the material in time which made our projects pointless. I took NOTHING away from this class. It would be nice for Mr Lee to teach his own material.,1
"Extremely helpful, easy to understand after you get accustomed  to the accent, Very intelligent.  Highly Recommended.",1
"Good professor, but i did not learn much reading in her class, but how to follow directions instead. Easy class though so you should have no problem passing with a B if you do all the work.",1
"Dr. Schore is the most memorable professor I've had at Davis so far, he made organic chemistry interesting and even enjoyable. He's very clear in lecture and makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Do not be fooled by the examples he does in class, the exams are much more challenging. Textbook problems are similar to his exams.",1
"Took his 230 class (precovid) and now I'm at UCSC, and my upper div biochem series has been SO EASY because of this man. He makes you work for an A, but its bc he cares and wants u to do well post-transfer. I would *NOT* being doing as well as I am in my biochem series w/o this man!! If your taking any biochem post-transfer: TAKE STAPLE'S CLASS!!!",1
"Professor Dunham was professional, organized, and kind. He responded quickly to questions via email. Very supportive, informative, and personable. I did not like how group project members were not held accountable for low participation. Quizzes contained a lots of nuanced trick questions and one quiz (that I caught) had wrong answers.",1
"SO HOT. He is a fine looking specimen as well as the most helpful prof I've ever had. Relatable, personable and encouraging. He made me want to change my major. Always available to help and is easy to contact. Makes an effort for the class to get to know him as well as each other. Class participation is a must but he makes it a lot of fun.",1
I am taking her this semester and by far she has taught me the most in any English course I've ever taken. The people who are commenting harsh things are kids who 1) never show up 2) expect a grade to be handed to them 3) didn't try to understand the material. She's very understanding and will help you if you help yourself.,1
"She is a sweet lady. I feel like we only did like 5 essays all semester. We only did like 1 or 3 assignments on the book,so your efforts on your essay will reflect on your  final grade. I wish she would have handed back our essays with feedback, so that I would have known what I needed to improve on. Overall, I got an A in the class.",1
Melissa Benfield is a great teacher!  She is very nice and warm and cares about here students and wants you to do well.  She will answer questions and she is very clear.  If you do the work and follow the instructions you will do well.  I would take her again if I had the chance.,1
"Reiterating what I read about this guy before I took the class. DO THE HOMEWORK!!! Its not a requirement, but you will do well on exams if you complete all problems assigned. Lectures are strictly PPT. Had not taken an accounting/finance class in 2 years before this one. Expecting A- or better. DO THE HOMEWORK!!!!! If you're stuck, ask him for help",1
"Generally a very sweet woman. When it comes down to ANT, she's passionate and because she's the chair of ANT, she's pretty serious about her work. Weekly assignments and LOTS of reading from textbook and multiple articles every week. Not a lot of slideshows, mostly lectures. I like her, but I don't like the extensive curriculum. Tough class to pass",1
"Kendra is amazing.  She makes everything interesting, and I love how excited she gets about ideas.  Take her class - it will teach you to write, but more than that, she will teach you to see the world around you in ways you never have.",1
"If I could give her 0 stars, I would. I'm confident she grades with her eyes closed as she is consistently late to all meetings and only ever complains about her second job. Doesn't bother to give feedback on tests/assignments and avoids emails and texts. My worst teacher and will be yours too. I can't describe how horrible she is in 350 characters",0
Professor Lorentz is the best! He will proofread essays before due dates and will specify exactly what needs to be changed for an A and he is very understanding. He really cares and is very clear and timely on his grading. He lectures a lot but often takes time for more fun assignments. Professor Lorentz is an amazing professor.,1
Dr. Haspel is one of the most admirable teachers I've had. He's funny and his class is very enjoyable. He is very easy going and is willing to work with you in any way he can.,1
Great lecturer and easy to follow notes. Simplifies complex material to make it easier to understand.,1
If you forget about the quiz he would not open it ( happened to me). The project is about creating a website which he show u in how to videos every week. I took him for ITM 4271. I highly recommend getting E-book since the homework are the def. so you can easily and faster find the answers. 2 quizzes and 2 exams.,1
"I took him last semester fall of 2015. He's a funny guy, and he knows what he is talking about. Very organized with his lectures. Interesting class. Homework isn't hard and not a lot is given. The most work you'll do is writing research papers, and they have to be 3 pages, which isn't much. I say go for this class.",1
Good,1
"I took this class for EDU 104 and I tell you I will highly recommend this professor. she is very funny and realistic, she understands and goes out her way to make sure you understand as well. she is always available after hours so that helps a lot. I love this professor she is a real GEM!!! Not to many professors are like her, she is the best!!!!!",1
He made the class very engaging and fun.,1
"Fantastic. As long as you do the homework and projects in CS121, you will easily get the hang of it. Attendance replaces your lowest test score. So go to class. If you're learning a programming language, you really don't want to miss class anyway. Did not use the book at all.",1
"She's a super nice and great teacher, she's flexible with due dates with her students and explains the topics pretty well. The class is pretty easy, show up and do your work. The tests are fairly hard but if you take notes and study them you'll be set.",1
"I took this course online during the summer. He held live weekly help sessions before each assignment was due, which were quite helpful. Easy to get in contact with outside of class time, and responds quickly. Overall good prof - I would recommend",1
Prof Cameron is great at giving you feedback! His class is online but he records the lectures for you to go over the material for the week. There is no textbook! Just exams over the readings and lectures! SO READ THE BOOKS! theyre not hard either.,1
"Andrews is the ****ing man.  Period.  If you have not taken KNES 287 then you are missing out.  How to get an ""A"" in his class: Start your papers at least a week in advance (and possibly consult with your T.A.), and study the key terms he has posted on each section for the test.  I got an A+.",1
Dr. Souaiaia gives excellent lectures that will make you interested and make you want to listen. Take this class only if you have an interest in the Islamic Civilization. Easy to get an A if you work very hard and listen. Please throw out any preconceived notions of Islam before taking this class to get more out of it! Yoko is the best TA ever.,1
"She will take any chance in class to promote being organic. She talks about her personal life a lot to try to relate to the lesson. There were 3 test and a final. If you look over the study guide and memorize it then you'll pass. She counts the class activity at the end as classwork, so come to class and you'll be fine. There's a presentation too.",1
"I didn't mind Dr. Lim as much until the final.  I've gotten higher than 95 on all my homework, A's on both of my midterm and 100 on the semester project, and I left finals with an overall of B-....... The 3 hours exam was so freaking hard, I didn't finish in 4 hours... and trust me, I studied my ass of for that class. so good lucj if you take him.",0
She was very helpful. I learned how to swim because of her ,1
"Professor was great!! Maybe she does have a heavy Russian accent, but she taught with passion!!  Tests were not too difficult if you listen to her lectures! Take her if your are interested in continuing in the field.",1
you will need to study like crazy- do ALL the practice problems. if you do this all then you'll do really well. and she's really good. but dont think that you can slack- you really need to work to do well.,1
"Dr. Phelps loves art, and it comes across in his lectures. Come prepared to take lots of notes. The information he gives you in class is what's on the test. You'll have to study for the tests but I have learned so much in his class. Don't doze off, don't skip a class, and do take notes! Art book not really necessary if you take lots of notes.",1
"His lectures don't really explain the material well, and you're better off looking at videos on Khan Academy. He only grades you on the midterms/final, with optional quizzes based off homework for rounding purposes. The TA's are left to handle non-lecture things, and they've struggled because of the lack of communication from the professor.",0
"You will work hard to pass, but the personal growth is amazing!",1
Best teacher at SCC hands down! The guy can teach and is one of the most accomplished professors at SCC. I highly recommend you take him as a teacher if you have the opportunity.,1
"His class is easy if you read the assignments, especially if you already know about WWII. It is great because you get a thorough understanding of the war in the Pacific. Two tests and an optional powerpoint leave you time to deal with other classwork. Definitely taking him again.",1
"The worst professor I have encountered. His rudeness, disrespect, and attitude are so poor. The guy clearly has issues and needs some help. Do not take his class unless if you want to experience his poor grading skills.",0
I loved Dr. Clark! I had her for online Math1111 due to Covid. Math is NOT my strong suit but if you listen and take notes the class is pretty easy! Very nice and patient teacher.,1
"By far one of my favorite teachers I've ever had. She's very good about laying things out clearly and helping you if you still don't understand. Her class is not overly difficult, but you still need to put for a decent amount of effort. She's very fair and a genuinely nice person, loved taking Diff EQ with her.",1
"One of the best nursing professors EMU has.  She is very knowledgeable, fair, and presents the information in a clear manner.  She also still practices nursing (unlike some other professors) and has useful information that is still current. Exams are fair with no ridiculous questions.  If you study and know the material you will get a good grade.",1
"Linear algebra: Gupta does nothing to inspire students: reading straight off slides, he teaches computations and definitions s.t. when students like myself try to employ intuition he fails to understand our thought process. Neglects any curiosities you have in topics not directly addressed in the textbook. 3Blue1Brown will be your best friend.",0
"Ms. Griffin is by far the best teacher I've ever had in any subject. She is extremely prepared and has every lecture available online if you can't attend or want to rewatch it. She gives you every tool to succeed and will help you if you need it. If you take the class seriously, she will take you seriously. It's still hard work but so worth it.",1
"Course Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics. Fair to good presentation of the material. Went largely off ppt slides, few references to book, although the book was used for homework. Easy to get along with, responsive to questions. Fair grading.",1
"I absolutely adored Sandra Orser, she definitely gave me my love for English! However, she is forgetful but she is very accommodating if you have any disability, or mental health issues. I think she is a fair grader. She gives you options to use the stories that she talked about in class for assignments but tend to mark harder.",1
She deffenetely knows her stuff. I really don't like the way she speaks. She has a big accent and it annoyed me so much. He is one hardworking professor but she demands a lot. I consider myself as a very good student but for some reason no matter how much I tried I could not do that good in her class. I ended up gettin a B in her class.,1
"I LOVE HISTORY. Prof Homzy makes you work very hard for an A, but as I said, I love history and didn't mind working very hard for mine. It could have been easier regarding moodle, etc, when we didn't get info early enough to study for our weekly exam. I was happy that there was no pressure at the end of the semestre. All in all, a great teacher!",1
Melissa is an excellent teacher.  She explains exactly what she wants and you can get a strong A if you do it.  I was NOT looking forward to the class before the semester started and now I'd LOVE to take her for another class!  She made public speaking much more comfortable!,1
"Even if you read the free textbook, he will ask you things you can't find anywhere else besides HIS lectures. 2 lecture quizzes per week, 1 chap reading quiz + discussion prompts per week, 3 exams: 60 mult choice, final exam: 120 mult choice, & once a week time-consuming Problem Sets that you will hate. Hard grader w extra credit opportunities.",0
"Great prof.  Was clear in lecture, tested fairly, helpful in labs, graded & handed back assignments very quickly.  Professional, on time to class.  Not an entirely easy class/subject but Dr Miller really simplifies things for his students.  Highly recommend.",1
Staples is a nice guy be expects way too much. Multiple assignments will often be due the same day making it a heavy workload. Lectures are incredibly lengthy and would be a lot shorter and more bearable if he didn't talk about himself so much. The midterms are actually pretty hard; they consist of one essay question and a multiple choice section.,0
"Professor Carson is a great guy who cares about the success of his students. He gives a lot of writing assignments but they're worthwhile and can be finished within the class period. As long as you put in the effort, you'll do well! I would gladly take him again.",1
Attendance points every class. She is very sassy and doesn't answer questions directly/ is not helpful. Half of the class consists of online labs using SPSS. The course reader helped a lot and she gives you a cheat sheet on the final.,0
"She is great instructor and is very knoweedable, very helpful, and explains everything so well.",1
HIST 424 changed my life!  The genuine passion of Dr. Tone quickly connected our class creating a unique open space and honest space to approach carefully selected fascinating subjects. Dr. Tone is incredibly knowledgeable and conveys extraordinary compassion towards her students.  It was such a privilege to take this class!,1
"Professor Antoinetti is a great teacher who knows how to explain the material clearly so you are rarely confused. He also makes lectures interesting with his humor. He frequently embarrasses/makes fun of students which can be upsetting, but don't take it personal. Memorize all the notes word for word and you will be fine.",1
"Honestly you will not go wrong wit her !! she is a great professor, offers so much extra credit ! Easy A, especially if you took trig in high school. Deff reccomend her !! Take her if you get the chance. ",1
He is so awesome. I have so much respect for him... you can feel his intelligence rubbing off on you he's just that smart. I was very intimidated by ochem but he ended up making it actually fun and not nearly as daunting as it could have been. I love that he writes the notes in front of you. He is so willing and nice about any questions you have!,1
"Intresting class. Made you think about sports in a different way. Tests were kinda tricky. Put in study time and you'll do well. Average final grade for the class was 81%. Paper was 8 pages and kinda annoying, but managable. The TA makes or breaks the class. A few pop quizzes so its good to go to class and also to write down small details he says.",1
"Attendance-mandatory on Fridays for Discussion Days but you don't have to speak. You have to do only 5 out of 10 of the Discussions, one page double-spaced. Doesn't use PP slides to lecture, she just speaks so you have to pay attention. Two tests (Midterm/Final). One big paper. There aren't many grades in this class so do well on tests and paper.",1
"This course was not very good, the teacher is really mean if you don't understand everything right away he yells at you. He doesn't help you at all to understand. He is one of those teachers that if you don't get  then you need to figure it out. Did not enjoy this class at all because he was so rude and mean to the students trying to learn and cant",0
"Dr. Kenzig provides feedback on assignments, but it is vague and not helpful. The amount of work each week is overwhelming, beware if you work full time. I would not take another class with this professor as she is a lazy professor with a completely chaotic and unorganized course structure. 10/10 DO NOT recommend.",0
"I was concerned when she said she doesn't do study guides but this is college, not  high school.   I had to study and attend class to learn the topics but I was glad afterwards.  I used the chapter summary technique she required  in her class to study for Microbiology and I passed Microbiology also. Taking her class has helped me get ready for UCF.",1
"Dr. Oriole's lectures are interesting.They will keep you awake.His lectures consist of material which are covered somewhere in your textbook but aren't consistent with his lectures.READ THE CHAPTERS!His exams consist of mostly True or False,and a handful of multiple questions and cases.Know ALL cases. His grading scale or curve is strange.75+ A",1
"I took him for 1101 and 1102 and received an A both times. He is a very good teacher. Sometimes his lectures would not make sense, but the essays were a piece of cake. We only had to write 1000 words for most papers. He is very good at giving you feedback or helping you come up with topics. Overall a fantastic teacher.",1
"Luv her!!! so easy to follow n very thorough in her explanations! Detailed outlines already printed for you, dont get much easier!!!",1
No Comments,1
Easy class if you attend class and actually study. Tests come straight from the lectures and readings.,1
Annoyed me most times becuase of lacking in explaing herself and giving you five different ways to get the same answer.  Saying you only need to know one way but tests you on all of them.  Got a B after a hard semester not really enjoyable though.,1
Great Teacher,1
Currently in her class and I can't say how amazing she is. She kind and caring about school and the real world. She's fair grader as long as you do the work. She gives feedback and loves to get to know students personaly. Just a sweet older lady who loves teaching and students.,1
"Hardest grader I've ever seen. The handful of people who camp out in his office seem to be the only ones with A's. No matter how hard you try on the homework, unless you go to his office and get him to review it before submitting you will get an F. He is a good lecturer, but no way I would take him again.",1
Very difficult for Sociology One.  Gives 6 papers and weekly readings that are more than 60 pages long.  On top of that gives assignments and visit to museum and have to write on those as well.  The readings consume you along with the papers for a level one course.  I would not recommend this teacher,0
Great adjuster. He really helps students reach their adjusting goals. It is refreshing to have a genuinely nice person as a professor!,1
"Very helpful and always accessible. Always gives good and positive feedback.  If you have a passion for Math, you will definitely enjoy every single class with him",1
"One of the most thought provoking classes I have ever taken.  Prof McConnell is not the most interesting teacher but by the time you leave the class, you're sure to be a better writer.",1
"Attendance is mandatory. She'll take off points if you're tardy, miss class, or leave early. Her assignments are easy if you listen to her directions. She's strict, but it's only because she doesn't want students to take advantage/walk over her. If you want an A or a B in the class, you have to work for it. She wants you to be detail-oriented.",1
Good professor. Make sure to show up. Not to tough. A good class to take to complete MACRAO. I would recommend this prof. She knows her stuff and is helpful. The class is also easy. It teaches a lot about how humans communicate.,1
"He is hard, do not pick him.",0
Oh Deb fels. Turned my multimedia in business class into the depths of hell.  no. bueno. ,0
"He's a laid back guy with a lot of experience, which he is always willing to share. Don't be fooled though, the exams can be tough. Got a 99 on the first one, a 40 on the second. A reasonable class over all  - not an easy A, but it won't kill you either. He was very empathic about my second test grade and really encouraged me to work harder.",1
she is the best,1
"She is so bad. Doesn't teach you anything, if you don't know how to do makeup or sew youre on your own. You learn mostly through videos that are 15 + years old, and if you do something wrong its always your fault because you didn't pay attention. She treats her students like crap. If she continues to work here, the students will suffer even more.",0
he is sooo hott!!!!! ....his class was pretty fun considering it was jazz hist he's funny and really cool ..i definently recommend for everyone to take his class,1
"She is clear about the topic, but the homework is difficult. Gives a lot of homework. Is very strict on deadlines, and will not give a second opportunity. I have no desire to take her again. ",1
"Larry Miller, WOW. This was and is my favorite teacher I've ever had. I had him for BIO&241 and BIO&242. Begins class by asking if anyone has any questions and doesn't begin class until every question is answered. Actually gets back to you if he doesn't know the answer to one of your questions. If you actually want to learn, TAKE LARRY MILLER!",1
"Dr. Holtan is awesome! Super genuine and caring professor. There are a few quizzes, but other than that it is a partner presentation and an individual presentation. No final or midterm! She makes connections with her students and cares. Would recommend taking her!",1
"This professor is very helpful. If you have any problems, email her and she will get back with you very quickly. She is very understanding and is really on top of her work. She does have an accent, but she is easily understood. Stay on top of your work , and you will do fine. Wish I would've got an A, but oh well.",1
She's not a very helpful professor because she usually reads off the slides. Class is usually boring. Attendance is a must.,1
"The whole class is based on religion. Class is pointless just study before the exams. You only have 3 and its just two or three short essays (paragraphs), graded by TAs.",0
"Jose Juarez is a very great teacher. You can tell he cares for his students, and he will help you in any way possible.",1
"great teacher, great adjuster, Best Gonstead...",1
He is the man. I hate  math and i suck at retaining the information but in his class I enjoyed math and Got an A.  Take him if you care about getting your moneys wortth.,1
He puts all the readings and films you need for the class online for you. He assigns several articles or chapters from books that he expects you to read between classes. You also had to watch the film out of class. He is a tough grader for the quizzes but is not so tough with the papers which was a boost to my grade.,1
Helpful in and out of class. Uses clear concepts and good examples,1
"His tests are heavily conceptual and difficult but the course is difficult by nature. Quizzes have unlimited tries and in class assignments are graded based on effort, which makes it a great learning tool. Hard to get an A or even an A-, but a solid B is definitely possible.",1
"Very good professor. She knows what she's talking about and explains everything very clearly. The class was definitely harder than I thought it would be. She assigns a fairly heavy work load. You also need to go to class, pay attention, and read the book to do well. Her test questions are very clear and a study guide is provided before the test.",1
"For this specific course, he does not give partial marks, sometimes not at all. This will have a big impact on your exams unless you work extremely hard. He'll help you if you visit his office and tries to help his students, but don't take this specific course with him. Other courses, maybe, but not this one.",0
"Very passionate in her lectures! You need to purchase topHat. she takes attendances every class meeting, at the beginning and end of class. Lots of reading, homework is based on the readings. Midterm and Final are very similar to the homework. Do the homework and readings and you will pass. Reading are on blackboard.",1
"Unless you are majoring in philosophy, it is highly suggestive to not take this course. For a gen. ed req, the work is overpowering as well as difficult. Not everyone could grasp such concepts so easily, and she is very critical with her grading. Tries too hard to seem like a good prof. when half the class is complaining that they are failing. Sad.",0
"Really nice, extremely helpful and always had a lot to say. At the same time I didn't think the class really went deep into the literature we read. Then again it was only an Intro course. I wouldn't be opposed to taking her again.",1
Excellent teacher! She was wonderful. Extremely helpful. I took this class during the summer so it was slightly shorter than the fall semester. She was great at responding back to emails. A few times after class I would ask questions  and she was always willing to stay and answer. Highly recommend her. Wish she taught higher levels.,1
Do NOT take this Professor!!! He is passionless and does NOT teach well. You will sit for literally 2 hours in a ZOOM class and listen to the MOST boring lectures... on top of that he does NOT follow logic and is a VERY tough grader... he approaches religious teaching in a bizarre scientific or philosophical way and not how it actually is...,0
"Professor Alse is easy to understand, but gets a little too excited and jumbled things. His homework is really helpful for the test. This class is hard though, so don't brush it off.",1
"His class helped extend my knowledge of Calculus. Even though he has an accent, I had no trouble understanding him. He's clearly very knowledgeable about the subject and able to explain it clearly. He went over all the homework and explained any problems students had difficulty with. He also told us what we needed to study to do well on tests.",1
"Doesn't help you learn the material, she just teaches it one day and moves on to next lesson. YouTube and math lab was the closest thing to really understanding the material. Doesnt have extra credit and doesnt allow make ups on quizzes.",0
Recommend him for this class if you want an A to boost GPA. I took him online. Homework that you get 100% for completion and then online test with no time limit. A few discussions but not a tough grader.,1
"Amazing calculus teacher. Honestly, you couldn't hope for a better one. She's enthusiastic about the content, accessible for extra help, and clear and concise during lecture. The only thing that I thought was funny was that she put a lot of emphasis on the correct use of symbols and names when grading.",1
"I definitely recommend this class and professor. Everything we learned was super interesting, and Prof. Haldane did not overwhelm you with information. She really just wants you to understand general concepts. Some of the readings were kind of long (2 full books), but they were not boring and I enjoyed them.",1
"I took this class online and it was the easiest math class I have taken to date. The way she set up the course was very efficient and helpful. All the quizzes and tests were at home and gave me a chance to practice for the midterm and final, both of which she gave a study guide for that was very thorough. I would definitely take her again.",1
"May seem like a tough class at the start and his teaching style might catch you off guard, but you just gotta actually do the work and read the book! Up until this class, I was skating by giving about 60 percent, but here you gotta give 100, and the Dr. will be more than fair with you if you're honestly trying and STUDYING. Great night course prof.",1
"She is a TOUGH COOKIE! This class is hard if you don't put in your all. If you want to pass this class with an A, I recommend doing everything she tells you to do. She will try to intimidate you by picking on you and blast you with tons of questions. Believe me, when I tell you to study, study, study! Good Luck!",1
nice guy. lovehis class.,1
Very boring lectures even though the prof is nice. It is fairly easy to pass her classes because the exams are all projects. Attendance is mandatory (she makes us sign a paper at the end of the class) but I've worked on other projects in her class while she was talking. Easy A but boring.,0
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
Upper lvl philosophy. Hard. Seemed like the people who really got into it were those more naturally inclined to the subject. First time I wanted to stab my skull with an icepick during class. Prof. loves his stuff so that makes learning easier. You earn your grade. Not hot (not ugly)- some people must be  smoking here.,1
"The exams are all multiple choice, and they are the hardest exams in comparison to the other orgo professors. That being said, expect a fat curve at the end 10% for F2020. If you want to learn, take another professor. if you want to get a good grade in orgo, take jasmin!",0
"Veryyy good professor, he is clear and helps his students alot. A Good man.",1
"Dr. Wooten is my all time favorite prof. This isnt an easy A, but its attainable. Hes really organized and lays out everything you need to do in order to succeed. If youre having any trouble, just stop by office hours and hes more than happy to help. Makes lectures super interesting and fun as well. Wish I could take more classes with him",1
"Dr. Staples is an excellent and passionate Instructor. He makes complex elements understandable. Test are tough, but uses homework and online quizzes to prepare you for tests. Labs are tough and time consuming so take the lab after the Lecture so you won't be rushed. Strong Lab partners are a must. Take advantage of extra credit opportunities.",1
"Mrs. Romani was great! I had her for CPR. She doesn't waste time and gets right down to the skills. Plenty of time to practice. It was actually a fun course! Man, she knows her stuff too. Take her for the weekend CPR class.",1
"Took an online health science class. Easiest college course ever. Easy work, there's not even HW every week. Like a previous comment said, though, she's a ghost. Modules get open late, takes forever to grade (no wonder, she's apparently teaching so many things at once!), rarely replies to emails, and if so, way late. At least it was super easy!",1
No Comments,1
"Best professor hands down. He's one of those awesome professors you see in movies and wish you had. I took a 5 hour summer class with him, it flew by, surprisingly enjoyed it as well",1
"Awful grader. Takes off points for not doing it exactly as he instructs although you understand the problems and your work is in general correct. Don't take him, he will ruin your GPA. If you want to have a good experience at SMC with math professor you need to join the scholars program, otherwise you'll get professors like Mr. Konya. Unfortunately",0
"One of my least favorite professors Ive ever had at UWT and Ive been there for 5 years... Shes all over the place and is NOT accommodating to students that havent taken a political science class before. Way too goofy and unprofessional, and her assignments sheets NEVER match the online instructions or syllabus. This class was miserable.",0
"One of my favorite UNI professors. She is darn well organized, flexible, very personable and approachable. Whenever I ask questions, she is patient and explains things many different ways.",1
"i don't know what the student a couple posts down is talking about. i had smith online and he always had stuff graded the next day. hes not a pushover, though, this is college --- even called me from his office on a sunday afternoon to help with a problem -- I also tok this from out of state -- no problems",1
great prof but a wassssssssssstteeeeeeeeeeeeee class,1
Just dont do it to yourself.,0
Hes super awesome and easy to contact and to get criticism on the assignments but he is big on being on time for the podcasts and the posts and is key on the schedule of these assignments if you can keep up with them then hes super easy to pass,1
"Had him for freshman year seminar. His choice of books were really interesting, he didnt disappoint, and he always started by asking us a questions which ended up being the funniest way to start class. He is kind, give leniency when needed, and is very helpful. Honestly he is the best professor and mentor.",1
"One of my favorite classes. He is helpful, but you do need to study vocabulary a lot, as well as practice outside of class.",1
"I took Trig/Pre-Cal in high school and it was 1,000 times easier.  She teaches straight out of the book and that is not how I learn.  She's a cool person and she memorizes everyones name but that doesn't help on the tests.  This class is an easy A when taught right.",1
Great class. Interesting and topical. Attendance and Participation matter - great professor. Responds quickly to email. Cares.,1
Goes through slides way too fast for those of us that don't think in math. Comes across arrogant - isn't approachable. Doesn't triangulate book's explanation (especially at the end of the course when he's the author). Expects you to learn software ~and~ scripting/formatting software on your own WHILE learning the actual course.,0
"Not a hard course, just very time-consuming to learn material thoroughly - and you WILL need to do that if you want to do v. well on testsexam since they are v. nitpicky. You will need to utilize all the effective learningstudying strategies you know. I would take again if I didn't nearly burn myself out to get my grade. ",1
"Shes pretty nice and I understood alot of the things, but when it came to certain types of science she just wasn't very clear about it. The workload can get too heavy soemtimes.",0
"Great professor! Uses her family as an example of the benefits of bilingualism. She uses different methods to teach. If you ever have a question, feel free to ask, she's very helpful and nice. She engages in a lot of class discussions that help students understand the material. Overall, GREAT teacher!",1
A lot of material needed to remember for tests. Quite specific and a lot of weird names of sites and types of people and time periods you have to remember. Was a difficult course for me.,0
"It honestly is an awesome class, and there's no one I'd rather have as a teacher. Yes, there are quite a few readings, but they are easy to keep up with if you space them out enough. Studying for quizzes and tests is more complex, but it is a positive experience learning how to.",1
"Professor Bello is very nice and will help in anyway possible, she will even call you if she thinks you need to do better. Class is easy if you do the work, I had her half online half in class. All the tests are online which means open book but if you don't read beforehand they will be difficult. Very long tests",1
Dude is a rock star.,1
"she's a nice prof that knows her stuff. her teaching style really let's you learn the material. don't come in expecting to not take the class seriously, but she'll always help you if you need it. tough but fair grader. those that think she's bad just don't read and complain.",1
Heavy accent. Prepares nothing. Does everything off the top of his head. Loosely follows the course syllabus. Comes into class exactly on time or a couple minutes late. Weird sense of humor and laugh you will grow to love (or hate). Classwork rarely reflects homework. I would skip lectures but attendance is taken like 4 times throughout the course.,1
"HE SUCKS! he's very unreachable and always cancels classes, which would seem great ... but not when it happens every other week. he is LAZY and very unhelpful. it is horrible that he is the only professor who teaches fiction at FSU. he should be sacked. immediately.",1
"She's a very timid professor who knows a ton about British literature. Her (rare) exams aren't too hard, but she grades tough on papers, so be prepared to put a lot of work into them. The reading you have to do isn't terrible, but her lectures are boring. Take her for a nice challenge.",1
"she's really easy going, fun teacher, nice class. her marking is lenient too. go for it!",1
"She makes me believe in a better world. Granted, I am an ENS major, but Dr Farris is my heart and soul. SHe will accomodate you and lets you have up to 5 unexcused abscenses. Easy A if you put in the work. AMazing woman.",1
"I honestly don't know if she's a good teacher or not. She was extremely late giving back work and grading assignments and didn't respond well to inquiries regarding assignments. Additionally, none of the dates or assignment values matched when looking at the syllabus versus the actual assignments. Really disappointed.",0
"he is probably the best lab teacher you could get. all these other ratings are completely accurate too. makes the class as funny as poosible, and also he has the best drawings. 3 tests/2 you can use cheat sheets and an extra credit project. very good. deff. take him!!!",1
"Dr. Zhao is an awesome professor. He states what will be on the tests and doesn't add any unnecessary fluff into the lecture. He posts really simple study guides for each test and if you do them, you shouldn't get anything below a B- on an exam. Exams are straight forward and relatively easy. He makes chem awesome after organic. Lots of online HW",1
"Professor is extremly knowledgeable. However, it is difficult to ignore his arrogance/attitude. Calls on you to share your opinion, then proceeds to cut you off and not finish your thought while telling you your opinion is wrong. Learned alot in the course but couldn't stand the professor.",0
No Comments,1
"Professor Marchetti Is a great teacher who will always help make sure you do well if you go to her. She will answer your questions. Homework is a must in this class to do well. If you are thinking of being either a chem major or pre-med, she is the best teacher to have!",1
"Awesome professor who wants students to succeed she is super nice. As long as you do Homework and Quizzes you should pass the class. The only exams are midterm and final, as long as you study you should be able to pass with an A. I studying at least a week in advance.",1
Very easy class,1
Not the best professor. if you don't have the same opinion be prepared not to do well on tests.,0
"She was an awesome instructor. Loved talking about feminism in class. Do everything to the best of your ability, and you'll get a good grade. She offers extra credit as well. I took her for 1013 and 1023 (Freshman Comp 1 & 2) Got a A both times.",1
"Baughman is the open secret of Bates. Here's what you need to get an A: 1) Attend classes, 2) Have a pulse. He's a very easy grader and the class just isn't that hard. He's perfectly nice and willing to help you out if you need. He's probably more engaging when teaching his area of research. But if you want to chill for a semester, sign up.",1
"No study guides, likes to trick students on tests. No extra credit, doesn't care if you learn or not. Bad accent and hates it when you don't understand what he is saying. Do not take him!!!! Nightmare!",0
I took Dr. Nicastro for a class about Science and Religion he was a great prof. He definitely knows whats he's talking about. He has strong beliefs but is very educated in the subject matter so has a right to have them.,1
"Pillai is a great professor who is very intelligent about French and French culture. I think if you understand the language she likes you, but she easily gets annoyed with her students and expects people to speak fluently. It seems she forgets we are students learning the language. Homework wasn't too bad, but she is a very critical grader.",1
"Professor Kelm might be the best professor at CLU and definitely the coolest! Took him for Spanish too and he helped me so much! I got a B+ and really didn't do a whole lot to earn it. He is incredibly accessible if you need him, fun and friendly, and if you want to learn he will go out of his way to teach you. Don't take anybody else for Spanish 2",1
"I absolutely loved this class! I was pretty nervous when I found out I had to take speech, but Mrs. McNiel makes you feel so comfortable when giving speeches. She's always there to help you and class was never boring because she was always cracking jokes. She is the absolute sweetest and has really helped me become a better speaker.",1
"ASPN 322 (originally upper 400 level) is a very tough yet intriguing course. Although taught completely in Spanish, Professor Correa does a fantastic job of portraying the ideas and concepts of the course in a way that is understandable. Of course must be supplemented with outside work as all classes need. But if you work hard you will do well.",1
"Has open book tests. One written assignment. Field trip to a jail. His class is very easy to pass.Can get a little boring sometimes but it was a 2 and a half hour class. He's pretty laid back, makes jokes every once in awhile. Worth taking",1
"She is great! Really nice and she does care a lot about her students. I took her during Covid season and she was a really understanding during these tough times. Gave us the options to really accommodate each student with independent needs. Overall, a great professor!",1
"Dr. R cares about her students and is passionate about teaching. The class overall was well laid out and easy to follow. I took her for an online class and the tests were online and all essays. They were slightly challenging and you had to know your information, but if you try, she is an understanding grader. She is a solid choice.",1
Took the online course. VERY unclear with directions and assignments. Grade is based on 3 online exams and participations in weekly discussions. Never answers e-mail questions. If you read and teach yourself from the textbook it is an easy course but if you are not self-disciplined do not take his online course.,0
"I am currently taking her lab and she is very nice, explains everything clearly and makes organic chem understandable. There are no lab reports just a lab notebook.",1
"Dr. Keeling tends to set a lot of homework, however, he doesn't really give meaningful feedback. Furthermore, he is pretty passive aggressive and very strict when it comes to his criteria. As long as you don't turn anything in late or walk into class late, you'll be fine.",0
"Hands down the best professor I've had at Davis. I was really intimidated by the course at first, but Professor Schore gives you so many resources and is so clear during lecture. Also the curve is insane.",1
"I had Professor Steiner in my first semester of college (Fall 2019.) She has by far been the BEST math teacher or professor I've had this far. She is available all the time, being in her class you can truly tell that she genuinely wants her students to learn and succeed. I actually miss going to her class. I'm confident in my math skills now.",1
"One of the better teachers I've had in college.  Very entertaining, and gets you interested in learning the subject.  Pretty nice, funny, and makes you feel comfortable to ask questions, and for help.  I'd take him again if I could.",1
MAN BEST ENGLISH PROFESSOR HERE. VENUS DO NOT CARE AS LONG AS YOU DO YOUR WORK. THERE ARE REALLY NO DUE DATES UNLESS HE CHANGE THEM BUT OVERALL GREAT PROFESSOR. HE TALKS ABOUT HIS SON A LOT SO THAT IS REALLY IT.,1
"Amazing professor. Make sure to do all the reading and take notes during the lectures. The individual portion of the main group project for the class I took (ARTH 2753) was very stressful and difficult, but if you seek the right guidance and work hard in the class its possible to get an A. Great lecturer and great course!",1
"I hope that someone reports this guy, he shouldn't be aloud to teach with the way he talk to his students.",0
It's hard to put a bad rating for this professor because he cares and could potentially bring so much to the class with life experiences. Although he didn't really teach and thinks all problems are trivial for a first time dynamics student. Multiple choice tests are lazy and unfair in my eyes for an engineering student. Don't expect it to change,0
"Professor Couch was a really nice lady, this is basically the dream English class if you're decent/mediocre at writing. Ask questions if you are unclear about something, she is easy to talk to.",1
Fun interesting class. Very helpful teacher. He likes for you to participate. If you have the chance take him. Made reading literature and poems interesting.,1
He's knowledgable about the subject. Would help if he's more There's a lot of homework and lab work but they are beneficial.,1
Gotta love it! WHOO!!!!,1
I absolutely loved this astronomy class and am honestly a little sad it is over. You can tell that Professor Chase is passionate about physics and astronomy and he is a fabulous teacher. I would definitely recommend taking his class.,1
"One of my favorite professors at Duke and definitely the best class I have taken so far (Business in the Francophone World). Deb puts a lot of work into her lesson plans and it shows, as we're constantly learning and doing different activities that aid in us learning more about the topics we're studying. I was actually sad to have the class end.",1
"Few but important assignments. He goes over the homework in class very often, and would also often give away parts of the solution to the said homework. From the hints, one can often use it as a template and easily complete other parts of the homework. The final three assignments build on top of each other, would give excellent feedback if asked.",1
"By far my favorite Professor. Its like she actually wants to see each of her students succeed. If you have a question on the lecture, shell go out her way to find a day and time that works for you to help. The class itself is a bit difficult, but she held q&a sessions and really explained everything clearly to ensure we understood. Love her!!",1
"I like'em, he's obviously nice. Pretty cool, BUT he's inconsistant. He makes somethings seem important, then forgets what he said. His syllabus isn't always accurate. Some of the listed supplies weren't necessary, and other neccessary ones weren't listed. The jury's still out on this guy. I still think he can teach me alot. It's just aggravating at times.",1
"Dr. Clark is AMAZING, I took her for Appalachian Poetry and Prose which counts as a literature credit. The class was really interesting, no textbook needed but there are several novels that you will need to read to pass the class. Gives extra credit on each quiz, and the quizzes are all online and you can use your notes and the novel to complete.",1
It was a lot of fun in her class. I learned a lot and would love to have her as my teacher again.,1
"Organic is hard as it is, but she believes if you do not do good on her stuff that you will fail at your major and you need to change it.  She's not very inspirational.  Her test go from easy to hard.  Her grading system is very helpful and if you're good at chemistry she will be your bestfriend.",1
Take it. OMG I have such a hard time staying awake in class but online I understand things a whole lot more. Not only because it seemed to go my pace but because if I had an issue with a problem I could not solve I would add it to the discussion board and then as a class everyone would help solve it. I learned a lot no lie.,1
She is very nice and helpful if you ask for it. There are weekly quizzes from the material from the previous week. The tests are tough!! Not a class you study for the night before. There is 1 paper and a group project that weren't too bad. She gives extra credit but it's not a lot. If you don't do the readings you won't do well.,1
The Sweetest professor ever. She is super helpful and nice and wants to help you. She makes class really interesting with videos and different handouts. There's rarely any written homework besides weekly journals and occasional crossword puzzle. The class is completely manageable and she makes it fun to go to.,1
"Doctor Mavica is a beautiful middle of the road, neither strict nor lenient. She requires attendance and some participation, but she talks about information thats not exactly necessary but is interesting and pertinent. She cares for each of her students and is relatable. If you dont like profs that can get off topic, she may not be for you.",1
"Very educated in the field she teaching in, which helped us understand more clearly and get higher grades. Had her in my Inro To Business, she had an outstanding ability to explain. She's helpful and entertaining.",1
"Professor Sumi is fine if you already know the course material going in. If, however, you have questions or dont understand something going on Sumi becomes openly hostile. She also goes off topic a lot and tends to wander. I was not impressed.",0
"She's very kind. This class is an easy A. Though her lectures are a little dull and  unorganized, bear with it (or just take her online class) and you'll get an A. Do the readings, quizzes, discussions and you're good. ",1
Stewart is a great professor! His humor and lecture style makes a dry subject enjoyable and he's happy to meet outside of his office hours. The exams are difficult but if you study you'll be fine.,1
"Great person but terrible professor. Just comes to class and writes proofs on the board straight from the book, doesn't really care for developing intuition and big-picture understanding. Very fast-paced: it feels like she only teaches for the top 10% of the class. The class has no TA, no practice exams, no additional resources. Duke Math is evil.",0
"Professor Nearing is a great. I took her online and it was easy she gives you the work for the whole semester and all you have to do is 3 fireworks assignments out of the book and a 8 page website from dreamweaver that you have to come up with, also the final exam is very easy 100 questions",1
"Although I enjoy writing, I tend to doubt my abilities. This course being an upper division writing course made me anxious. Dr. Lorimer's syllabus was clear from the start of the quarter. She is direct with her expectations, but is also clear that she wants each student to be successful. You are expected to write at a high level. Use the resources.",1
"Good Prof, great course",1
"Dom was AWESOME!!!  He was very Helpful, Understanding, respectful and Fun. Easily my favorite Instructor/courses.",1
"I barely passed this class. As it was a weed out course, it was the most difficult class I have ever taken... and I'm close to graduating. Despite the fact that the class is extremely difficult and feels nearly impossible to pass, he is the nicest, most approachable guy ever! Go to his office hours, get to know him... he will help you immensely.",1
Of his 5 exams expect to spend 5 hours on each exam. Be happy if you get a 50% on the exam because that wont happen very often. Your grade is weighed 90% on the 5 exams and you will not remember anything from this class when your done. Dustin is nice and can teach but nothing that he teaches will resemble that which will be on the exam,0
"Took this class online from out of state.  EXCELLENT communication; emails promptly answered; heavy use of multimedia-  GREAT COURSE.  I thought it was going to be another plug-and-chug online course: boy, was I wrong!!!",1
Im glad this class was moved online because if I had to see him yawn back a students when they yawn one more time I would have shot myself in the foot. But he was a good teacher he will literally tell you whats on the test so if you pay attention in class and study youll be fine. But he does do a 7 point grading scale so a 93 is the lowest A.,1
"She is sweet, funny, and strict at times; well tries to be. You must listen and engage because participation is huge. She grades harder than the topic teacher although Her feedback is kind of vague, so talk to her during office hours to clarify her grading. Dont go to class late. Dont talk too much. Do your homework, its easy.",1
"Simple straight forward class, took it online. Please do not complain and cry about how many assignments are due. It's a very short online class, 20 assignments altogether - 3 exams (with reviews) you can easily pass them if you do the reviews, the other 17 things to do are simple. Easy A",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS UNLESS YOU WANT SEVERAL MENTAL BREAKDOWNS!!! I BARELY passed. If you take this class you will be asking for 8 to 24 pages of notes every week, so beware of developing carpal tunnel! Also the mastering biology is HUNDREDS of questions.... the only good part of her class were the labs and those barely affect your grade..",0
"Professor Richards is one of the best professors I've had at Dixie. Accounting doesn't come easy for me and he really helps to make sure you not only pass the class but understand what he is teaching. There is quite a lot of homework, but he gives you full credit if you put in 100% of your effort into it. Also a really cool guy.",1
Professor vavova is a really good philosophy professor. She hears your voice in the discussion and inspires you all the time. Outside class she is willing to make time to discuss philosophical ideas with you. You can always find time to talk to her about your papers or class readings. She grades tough though but you can learn a lot in her course.,1
"Took him for animal science, awesome instructor, very knowledgeable and funny. Kept lectures interesting.",1
"I learned so much in her class, she will help you out as much as you want- you just have to ask her.  She is an awesome teacher and really nice person, her expectations are high, but not unreasonably.",1
"This professor is really good she knows what she is teaching, we do a lot of quiz and exams on each chapter. She is also funny, caring and respectful",1
"Susan is an outstanding professor. I was intimated of taking stats and seeking help. Having a learning disability makes things rough. However, Susan was always clear and kind towards me when I didn't understanding a particular lecture. Clear grading criteria. Test heavy and homework almost every week. In other words if I can pass so can you. Work!",1
"Easily one of the best (ILR) professors out there. The way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations, and instead, requires you to critically think and understand data. He's exceptionally smart, but very approachable. Tests are fair, but can be tricky; grades are curved at the end.",1
"Multicultural Literature for Youth: Mary was exceptional! She is very passionate about her subject and it shows in her teaching! She cares about everyone. Go to class and read all of the books, make sure to keep up with the reading responses! There are a few projects to do, but they are easy as long as you put the work into them! Mary's the best!",1
"Dr. Schellhorn definitely cares about her students, and she helped me with some confusions during office hours. However, I think that something she could have done better is making the material more interesting, and conveying it in such a way that students can understand. She is helpful one-on-one, but her lectures can be hard to follow.",1
"You will read a lot. You will write a lot. You will LEARN a lot. A fantastic professor. Made class fun. GO TO CLASS! You will miss important information if you don't. Also, make sure to get every textbook. They are used, heavily.  -Took Contemporary Feminist Political Theory",1
Take Mr. Lockhart's class!!! You won't regret it. Very helpful and he is sooo nice. If you miss an online quiz he'll reset whatever you need to be reset. Very understanding and caring of his students. ,1
If you take this course be ready to spend time on it.,1
"His lectures were pointless and he would often ramble, but I went to every one because his clicker points are extra credit. Other than that your only grades are 3 super hard tests. I thought this would be an easy natural science, and I was so wrong. He can be pretty funny, but it's not so funny when you're borderline failing cause he doesn't teach.",0
Awesome guy,1
"She is just amazing. Her instructions are clear, and concise. She knows her subject well. I truly enjoyed her class. I never wanted to miss class with her. Great professor.",1
"The class is tough, but he explains it in an easier way than the book.  He'll answer your questions if you ask, and is fair.",1
"Had her for litho, then I had Brian and learned how to do litho.  She didn't teach us things, like how to scrape the rollers, and what the chemistry of litho is... basically came out with an idea of the medium but not any proficiency.  not recommended.",0
"Nice, very helpful, gives lots of bonus points.",1
Lecture heavy but if youre taking her online then I dont recommend. I felt like I learned little to nothing from her lectures she would post as videos.,1
"She is a very nice teacher and I think she does care about the students in her class. But she doesn't go over the material well enough in class. She always lets us out early, which to some of u might be a good thing but when u are trying to learn about managerial accounting and she keeps letting you go early all the time, well thats not too good. H",1
"I heard good things about Raphael before taking Con Law with him this semester... but have not experienced said good things. Probably my least favorite professor I've had; cold calls about things outside of the case (American history questions, for example), lectures without much discussion, and seems like he enjoys catching students off guard.",0
"Sometimes politically incorrectmisinformed and was condescending and one-sided towards some cultures, despite this being a class about ethnicity- you'll see what I mean. The tests and notes were so scattered, making it hard to study. Shows movies that I felt had little relevance to the larger topics.",0
"Spaced out is an understatement.  The woman did not know my name until the semester was over, plus I was able to correct her too many times.  In addition, I received the wrong grade at the end of the semester and had to have it changed.  A softie yes, but also out ot lunch.",0
Not present for a lot of the course.  Students left to figure it out on their own.  Forums not working when an assignments were due.  Discrepancies throughout the course material. Didn't grade most things until the very end of the course. Rude and condescending when contacted about these issues.  Glad this class is over.,0
"I don't know to make of this woman. Usually a very easy grader. Cancels Friday classes more often than not (no joke.) Seems to not expect too much from us, not very challenging at all, supportive comments even when the work is lack-luster. Will talk to you one-on-one and help if needed.",1
"Just like any other English classes, theres a lot of writings. Research paper is you final exam, but she helps you to prepare for it throughout the semester. You have to watch some tv shows and read a story for this class, but I didnt have to pay for those. Youll be able to find it online. She gave us one extra credit opportunity.",1
Blanton is super boring. He is a nice person but a horrible professor. He will try to make jokes; you will not laugh. Half the class is spent on him trying to figure out the computer. Not the worst class but you must be disciplined; it's easy to fall asleep.,0

"Awesome teacher, always prepared and always something new.  She really goes all out for every class, with examples of great artists and is always nice to have an instructor who is also still working on her own art work.  She is so current!",1

"Honestly, a super smart guy, knows so much about languages but sometimes forgets to simplify things. Always down to help, a little all over the place. Kinda clumsy. Gives enough practice in class that I hardly have to study outside of class. You have like 5 homework assignments the whole year",1
We wrote about 5 essays all semester and I got an A on all of them. Very easy grader. She is a very nice woman. Our final was a 10 page paper which we worked on after Thanksgiving. Easy A.,1
"I loved Michelfelder!!  Her lectures are long, but also VERY HELPFUL, you have to write a lot but she makes tests directly from the notes. She helps students when you ask and is not intimidating at all so don't be afraid to ask for help. Gave a couple opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester  would totally take a class of hers again",1
"This professor likes to point out the ""appalling propaganda"" from movies and groups that promote conservative ideas like capitalism... but fails to include analysis of propaganda from the liberal political ideologies. Sure she's inspiring - if you like being spoon fed political indoctrination.",0
"Grace was really very understanding about my incomplete. I found her to be a competent and personable teacher who is really invested in the success of her students. The books weren't my style, but others in my class enjoyed them very much.",1
"One of the best professors at CCSU. She is hilarious, smart, witty, and a breath of fresh air. She gets your mind thinking outside of the box and places high importance on each student finding their own way and expandig their writing capabilities. Tough grader but so worth it!",1
"Mr. Kanetis is the best. He's hilarious and really easy to get along with. If you show up, pay attention and participate, it's an easy A. I highly recommend taking him.",1
"Cute, fun, and quirky. She makes math fun and accessible to all. Would recommend",1
"hehe, she was pretty cute at that. Also, she taught well, and graded fairly. That class was a pleasant experience.",1
"I pay the University to learn physics but in return i end up teaching myself. The only time u will be taught by him is if youre lucky enough to be inhis group (which he changes every 3 weeks ) , his TA sucks and confuses everyone and no one gives you a straight up answer . its frustrating to be in a class where its all a guessing game.",0
"The first and most important thing is DO THE HOMEWORK!! His quizzes are literally from the homework and the tests are modified homework stuffs. Do you homework guys. His lectures are fine, but you have to be there to understand the materials. Other than that, he's fair. Very fair. Gradewise, personality-wise, and otherwise.",1
"If you are new to networking, or old to networking, take this guy, he makes learning a fun. Best instructor ever!",1
You use the textbook a lot! Teacher does not put in as much effort as the students. Teacher uses the excuse of forgetting to grade assignments or is busy. The syllabus is outdated along with written assignment requirements. It is the last week of the semester and this class is still waiting for feedback on their final assignment.,0
"She is one of those teachers that has a very specific group of people that are her little ""stars"" and who are so great in her eyes that she does not give the other more quiet students a chance. At the beginning of class she says ""Alright, so what's going on?"" and the few students that talk a lot will talk to her for 30 mins and waste class time.",0
"I really enjoyed Lyons, she was passionate about the subject and liked to add little jokes in as she taught. The course was very lecture-heavy and if you don't take notes and study hard for the exams, you WILL struggle. The lab material was easy and relevant. It's in your best interest not to skip this class.",1
Hes always late but hes a nice teacher. He mostly does problems on the board hardly used the book.,1
Great professor! It is clear that he enjoys the subject matter.,1
"Excellent instructor, works with you, - answers your questions clearly, casual, one of the best in the CompSci depart at IRSC.",1
"I took the 8-week online course and wow. If you don't pick up concepts quickly or if math does not come easy for you, I suggest taking the full semester or another professor. There were no lectures, just textbook and videos from the textbook/WebAssign. The amount of homework was almost comical, totaling close to 1000 math problems for 8 weeks.",0
"Don't ask questions unless you like looking stupid in public and being mocked.  His examples in class are all explained in the text making attendance pointless, but he grades on it.   The online homework bites, and his hints don't help.",0
I do not know where to began because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps and can't teach.,0
"He is extremely eccentric, but he really is quite brilliant. There is a lot to learn from him if you're willing.",1
"Took her interpersonal communications class and it was pretty fun. She's hilarious and her stories are great. Make sure you participate in discussions and do the reading and you should be fine. Overall, not too hard. ",1
"Best prof ever! He makes a difficult subject understandable, and his lectures are funny and entertaining. No penalty for missing class, but you won't want to!",1
"Ryan is hilarious, caring, and knowledgeable. He does many things to ensure as many students pass as possible. But he seems to cover advanced topics for a course with no prerequisites, and his explanations are rapid and lack clarity. I suspect he's over teaching this class. The open note tests are the hardest I've taken ever, & I used every minute.",1
She will explain everything and easy and nice way. I love her and believe me you will enjoy her class.,0
"Professor Miller is a fantastic professor. Although his class is hard, you must keep up and READ THE MATERIAL. But all in all, you will learn and appreciate him so much. If you have a problem and you ask about it, he'll give you one on one assistance. Signed up to take A&P 2 with him, fantastic teacher, really.",1
"I don't understand how people think this class is easy, I went to every class, studied notes and took his advice on how to study and still had a very hard time in this class.  The exams are strange, the multiple choice and true and false are very difficult and confusing but the math is pretty simple.  He's very nice but the exams are just brutal.",1
Great teacher if you study for all the exams you will do fine gives practice quizzes that are almost identical to the tests. Curves grades at the end by half a letter,1
Do not let these negative comments fool you. Dr Mavica is awesome! Do the simple(sometimes long) homework and take notes and you will be fine. The class is straightforward and quite simple honestly. I am surprised to see these negative comments as she provides the tools to receive an A in her course and she truly cares. Take her class.,1
"Professor Crane is Awesome. extremely easy class. only assignments you get all year are three papers that are assigned at the beginning of the year and due at the end of the semester, on any topic you choose. Her exams are short and clear cut. she basically hands you an A. I would take this class over again, or at least another class with her. ",1
"Serge Jasmin is a good guy its that other guy names organic chemistry that sucks. I'm not gonna lie he has trouble finishing his sentences and has accent so its sometime hard to follow, oh yeah and he gets mad when you ask questions and tells you too look at the stuff he posted on canvas as his answer. Grading isn't too bad since he curves.",0
"You only have to show up, and have the textbook, he is very funny...  -Only the final Exam Counts, but do the homework, it would help if you got a bad grade in the Final.",1
"Zarb is a friendly guy, but I don't care for how he'll spend the whole hour going over our homework.  Makes the hour go by very slowly.",1
"I've had Mr Hsu for computer organization, computer science 3, and data structures. He's a very good teacher and will work with you. But the subject material is sometimes not easy and left up to you to study and do well. Other than that , stay up to date with blackboard and do the labs an projects most exams are similar to projects.",1
"Not sure if it is the online format, but from what I hear from past students nothing has changed. Grading is terrible, this guy is arrogant and condescending. Please save your money and stress on another professor. Ignore old reviews, I am sorry but I do not think he should be teaching anymore.",0
"Jill is an awesome and FUN teacher! Extremely helpful, understands, patient with students and many more qualities to mention as a teacher of nursing 115. She makes class fun with latest tech. uses, encourages ALL students and is fair! I'd would schedule her class first and others around the nursing 115.",1
"What? I don't understand where the complaints are coming from. Took her for physiology and anatomy, A in both classes. True she can jump around a bit but she knows her stuff and gives you a really good idea of what will be on her exams. OK, not super easy but most of the people that take her classes are hoping to work in the medical field. Right?",1
"Dewald was really boring but really easy....he doesnt use a textbook just literature...which you do not need to buy...incredibly easy, seems like a good guy, my TA was horrible though....easy A",1
"Outstanding math teacher. Very knowledgeable, willing to help, and explains concepts with great clarity. I took this class after taking Calculus so it wasn't much of a challenge, but she kept my interest by using real world application of stats.",1
"I studied every day for this course and got deducted points for saying too much. I got an 85% avg mark for the lab portion with the lab instructors marking-which is all based off short answer but could only get no higher than a 71 for his exams. Super unfair prof, hes a nice guy but I would not recommend him to anyone.",0
No Comments,1
"Great professor and who is interested in helping students succeed and improve their writing. Her class requires effort, but she is always willing to help you out in office hours. She knows about the legal profession as her husband is a lawyer and knows the importance of clarity in legal writing. If you are considering law school TAKE THIS CLASS!!",1
I see it's been a while since anyone has commented. Well allow me to update you all. Not much has changed. She teaches a 3000 level class like it's graduate school. Expectations are beyond ridiculous! I am very opinionated and she did not like that at all. Her being a scholar has really gotten to her head and she is overly cynical. Do not take her!,0
No Comments,1
"Show up to class, ask questions, and if you need her to be in the math lab she will go and help you! Make sure you study. As long as you do the work and show up you'll be ok. She offers retests and gives take home quizzes. Not the worst teacher like many people say. You need the textbook for hw.",1
"Her class is pretty straight forward.  However, she gave me a B in the class when I had a B+ average...didn't that was right.",1
"At first, the lectures are intimidating as you try to keep pace w/ Prof. Raphael's chatter.  Moreover, Prof. Rapheal asks questions that are easy to catch students off guard.  His attempts at humor are awkward but all in good fun.  Not exactly receptive to questions but a nice guy nonetheless. Exam was fair, if not easy and straightforward.",1
"Best English Teacher ever!! She will work with you and help you. She grades fairly and honestly. Sweetest person ever.!! Also, you will learn a lot from her. From her teaching style to how to write properly she's the best.",1
"She was my professor in the PCCC nursing program, lecture and clinical. She is very clear with her lectures and organized. Great for clinical as well, I learned so much from her.",1
AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS,0
"This is a great class. When I took physics in high school, I did not enjoy it, nor did I do well in it until the very end. In his class, he explained the subjects well and made it interesting. I really enjoyed his class, and I can apply physics to my daily life because of it.",1
"Great prof. Very nice woman, helpful with assignments, schedules individual conferences with you to discuss your story. Little reading, just writing and workshopping short stores. Easy if you are willing to do the work and are interested in writing and critiquing fiction.",1
"THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN, ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE IT. Exams and quizzes are based on text book, (AND THE WRONG ONE, TOO), BORING, and he doesn't help WHATSOEVER. I knew everything in the class prior to this course, and I cannot even believe how terrible the experience was. HORRIBLE. He takes too long to respond too. STAY AWAY",0
"A very difficult class to do. I took her online so I didn't get to meet her in person. She was a very difficult grader and had very unclear instructions on her assignments. She has a lot of work for you to do, and I honestly would not recommend her unless you like difficult classes. A lot of the highest scores for assignments weren't even 100%.",0
His way or the highway.  Not my way.,0
"Dr. Holtan is an engaging, fun professor who still manages to pass on relevant information. I recommend any of her classes.",1
one of the best teachers that i have.,1
"I dreaded this class initially because I don't like reading. BUT Professor Favara is an INCREDIBLE woman. She made every lecture exciting and really knew how to engage the class. She is truly a one of a kind educator, and cares so much for her students (""humans"" she calls us). You are in very good hands if you take a class with her as your teacher",1
"Her class is very easy, for me sociology is interesting, she allows the students to share their opinions and she makes her points very clear, she does not read from the power point she knows this stuff already, her tests are extremely easy if you study the review and some of the notes, she grades fairly, I do not regret taking her class, do not let other comments judge the way she teaches each one of us are different and have different ways of learning.",1
"Had him for Manegerial Accounting. Easy class, honestly only went for the quizzes and midterms. Do the assigned problems he gives you for a good mark. When I went to class he seemed to be very nice to students, and explained things well. He also answers emails very quickly which I think is important. Highly recomend him.",1
"Note: He's semi-retired, only teaches part-time now.  Definitely the best Psych teacher I've ever had. Stars every class with 'joke of the day' (always corny ones), very succinct and straightforward in lectures. Tests are easy if you pay attention and take notes. Engaging and fun. Definitely recommended.",1
"He is a good professor, sometimes he rambles on quite a bit but as long as you take notes youll pass. his test are all Scranton so always bring a #2 pencil, labs are easy but not worth a lot so if you start doing badly its hard to bring your grade back up. get the notes from someone if you miss, he skips alot of things in the book.",1
Too hard,1
"Decent professor. explains things well and easy to talk to. wants you to succeed, you just have to put in the work and go to office hours. His lectures aren't the most interesting and he speaks in a monotone, but if you pay attention and engage you'll be good.",1
"It's a hard class if you're just taking this for your science requirement, but he's a really great professor and wants his students to do well. He allows re-takes of exams if you do really bad, and is always ready to help you outside of class. His class on labs is easier than the actual class though. I'd definitely recommend him.",1
Karen was a GREAT professor. I haven't taken a math class in a few years and she made things very clear to understand. I did remember a lot of the class from high school but she elaborated and really hammered it in. Attendance is mandatory but she will allow 2 if you explain why. She really does care and will work with you if you actually try.,1
"I hate this class. Group work, forced class discussion, and a lot of homework.",0
"Very tough teacher. I have been at Roane State 3 years, and Professor Sexton is the hardest teacher I have had thus far. She flies through the PowerPoint's, and gives a quiz every week over all the material. The quizzes are to the extreme as well, mostly fill in the blank and labeling with no word banks. Barely ever will you see multiple choice.",1
"Prof. Rasheed is such an amazing lecturer, he is so knowledgeable. He inspired me to pursue the Microbiology field. His test are not difficult,you just have to use logic and be in class. Take lots of notes and ask questions. He is a professor with a good sense of humor, you will enjoy the class. He is one of the best professors i have taken.",1
He made it easy to bring your grade up if you didn't like the grade you got,1
"Great instructor & class! Liked the quizzes & assignments, but the long tests are challenging if you are a slow test-taker, because they are 100 questions long. Learned quite a bit in this class.  It's to your advantage to read the material which is interesting.",1
Adorable. 10/10 take his class to hear him say wikipedia its great. Honestly made a difference in how I watched documentaries. Thanks,1
Explains everything really clearly and genuinely cares that each student understands the content. Wants every student to succeed.,1
"She is very disorganized that it just blows my mind. Gives lab reports like it's Christmas, like chill, your class is not the only class I'm taking during the summer and I have other responsibilities that are more important then her ineffectual labs.",0
Your whole grade in the class is based on tests and quizzes and there are no study guides. She does offer office hours if you dont understand but she is kinda standoffish. Hard class dont take,0
"I loved this professor! She was extremely helpful (if you made the effort to go to her) and the workload wasnt bad! She expects a lot, but only because she gives a lot to the class. there are many opportunities to do well and really learn! she's really hippie-ish and easy going! she's also very open to new ideas and is extremely intelligent!",1
Dr. Roberts truly cares about his students. While the material is dry...he makes class time fun.  Be prepared to read alot of journal articles.,1
boring lectures lots of writing,1
"A very nice professor,  It really is an easy class, just do your work and do it on time.",1
very helpful and friendly,1
Mrs. Gilmore is a fantastic teacher who will give you every bit of information you need as long as you pay attention in class and ask questions if you're uncertain.,1
... he's great!,1
Tough grader. Not many assignments to base your grade off of,1
"Professor McGlynn is super laid back and such a great professor. Class was online, but the book is very easy to read while looking for information. Theres between 2-4 assignments a week, most weeks have 3 assignments. Assignments are explained well, and professor McGlynn always will leave comments on turned in assignments.",1
BIG Z IS A GOOD GUY,1
Excellent teacher - very helpful - very easy to work with - cares about the student and goes out of her way to help them,1
He's an amazing art teacher that genuinely cares about what he teaches and his students. He is incredibly nice and tries to help you in any way. Would take a class by him again.,1
"Take him, hes really good",1
"Dhavan is an excellent professor and a brilliant guy. Also, in response to the few females who have made comments about him being dismissive toward females, I think that is really untrue. I am a female and he has done nothing but help me in my career and I've seen him do the same for several other students both male and female.",1
"This is by far one of the best professor at Kean.. Very simple and straightforward, we barely used the book for the class because you can have access to the PowerPoint lectures on his website. Two quizzes fairly easy just study what he says. Library assignment (introduction & literature review) you pick your own topic. Midterm & a final. Easy class!!!! Will definitely take him in the future",1
"There is a lot of reading. Daily homework, but it's not hard. The research paper in the class is lengthy but she isn't a brutal grader. No textbook and she provides all the reading material. Her lectures are great and engaging. The class is hard because there's a lot to do, but most of it isn't hard itself. Stay on top of it and you'll be fine.",1
"First of all, very funny! VERY VERY smart and always on top of things. knows his stuff. the class was very interesting and applies tolife. would take it over again. only thing is that his test are hard, make you think. they really take some studying but overall great class!",1
Went over many techniques for photoshop. He lets you record. Gives plenty of lab time. If you missed something he will definitely help you and repeat himself. Super nice.,1
Professor Lopez was amazing! His lectures always revolved around specific things and he'd just branch out from there expertly. He made my Monday mornings worth it!,1
"Madhu has a very specific expectation for the work done, there is no space for differing opinions or varying learning styles. She seems highly sensitive of Indias stereotypes and uses this to share her own of Americas, and the recognition of a broad gender spectrum is lost. Patience for full time workers getting tired at the end is nonexistent.",0
"I took a condensed course class with Mrs. Noland this semester. It was actually my first college course ever, which set me up for success. It was difficult due to being condensed, but she made it painless. She is extremely supportive of students and maintains a respectful atmosphere which makes public speaking easier. She's very relatable as well.",1
Very nice person and very helpful.  2 extra credits and to very easy assignments as well as 4 exams. You do have due dates but the assignments are so easy that you can do them with in 30 minutes and turn them in at advance.,1
"I loved this class. Danish is a difficult language to learn, but he teaches it in a way that really makes sense. He made me look forward to come to class every day & speak, even though it's a hard language. He made the language exciting, and really helped us fall in love with Denmark and the culture. Plus he's hilarious, so that was fantastic too!",1
"Dr. Conrad is amazing. She is a HARD teacher but will prepare you. I'm no bookworm and repeated her class 2x but she prepared me. I learned to love her teaching. Plus, she gives you enough practice. More than other teachers will ever give you (more points) and her labs are organized. Just be respectful and she will too. She cares for her students.",1
"Her Intro to Physics class was fun. Goes by her notes and you won't need to by a text. I tried using the text, but realized that she provided everything you needed on her handouts. She's energetic and excited about the course she teaches. Fun class.",1
"Best Chem professors Ive had here at WPU! Dr Xing expects a lot from her students. Lecture is fast and she gives lots hw, but it's there to help you, so DO IT! Exams are tough if you dont know material so be prepared to study & practice. Unlike most professor and you'll actually learn from her! If you need Organic TAKE HER for 1&2, you'll thank me!",1
"Orgo is hard first of all, but he makes it fairly easy. Just pay attention in class and do hw problems He is grade If you hate him, i assume u didnt even try and complaining I took him orgo 1 and 2 i struggled in orgo 1, but i read book, solved problems in orgo 2 I am doing good try, if you try, you will do okay",1
"Very smart man, definitely has considerable knowledge in terms of sound reinforcement. However, his tests are unnecessarily difficult  and most of the questions on the test don't pertain the textbook, lectures, or study guides he hands out. I would not recommenced taking this class if you have no experience working with sounds systems.",0
"DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES. Very disorganized, doesn't follow syllabus and is harsher on you if you don't have the same opinion as her. Although her classes are art classes, she teaches them more like history classes (I.e memorize dates, names, typical issues of the time period)  If you value your gradessanity do not take her class.",0
"tests are extremely hard-the average on test 1 was about a 50. study like crazy, because she picks the most random and picky stuff to include on the tests. doesn't use any visuals during lecture, so it's hard to pay attention. however, nice teacher & helpful if you ask questions. final project sucks-it's a 10-15 pg paper, but it's in groups.",1
"As a whole, the class was very disorganized. I honestly didn't know what my grade was for most of the semester. She wasn't very helpful during the semester. On hard grammar topics, she would literally spend a day on them (which doesn't make any sense). I can't recommend her as a prof.",0
"She's a very nice lady and answers questions well but she seems to forget that our class is only 50 minutes long and, therefore, tries to pack everything she can in at the last minute.",1
"Awesome teacher. Really funny guy. The class isn't the easiest, but if you apply yourself and turn in all the homework you'll get an A. Dixie is lucky to have him, he's a wealth of knowledge.",1
If you are a History major at San Marcos then you must take Professor Ibrahim Al-Marashi. Taking one of his classes is like a right of passage for History major. HIST 384 was an enlightening experience that I would recommend. Al-Marashi's lectures are a transcendent fusion of knowledge and dynamic humor. Take whatever class that is offered with him,1
"Her media literacy class was very interesting. Alot of you're grade is based off papers 3 papers and 2 exams. Exams aren't too difficult, tough grader with papers though. She's very funny and can be at times very over zealous. But its very refreshing compared to alot of the boring teachers at CCSU. I strongly suggest her.",1
"Spends a majority of the class ranting on about his own personal opinions and beliefs, has ZERO written explanations on how to do well in his class, will grade poorly for doing anything outside of what he demands but wont tell you all his demands, insulted every member of class no matter skill with no instruction on how to do better. Condescending.",0
Dr. Ramey is easily one of my favorite professors at UA and I do not even have an interest in religious studies (class was for my major). He made the subject truly interesting and it was clear he is exceedingly knowledgeable about what he teaches. Class was easy enough but I still got a lot out of it. He will go above and beyond to help students.,1
"She has quizzes that she makes up herself in her class, and they are often poorly worded and she expects a lot out of students. She expects you to understand many, many, different types of long charts. She also is a tough grader, and I've had times where she completely gave me the wrong grade and said she had me mixed up with another student.",0
"SHE IS SO HOT! TAKE HER! BEST TEACHER, HANDS DOWN!",1
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
Great teacher !!,1
"I was scared to take PSY210, but it was not the nightmare I anticipated, thanks to Prof. Rizzella. If math is not your thing, take 210 with her. She is incredibly detailed in her explanations of content and will prepare you as well as she possibly can for the tests. If you keep up with the work and do the optional assignments, you will be golden.",1
"Easy class. Except for mid-term and final, tests are online and you're even forced to get an A by taking it as many times as necessary. Other tests are easy thanks to comprehensive study guide. Nelson is a really nice, funny and smart guy. Extra credit is offered through easy in-class quizzes to encourage attendance. Class itself can be boring.",1
"Good instructor. Some organizational issues, but those issues are minor. The class was interesting, but there are a lot of dense readings, so come prepared by reading the day's material at least 2 days in advance. Which is what you're supposed to do, really.",1
"He definitely wants his students to learn, do your work, show up to class and you will pass.",1
"This course is about Jewish literature (mainly American), but it is really about my life and family--at least it made me think about them and past generations, too. And i am not Jewish.",1
"The people who complains about her either dumba.. idiots who has no math ability or shouldn't be in that class first place. I don't know her personally, I m not from her country but I can understand her and follow the directions she points, got an A.",1
I recommend him to anyone.,1
She is funny teacher who want to see you pass. she ,1
"He gives way too much work for his class, is a very hard grader, gave two midterms, ended up with a crappy grade. Equivalent effort would have resulted in passing two other courses with an A+.",0
"He's a good English teacher, just assigns a lot work so be prepared",1
"Great professor. Very nice to students who didn't get a high grade on tests. Lecture can be long but he tries to be engaged with the students to keep us awake, haha. However, I STRONGLY advise people who take his class to buy his recommended book, because like 70% of what we go over in the lectures and tests are based on the reading in the book.",1
"This is my 3rd class with Dr. C, so I'm a little biased. Her teaching style speaks to my method of learning, though, so it's a good arrangement. Lots of extra credit. Gives all that you need to know on Powerpoints, but be sure to bring your book to class! Sad that she isn't teaching 142 next quarter.",1
"I cannot stress enough how amazing this instructor is. He is extremely passionate about what he does and is amaze at it. His lectures are amazing, straight forward, and very helpful. He makes sure the class understands what is happening before moving forward. Always willing to help and just makes math stress free and fun. A true gem!",1
Really understanding and cool teacher for new comers to IT,1
"Very nice teacher, tough class. Study your vocabulary !!",1
"I like him as a person but he is a terrible professor. There is homework everyday and this stuff is complex stuff too. I mostly chegg everything but Im looking at a D to pass in this class. He teaches it like youre in graduate Electrical Engineering college, not an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering. Im glad I can take him only this once.",0
"Intro to Special Ed. - Hybrid Prof. Hutton knows a lot about special education & has multiple children with disabilities. There are 27 modules you have to do throughout the course, you can work ahead (recommended), they are easy but with a good amount of reading.  Study aids are helpful Gives good constructive feedback - rubrics can be wordy...",1
"Complementing him and putting him on a pedestal is the exact opposite of what he would advise me to do, but it is hard not to. Truly the most transformative figure in my life. The most inspiring and Innovative teacher I have ever had the pleasure of studying with!",1
"I enjoyed having Mr. Vaughn as my instructor. He works out multiple problems on the board -will ask if anyone needs help understanding the problem before he moves on, and will go over a problem if needed. He does skip the small mental parts (this is college) but will gladly go through it if asked. Attend class, dont be afraid to ask for help.",1
Dr. Watford was an AWESOME teacher.  He was very interesting and knew what he was talking about.  I enjoyed goin to lecture and his exam reviews were very helpful.  There were no surprises on exams... BEST TEACHER in the Nutrition Dept!!!!!,1
"Deb Fels utilized a series of guest lectures in lieu of presenting course materials. The guest lectures represented related content; it did not explain the concepts of the course text book. The final exam was 100% from the textbook. I know I did not Fel the exam, but I did not do as well as I could have with lectures on course material.",0

"Conrad's class was not a cake walk. There was a lot of work due including online sapling homework, labs almost every meeting and a bunch of other worksheets. Although her class was extremely tough I do believe that I am ready for chem 2. Do not take her if you have another major class, its not a joke at all. She is a very nice and caring lady.",1
"Took History of Paper Structure in the Spring. Amazing class, not too much reading and you really end up with a LOT of handmade paper that you can do anything with! Great for printmaking majors. There is enough time to come in outside class and do more work if you really enjoy it!",1
"There is so much reading required for this class, but it ends up not counting for much.  You write two essays that are not necessarily related to what we learn in class, and you take two tests.  The tests are too simple after all the analysis you do in class and discussion.  The professor is very unclear and hard to understand.  Frustrating class.",0
"he is an easy teacher. i got mostly d's on the exams ,and did the extra credit.i passed with a b-. his class is fun ,and he is very helpful.",1
Awesome teacher!! He actually cares about his students!!!,1
Dr. LeFlouria is awesome!  So knowledgeable and so funny!  She makes it very interesting and fun to discuss.  Even in a class of 100+ students she let's everyone participate and discuss.  As long as you do her reviews and read (there is a lot of reading) there is no reason not to do well on her tests.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
Loved every class Ive had with Mr. Williams,1
I took this class and learned all I need to learn to get me on a sound track to teaching using the constructivist learning approach. There was no test and examination. Just weekly assignments/ projects. Great  professor. Always pushing for excellence and ready to help those in class to learn rattan than play the clowns.  Thumps up!,1
Mrs. DePinto lets you know exactly what she expects and guides you with how to accomplish the task. Very exacting with grammar and writing. I was lucky to have her for my first college class. I feel prepared for the next English class I have to take.,1
"The textbook is really just different books that he'll assign you to read. It's possible to BS your way through, but he'll figure out eventually if you're not reading & that'll affect your grade. Lectures are more class discussions which are interesting. Midterm & final are papers. Changes how he arranges his class quite frequently.",1
"I had Gilmore for SOC110/120, and his 180AW is largely based around his teachings in those previous classes. Writing proposal as your final, along with a presentation to the class of your findings and work. It is a seminar class so you will need to speak in class. My advice, get to know the TA. They will be grading all of your work!(alex o is gr8)",1
"Sammons is the homie! At first he comes off as being dull but if you actually pay attention and participate he's funny and entertaining. He also isn't too hard on grading, I'd definitely recommend this class.",1
"She is a very caring teacher. She does not spend very much time lecturing during class and we watched a lot of videos and had a lot of group discussions. She assigned a lot of small writing assignments and there were no exams. The writing assignments are worth a lot, but are all very short. She marks decently hard but fair.",1
"Online tests are ""take as many times as you want, open note, open book"" but it's pass or fail - Not hard. The hard part is actually studying for the midterm and final which is in the classroom. But he gives you everything you need to pass and he's really nice. He's actually kinda funny too in an frighteninly awkward kind of way...",1
"I took her for ""Issues in Work: Avoiding sexual harassment"" one credit course. She is nice and all but for a one credit course it is by no means an easy A. In fact, about six people failed (she posts final scores in excel with nicknames). Must attend all classes, do the small project and final. I recommend her.",1
professor is good but be ready to work. if you don't like to do homework then don't take this class. this teacher will teach you everything properly but is a bit dry on the humor side. If you like to learn this is the class.,1
"EASY A, but he did pick on me alot through out the semester. He seems unhappy in his marriage and belittles you when your proud of your happy marriage. Like I said, EASY A, and gives extra credit as well as extra redit for attendence. Also, no need for book..",1
"he is a great teacher, & he loves what he does",1
"Even if you do the weekly 3x D2L postings, they have to be perfect or you won't get the mark. Group project is actually worse than you could imagine with no support from the prof. Impossible grader - midterm was a disaster. He's a good person, very nice, but it's almost like he wants people to regret taking an online course.",0
"Amazing professor, but you need to put some effort into learning the concepts!",1
"I took Prof. Gronlund this last spring for Nutrition online. She is really sweet and makes sure to let you know what you'll need for the course. This class is an easy A and I would definitely take another one of her courses again. She gives extra credit, and is an easy grader.",1
"Ken is a great professor I ever had. I learned a lot in his class.  He will make you work hard for it, but at the end it's all worthy.",1
"He's a great instructor, has great lectures and gives you the materials you need to study for the weekly tests. He gives TONS of extra credit and drops your lowest test score. It's an extremely hard subject to learn but he does his best to make it fun! It does take him a while to get things graded so you're never really sure what your grade is.",1
"Dont take this class. She expects too much. She wants you to do every week reflective journals and written assignments which are about 5-6 paragraphs long. Also we write in class for a grade. Attendance mandatory have to be on time, and 3 times you miss class she will drop you. Too much stress.",1
He is such a sweat and knowledge professor.,1
"Shes alright, I dont like her tough grading or how shes to picky.",1
"Great! He is great and easy to talk to, super funny. Office hours are always available",1
"Though he's knowledgeable in his field, he's definitely the worst teacher I've ever had...",0
"Mr. Logan is a very helpful and patient teacher. He can be quiet if you are in the back and has smaller handwriting though, so if you have vision or auditory issues it's good to sit towards the front. Ultimately he is a very clear and thorough teacher who takes his time during and after class to ensure we understand the methods and theories.",1
"I am writing this because of the negative comment here about this professor. he is one of the best teacher who knows his stuff and you want him to teach you. Take his class and you will learn alot. People here that say negative things about him are people who do not want to do any work and get A, wish he teach all my courses",1
Absolutely fantastic teacher. Takes a genuine interest in his students and always makes himself available. I've never been one to meet with my teachers but I have kind of adopted him as my adviser. A+,1
knowledgeable and passionate professor. He creates a class atmosphere that is relaxed and fun. Def will take again.,1
"Extremely intelligent in this field, but impossible to access outside of class. As someone who had class during his office hours, I emailed him several times this semester to set up a time to meet or just ask questions and never received a response, and he was always the first person to run out of the class room. The GSIs graded extremely unfair.",0
"His teaching style is great, but if he edited the suggested problems list and took out all the problems that test concepts he does not want FNCE 3227 students to brood over from that problems list, I would not have had to spend HOURS unnecessarily reading the textbook. To make matters worse, some of the explanations in the textbook aren't clear.",1
I really liked Professor Brown! He is very interactive with the class and gets excited about what he's talking about. He's always interested in different opinions and perspectives on the novels we read. Professor Brown really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. There is quite a lot of writing in this class - so be prepared.,1
"He doesn't teach the material; he expects you to learn on your own. Wastes valuable class time telling personal stories having nothing to do with the subject, wasting my money. Need I say more?",0
"I love Dr. Anderson. He's such a caring and kind professor. He always calls himself the most ignorant person in the room and he tells us to channel our inner Socrates so that we aren't afraid to ask questions. He understands that what we're learning can be hard and he makes it clear that he's here to help. Latin is a lot of work though, esp. Latin2",1
Good class.  Great teacher.  ,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course with Dr. Reddy! She makes her expectations for the course clear and provides plenty of study materials/resources. There is a lot of homework, but it does help with understanding the lectures and material. Highly recommend taking Biology with her!",1
I truly CANNOT say enough good things about this professor. Even though this was an online course- she was so sweet and helpful. Through her emails and funny posts you can totally tell she's invested in her students and just actually cares. Seriously she's the best!,1
The guy doesn't teach whatsoever. He tells you he's on your side but that's a load of.... Instead of teaching you the material he talks about how bad professors are nowadays when hes the worst of them all. His exams are really hard and the fact that you have to teach yourself doesn't help.,0
I have taken her for several classes. Great teacher and great person! She is full of personality and very passionate about her work. She loves to see her students excel and is always open to help! Take her she's great!,1
Great Professor. Allows you to be creative in your research projects. A lot of reading.The overlap of info helps if you didn't get it the first time. The tests make you want to study harder. Class attendance is a must. My favorite class.,1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Blames students for bad exam grades, never returned any of project grades. Nobody knew how they were doing in the class until the final grades were posted.",0
"Brad Justice is the most amazing professor I've had at Akron. I had Justice over the summer 2019. He is by far the best at explaining the material and cares about his students. The course itself is difficult, yet he clearly explains each topic. He adds humor to help the environment. Always available to students. 100% Recommend Brad Justice!!!!!!!",1
I am in utter shock and dismay after the horrific events that occurred from January-March 2019. This class was absolutely horrendous. Where do I even start? She gives TONS of homework every single week. She even assigns it right after TESTS! Her tests are always the MAXIMUM level of difficulty. Please please please avoid this class if youwanttoLIVE,0
"I took this class expecting math to suck, math sucked but the teacher is definitely nice and when had questions about the lecture or HW during class she would explain things a little better so that was good. The bad began when she would forget to post the homework and the work stacks up, and you fall behind. She doesn't answer her emails.",0
"Congratulation! if you are reading this comment while looking for English professor. Stop reading looking around; go register for his class before it is closed. I took his class simply based on the reviews here. Is a great teacher, unfortunately I started loving English.",1
Dr. Evans-Nguyen is very sporty and wears his favorite sports team shirts daily. He always is making Chemistry parallels to the chemistry in his favorite teams. He once compared an Acid Base reaction lab to the offensive and defensive reactions to the crowd based on home and away games noise levels.,1
"Prof. Monahan is one of the best professors at Suffolk, and could go down as one of the best professors I've gotten to experience. His class is a lot of fun, and he clearly explains everything that needs to be done in order to succeed. If you pay attention in class and do all of the online assignments you will succeed. He is a role model for all.",1
"He is a great teacher. His tests were more analytical than memorization. He made you think, which is good, but different and can be challenging. He has a great sense of humor and tons of great stories. He makes a 9am class more enjoyable. I learned a lot in the semester I had him for BI 210. You can tell he loves his job and he's good at it.",1
She is such a phenomenal professor! She actually teaches you and wants you to get an A. She always goes over every lesson as much as you need in order for you to understand. Wish i would've taken all my Spanish classes with her. HIGHLY recommend taking her.,1
She is so good! knows a lot about the industry and really just knows what she's talking about she always lectures the best and does everything she can for her students! I honestly can say she is one of my favorite professors!,1
"He loves to tell hilarious stories in class, but don't let this distract you from taking notes. Understanding the notes and the chapters in the book are very important. Tests can be quite difficult, even if the material from class seemed easy enough. He is quite helpful though and provides a lot of opportunities for extra credit, just go to class.",1
Extremely personable and very relaxed.  Tests follow consistent structure.  She has a good sense of humor.  She's a cutie too.,1
"Personal experience and friends taking the course, he tells you what will be on the exam .... he gives you the complete opposite.  He definitely knows what he is talking about but is very boring in class.",0
Delightful presentation. Upbeat and encouraging. Helpful to students and presents useful information worth learning. Great experience.,1
"Not only does the class require daily reading, weekly papers, AND mandatory weekly participation in a cultural/religious club outside of class, but there are two exams, side projects, and a tedious final paper that you have to worry about as well. She is a good teacher, but the class overall sucks. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS IT IS MANDATORY.",1
"Loved this class, from beginning to end! Professor Wilson sure is one of the greatest professors at UHD! Take him! Easy class and you learn everything you need to know!",1
"Never and I mean NEVER take this professor. She is a very kind lady, but doesn't teach well. ""What does the book say?"" is her favorite line when you need help. Labs are unorganized and no one had any clue what they were doing. I am a good student and tried my hardest to understand, but it was just impossible. I had to withdrawal.",0
"Do not expect full credit on anything, even when it is deserved. She is a tough teacher who treats you like professional journalists. If you are anything BUT a journalism concentrator, do not take this class anyway. Find something else. I would not recommend taking her, she doesn't teach at all. No tests or quizzes, just articles and blog project.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. it is hard and you cant understand what he says. the class is so boring and he talks about one slide for like 15 minutes!,0
"TAKE THIS CLASS! Worried about your grade? Take it P/NP. The ONLY class requiring thought during my Berkeley education; material is graduate level but given it is psych it's nothing to worry about. Hinshaw analyzes mental illness from every facet of human experience, arriving at sound conclusions. Exams are curved. Everyone does well on the final.",1
"Washburn is a very fair teacher and enjoys teaching. She is always Nice to students, goes over everything in detail, and is very relatable. Do your homework and be respectful, that's it. Her class is informative and interesting, and she likes doing group activities. The tests and homework are not hard as long as you are attentive. Do not be late.",1
"This guy is legit! I don't know why he gets so much guff on his online classes. In-person, Dr. Goodyear is someone who takes his course material seriously, but he doesn't take himself too seriously. Consequently, his class has a laid-back, low-stress kinda vibe; but stay engaged with his lectures! Very relatable, but textbook reading still a must.",1
I was super nervous to take his class as I haven't taken a math class in five years. His assigned homework is ALWAYS related to tests and very helpful. He grades very fairly. He is an awesome teacher willing to explain and answer questions. Fast grading. Not to mention he's very nice and cracks a few jokes. He also brought treats several times :),1
Gosh this is a boring class and she does her best to make it interesting. There is a lot of material which she flies through. Also her test are mostly multiple choice but they are hard. Do not take lightly. and her reviews don't really help that much.,1
READ the textbook before each lecture. You'll get like 2hrs of online hw a week but they are great grade boosters and get you ready for the exams. The midterm and final are multiple choice and are much harder than her other two written tests. Overall she really knows her stuff and how to teach it. Go to class and build a relationship with her.,1
"Great professor who cares about her students, very helpful, generous grader.  Really makes you think and points out the material that is difficult to grasp at first.",1
Very vague. Not a lot of feedback given,0
Garyen teaches from a more clinical perspective (ie. what would happen if a physiological process was interrupted?) which is effective. His iclicker questions are worth 10% of the final grade but they're not too hard. Study for his weekly quizzes (probably the hardest fill in the blank quizzes you'll ever write) and you'll be fine.,1
Luallen is exactly how he comes off to be on his reviews. Really goes in depth with the material so you don't have to do the reading. The multiple choice on tests are very difficult but get better as the year goes on. He tries to trick you so you really need to know the material. Open responses are very straight forward. Overall a great teacher.,1
Professor Dunham was great! His class was not hard as long as you listen to his lectures in class and read the learning units in each module you will pass every quiz and the discussions will be pretty easy. He gave great feedback and is a very fair grader. I recommend his class to anybody taking any one of his business classes.,1
"Personal negative, social and political views where constantly issued, some students where ignored and dismissed often.",0
"Shively is Love, Shively is LIfe.",1
"Dr. Olson was very available considering this was an online class.  The instructions are clear and there is participation every week online with the other students through ""discussions"" about the subject that week.  I thought it was a terrific class.",1
"I had Dr. Vhos for Gen Chem. He is a great teacher and focuses on teaching concepts rather than having his class memorize. He clearly loves what he does and wants his class to do well. His tests are cumulative, which some students did not like. I highly recommend Dr. Vhos for anything Chem.",1
He explains everything in detail and gives out plenty of worksheets for students to adequately practice the particular lesson that he is teaching. He also dedicates several of his classes to review for tests which are a major help to anyone that might be having trouble understanding a specific topic.,1
Awesome teacher. Very funny and actually helps you understand what you are learning. Would recommend to anyone taking a&p 1. Quizs every week and 4 exams with 3 practicals. As long as you study your notes you will pass. ,1
"He is a great prof. who clearly knows a lot about econ. He used to work at the federal reserve. Gives great examples in class. Applies what we are learning into easy to understand real world examples. He talks slowly and can be boring at times tho. He uses a powerpoint but could easily teach without any notes. 5 quizzes, 3 exams, little homework.",1
Luckily the concepts were fairly easy to grasp. Just basic math problems you weren't allowed to use calculators. The tests weren't difficult but if you mess up on something she treats you like you're mentally challenged. She wasn't very understanding when I went through family issues and told me the wrong time for the final. #neveragain,0
"Solari is easily the BEST Professor I had at State. He is so animated and lively.... not to mention hilarious. Hes one of those people who just knows so many facts off the top of his head, its amazing. I adored him!",1
"He is pretty cool. Although he teaches by lecture, rather than an interactive experience. His Korean accent, although adorable, sometimes gets in the way of understanding how somethings are pronounced. He also has occasional moments of funniness. He is not the best teacher, but he gets the job done.",1
"Madame Aunave is one of the kindest professors and long as you participate in class and ask for help when you need it, all she cares about is that you're trying to improve your French. Homework is usually just an activity or two every night that doesn't take longer than 30 min. Only complaint is when she does assign final projects its all at once.",1
Very smart and easygoing person. He will get you involved in lectures and not make you bored. If you show interest and participate you will have no problem passing.,1
"I love Yvonne! I have taken the following classes with her: 2-D Design, Mixed Media, Figure Drawing, & Exploring Photography.  She has strong credentials, there are a lot of assignments, she wants you to work hard and stretch yourself to become a better artist. Accepts late assignments. As student with ADD this teacher works with me wonderfully.",1
I don't get it this teacher is a master at making people think she's something she's not.  What she has been is incredibly rude and just spiteful to me.  Doesn't anyone else see what's really going on?  Shes the reason my husband dropped out.,0
"she is nice, she would like to explain everything you dont understand, but she DO NOT explain a lot on grammar and new stuff, because she think the student can read book and do the questions by themselves. moreover, if you would like to practice more oral , you can go to her class, because there is a presentation in each class, sometimes each week.",0
"He is a very smart person and knows his stuff but can be a little hard to follow at times. He needs to ""dumb it down"". He has lecture slides that are exactly what he goes over in class so only have to go when there's a clicker quiz. It's difficult material but the old exams are given to you so study those for exams. They are extremely similar.",1
"Dr. Legg was my favorite professor at of all the professors I've had. He relates lectures to real life instances, which have really helped me in my career. He's really knowledgeable and funny and has a lot of interesting stories. Tests are a little challenging, but he usually gives extra credit, so do that and you're good. Definitely recommend!",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM! I am warning you!!! He is the worst... seriously... save yourself, your GPA, your money, and your time!!!!!!!",0
"Took this class over Spring 2013 semester. This guy basically takes what another instructor does and tries to teach it. Automatically get an A if you try. I would turn in projects half done and still get A. If you are looking for a great great and no idea what is being taught, then this is the class.",0
"This guy is funny as hell and if you talk to him outside of class he will always help you out.  He also reminds me of Joe Pesci and curses almost constanly. He also doesn't put up with any crap either.  So, if you're a lazy ass bum like one person that commented earlier then don't take the class.  Probably the funnest class I've had because of him.",1
Warning. I had a horrible experience with this guy and his class was not what I expected. Be aware. ,0
"I didn't use the textbook once. Wejksnora is very passionate about biology. He makes hilarious examples, and asks you questions if you sit in the front row. I missed an exam for no reason and he let me retake it even though I told him two months later. Definitely a great professor. ",1
One of the best profs in engineering. Gives very intuitive explanations of the material plus he's funny. We need more profs like him in engineering.,1
"Great professor, awesome lecturer, some various things he lectures about will stick with you forever(good reasons). I really enjoyed this course except for the quizzes/tests(Very hard and analytical; memorize and UNDERSTAND the material). Take down every single note of the PowerPoints(will regret it if you don't since he doesn't post it online)",1
She is a really caring and wonderful professor. Her class was really easy but just a bit boring. She does have an accent but it's not that bad. She will gladly help any students or clarify.,1
You should do the labs and projects. It would definitely help to look at tutorials on Youtube. Professor Hsu is nice and willing to help.,1
"Test are difficult, sometime quite different from homeowrk.",0
"you have to read the book and half way pay attention in class and you should do ok.  He grade on a cerve which is good and no longer does essay questions, atleast not on the 101 corse.  He is cool, laid back, and you miss alot of classes, but he is cool otherwise.",1
"By far the most amazing professor I have ever had! Absolutely loved, and looked forward to each class! I would consider him an expert in his field! Full of knowledge and humor! TAKE HIM! You will not regret it but if you don't take him, you will! Professor Lyall is simply the best!:)",1
"I dont know why everyone didnt like this class.  i thought it was enjoyable and rather easy, and im a business major!! this is a great elective, a little bit of work but alot less then my other classes.",1
"I hope that I could give 0 for him. For those who have to take this class, do it wisely. Write your letters clearly, cuz he took points off because you did not write '2' or '5' properly. He also can not read your exam if 'x', 'z', and 'y' is in printed format. Very stubborn , impossible to argue with (about anything). Argue for grade? Take care!",0
"I've taken Professor Corder twice! He's very understanding and caring. Even if you aren't doing so well in his class (grade wise), he just wants you to let him know what's going and he will help! Awesome Professor!!",1
"Top notch. Lectures clear, concise. Helpful in class. Communicates via e-mail too. Have a question? Ask away! Avoid missing class, each day is 5 hours. What you learn is applied practically (lab). Read supplied online book to supplement class. First few class days feel long, but feel shorter thereafter. Pursue if you have a passion for networking!!",1
"I took TV production this year and I am learning nothing! Molloy is such a joke for TV and Film. They should call the class, TV production for Dummies. This is a TV, it is square, anything techncal I have no idea how to teach. Talk about a teacher who is crying out for students to like him. Maybe he should change his teaching style and be a so call",0
"Okay first off. Shes pretty cute. But other than that she grades really tough. Only makes one or two comments on papers and deducts 20 to 30 points. Dont even think about talking when shes lecturing, she actually puts your name down then decucts points from participation. She is also a very boring and slow speaker, but shes still hot!",0
"Steve is amazing. He takes a legitimate interest in his students and he's super passionate about Classics. He sincerely wants his students to succeed, and if you put effort into any of his classes he will make sure you pass, but in all honesty he doesn't make his classes hard at all. He's awesome; I recommend him for every class you can take.",1
"He is amazing and accommodating and he understands that students are overwhelmed so he works around that. His goal is to teach you and help you understand rather than just throwing work at you. He is a great professor and if you do the hw and the practice q's he send, you'll pass with flying colors.",1
"He is a really nice guy, but wouldn't recommend him as a professor. Very tough class, could teach better online, 85% of grade is in exams with little time. I scraped through at the end with a B. Wish he gave more practice exams/material. Lots of people did very, very poorly. His microphone is bad so listening to lectures hurts your ears.",0
"Very easy grader, but an A is a 95 in this class so it offsets. Very nice, but sometimes a bit forgetful/wrong about trivial tangential details.",1
"Professor Whitney was an amazing teacher! She uses her life experiences a lot within the topics discussed which can be a win for some or not, but either way, just take notes, study and do the reports!",1
"This was my second time having Dr. Osborne for a class, and he was as fantastic as the first time. He is very funny and entertaining, and tries to make the texts more relatable. The only thing to watch out for with him is there will be a very intense reading schedule. Your grade will be based on two big tests, a big paper, and a few quiz grades.",1
"The best teacher i've ever had at kean university.  He wants you to do well, and he cares about each and every student. I 100% recommend you take him for classes as often as possible. ",1
Statistics is not an easy class to begin with but he tries his hardest to explain to you what is going on. If you can get another teacher for stats DO SO because the word is that Rayburn is the hardest of the two stats teachers.,1
My first essay was a B+ and no matter how much I went to the Writing ctr I get the same grade wc is frustrating she's really nice and kind you have to participate in class and AVOID being late bc she doesnt like it the only thing w/her is w her esay instructions its quite confusing and no matter how you change the roughdraft its the same grade,0
Took the Creative Writing class with Professor Daniels. He explained everything in an easy-understanding way and related many things to real life. He's also very chill as a person. Wish I would have gotten more feedback though for my writing though.,1
"Prof. Nelson is a great instructor. She's passionate about anthro. and it shows in her lectures. She will talk about her research from Africa to help contextualize concepts from class, which I found helpful. Her readings and class projects are interesting and sometimes can be challenging. I reccomend taking her, stay caught up!",1
"Jorgen is one of my favorite professors! You do have to go to class he doesn't upload the slides and so you won't get your notes, and you're going to need notes for the exam. The exams are hard but you MUST do the readings and take good notes & you'll be fine. I was really scared for this class I heard mixed reviews, Jorgens is an awesome prof tho.",1
Most amazing teacher i've ever had.,1
"She's easy, but she's too high energy/perky.  I disliked having to do so many activities during class and thought that we wasted a lot of time with these activities. Thankfully, there aren't that many speeches.  Don't bother buying the book.",1
"This teacher is a ray of hope for education in this country. He's not like the majority of the educators who only come in for a paycheck. He is there to teach you a subject, not have you pass a test, and he does a great job doing so. I failed my first applied calculus class, and knew nothing go in, Passed his with a B+ Great teacher",1
"Professor Peters is one of the nicest professors I've had the pleasure of having. She's very accessible outside of class and she also is super understanding if a student is having trouble. While her lectures can be a little boring and she relies heavily on the textbook, she makes the material easy to understand.",1
He's a great professor. Always interesting and interested in helping your work. Three essays and a portfolio which is just the revised first three papers. Lots of peer editing and he's always open to questions. Quite funny as well. Can miss up to 3 classes. Participation is about 10% of the grade as well. Highly recommend,1
Very caring for students when it comes to exams in case you are kicked out she decides if you can go back in and finish. Also has very good lectures that i enjoy.,1
"I have taken this professor for chem 2, orgo 1 and orgo 2. The only thing that I would change would be to have taken him for chem 1 as well. Hes hands down my favorite professor Ive had in my collegiate career. He is by no means an easy professor, but he is a reasonable and fair one.",1
"I loved Dr. Grave's energy and enthusiasm, but was not a fan of her teaching style. The class has no real lectures/powerpoints so you basically go to class to do practice questions out of the book with a partner, and have to teach yourself from the book on your own time. If you're taking the class pass/fail its manageable but if not then good luck",0
"He gives extra credit worth a whole exam to replace your lowest score. Like the reviews state 3 tests online multiple choice, easy questions, even if you get average scores, the extra credit brings you up to an A. The discussion board was about the budget due until finals week. Easy A class.",1
History is history. You read about it in the book (so boring) and you write a discussion post about it each week. It wasn't hard it's just time consuming because you have to read a lot. The quizzes were tricky sometimes but the answers are usually on the internet. I took her 8 week course and I had to prioritize the readings but it was manageable.,1
"She brings enthusiasm AND expertise to class, which makes it really fun. Classtime flies. She expects you to work hard, but she is also fair and helpful.  This class is useful if you want to use your french some day.",1
"Very nice professor. Exams cover what is discussed in class. Some group projects, graded somewhat leniently. Very experienced in the health field, I enjoyed her ethics class the most.",1
She gives good comments on papers. But do any extra credit she offers. It might mean the difference between a letter in grade.,1
I freaking love monica. seriously best bio teacher. She is so nice and is the bomb and so cool and just really helpful and accessible and wants you to do well.,1
"She's really nice and very fashionable! She talks to the students in class about whatever they want to talk about really, and to me that's a great way to practice conversation because you're discussing something you're actually interested in. The tests were fair and she's very helpful",1
I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR :) HE IS THE BEST && FUNNY !! TAKE HIM !,1
He is an amazing prof.,1
"Tulin is a great professor. His class, however, is no joke. We had two tests that were solely essay questions, and best believe the response was two ACTUAL essays. But if you record his lectures and write everything he says down verbatim and study it, you should have no problems getting an A.",1
"Did not teach us, let the textbook teach us (30 pages each chapter). Weekly homework assignments were like Quizlet. All exams were about super specific info inside the textbook. Easy A for the most part, but damn, I did not learn anything.",0
"Fowler is a very smart individual with lots to say even if its not clear what she wants you to take away from lecture. I agree that the fall 04 final was a total ****. I went in with a B+ and came out with a C+, ouch.",1
"Its a hybrid class so you gotta be attentive with that. the weekly discussions are where you accumulate the most points, it really counts. ",1
Kraft is a awesome professor and is a super nice guy!,1
"Choose a different teacher. Exam reviews are inaccurate and you might as well not even read them. Everything is so unorganized, and much of what's on the exam is not on the reviews. Just a mess of a class. Be prepared to teach yourself, or look up other lectures online relating to the same topic because they will teach you more.",0
"Excellent teacher and nurse, but don't be late or miss clinicals. She gets very annoyed if you show the least bit of apathy or not enough effort. But she is very helpful if you go to her for help, and a very interesting person. She's not easy, so study study study. Just do your best and you will do alright!",1
Had Professor Williams for SF 350 this semester Fall 2017. Also had him for SF 462 last semester Spring 2017. Overall class is really interesting. Learn all about aircraft accidents and the responsibilities of Airport Management and ARFF on how to handle airplane disasters. Can't wait to have him again next semester for SF 341.,1
"Show up to class, participate in the workouts and you'll pass.",1
"Awsome professor! Very helpful. Yes, she has attendance policy, but that is what you are paying for - a class.  Just study the definitions from the book, and you will get at least a B.  On the tests, ask her, and she will almost give you the answer.",1
Knows what hes talking about,1
"Cool Guy,made a B in the class,just do the work and you will pass. Beware doe, he does give alot of writting assignments outside the class room. Overall, just put time in doing the end of semeter research paper (5+ paper) and you'll come outside the class passing with a ""B"" or an ""A"".",1
"Dr. Crumpler is a great professor, he makes things very clear cut. He does his best to make sure the students understand what they're doing. The tests can be difficult, but the material is what is expected to be on it.",1
I took his class for second semester even after reading the comments and I strongly recommend not taking his class. First off there's no leniency and doesn't even communicate properly on what's gonna be on the midterm. His lectures online looks like chicken scratch and its unreadable.,0
JP is a reasonable professor. I just wish he put all the assignments on Canvas at the beginning. I highly suggest going to class--he gives the code for some projects! He also gives critical instructions for the projects (which really should have been included in the assignment descriptions...). There are 4 online quizzes and 1 open-book final exam.,1
Mrs. Prater means well but treats her students like they are children and talks down to them. Expects you to read every night before class and is homework heavy. Her personal tests arent that bad but the midterm is a grade breaker. Study hard and go to class otherwise you wont do well in the class. There are definitely easier teachers for this clas,1
Simply the best! tests are based on both lectures and textbook so make sure you understand the concepts she talks about.   Gives great advice and feedack.,1
"Professor McCarthy was a really good instructor-- WRTG 106 is an accelerated freshman writing course, and I really felt that I was challenged to test my ability in the class.  Tough grader, but gives really helpful criticism in order to improve (which you can-- rewrites are offered!)  Would recommend her class. ",1
"Good Professor.  Not as funny as he thinks he is, but damm smart. Tests are fair but long.  Big final presentation in both.",1
"Really odd man teaching a curveball of a class.  Yet it was entertaining and pretty easy.  Translation quizzes were simple.  The key to this class, however, is to take the exams.  They are long and require a decent amount of studying but they come with a massive curve and a nice study guide as well.  Plus he likes monty python, you can't beat that.",1
"Great teacher! Always had interesting facts and stories about the countries he had visited. There was no textbook, so there was no reading.  Would take this class again! Very smart, funny, and awesome professor. :)",1
Dr. Sexton was awesome! She knows her stuff and is very clear about what you will be tested and graded on. Would highly recommend her.,1
"Kelly is one of the sweetest teachers there is. She pushes you hard and makes you work, but isn't mean at all. Has great games for the class to play.She can be goofy, but it's funny. Very motivated, athletic and energetic. Her enthuisiasm is refreshing to be around! Highly recommend her classes!",1
"Dr. Ayers is a pretty cool guy.  The class has no book and is 90% discussion.  You have to read a lot of case studies, but not too bad.  Takes a little effort but worth it.",1
ughghghg....boring,0
"I wrote over 25 papers for this class -- 3 papers a week on average for INTRO to Literature. His essays are incredibly vague and you will have to go to office hours for help since he does not make it clear what he wants. I recommend taking any other professor for this course. Show up to class, read the material, and work for your grade.",0
"All lectures are online as PowerPoints & content is straight from the book. Preferred to just read the book rather than sit through lecture. Does give extra credit for attending events & writing one page summary. Soft speaker so, if you want to hear lectures clearly, sit in first two rows.",1
hes good,1
i accomplished my dreams thanks to Greta.,1
TERRIBLE professor. He is very cocky and the entire class is about his life. He does not use power points or study guides and the test are all essays based off of his random opinions. Avoid if possible.,0
"Where do I begin! This course is SUPER HARD!! Not something you can just skim through and pass, You have to read, do your assignments, tests and pay attention in class to the guidelines.  Great teacher by far! I walked away with tons of knowledge! Hard but worth taking...",1
"he is a great professor, makes the material easy to understand.",1
"Cynthia is a wonderful teacher. She really loves her students and her subject. She is very supportive and very helpful. No lectures, class is basically based on your own research. I feel like I learned a lot about what I was interested in!",1
"I learned a lot in her class. Yes, it was work and I was nervous every time I had to give a speech, but by the end of the class I had greatly improved. We laughed a lot - some of the speeches were just hilarious. Great prof!",1
He is a terrible professor. He has papers throughout the semester. He is the hardest grader I have ever seen. I reached out for help and he basically told me to drop the class. His exams are difficult. He makes everything difficult. None of his feed back is useful at all. I WOULD NOT take him if i was you. He is a nice guy. Just a poor professor.,0
"Avoid avoid!! This class was horrible! I wish I read the reviews before choosing this course. I failed both exams even though I did the study review. Only a handful of questions were actually on the test. George assigns 5 assignments to complete every week, it's impossible to keep up. Best advice: choose a different elective!!",0
"Class was emotionally tough based on content of material covered (Veterans, PTSD, Vet Programs and more). Mr. Darman is incredibly knowledgeable in this area and conveys information in a well organized lecture setting. He's a great teacher. There are written assignments, quizzes and tests. As long as you read and attend class you will succeed.",1
He is the example of how a man can flawlessly teach a course that covers WMST material. Teaching the course seemed natural for him and made learning more enjoyable. There were a group of students who challenged the material and al-Marashi gracefully presented material in ways they could better understand. He needs to teach more WMST classes!,1
Prof. Tortolani is a great professor for Italian. She always tells you what to expect on quizzes and teaches very well. I would highly recommend her for anyone who wants to get an A in Italian and enjoy it at the same time. She really wants all her students to pass and cares a lot about her students.,1
"Lectures are great and in-depth. The assignments were fairly easy. However, the problem with this course is the exams. The exams don't test one's programming skills properly . The questions were not particularly hard however a project or something along those lines would've been better suited for this course.",1
Easiest class at McGill. Gives Art of Listening a run for its money! The final is much harder than the midterm but still really easy. Ostry often cancels class due to mysterious trips to the US of A. Seriously take this course.,1
"She is definitely one of the worst teachers. Shes super rude and does not have that teacher compassion aspect. She does not care about fixing her own mistakes. When asking about correctness on assignments/grades, she totally dismisses what you are telling her when its HER fault that an assignment/grade is incorrect.",0
"If Humber is teaching the class you want, take it with him. He's able to explain even the hardest of concepts in a clear, concise way and then follows up with examples to further solidify your understanding. His tests can be tough, but he gives a ton of partial credit. To top it off, he's got a great sense of humor/really cares about his students.",1
great man!,1
He's good and not a bad guy or anything but he's a better researcher than lecturer. I do not understand why universities think that researchers will necessarily make good lecturers. Time and time again that has proven to be false. The course itself is easy but tedious.,1
LOVE Amy! She's so sweet and makes learning fun! Would totally recommend her class.,1
No Comments,1
"He is really fun and makes the lectures entertaining, I didn't do amazingly in the class because I struggle with multiple choice and there was soooo much content but he is a really good professor and really good at explaining.",1
"Fantastic class notes and overall approach to teaching the material. If you don't understand the material visiting him during office hours is like seeing a friend for help. Assignments can be challenging and the tests are fair. Anyone planning on taking Math1000, Dr. Dyer is the man",1
"Honest review here, Professor Fels is such a Fels. She has no idea how to teach this course because she's a researcher. She brings in guest lecturers that think we're high school students. Our exam was to write 15 pages of complete BS with questions that makes no sense. It Fels good to finish this term cause I can't stand another term with her.",0
Best in the college. Not a hard class. Pay attention to class.,1
Dr. Phil is amazing. He reads and responds to many of a sessions post with a personal story or real life event. He gives great references to assignments and answers questions quickly. He does not destroy your grade if you make a mistake in citing's. He understands life happens and will work with you. Best professor in the program.,1
"I have mixed feelings about Professor Al-Marashi, he really knows his material, he's also super funny and makes class pretty interesting. My only downfall is he doesn't grade anything, he has a payed grader. She grades extremely hard, almost everyone in the class failed the midterm. Thank God for that curve. Attendance is MANDATORY.",1
"Was a very difficult professor, but massively beneficial in that respect. Gives the toughest critiques, but also the best. Can be confusing; often changed grading criteria and requirements as projects went on, often at the tip of a hat or at the end of a project. Very experienced. Extremely hard, but extremely informative and educating.",1
She is the best! My favorite teacher by far. She gives homework but it's not hard. She is very helpful and wants her students to succeed. TAKE HER!!!!!,1
Professor Larson is a must take teacher at MCB! He really does engage his students and create an open and energetic atmosphere. I genuinely enjoyed his course and would recommend it to all!,1
Best Professor Ever! Like her lectures and the real world examples!,1
"I have taken tons of online classes before,  but this one was by far the best. Super well organized and it was loaded with game features like points, badges, etc... Best class I have taken at Concordia period.",1
Stacy is an INCREDIBLE teacher!!,1
BusComm 1 class is a necessary evil for getting your MBA. The silver lining: cute prof.  ,1
This class was by far the toughest class Ive taken thus far. Tests were extremely difficult as there were no study guides given and when asked what would need to be studied we were told our 18 pages of outlines. Tests were very heavy as there were only 4 in the semester 2 of which were the final and midterm.,0
This class was very interesting. I came in knowing absolutely nothing about the class and was really nervous because of that but Jacobson was a great professor who really teaches well.,1
Taking French 2 with him he expects us to be basically fluent in French and expects us to know every exact detail FROM French 1. Comes off friendly but can be uncaring and unsupportive of students who need help.,0
"He's amazing! He genuinely wants everyone to do well, and he is passionate about what he teaches! He goes slowly to make sure everyone understands the material, and he makes it clear what is on the quizzes and tests. You will not regret taking his class!!!",1
"Cathy is great. Her lectures and powerpoints aren't the best, but she gets you the information you need in order to pass. Her character shines bright, and she truly wants each student to succeed. She can be a space-cadet sometimes and needs to be reminded of things. But overall a good professor.",1
Professor Kamau is a great Professor. I just finished one class of his and am taking another! As long as you follow the syllabus and do your work you will receive an A.,1
Very aggressive,0
He was a great teacher and Im really excited to have through all my four years here in uni,1
"Dr. Thompson' class was so fun! Attendance isn't mandatory, but going earns you extra credit on exams and the tests are all based off of lectures. She keeps her lectures fun and engaging and she's so funny!! Highly recommend.",1
This class is based on a workbook that Professor Garland made herself. It is basically a lot of reflection work so I don't feel that it was a difficult class at all.,1
"BEST teacher ever!!!!! If you want to get A, just choose her class. ",1
Very solid teacher. Partovi is very knowledgable and he really tries to focus the class on the person who know the least which is a nice review. There were only three tests and a final paper though so you do need to do well on the assignments.,1
"very fair marker and entertaining lecturer (although sometimes irrelevant material) Go to the super tutorial, you'll get a good mark.",1
Dr Schwartz definitely cares about the students.  He wants you to do well by learning the material. Had extra classes to help and even had a special class on a Saturday.  He's there for you if you study. I'd take him again,1
She talks really fast and doesn't give you much time to take your notes. She is very easy grader on papers I have made 2 A's an 1 B. She is willing to help you. She isn't very good at checking email. She will also tell you that you have to address the emails or else she wont reply Her weekends are her personal time so don't email her then.,1
"Great professor. The course requires your undivided attention. Difficult subject matter, but she was always open to ""questions, comments, concerns and outrage"". Do not purchase the textbook, she used Aplia- an online homework service which you need to purchase for the class and it includes an electronic textbook. Aplia 35% of the grade, Tests 65%.",1
Mrs.Pittman is overall awesome! The content of her classes in hard but she makes it interesting with out of class events like church visits and such. She always works with students as far as completing missed work and for the midterm and final you will have all the answers!,1
No Comments,1
"Took him for orgo 1 online for COVID. He put the class onto a strict bell curve based solely on scores on two tests and a final that did not have feedback or regrades. His lectures, which were all made before class started, were extremely confusing. I learned mostly from the book as no other course materials is given. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Although you can miss days I wouldn't recommend it cause he tends to throw some curve balls in with the weekly quiz but he does do study guides for exams.  Overall he is an amazing teacher and has some interesting stories about his roses, and really gets you interested in plants in our daily lives.",1
This class is all group work literally ever single assignment and she grades so so hard my group got a 50 on just questions for an interview project and she offered no extra credit dont take this class,0
"Dr. Pan is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and takes the course at a great pace. His Materials Science class was one of the most enjoyable I've had so far. Learned a lot, two tests were fair, not much homework, no final.   Last month of the class was just group project presentations, which was actually pretty great!  Did I mention no final?",1
"he's a nice guy, work oriented. i'm just a fanatic of the field. i just wish he would take interest in all aspects of teaching both inside and outside the cassroom. i've cried i've laughed and i'm still breathing for the moment. take care sir. opportunity knocks at the door, but my knocking seems futile. this sample has too many associated errors.",0
"She deducts points fast!  I wish she inspired me and all the other students in class.  Even though I passed with an A, I would recommend any other student to take another instructor.",0
"Littlejohn is a good prof, like someone else said here she treats you as a 'person' and not as a student. She treats everyone on an equal level, and takes her teaching material and her students very seriously. Her lectures are interesting and overall, is a good prof.",1
"In MKT463, you'll have 3 tests, many homework assignments and a semester-long group project. Choose your team members wisely and re-read all homework articles before exams for a better grade. Overall, great course. Prof Rauschnabel is very understanding with his students and is one of the best at the COB.",1
"Very delightful teacher, I really recommend his class. He makes you view things in very different perspectives. I learned very much from this class.",1
"Dr. Guerra-Pujol is hilarious! He is also amazing at keeping students interested during lecture by being very animated and passionate about the topic. The grading criteria for the essays isn't clear but if you make an effort, you should get a decent score. There's a lot of reading but he talks about it in lecture and brings it full circle.",1
"Professor Tang is one of the best professors at Wesleyan. She has an amazing personality, incredible intellect, and gives phenomenal lectures.",1
"There's a lot of LONG power points. If you already have a basic knowledge of computer parts and how they work, some days will be boring. Lab days are the better part of class as everything is hands on. Requirements are a screwdriver, pliers and an antistatic wrist band for the class. Overall good teacher.",1
"Devin Gandy is by far one of the most knowledgeable professors at Mcneese. He can be very comical in his lectures, but he covers a very broad amount of topics and is very knowledgeable in each one. Gandy is one of my favorite professors Ive ever taken at Mcneese. He does not post notes online, you must attend class.",1
"When Mark is lecturing, he is enthusiastic and down-to-earth, tying taught material to systems and procedures in the industry very well. He is accessible and provides good advice on how to tackle the various group projects that encompass the entirety of the course. However, he seemed rather busy this semester and cancelled nearly all the labs.",1
No Comments,1
This is not a straightforward math class. If you have never seen physics before I advise you take general physics before taking his class. He is a very cool dude but he doesn't teach because his LA's do that. But if you need help on a problem he will be there to help you. Since this is modeling physics it is not for those who seek immediate answers,1
I love this man,1
 LOVE HER,1
He is such a great teacher! He doesnt sit up their and bore you with a lecture. He actually teaches so it is understandable. He also does so many examples to make sure students understand.,1
"Birx is one of the most remarkable teachers I've found at Canisius. He is betrothed in the material and the students. No matter the student or project, he was always able to find the redeeming qualities of a firearm and the areas where the student could push their work. On a personal level, Birx was one of my most influential instructors.",1
"Christy was great she was very helpful being I'm useless when it comes to science. She was very patient and helpful but the workload was consistent and she expected it to be done, on time. Lots of worksheets btw",1
I am taking Calculus with Professor Wang and it is a challenge that I am loving. I knew the course would be tough since I took algebra 13 years ago. Professor Wang's curriculum is making me earn my grade and I appreciate that. I don't agree with curves. This class is making me work hard and I am embracing that. Her lectures are paced well.,1
"Loved this class, read a lot of young adult novels that I enjoyed as a teen so it was nostalgic. Dr. Keeling is a very friendly, helpful professor but very specific on how she wants things done, such as her papers and journal entries. One novel every week is tough to get through esp. if you have a heavy workload for other classes but it's worth it",1
Honestly the most unorganized class I've ever had. I feel I could confidently say that about 75% of the class didn't know what was expected of them. A whole bunch of stuff was shown in lecture that would never be brought up again so you didn't know how to filter out what was important at all. Plus there are the readings which are pointless.,0
"I've never cried over a class in all the years I've been here, until I took policy with Rombo. Probably the worst experience ever. Gives little to no help, and makes you feel stupid when you ask for help. If you go to class or skip, you'll be 5 years behind, no matter what. Worst class and professor I've ever had at Oneonta",0
"She's really nice and she tries to involve her students into her lectures. Class participation counts but her lectures are interesting. I really enjoyed the class. Expect homework, she gives work about every class but it is nothing to the extreme.  She's a tough grader, but if you participate and do your work it will reflect in your paper grades.",1
"Ms. Lhota is a very nice lady. I had her for English 101, which she doesn't usually teach, but she still showed all of the qualities of a good professor. She is always willing to review your work and give you constructive feedback. Overall, Easy A, just do the essays and you're golden.",1
Loved it!,1
She was a very good teacher but i didnt feel like i learned alot from her classes.,1
"I think I estimated by the time I'm done I will have had something like 10 semesters of classes with Ken.  I'm a photo major, but still, if it weren't for him I probably wouldn't be one.  Very laid back, easy grader(AS LONG AS YOU DO THE WORK), get to know him, he's the coolest kid in school. ;D",1
Professor Olson is extremely passionate about anthropology and loves to share it with her students. The chapters are long and some of the subject matter is difficult. Pay attention because things you'd never expect will be in quizzes and tests. Be prepared to write and participate in the discussion boards - be original!,1
"Only three grades in the whole class: a midterm essay, a final essay, and participation. Make sure you speak up because he takes participation very seriously. In general, the class work was not difficult. We read short stories and poems and then wrote an essay on them.  You can tell that he really does know what he's talking about, which is great.",1
THE BEST professor by far. She explains everything so well and her lectures are posted on mycourses after every class period. As long as you STUDY you will do fine. It is a lot of information and takes effort.,1
Gerritsen is the best professor I've had in my entire college career. He is willing to help you succeed in lab. He should teach lectures for Cell biology and Genetics.,1
"Professor Mantell was amazing! She's probably the most caring professor I have ever had. Lectures can sometimes drag on and you don't realize when you stopped paying attention and it's not a very exciting subject matter, but take Professor Mantell... she will get you through it!",1
overall great math teacher! i'd recommend him to anyone who has difficulty with math because he's always willing to break things down for you if you miss a class or just need some extra help on something!,1
Dr. Miura did not give a single lecture during this COVID-19 pandemic and was extremely hard to reach during these hard times and during the normal semester. He is not specific nor clear in his grading criteria and when asked for feedback he takes very long to give answer back. Lectures are long and boring! Do not take his class!,0
"He was an awesome spanish teacher, constantly updated our assignments, percentages, breakdowns, and grades online, so you always knew how you were doing in class. Tests are easy if you pay attention in class and do the class/homework.  Couldnt have picked a better teacher! You use the textbook everyday, so buy it!",1
"this course has such bare content that it could be compressed easily into half a semester. the prof has a likable personality. hes not a bad teacher but doesnt go above and beyond either. do the questions in the book but expect a little tougher on the exam, and you should be ok.",1
Stephen Maiullo is an amazing prof. He cares about his students and understands how to teach a language well. Although the class is very hard taking it with Maiullo makes it 100x better.,1
I have never had a professor who is as dedicated to his work and to the success of his students Professor Dattolo goes out of his way to help us learn. If you ever need him he is always available to help you. His kindness and respect is greatly appreciated and his lectures are second to none!,1
"Obviously the student who complains about the recommended books does not read. I read the books recommended by the professor. Some have changed my life. He teaches with a level of enthusiasm I've not seen before. He grades grammar, and those who complain do not know proper English. Really, after 4 years at WSU? I appreciate Dr. Alderete. Thank you.",1
"A bit spazzy but she was a good professor. 3 tests that consists of multiple choice & short answer questions on vocab terms. Study the vocab and the powerpoints she posts on Bb, and you will definitely ace the tests. She gives out few paper assignments and one newspaper article assignment that you present in class (very informal presentation).",1
"horrible teacher! I have trouble staying awake in class, let alone pay attention and try to learn! Finals are beyond anything we've ever done before! Avoid taking his class at all costs. You'll be so much happier without him!",0
By far the best teacher I've ever had. Tests are from lectures (so record them). Do lab questions before going to lab. If you're ahead of the game she will appreciate that. Always ask a lot of questions. She's extremely smart & a very impressive teacher. I learned so much from her. Highly recommend for future RNs. You won't regret taking her class.,1
"YES she is hard to approach... However, she acts like than only when she knows the student is not making any effort! The BEST way to piss her off if to give her late work or ask last minute question the day the assignment is due. Other than that if you work hard and do what you got to do she is a GREAT support and help!",1
I am not a science person but I'm so glad I took my science courses with Christy. She was so patient with helping me understand each lesson. Her lectures were so thorough and clear! I would deff recommend her!!!,1
"I am married and I have a full time job. This class requires a lot of work and effort, but well worth it. Arnold is enthusiastic about the subject and offers a variety of ways to engage our future students. I attended every class and I received emails within 24 hours; she never kept us late! Team Arnold.",1
"BEST MATH PROF at SCCC, she makes sure you understand the material in lecture and on tests, I took a class with her & Prof Ferrigno and it was OUTSTANDING! Tests based off homework problems so do your homework and you will be fine! EXTRA CREDIT IS GIVEN ALL THE TIME! Attendance is mandatory and well worth the time! TAKE THIS PROF! 10/10 !",1
"Very nice teacher. class'll get hard but he explains everything crystal clear. he always took time to explain an extra problem after class to make sure I understood the material. Taking notes is mandatory in order to pass but all problems he writes in class are literally the tools to you'll need for HW, quizzes & exams! would take again w/o a doubt",1
I had so much fun listening to her talk. I enjoyed all of her stories because she tried to tie in real life aspects to help the students better understand the material. If you ever have a question never hesitate to go to her office and ask her. I loved her class and would take it again!,1
Awesome!!!  Highly recommend the course.  2 observations a little out of the comfort zone but attainable.  Great discussion board topics and easy final!  Easy A if you do the work.  Professor is professional and easy to contact.,1
Jeff is a really hot teacher. Hes always five minutes late atleast but its ok because his looks make up for that. He is somewhat interest in what hes talking about but gets off topic fast. He assigned little/no tests so its hard to stay on track.,1
"Honestly I'm already taking my major classes and I just had to retake precal because I withdraw from the course my first time taking it. So in my opinion it was so hard to stay awake, I found it boring and useless but that mostly because I know I won't be utilizing what he's teaching.  He teaches the the very last second!",1
"Sigal's exams are very tough, don't take her class. Her husband (math prof David Earn) is really hot :)",0
"Very nice, willing to help as long as you do the work, just do the work and study and you will end up doing well. English isn't my first language and she was very understanding about that. Wish I could take her again! (:",1
"Brilliant man, witty, real, & makes you think. he knows when students aren't trying, don't patronize him, or waste his time.. he cares a lot about whether or not his students care. if you take good notes, and pay attention you don't need the book, he is really thorough. Don't text, go late or leave early. It's just rude and clearly bothers him.",1
"Very difficult class.  He pushed us very very hard.  He was willing to help me whenever I got really stuck, but made me do everything that he thought I could possibly do by myself.  He made me stretch to do my best.  It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.",1

He's a super thorough professor! Lectures are intriguing as he always has fresh takes for each reading and points out details you probably missed while reading. Definitely do not skip and make sure you pay attention. He's a bit deadpan but funny when he wants to be,1
"The classes at boring all she does is read of the power point and posts it up on BB. its 3 exams, 1 final, a group projects and presentation which is 9 service learning hours, and a 5pg term paper. she offers extra credit worth 5 points. test are average not too hard, takes forever going over the chapters, behind of schedule for exams.",0
Probably the best professor in the school. Highly recommend taking him. I was lost a couple of times but going up to him and asking him questions is what helped me. Chet makes sure his students know what he's talking about. He'll even make up funny strategies and gestures to make the material stick in ones mind. Ill never forget this guy.,1
"Very helpful! Never a moment to be board in her classes. She's by far the most enthuiastic, on task, and organized professor ive ever had. Very flexable for students with full time jobs. I had her with 2 CDEV classes and she was conistant in both and just as encouraging.",1
I took him for organic chemistry and I do not recommend! He goes by notes only and doesnt really teach you anything. One time during a lecture a classmate asked if he could go back a slide because she did not understand and he told her its on the slide show in moodle Also does not really reply to emails or sends short replies,0
"She is an amazing professor. She cares about all her students individually and wants you to succeed. She has papers due every week, which seemed really overwhelming at first but once I got going, I realized she was pushing us to be better in every aspect. Keep up on the assignments and discussion boards. She is authentic and hilarious. #failforward",1
"Professor Reddy was amazing, but she is very lecture heavy and goes through the material very fast. She talks very fast, like she's trying to catch a train. The videos she shows in class are very helpful. The test questions were based from the slides she used in class, I highly recommend.",1
"many of the previous reviews were in large lecture halls, i've taken him for quite a few classes, including a small seminar with less than 20 students.  he does have a thick russian accent, but good luck finding a prof in the math department who doesn't. his tests are pleasantly challenging. he's a fun guy who has a passion for what he does.",1
REL 1312 She cares about students. Tell funny stories to break up hard material. I would take her again because I learned a lot.,1
I can't believe she even got a 2. She is a really bad teacher.,0
"HARD CLASS.  Not an easy grader AT ALL.  I didn't get an A on any of her papers.  (she actually gave me two 89%, like come on..just give me the 90%)  Shes very very nice, but tough.",1
Took this class this past summer. Interesting guy who truly enjoys teaching students about Genetics. His test came straight from previous quizzes and exams or the class notes. He was willing to help you out in any way you needed.  He really made the class interesting. I would recommend him to anyone! Didn't need the book once.,1
Such a great  professor! The material is very insightful. He really breaks down the readings for you in his lectures. Definitely ask questions and participate in discussion. You get quizzed every class but if you just do the readings you will be fine. There is so much extra credit at the end of the semester it would be hard to not pass with an A.,1
"He might come off like a jerk at first, but honestly as long as you treat him with respect he will treat you with respect. He is very specific with his syllabus and he has a midterm and final based ONLY on his lectures, and they are worth 50% of your grade. The other 50% is based on Learnsmart activities online- super easy but a bit time consuming.",1
No Comments,1
"Hes a little shy, but he listens to reasonable arguments that are made about subject material. He is a good prof to have, looks fresh out of grad school. You have to read the book, but he does offer help about things that you might not understand. Almost no homework.Outlining the chapter the night before is the best way to go in his class.",1
Best professor I ever had. Politics is not my thing but at the end of the semester I feel like I have something to say and that I am better prepared for my upper level college classes. I reccomend Dr. B!,1
"Dr. McCartneys civic engagement class is by far the toughest class I've taken- but it was worth every second of work. She causes her students to strive to be engaged, I wanted to work even harder because of the possibility of putting it on my resume! definitely recommended.",1
He wasnt helpful at all. He teaches too fast and doesnt explain well and gets an attitude when you ask questions or dont know about the lesson. He drops you out of class with no notice if your grade is low. He doesnt tell you that your grade is low. He is just a person who isnt understanding at all and doesnt consider anything.,0
"This dude is a jerk. I DID NOT want to take him bc everyone told me I shouldn't, but he was the only one teaching this req course. I've passed all my 4000 level courses with A or A+ but this guy graded me down insanely at every turn. Unreasonably hard reader, is mean about opinions he disagrees with. Only passed how I did by acing the final 110%",0
"Microbiology is freaking hard. Hardest course I have ever taken and I have excelled at college level courses. He's very understanding and tries to work with you, honestly, a really nice guy! It's not his fault that the material is difficult. He did a good job with dense, hard to understand material.",1
"The ASL class had a pleasant and quiet atmosphere. We didn't speak and really immersed ourselves in the language. The way she went about teaching without speaking wasn't hard to follow at all, like you may think. I would take the next ASL class with her again if I had the opportunity to do so.",1
Best professor ever !! She is a great human being. You will utilize your textbook- so make sure u buy it.,1
"Loved his class!!! he is very knowledgeable, helpful and organized. His grading system is very fair. He gives excellent blueprints before each test. Take him! You won't regret it:-)",1
"Dr. Druffel is the nicest professor at UCI.  She genuinely wants her students to do well & provides multiple opportunities to gain points. The course material is a little dry, but that's not her fault! She tries to make it as interesting as possible, and as long as you come to class and do the homework, you will do well in her class.",1
"Although personally I liked him, and I thought that he was super passionate about science, a lot of times I felt like he couldn't properly explain concepts to us. Nice guy, but I'm not sure I'd take him again unless I have to. ",0
"Professor Mantell made doing labs on Labster (online) easier and interesting. For discussions, we reflected on what we learned each week. Reading other students' responses helped me understand important concepts from the course. Her grading was easily understood, and the midterm and final efficiently reflected course material.",1
"Honestly learned absolutely nothing, and she was one of the worst teachers I've ever had. I am not very good at math, so I was hoping I could utilize her office hours, but whenever I went she would do nothing but complain about her life, and told me to ""work harder"". I would NOT recommend this class to anyone.",0
Awful prof. Condescending attitude towards students. Sometimes she messed up her lessons & was corrected by her students. MC tests were horrible. I dropped this class the day before the last drop day. The material was interesting but I don't recommend this class if she's teaching it.,0
"She is very knowledgable, but not really willing to share this knowledge outside of the classroom. Not really helpful during office hours. Her class slides are very general and lack examples and explanations. Again she explains the material good, but not really passionate about it, so her lectures are pretty boring.",0
"Take Her she is awesome, and very nice!!! I wish all the professors I have taken were like her",1
"Hey knows his stuff.  He tends to teach a little fast, but will go back and explain if you don't understand.  Really nice guy and easy to talk to if confused.  Only 12 quizzes and 4 tests.  Must study for tests!!!!  Very important that you go to class, he goes over everything that you need to know!",1
I would take her every semester if I could.,1
"My name is Keri, i took Mr. Petro's intermediate algebra class in the fall of 08'. He can be intimidating at first but was always willing to help me with equasions before class. I can barely add 2+2 but i tried my butt off and Mr. perto encouraged me alot. Thanks Mr. P.!",1
"Her class was so easy. Wrote 2, 1 page essays all year. When you had class all you would do is answer a few textbook questions and she grades very easily!",1
"I loved her. She improved my writing more than I could have ever imagined and gives amazing feedback when she returns your essays. Would take her for every English course available if I could. Take her and I promise if you put in the effort, you will do great.",1
"Take this class, it's so easy. All you have to do is show up and say at least two things a day to get an A.  I didn't really participate so I got a B, but overall he's a very laid back teacher.",1
"I've never failed a course until I took this class. I know at least 6 others who failed, and not for lack of trying either. Early in the term I expressed concern for my grade, and he just told me to drop the class, pick another major. He grades tests and essays on an unbelievably hard scale.  I no longer even want to major in psychology.",0
Probably the most reasonable and understanding professor I've ever had. Always willing to give you more time if you need it.,1
"He is a great teacher, lots of fun! You watch lots of movies and clips, and all of his notes are on Power Point on the School website. Quizzes for each chapter, but those quizzes are the same questions as the test, so you have seen them before. GREAT teacher! Highly recommended.",1
"Hands down favorite professor. She taught me so much and got me interested in the news and political events. She has her views on things and she is willing to fight for them. Gives lots of extra credit, gives attendance points, she gives you outlines for each chapter so learn the outline and skim the chapters in the book. You'll  get an A.",1
"I wouldn't say the class is hard but it is demanding. As long as you are good at taking notes and preparing for tests, you should at least get a B. He is a very fair grader, and after the first test the following get easier. The lectures are funny and interesting too, if you pay attention you'll be able to connect and understand concepts easily-ish",1
Lots of work.  Nice guy though.,1
This is the best class I've taken so far at FSCJ. I looked forward to every class. This guy is a really good teacher. Highly recommended.,1
Great professor... fun and funny.  Makes you think critically and respects your opinion.,1
She is very uptight and does not know how to talk and understand students. She knows the material but ends up giving only lectures. Never leaves room for interpretation and is very rude with her answers.,0
"Linguistics is about language in general, but i think i learned more about mixtec than anything else. If you don't mind that, you'll like the class. Nice woman, easy class, lecture notes online.",1
"She was eager to help and very understandable. She explained it in a way that even I, being someone who doesn't usually understand math, could understand. It took her a long time to return our assignments and I did not know my grade in the class until the very end... But she made math fun!",1
Do not take this class. His lecture are boring and his exam extremely difficult. He doesn't know how to teach a class. RUNNNNNNNNNNNNN from this class and from this professor. If you want to fail a class take this one!,0
"professor potion is a very cool guy. when it comes to teaching however, he kind of goes around your questions and makes you questions everything and it can be frustrating. the whole class you'll be confused and he only really teaches if you're in his group(there are three groups and he only teaches on of them).",1
"Dr. Laflin doesn't really interact with the class, by more so her TA does, being Mr. Burkett. Burkett is wonderful and provides excellent feedback. You have weekly readings and projects (not hard at all though). No quizzes. 3 exams all semester. Do the work and you will get an A. Lots of extra credit as well.",1
"AWFUL TEACHER! If your interested in Asian art don't take her class--you retain notihng because she doesn't have herself together enough to be a teacher. She is moody, nasty, and really difficult to get along with. You will dread going to class! She grades unfairly, its all subjective. She puts down everyone-evn those who thought they were ""friends",0
"Very nice and so sweet. Be careful if you're anything but conservative. Her views are really right-winged and traditional. Overall, a great instructor just take everything she says with a grain of salt.",1
"Not super difficult. We had 3 papers with criteria that were extremely clear. He is not a difficult grader, but make sure you show up to lectures because his papers are based on what he says. Textbook readings were all online and relevant to the class. He is pretty funny and lectures always went by fast",1
I loved Professor Mack! She is entertaining and really cares for her students. Semester long group project and discussions every week so don't skip class. Tests are not too difficult if you study the information from each chapter. Definitely one of my favorite teachers at CofC.,1
Great Prof.,1
"She is an intimiating women. She is a great teacher. If you are serious about being in the medical field, take her.",1
I loved her!,1
"Probably my favorite person in the whole entire world. He is such a sweet man and really knows what he is talking about. I have him for both theory and aural and he is there to be sure you really understand everything. I recommend him to anyone! Not to forget, he is a GREAT piano player so I also recommend him for an accompanist! ",1
"Professor Elliott is a very sweet lady. Like with any English course, the material can be very dry at times, but she facilitates great class discussion. She also offers many extra credit opportunities so take advantage of them, because they will come in handy! Tests cover a lot, but are not impossible. Prioritize the time spent on writing essays!",1
"Definitely accurate on all the positive comments: good sense of humor, passionate about his class. But he's a tough grader FOR SURE and if you don't come to class? It's over. Important to TAKE TIME TO READ!!! Fiction and poetry unit are currently killing me... Stay involved and I'm sure you'll make it through.",1
Great professor! Explains concepts really clearly.,1
"The way he teaches is perfect for my learning style.  students complain that he repeats things over and over, but I believe this is a good way to learn. This class scared me so much that I waited until the end of my A.S. program to take it. It wasn't bad.  lots of memorization with definition and codes. Just pay attention and you will be fine .",1
Best prof I've had to date.,1
"She is a good researcher, but defintely not a good lecturer. My mind went blank soon after listening to her. Lecture slides are pointless and reading the textbook is a must to pass. Even if you do so you still miss points due to the unncessary details and confusion you will see the MC questions during the tests. Be warned.",0
"There is not enough great things I can say about Professor Chase! You definitely should show up to every class because his lectures are very helpful for exams. But honestly his lectures are so interesting that you will want to show up every class and he tells you exactly what you should study. A True Gem of a Professor, 100% recommend!",1
VERY passionate about astronomy. Tests aren't too bad as long as you study because they aren't open note like the other astronomy teacher. It's just boring as hell. He gives extra credit opportunities though. It's not the worst class I've ever taken.,1
"Took her class for UI100, and while it was a lot of busy work, as long as you did it, you should pass with an A. There aren't tests, just a few presentations that she gives you 2-3 weeks to put together. I reccomend it",1
"Dr. Rogers is caring and helpful! Her lecture is amazing, try to attend every lecture you will get 5%. Try to take her course, and you wont regret your decision! Sometimes there will be some problems about grade calculations. Dont hesitate, come to her office hours and tell her your situation! Miracles will happen!",1
WORST ACCT TEACHER AT CLEMSON!! DOESNT UNDERSTAND THAT ACCOUNTING IS DONE ON THE COMPUTER NOW...NOT BY HAND!! MAKE SURE YOU LOVE WRITING OUT YOUR ACCT PROBLEMS IN A BLUE BOOK BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS TEACHER.,0
I can count on the fingers of one hand the professors at ASU that I can say that their class changed my ways of thinking. However Dr. Aviles class was one of them. I took Approaches to Pop Culture and it was one of the most interesting classes I ever had. I STRONGLY recommend him.,1
"I loved Dr. Lamkin's class. I learned so much information from her! It's a tough class no matter what so prepare to work hard but she really wants to help you succeed. She gives a TON of extra credit (probably 75 pts or so). There are a lot of exams (5 lecture exams, 5 lab exams, 6 quizzes) but she drops 1 of each. I would definitely recommend her.",1
Knows what he is talking about. Very good lecturer. Tests are difficult. Final exam is one of the most difficult exams you could take.,1
take this class this guy is so cool and funny. like he doens't take the class super serious seriously one of the best classes i took.. TAKE HIM!!,1
"Mrs. Booth is an excellent instructor! If you study the notes from the lectures, you will have a good chance of making a good grade on her tests. She is very funny and loves classroom participation. Mrs. Booth also likes to answer questions and appreciates occasional humor from the students as well. Overall, I would highly recommend her!",1
"Dr. Auten is a great professor. 7-8 labs, 1 midterm and a final. 1 group presentation before the final exam. Every week there's a chance you'll get picked to present an article regarding a certain topic. Don't sweat it, chances are you may not even have to go but if you volunteer, you get extra credit. This class is not that hard, take it.",1
"She grades based on effort so if you do the work, you get the credit. There are no right or wrong answers in this class. She grades it on two categories: ""Meets expectations"" and ""Exceeds expectations""; either put more effort to get a 4.0 or do the bare minimum and pass the class with an 85%. She's the easiest professor I've had at UWT.",1
"I personally hate this class. The layout of the class makes no sense. The countries are scattered and the order is not related. He constantly talks about the ""Universal Pattern of Culture"" which is in no other academic source online or otherwise. The only source I have found that has anything similar contrasts his definitions completely.",0
"Waxler is a very smart man and gives good lectures, but that's it. He is very old fashioned in his teaching style and doesn't really engage with anyone in class. I went to ask for help with him once and it felt like an interrogation. Make sure you don't get sick or miss a class ever.",0
She is a great professor. Very sweet and helpful. I would take her again!,1
He's difficult to adapt to. Had a tough time following his lectures.,0
"Kelli is absolutely hilarious and her lectures are really interactive and engaging. However, the lectures do not seem to be very relevant to the tests. Attendance isnt mandatory, but she has Industry Exercises randomly in class (usually its posted somewhere on canvas beforehand so you know its happening, just have to be smart enough to look).",1
She is the head on Information Systems in FGCU. She is lazy does not want to teach. She is unethical and uses her power to control students. She even creates conflicts in the schedule for students drop her class. She refuses to help and she gives projects with very little clarity. Out of 8 chapters she only talked about 20 minutes about 2 of them b,0
"ME 340 with Professor Brennan was one of the best classes I've taken at Penn State.  He is very clear in everything from his lectures to his expectations in terms of assignments.  He's also incredibly motivational; I always looked forward to going to class because even though the book is a little dry, he made the course interesting and enjoyable.",1
"He does not care about his students. Terrible at explaining things and if you dont catch on right away, he doesnt help you.",0
"Dr. Mueller uses the POGIL method which definitely has its pros and cons. Overall, I would say it works. People complain about wanting just lectures but then just space out don't learn anything from them. I definitely feel like I have retained more info from using POGIL. Dr. Mueller is also a great guy. Will always help you when needed and really c",1
"This guy is terrible. I'm a ME major, this course is needed, and I have never gotten below a 84 in any previous math class. Makovers handwriting is bad, he jumps all over the place, he'll change numbers in examples or put an equation into mathmatica if he can't figure it out, and he goes way to fast. Avoid him at all costs.",0
Well so far the notes don't really match up with the test. Its as if he wants you to master all the info for every test. The book does not seem to help. The average for exam 1 was just above 70...most ppl I talked to made in the 50's... vary hard class lets hope it ends well...only take if you really really need to.,0
Well No Lie he has great stories though I'm sure if we stuck to the syllabus this class could have easily been a half semester class. He goes on and on and on with stories though that can be tiring and completely not go over what we should have in that class. Takes forever with grading things and giving them back. Not Emailer friendly.,1
She is a very nice woman. I really enjoyed her class because she made me comfortable for my first year of college. Her grading is very lenient and she is very understanding towards her students. Her class is an easy A and I would definitely take again!,1
"Professor Hurley is an awesome Accounting Professor. He really wants his students to learn accounting, and uses real life examples to make it easier. He rocks! If you have the opportunity to take him, definitely do it! One of the best at MassBay!",1
His class is informative and interesting. He uses real-world experience and examples to help us understand what the book is trying to teach. Tests are open book as well.,1
"Mr. Tyson is my favorite instructor so far at MSU and I'm a sophomore. I took PLS 101 for a gen ed and loved it because of Tyson. He is hilarious and teaches his information clearly and will go above and beyond to give examples and really make sure you understand it. There aren't many tests, no papers, or homework assignments. TAKE HIM! :)",1
"I'm not sure how Mr. Nelson does not have 10000 stars. He is the kindest man ever, who wants to hand out A's to his students. He gives you the test before you take it, and if you come to class and listen to him, you have all the answers to the test. He's passionate about history and just such a nice guy in general. A great teacher",1
Prof Hinshaw is amazing. His lectures are incredibly clear and interesting. He is fair and helpful. I tend to sleep through many of my classes but never this one!,1
"I loved this class. The professor makes his lectures truly interesting and engaging. He's easily the best professor I've had at this school, I definitely recommend his class!",1
"The material of the course was quite difficult, however Abdallah teaches it very well.",1
"You MUST read the book, you'll fail if you don't. Code not required, so buy used. All tests have extra credit (10 pts max) DO ALL OF THEM!! She answers all questions asked. Printed notes are okay, but reading the book helps you understand WAY more. Labs were fun, pretty cool stuff. You won't regret taking Prof. Sieber.",1
"Great professor. What made the class difficult was the material, not the professor. Her lectures are very interesting and she treats you as if you are all equals and just as intelligent as she is. There is a reason she has a 4.7 on her and for organic chemistry, this teacher should be your number one priority pick.",1
Dr. Brown is very funny and uses real-world experiences to help you understand the material better. He's very real with his students and has a wonderful class atmosphere. His classes are easy if you study properly. Outside of class he goes above and beyond to open opportunities to students in the EHS department.,1
"Textbook was mad expensive, homework assignments were a time suck but not difficult in the least. The amount of studying for the exam does not correlate at all with your grade. Final exam is killer, which requires way too much memorization. This class is no longer an Easy A, do not take it if you have heard that it was.",0
"Easiest class I've ever taken. Didn't read one of the books he assigned. Can google everything and get by. A lot of writing but hes a lenient grader, very open minded",1
"Dr. B is extremely passionate about what she teaches. She in knowledge about environmental science and that shows through her lectures. All of the texts are hand written but that only makes you study harder so you actually can recall the material youve learned. If youre passionate about environmental science, youll enjoy it!",1
"Get ready to have to do at least 50 pages of reading (textbook and articles), watch 30-45 mins of videos AND read about 20-30 powerpoint slides PER WEEK. The quizzes are open book, but the questions are so specific that, no matter how much you prepare/study, you will still have no idea what's going on. Also, lots of trick questions.",0
"Jacobson was great, she was entertaining and kept relaying her materials back to everyday life. I enjoyed the class and will look for classes from her again!",1
"One of my favorite teachers. He is very kind, helpful and patient to answer all your questions. I learned a lot of useful software in his class. Some people say he has heavy accent, but it's not hard to understand. Why not look at everything with a more inclusive mind? Great teacher, I regret not having met him earlier.",1
She was unfair at grading and made the class a living hell.  I now HATE animation class and never want her as a teacher again.  Worse time of my life.  She is good but expects too much from you and the grading is unfair and bias.,0
"This class is graded evenly between 2 tests and the pop quiz grade. He expects you to put in a lot of extra hours a week into reading the textbook, make sure you own one. I genuinely thought I was going to fail this class or have to change it to credit/no credit, which a lot of other students did in my class. I haven't worked harder in any class.",1
Best teacher i ever had here so far... If she would teach Anatomy and Physiology i would take her..Basically if u have her. save all of ur exams because u will see it again in the end of the semester.,1
"Highly recommend. 7DB 5 Exams, 6 Team assignments. Group project. Pharmasim was a challenge, professor was very helpful with feedback almost instantly. A good group was a plus for this class.",1
"She is a most excellent guide. I took the online class, so there's no actual teaching going on, but she has set everything up in pearson right nice. Just watch the videos and read your textbook to figure out how to solve the math problems and you will be fine. The textbook is your best friend in this class.",1
"I took this class on M and W from 9-11. It was such a boring class but she just stands up front and talks the whole time. I usually did papers for English or shop online. She does give quite a bit of assignments, but honestly they're not hard. The test are on blackboard and I just copied the questions in Google. Attendence is important unless sick.",1
Professor Bonner is a great teacher who guides students to understand all of the material. He would not leave anyone behind and would answer any questions people had. He is easily the best teacher i have had. I highly recommend you take him if you get a chance!,1
" Her agenda is to ""defend"" agriculture. With all of the inefficiencies in agriculture right now it was heart breaking  to see a PhD  professor dance around the problems we face with pollution and resistance. We spent absolutely no time trying to look at new solutions but focus on how laypeople give ag a bad name. It made me uncomfortable and sad.  ",1
Excellent prof. She explains things so well and is passionate about thermodynamics. Knowing that the prof loves the material makes it so much easier to want to learn it.,1
"He is by far the best professor I ever had at Fordham. Accounting is a tough subject, but he makes it easy and clear. Just read the textbook and his notes, and you are good to go.",1
"Dr Rogers is my favourite professor at Concordia. She is a brilliant prof whom not only gives you a solid understanding of Chemistry topics, but makes them land in a way that pertains to real life; not just a calculation on some exam. She is legendary!",1
"Such a sweet lady, wants you to do good and offers so many useful aids that help study for the tests soo much. She uploads study guides, she holds review sessions, and uploads optional practice quizzes which all help to study for the test. If you pay attention and use the resources provided you will do well",1
Easy A. Be aware that there is a $90 course fee.,1
Dr. Guerra is the BEST professor I have had at UCF. He is so amazing it really makes this class a joy. You can tell he is passionate about his craft and wants to see you succeed. Take this class along with tough classes to give yourself a break.,1
"Her dedication and caring are awesome. Only two negatives that I can see. First, she tends to be rigid about the usefulness of the techniques in which she instructs, and two, she gives many, many techniques on which we experiment in class but she doesn't allow adequate time to complete them. Wonderful person, though.",1
"I had Dr. King for Cells, Systems, and their Environments and I LOVE him!!! Although this was a very tough class, Dr. King is a fabulous professor. He really knows his stuff (which makes the tests and quizzes hard). But despite that he is very helpful in office hours.... really get to know him! He loves to build relationships with his students.",1
Completely aloof. Doesnt communicate at all. Doesnt respond to emails.,0
His class was super easy just make sure you pay attention in class! The only down side is that he takes dayssss to reply to your email.,1
Great class! He expects alot from students and grades very hard. But that made me just want to work harder. Great classroom discussions. Loved the book.,1
"Extemely intelligent and insiteful woman.  Fantasic teacher, failed acct 1 then took her and got an A-  Makes students enjoy the subject and applies it to everyday situations.  Also, doesn't hurt that she is quite attractive :)",1
"Took this class online - there 4 books, with necessary reading in each to pass the weekly quizzes. There are a few weekly discussions with required responses to classmates. Three journals and one paper where you reflect on your personalprofessional life. Tons of extra credit opportunities! No excuse to get a grade lower than a B...",1
"I appreciate the effort he puts in to try to make the class engaging, but at the end of the day what matters is his ability to teach and properly assess the material, which is mediocre at best. Seems to lack empathy for students. When the exam average was in the 50's, he just said that was normal and made no effort to help or improve.",0
"My 2nd favorite professor out of all my semesters at hostos. She's understanding, funny, & makes the information understandable & super fun to learn. Highly recommend you take her!",1
This class seemed easy until finals came around. She makes the chest sheet for you which for me is not very helpful as what makes sense to her does not make sense to me. She was however very understanding during the other parts of the course I doubt Ill pass this class.,0

"Great Class!  I would definitely take him again, but this was all I needed.",1
Take him he understands micro very well! I'm surprised he doesn't have a much better rating he is a very great professor! Highly recommended!,1
"I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket",0
"strongly recommend, you will get a curve in this class.",1
Very hard to understand. And moves very fast. She tries to cram a week worth in one class.,0
She is amazing professor who was not only helpful with class material but promoted her students to grow as people. She was a sweet lady whos tests are fair if you study and she grades her papers in a more critical approach. I would 100% go to another of her classes,1
Professor Pittman is awesome! She is enthusiastic and really knows the material she is teaching. She is also super personable and helpful if you ask. I would take any class taught by her; I think she could make any topic fascinating because of her own enthusiasm. ,1
"he is not helpful at all,",0
"Dr. Creed is one of the best teachers on this campus. This class is hard and he makes you work for a good grade. But if you put in the effort and get on his good side, youll be golden.",1
"Take great notes!  Two exams, all writing.  Write two papers.  He is a tough grader, BUT you have the choice of giving him a rough draft beforehand.  If you do this, he will advise you on what needs fixed in your paper.  Loved the class!  Great Professor!  I worked extra hard, and was able to get an A!  He rarely gives those out!  All about effort!",1
Great Class. Chance to write. Nice workshops. Meets w/ u to help.  write one complete short story in the semester.  See others work.  Everyone comments on each other's work so be able to take comments.,1
Best professor take her!!!!!!!,1
"Dr. Crockett is a really great professor! Amazing feedback and very nice lectures. The book was definitely not a fun read, but her lectures got me through the material. There was a good amount of assignments each week, but I was more than prepared for them. I hope I'll have her again!",1
"To be fair, Madame Petcoff was pulled in as a replacement for a prof who took ill. That said, she was extremely disorganized. She often promised to put notes on Moodle and only remembered once, wasn't available for office hours, didn't respond to emails, and changed the contents of exams the day of the exam or two days before. It was rough.",0
"He's a very odd guy, but knows his stuff. I didn't open the book once and just took notes in class. Test questions are directly from the notes so pay attention. I got an A in the class. (:",1
Professor Nguyen was fantastic. He even gave you the discussion topic if you emailed him nicely.,1
"Prof. Perez is great, not very organized though and yes, she reads the slides. But, if you ask her a question she will respond and with examples. She gives a lot of extra credit and participation is a plus. People who give a bad review are just lazy and do not want to study, they want an easy A.",1
"Really recommend Engelhardt. Great guy, funny, always there to help. Really clear and wants you to learn.",1
"For the love of God, do not take him! If you didn't know, he is a world-renowned physicist (not exaggerating), and he is forced to teach so that he can keep his research money flowing in. So please, DO NOT take him! He only cares about his research. His tests are 3 questions (9 parts), and he doesn't curve, even if the class average is a 40. AVOID!",0
"Excellent Professor. Lectures are solid and to the point. She entertains hypothetical and ""silly"" questions gracefully. DO THE READING! Otherwise you will be lost. Clausen won't make you look bad if you don't (others will) but you will get left behind. Your fault not hers. Definitly want her again for other classes!",1
Yonn is a lively individual who enjoys the teacher/student seperation. His teaching style is very ecentric and a bit off the wall at times. overal pretty good instructor. just dont expect him to talk/make eye contact outside of class w you,1
"Matt is tough, but a great professor. You will learn a lot in his classes. He really knows his stuff, and is very helpful outside of class.",1
The most caring profesora in the department.  She can be very strict but she will work with you to excel not only in your class but also in your desire to be fluent in Spanish.  You have to do your homework and focus in class.  I just wish all teachers were like her .  I highly recommend her. She is a darling!,1
"Professor Xian has a very good way of simplifying the topics discussed to help us understand it quicker. When students asked questions that were related to the topic discussed, but on a more personal example, the professor was professional and ethical with her answers. If students looked confused or needed clarification on topics discussed, the pro",1
"She is so entertaining and such a great professor. Lectures are pretty tolerable because she's so animated. There are pop quizzes, but she only counts a handful of them so its not really worth stressing if you don't show up/fail it. The only annoying things about this course is that there's a lot of reading every night.",1
I took her class twice and found out there was other people in the same class that took her class twice. I notice people dropping her class with complaints I truly thought I was doing great in her class to find out I got a D at the end of the semester now I have to retake the class before I can take any other my classes ,0
extremely interesting professor. you'll like her,1
"Jill was by far one of the greatest teachers I have ever had. She was so encouraging & a great motivator. She wanted to make sure when her students walked out of the class room,they had a clear understanding of the nursing concepts. She made sure it was a stress free & relaxing environment for all. It was a tough course, but very fun & informative.",1
"I took Dr. Rich's Intro to Psych and absolutely loved it. She made lectures fun and enjoyable. Her exams are extremely fair, a good mixture of what is covered in lecture and also what is in the text. Reading the text book and actually going to lecture (instead of watching the recording) is mandatory for an easy A",1
"Worst teacher, why am I even calling him a teacher. EVERYONE failed EVERY test, highest test avg for class was a 52, with a 20 point curve. ",0
"Dr. Ayers is awesome. Dry sense of humor and knows his stuff. No textbook but he does assign a case to read every week, honestly they were interesting reads- not boring at all. Midterm & final all short answer questions. if you go to classtake notes on main ideasEasy A. I really like his class structure- 90% discussion. Def. will take him again!!",1
"You don't really have to show up for class, she never takes attendance; very boring. She puts all of her notes online so you can print them out, even though she says they aren't the exact notes that she goes over in class, they are! You definitely need to get the book with the journals, they are on tests! Grades her exams + assignments very quickly",1
"I took Crim. Pro. with Raphael after being warned by some of his Constitutional Law students that he was bad. HE WAS AWESOME. If you do the readings, it's not hard at all. He will call on you, but if you don't know the answer, he won't ridicule you or make you feel bad, he'll just move on. If you engage him, he's interesting and fun. I recommend.",1
This teacher is tough. Be prepared to learn everything on your own. She is an NP and expects you to know everything. Half of the things she teaches in class don't be on the test. She brags about herself and has a million and one life stories to tell you. If this class was not required for me to take I would of definitely dropped this class.,0
"Great Professor.  Don't miss class.  Gives study guides for exams.  Really down to earth, and tells it like it is.  If you need a psych class, take him.",1
He is a really great professor. Funny when it matters which makes lectures easy to understand and fun to attend. Doesn't make going to class feel like chore. The marital is interesting and not for those who don't already have an interest in deep film analysis.,1
"The best teacher I've ever met! Very clear but very complex. You have to push yourself hard,  but not beyond your capacity. A lot of hard reading, but his lectures clarify everything (if you are attentive and present).  Grades not based on Attendence.",1
"You will teach yourself in this course!!! If you want an easy class, do not take this course! There are three tests and you need to get 270 points total to get an A. Each weekly homework assignment takes 2-3 hours. He does tell you which problems will be on the test though and he lets you out early.",0
"very monotone. lots of homework. do good on final and all test grades are replaced. online quizzes are easy, homework is difficult. curves all tests including final. attendance isn't part of grade but essential to succeed. take him! he wants you to pass the class",1
"This guy has a HUGE ego and it shows. He also claims he will confiscate your phone if it is found to even be on during his class. When asked if the exception would be made if the student is a first responder (EMT, firefighter, police officer, etc.) who is on call, he says you should just take a different class. It even says this in his syllabus.",0

Jenneke is a fabulous teacher.  Her commitment to the students is absolute and she is always willing to go the extra mile to make sure that everyone is on board.  The class was rigorous but not difficult - she made the process of absorbing a new language fun and as easy as possible.  Highly recommend!,1
Great prof! Crystal clear teaching style and covers the material on the tests at length. She is the kind of teacher that actually wants her students to do well. Take her intro course for sure! Do the readings and attendlisten to her lectures and you will get an A. ,1
Great Teacher!,1
WORST TEACHER EVER. DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ANY CLASS.,0
"Really great teacher... his take on electronic music, its composition, and history has definitely opened doors for me in terms of writing & listening to music. His approach to teaching is skillful, plus he's a pretty chill dood.",1
fun guy with a great sense of humor,1
"Class is way too much work. There's a quiz every class (one is open book) and there's 4 papers. 5% the grade is participation, so if you never raise your hand you automatically lose that. However, he gives over 10% extra credit throughout the semester. That said, it's too much work for a 3 unit class.",1
dont be fooled by Elementary Spanish this class is tough and if you are not comfortable with the language do take it. im fluent in Spanish and there were some questions that I struggled to answer. the professor seems nice but completely disappeared throughout the 10 week course. she DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. avoid at all cost. no support at all,0
"She's very sweet and gives a lot of extra credit! 8 free absences and she really does try to help bring your grade up. Strong accent, always energetic.",1
"This woman is amazing at teaching, LOVED her!! Highly recommended. It is alot of material but she does a great job at explaining and she also has reviews twice a week to help you if needed outside of class.",1
So far my favorite teacher in CCSF. She cares about students a lot and truly wants students to succeed in class. Always accessible outside the class. She responds to students' email very fast and goes out of her way to make sure that you actually understand. I have great respect for her and I will definitely take other classes of hers if I can.,1
Albritton is an awesome professor.  Very laid back and openminded to what you have to say.  Funny guy.,1
I learned a lot about the world of corrections. You have 4 papers and 1 power point presentation to do in this class. All of them are not that hard as long as you do the research. Professor Valltos is their if you need any help or clarification on the projects. I recommend taking any of his classes if you get a chance.,1
"Dr. Kim is an amazing professor/human and is one of the most energetic, caring, and passionate profs at UTC. I took her for Orgo and Biochem lecture these courses aren't intrinsically easy but she will make them as fun/interesting as they could be & is very specific about what she expects you to know for her exams STUDY HER SLIDES!",1
"This class was awesome online, but be sure you have plenty of time to spend on it. You need to make sure that you do all of the learn smart and take the exams. This was a GREAT class online and if you  need help Ms. Papapavalou was very helpful and responds pretty promptly. Take it if you need Econ!",1
"Adam Gerritsen is hands down the best professor I have ever taken at SUNY Cortland. As a senior, trust me, if you have to take a biology course, and this man's name pops up, TAKE HIM!!!",1
"MA is the best accounting teacher I've ever had. Yes you have to do work in her class, but you actually LEARN accounting. If you want to learn how to regurgitate facts, take Larry Clark or someone else, otherwise, take Prater.  Yes she'll challenge you, but its not an extreme amount of work for a class.",1
"Lots of reading but let me tell ya. Dr. Heth is my favorite professor ive ever had in my 4 years at Taylor. He is a man of God, he offers so much wisdom and knowledge, and he courageously follows the Lord even when others dont agree. Amazing feedback he really reads your papers and offers some helpful tips and acknowledges your successes.",1
"Very laid back teacher, hes pretty interesting.  The class is an easy A if you do the extra credit and study the questions he gives you in the beginning of the class, which will be on the test.",1
"While it is a tough class for most, he takes his time and explains everything multiple times. Exams aren't hard if you study and he does grade on a curve. I recommend this professor.",1
"Really great and rewarding class, I loved it!  You'll find your art improving a lot with it!  Teacher is very nice and helpful. You'll do just fine if you have an interest for the subject",1
"I enjoyed the lectures and the prof's sense of humor.  Sometimes I thought lectures were a bit too easy for an advanced course, but overall the pace of the course was good.  I would have liked more homework so I could have more feedback on my understanding of the material.  The professor also thinks EVERY topic in the course is easy.",1
"I've taken a ton of classes with this man.  He made me actually understand history!  I loved this man, he has a heart of gold. If you get to have a class with him it will clean up your writing like crazy, do it.  And his sweater vests are amazing.",1
"With Julien it is very very simple. Be ready to learn or be ready to fail. The group project is very fun but it is extremely time-consuming. My biggest tip to students taking this class is attending the lectures as the first couple of weeks are easy but then it gets difficult all of a sudden. However, if you take this class you will learn a lot!",1
Dr. Gordon is hilarious in a cynical sort of way. If he's feeling nice he gives bonus points! He tells you what the essay questions are on the test and lets you have a note card. He gives hints as to the multiple choice but make sure and study for those. Book quizzes are easy if you write down the points he gave. Can't use phones or computers.,1
"Professor Reisinger was very accomodating and is super nice! Decent amount of work, about 2 long-ish papers and weekly assignments. Be prepared to participate in class. But would definitely recommend",1
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
"He was a good professor!! I did not do well in Spanish because it was extremely hard for me to learn. I have great grades in other classes, but this class was hard for me. He tried so hard to help me. He met me after class and had great communication with me.",1
"Stewart teaches two of the most challenging courses in the major and makes them enjoyable. Humor is a combination of self-deprecating and uber-wry and he uses it to hold your attention. Ignore the haters who drop to SOC, he's the best!",1
This is a wonderful professor who cares deeply about her students. I enjoyed this class more than any other I have taken at WV State University.,1
Super lecture heavy class. This isnt necessarily a bad thing though. He makes everything within the lectures very clear and tells stories to help you remember the material. I would have definitely received a better grade if I had not missed two class periods. That being said you have to go to class if you want an A. Highly reccomend.,1
I loved her class very good information to learn from. Everything was exactly from the book so if you read the chapters you will do very good but if you don't read then I don't know what to say. It was a very easy class if you read and she does offer extra credit just in case you need a boost in grade.,1
No Comments,1
"She is very kind-hearted and honest. Also, she is very detailed and straight forward about the grading scale and class assignments (homework, test, projects, debates) that will be taken place inside class. She also puts herself in students shoes and tries to make class easy-going yet informational. She sets you up to succeed. Highly Recommend!",1
"Pretty good professor. Lectures are clear and and she explains concepts pretty well, at a good pace. Concept heavy class, only one programming assignment. Exams are fair and heavily based on the HW and slides.",1
okay,1
"A great professor who I recommend to anyone taking a General Humanities or Myth course.  His lectures are funny and entertaining and he makes class not seem so boring as most professors do.  He is also a good grader and as long as you show up to class, do your work, and participate, you should have an A or B.",1
"Mrs. Abraham was as awesome teacher! She provides the readings for the semester so you don't have to buy books. She gives good feedback, only a couple projects, 2 papers and one big project due at the end of the semester as your ""final"", but it was easy. Definitely recommend her!",1
"She is very detailed on the work she goes over in class, but her exams are much harder than anything she covers in class or on the homework. There are quizzes regularly, about 2-3 a week, but they aren't worth too many points. If you're going to take her, just make sure you do the homework and then some, because she's a very hard grader.",0
"Literally do not take this professor. I took this as a mandatory credit and will be receiving my first C ever in college. He grades as if everyone in his class will be professional writers. Not clear in feedback, nor does he ever talk about how he wants papers to be written. I do admit that the class discussions are interesting but not worth it.",0
If you do the reading assignments that you are assigned you will pass all his test and all the journal assignments. Most of the journal assignments comes from the readings. Buying the textbook is a MUST. He grades pretty easy when it comes to papers. Just read the readings and you will leave that class with an A. :) He's a cool teacher also.,1
She is amazing,1
Super smart guy. But doesnt really communicate his knowledge to students well. Not everyone is capable of teaching and this guy is one of them. Just reads the slides to the class then passes out a worksheet. Be prepared to do loads of reading and work on your own. The only reason I passed was having seen most of this material in high school.,0
Amazing lecturer! She really puts work into her lectures to help her students succeed. Her tests are usually based on the lectures so attending class is a must. She does a lot of visual demos for you to understand the concept.,1
I absolutely love Professor Garland! I have taken her for every class that she has and they are all interesting. She makes it possible for you to care and pass. Her assignments are great. Just do the work and put in some thought and you should well.,1
Excellent Teacher,1
"I get really good grades, but this class was extremely hard. Her lectures on powerpoint are not clear. She jumps around from slide to slide w/o telling you what chapter she's on. She goes very fast in lecture and it is impossible to take notes. Erases everything after talking about it. Doesn't answer emails for help. Class test avg is in 50's.",0
Terry is great! I had her for PSYC 395 as well. She is one of the most straightforward professors you'll ever have! Guidelines and expectations are super clear and she is quick to respond to emails.,1
great job,1
Good professor.,1
so nice and helpful! make sure to do the readings because they are important to understand the lectures. she's also a fair grader - isn't looking to screw you.,1
"He is by no means a bad prof, but I will never take him again if possible. He gives you all the exam questions before hand so as long as you study those you will be fine. Most of class is spent on tangents, and had to rush through most material because of it. Since attendance was mandatory this made coming to class difficult.",0
"The best prof I have ever had! The sweetest lady, really cares about her students. So hilarious. She would bring us chocolates around each holiday and Christmas crackers at Christmas. A lot of students would skip which is not recommended, but she wasn't really mad about it. Very generous marker if you know your stuff and participate.",1
"This class is not hard at all as long as you pay attention in class and look at the PowerPoints before exams. I hardly read the textbook but I got a full mark on my last exam. The professor is great too, her explanation is super clear and easy to understand. Though she takes attendance so u should go to class:)",1
Kathleen is absolutely amazing and so inspiring she makes me want to be an animator. What makes her advice more genuine is that she worked on so many movie s like Pocahontas and Tarzan. Everyone was genuinely excited and loved coming to class Can't wait to take her other two classes.,1
"Heavy workload. I've always loved my Spanish Professors, but she was something else. Very difficult to communicate with, very harsh grader, very abrasive. I didn't feel like language learning was the priority; pure academics was. New languages are difficult and unless you have an excellent knowledge of the Spanish Language, be cautious.",0
Professor Whidden was awesome.  I had to work for my grade but it was totally worth it.  I wish all my instructors cared as much about students.,1
Great professor.,1
"MA is one of the more interesting professors I have taken at Clemson. While she is a great lecturer, she is a tough grader and intends to make the class harder than the material really should be. Make it to every class and put in your time and this class should be an easy A. Don't ask her questions, she tends to make fun of students who do.",1
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
"Great teacher, will repeat or clarify anything that you aren't sure about and gladly answers any questions. Great office hours. Go to class to see exactly what you need for assignments and do the assignments to see exactly what you need for the exams. Pretty simple, effective structure.",1
Nan is an extremely tough grader. Do not expect higher than a B on your stories. I felt like I was writing stories for the New York Times! Don't take for an easy A. Definitely a heavy work load. ,1
"Jeremy Fry is by far the best teacher I've had at Hawkeye. I've always struggled with math, but he breaks it down and makes it seem so easy. When he grades tests, he's extremely fair and breaks down what you did right and wrong. He also gave us treats before Spring & Summer break. Highly recommend!",1
"Prof's class is relatively easy but practice lots of math problems to pass. Three quizzes total. Forgets what she says one week to the next. Is generally clear but you never know quite what you need to memorize for an exam and if you're not a nursing major yet, ask a nursing student about types/amounts of shots and insulin mixing. Very approachable",1
"Shara is a great designer and you can tell this by her passion for the craft, shes a wealth of knowledge of you know what questions to ask. Shes always open to talking and bouncing ideas off of",1
Great professor! At first I wasn't sure if I would enjoy her but as times went on it got so much better! Very clear about what she wants and super helpful during office hours!,1
Nice teacher,1
"Shes a very lenient professor when it comes to work, but expects you to be in her class majority of the time. Our work consisted of textbook passages and their corresponding questions due every week and probably had a combination of 3-4 essays due throughout the entire semester.",1
"two short papers, one long one, a group project, and a midterm and final. If you take notes in class and study you'll do well. she let's you voice your own opinion and does a good job of not disrespecting anyone, whether she agrees with you or not. overall a good choice for the class, and pretty interesting!",1
"This professor is a real gentleman. It is entirely possible to do well in his class because he makes himself so available to help students, even in his rather large classes. I wish all my instructors at Rutgers had been as considerate. He entertains every question or comment--never makes a student feel like an idiot. He was awsome.",1
No Comments,1
"Eric was not a great teacher. Half of the time he had to stop and redo his examples because he didn't even know what was going on, he would even often ask us if we knew what we did wrong. Assigns lots of homework and the tests often consist of the more difficult problems with lots of steps.",0
"Jago is the best! Accounting is pretty dry regardless, but he makes sure we get a few laughs in. Not only does he teach the material, but he teaches life skills and keeps us informed of amazing opportunities. This guy actually cares, and he will make sure you do well if you work hard. However beware the second exam is WAY harder. Big letdown. ",1
Walling is THE absolute worst professor Ive ever had. She Has a bad attitude and is forever in a bad mood. She likes to make smart remarks if asked a question and she is constantly giving attitude or rolling her eyes if you say anything to her at all. BC should really get another professor to teach A&P because nobody should have to deal with her.,0
"Beware of Mrs. Wang's math classes. You need to be well-versed in the subject. She does not provide a platform for C students. She delves into Matrices and Linear Programming. Taking precious time away from more applicable math subjects. Just keeping it real. Also, you will notice that she does not have 23 people on her waitlist!",0
"Easy A. She's always willing to help, she helped me find a major that suited me and even helped me with my major change, always taking students opinions into consideration to make class fun and easy . ",1
Great teacher. Shows you real life experiences not the boring textbook definitions.,1
"Take this class during the summer if at all possible. The lab and lecture are mixed which help with some of the reviews I have read. The only issue I ever had was that she sometimes didn't 'teach' the class. Sometimes it was a 'figure it out' sort of thing which sucks. Overall, she was a decent professor who will eat your lunch if you get too sassy",1
"Prof Conner is an amazing teacher, I took her for College Algebra and i am very thankful for everything that i learnt from this class. Math itself is very confusing, but if you pay attention and do homework you will have a good grade. ",1
"I loved having Yvonne as my professor this semester! She's kind, big hearted and willing to help in any way possible to help you get a good grade! Take Yvonne and listen to her lectures! You can learn a lot if you listen!",1
"I've had Dr. O'G twice now, and I like him a lot. He is a nice and very smart guy. He knows a lot about the stuff he teaches and he is passionate about it as well. With him being a liberal and me being a republican, he was always respectful and never looked down on me for that. The only thing is that his tests suck, but he does give partial credit!",1
most likely the most fun class i have. the core of the course revolves around class discussion and walking through topics. has true real world experience. learning takes precident over opinions and theres no punishment for being wrong. everyones thought matters. tests are ethics based and open book. amazing professor,1
"I took A & P 2 with Dr. Montes this past summer. He is very kind and very helpfull. The class was very fast and demands a lot of hard work. If you are organized, you can get an A. He knows the material and he used to be a medical doctor. Very easy going guy and funny sometimes. I recommand him to students who want to put in the work.",1
Always has great advice. Also you should believe anything this man tells you.,1
She is a good at accounting but not necessarily teaching but she can be rude sometimes especially if you're late or aren't showing up. I would not take again.,1
Always punctual and expects you to be. Good examples and gives fun facts now and then. Very informative and willing to help with difficulties. Learns your name and gives individual attention after class if needed. No homework (lab gives hw). Ensures all topics are covered and follows strict guide. Doesn't care about attendance.,1
If he likes you you'll do ok. No clue how things really work in business but he spent all his time in the navy.,0
"this teacher doesn't tell you how to do anything. she just expects it done the way she wants it!! dont miss anyclassed or youll get 0 points. BORING CLASS...bring a pillow. shes teaching about teaching, yet shes not teaching!!",0
I advise only the people who are ging to devote their lives to Bio to continue with it. I got an A in Evo and am now in danger of getting a D in this damn class. Very vague about what's going to be on test and expects you to know EVERY DETAIL. It's a shame 'cause they seem like good people too.,0
"She is very rude. This class is boring and she doesn't answer questions when you ask. She gives smart remarks.  The work is not hard but she treats everyone like they are 17 and I am not.  If you can handle a rude teacher, the work is fine. Pointless though.",0
"I took the class before knowing her, but ended up liking her. She is a very clear regarding assignments, paper, presentations. Mid term and final terms were easy. Participation in class matters.",1
Lectures can get boring. He doesn't take attendances but gives pop quizzes sometimes. Gives study guides before exams. Exams aren't open-book so you actually have to study to ace. ,1
Mr. I is a great professor! His lectures are really inspirational. Makes class fun.,1
Absolutely Horrible. Treats it like it's highschool. Rarely answers questions. Won't help you with anything in excel. Doesn't work with students. Leaves grading up to other people. Blinks too much and her only child is cat...Stay away from rankin if you value your G.P.A,0
Awesome prof. Very intelligent. Has genuine interest in your projects and ideas. Cutting edge. Highly recommend.,1
Not a good prof at all. Rambles during lectures and goes off topic frequtly. Lectures are all over the place. Do not recommend her.,0
"Professor White's class is an easy A because she only has 3 tests (non cumulative) and they're all taken online and you don't have to take them in class. She also doesn't have to take attendance so if you're looking for an easy gen ed to take, this is a great one. ",1
"Make sure you have reliable internet, a decent computer, and you are a fast test taker. She will not allow you a chance to make up time lost during any test if you have connection issues, she's not helpful. She is a pretty rough grader but involved in discussions. The assignments are not hard and she gives a few extra credits throughout if needed.",0
Disa is hands down the best professor I have ever had. She makes class so much fun and is just a stand up educator. She gets to know her students individually and shows us that she cares about us at all times. I have had her for two courses and I 100% recommend taking her if you have the chance!,1
Lots of passages to read but a lot of them are interesting. Hes a really great guy with a good sense of humor hes easy going and wants you to succeed. Really cute kind hearted guy with good knowledge. Great class but you need to go to the lectures for clicker questions and theres a lot of reading.,1
"Very personable and explains things well. He co-taught this class with another prof (who was terrible) and under the circumstances he did the best he could to help us understand the other prof's material. Going to class is a must because I maybe opened the ""textbook"" once and he didn't have powerpoints.",1
Bruh.,0
Holly is extremely knowledgeable but not very approachable. I found her rubrics hard to follow and very nit picky.  IDK if graphic design is just like that but she should keep in mind that this is a required foundation class for all majors.,0
She was the most horrible teacher she doesn't allow you to make up work and also doesn't allow you to turn online she also do petty stuff.,0
"This was seriously my favorite class. Every lecture was fantastic and I felt like all the information covered was important. We didn't have any filler assignments throughout the semester, only the exams and the weekly four question quizzes which were super easy if you go to class. Jorgen is an awesome teacher and I hope to take his classes again.",1
"I took her class for A&P1 last semester. Shes one of the best professors I ever had. She cares about ALL of her students and is constantly keeping in touch via email about tests and presentations. She even gives personal feedback. A&P is a hard class, but seriously, she gives you all the guidance you need to pass- you just need to work for it.",1
Super easy. Definitely flexible. Not hard at all. Take it online!!!!,1
"Boring and stiffly well-mannered (not friendly). A teach-yourself class; lectures consisted of the captions of the pictures in the text, verbatim, nothing more. Lecture exams didn't always follow the text, so you couldn't fully prepare yourself since the only way to teach yourself was from the text. No help given during labs.",0
Fair grader.  Makes you work.,1
Dr. McCartney knows her subjects and is very respected by her peers and students. Can be intimidating but she grades your improviment. Read and participate and keep up with the assignments. Civic Engagement class has a lot of assignments but they are all very interesting. Don't procrastinate!,1
"Her tests are hard even if you know the material. She is preparing you for the departmental final. She is a good teacher, very clear. If you just took bio and chem, use the first couple of weeks to get ahead on reading as she reviews alot of this material. The amount of material you will cover and the pace at which you will move will stun you.",1
"Great professor. The material was interesting and he is very energetic and keeps the class involved. The homework can take a few hours to do, but he explains everything very well. Exams are similar to homework; whatever he gives you on the homework will be on the exams. Grading and expectations are straightforward and he wants you to do well.",1
"Lois is great.Passionate about the subject, and invites you to think about things differently. Yes, many think the class is disorganized in topic, but Politics touches everything in our lives and is messy. If you do the work, ask questions, and participate, you'll do fine.",1
"terrible time with this guy in LFS 250 and 350, 250 was the worst class I ever took, waste of time 4 hours gone a week just like that and the course was for a whole year, absolutely useless and nothing taught, very opinionated and we do stupid activities as if we are 5 years old, same in 350 if you value your time and brain cells don't do it",0
The one thing I liked about her is that her tests are usually like the review. One thing I didnt like was how strict she was on grading essays. She would take up to 15 points off for slightly citing something incorrectly and acted as if this were an English class instead of a sociology class. Her lectures were pretty boring but overall Was nice,0
"I'll def be taking ACCT 302 with Paula, if possible. She really emphasizes reading your book before class but I never did (sorry, Paula!) but only because she explains everything SO WELL in class. I found this class a breeze while being very applicable and educational. I learned a lot. She also let us out early everyday, which was much appreciated!",1
"Has a good sense of humor, great person but horrible professor. Has only three tests and are very hard. I'm already bad at math but he won't let us use the formula sheet.  Whenever I don't get something I ask but I still don't get it. Goes way too fast. If you're good at math I'd recommend his class but if you aren't I wouldn't.",0
"One of the absolute best professors I ever had. Runs rings around the ""tenured"" faculty. Professor Solari knows his subject matter, is able to engage students and makes the material very interesting. I learned a lot that changed my view of things from when I came into the class. You need to do the reading to get the most out of the class.",1
"Dr. Ramey is a really laid back kind of teacher. His lectures can be lengthy but they are easy to follow. There are two group presentations but they are only done with him, so they aren't bad at all. He just wants his students to look at different representations within the context of religion.",1
"Raquel is cool, but a tough grader.  For this being only a 1000 level communications class, I have spent more time working for this class than I have in a lot of my other courses I've taken at LSU.  There are 5 group projects throughout the semester, some are more difficult than others.  The final paper is hard.  Sometimes slow to reply to emails.",1
Great guy! He was really excited about the readings and you could tell he loved what he was doing which made the class fun. I would highly recommend taking his class!,1
"I defiantly thought he was a bit on the strange side on the first class but he's very funny and has the most interesting way of describing things. Not much studying is needed. No homework, just one 15 point quiz per week. He goes over at least half the answers before the test so pay attention and youll do fine!",1
"He's a good teacher because he makes himself available, but DO NOT take his remote class, do the online class instead. In his lectures, he repeats himself over and over and uses the whole lecture time to tell students stuff they learned in the 1st class. He doesn't actually teach anything in the remote lectures.",1
"The come-up is real in this one. Danae has been through it y'all. I legit almost cried when she told us her life story. Ok, enough fangirling. Absolutely my favorite class of the semester. The assigned reading & hw was very interesting & eye-opening. The only downsides are that there's a lot of hw & she's pretty disorganized. Still ily though. 3",1
"This class with this professor was the absolute worst. She assigned so much busy work that was incredibly pointless, but you have to do it or you'll fail the class. She is such a tough grader, and I NEVER got As on any assignments despite being a good student.",0
Best Philosophy teacher at QU,1
unfortunately i think she is the only one who teaches this class. (fall '12) we had no assignments during oct and none until after thanksgiving. she didnt grade sept assignments until november. so she takes extremely long to grade. lecture is boring and almost 2 hours long. easy A though,1
"He's very monotonous, which isn't great considering that the material is very dense and hence it necessitates focus. Dude just reads off the slides. He's very smart, but he gives off the vibe that he doesn't want to be there. If you want to take this class for premed then wait until another professor is teaching it",0
"Professor Newcomb is really good at explaining things and actually wants everyone to do well. Also, knows a lot of interesting information so class is always engaging and fun. And he's on point with the dad jokes. Great instructor, definitely recommend and only hope that I'm so lucky that I can be in another class of his.",1
Easy A! Show up ready to learn and you will do well!,1
"One of the best teachers that I have had.  She is very thorough and detail oriented, but as long as you put forth the effort to study, you will do fine.  Makes class very interesting.",1
"This class was informative. I personally am not an ethics guy myself, but I feel like he did a good job of making it interactive and passable. The work was more annoying than hard, we had reading papers due every class, which were easy and always got A's, but 3 times a week is a bit much. Be prepared to read and write a ton. Easy A, would recommend",1

Awesome! Class structure is fair and work load is relatively- balanced for a six week summer course. Provides great feedback and is very approachable/friendly,1
Easy online class. Mainly written assignment with clear cut directions. Gives good feedback that is helpful.  Good information learned in this class. ,1
"Professor Simerka is a very intelligent person. She really knows her stuff and is a huge intellectual. Nevertheless, her grading style is too harsh and the subject matter was a little dry. Although she is good at making you feel insufficient, she does care about her students and is always willing to make the time to meet one on one to discuss grade",1
"Took course online. Have weekly due dates but I liked that can work ahead. Like how it was organized. Class is pretty straight forward. Do the work, get an A.",1
"I learned a lot in this class. I do have prior experience with Mandarin because I speak it at home. Even so, however, I came into the class without the ability to read or write any Chinese characters. After finishing this class, I can now say that I can confidently recognize and write nearly all of the characters I learned in class.",1
"LaPresto demands a lot of her students, which can seem intimidating to freshmen, but she truly cares about teaching, and will go out of her way to help students learn. A wonderful person!",1
An incredibly gifted lecturer who assigns an inclusive set of readings. Lectures usually connect pre-1800 writing to recent events while establishing the context in which authors were writing. A surprising number of guest lecturers to introduce students to the department. Participation is 40 percent of the grade but includes weekly written work!,1
A person inflexibly attached to policy without regard to its practicality.,0
This class sucks...defenitly dont take for a GPA booster! I took it bc i thought it would be an easy A  but it turned out to be a class that i had never studied harder for in my life. The tests come from the lectures and the text...if you dont read the book you will without a doubt fail.  There is a weird curve at the end and he doesnt give +/-,1
Very good professor. You can learn a lot and get a decent grade if you put in your work. but 1191 is a heavy course no matter who is the professor.,1
"There were a few Mastering assigments, along with 3 tests. No final exam. Gave extra credit questions each class period that would be added to your test. Overall she's a great teacher and the class is ran in nice way!",1
"I took Dr. Snaza for my FYS and he was really passionate about the topic. His class is a lot of readings and 3 essays, but he allows rewrites and gives good feedback.",1

"Although this is the toughest class I've ever taken, MA really cares about her students. She shows it in an odd way because she can be rude or mean at times, but it's only because she wants you to do your best and want to succeed. Be prepared to do lots of homework problems. Read the book, and never get behind. It's impossible to catch up.",0
Dr. B is a great teacher! She definitely loves her subject and talks about some of the cool places she has traveled to that relates to the lesson. There's a lot of work that comes with this class but she has done a fabulous job making it accessible for students taking it online.,1
"Great instructor! She knows the material, and really wants you to learn it as well. That being said be prepared to study a lot, and never skip class. I learned a lot it this class. Would love to take more classes from her.",1
not helpful. lets computer teach you. never sure when stuff due because you expected extended deadlines but then find out one person got and you didn't. I'm lost and taking different teacher next term.,0
Shields is laid back and his classes are disscusion heavy. His teaching won't be from a textbook but from real world examples of projects he or someone he knows worked on. The industry guests that he invites to speak are top-notch and confirmed to me that I had picked the right school.,1
"Ok so idk about the person under me, but  I'm taking it right now and Mr K is a great guy. You can tell he's passionate about art just by the way he talks about it and makes his sounds. He takes the time to  go around and physically correct your drawing if needed. Its a complete joy to take his class. If you dont take it serious, you wont do well.",1
"I loved Professor Palomar so much, she was so sweet and caring. All tests and quizzes were relatively easy and she reviews for each one in class. All her reviews are very similar to the test. There are a lot of assignments but they are super quick and easy to do. The only downside to her class is that I had her at 8AM so I was always tired.",1
"Will is really approachable and seems genuinely interested in helping his students succeed. This is a really hard course though. If you are not a good writer, you should set aside time before taking this course to improve, or you will definitely not do well as 90% of your grade is based on writing assignments (blog posts, research paper etc.)",1
I had Bob for W301 and L346 and he was amazing in both classes! He's good with students and very  good at facilitating class discussion. Make sure you do the readings he assigns and respect the other students in class (especially if you're in 301) Everyone should visit his office hours at least once!,1
"We only have 5 homework assignments for the entire semester, and they're very doable. The first exam that covers morphology is HARD, but he tells you up front that if you're going to study for anything it needs to be that exam. He's funny and awkward and really nice. I definitely recommend if you're into linguistics.",1
"Assigns work and does not discuss them extensively, shows so many irrelevant videos and as long as you are on his good side, you will pass with flying colors. Talks a lot about politics and although he asks for your opinion, he ds not care about it. Terrible teacher, but easy class.",0
Loved his lectures. Seems incredibly knowledgeable about Shakespeare. ,1
"He uses Wiley for his class but he does not teach us anything because in every class, he just writes the homework on the board and does not explain the reasoning behind it. Sorry, but not for me, especially that this information will be on the CPA and I gotta teach myself all of it.",0
"Kai Du is very hard to understand, and his teaching style is ridiculous. During class he'll write a few short-hand notes on the chalk board (even though there are 6 sliding dry erase boards available) and proceed to try to explain the information, which you probably wont understand, and so you MUST read and study the text book every night. GoodLuck",0
"Hard semesters since Fall 2015.  Mr. Haze cares and is juggling a lot.  I learned a lot, mosly how to be patient with not so committed classmates.  He could have clamped down on the less serious students.",1
Extremely unclear about EVERYTHING. Doesn't let you pee during class. Reading/paper every night. Busy work assignments.,0
"Textbook is mandatory, lots of homework, and tests aren't difficult. He will give u a worksheet in the beginning of class and u could work on it alone or with a partner and then he'll go over SOME questions. If u have  a hard time understanding the way he teaches, he'll tell you to ask for a tutor instead of helping you get a better understanding.",0
"I have had her for 2 classes now and want to take as many as possible with her. She is a great professor, really knows her topics. She is very approachable and always willing to help students. Her classes are interesting, but you must put in a good amount of effort to get  an A",1
"Her class is pretty interesting especially the debates if you have a lively class. Although her homeworks are unbearably boring, long and intense. She assigns 25+ page articles and you have 2 due every week. She is still a great professor, no tests just homework and an analysis paper due at the end of the semester.",1
amazxing man with a gold heart. very helpful and clear in his teaching manner. wants his students to do well and helps with anything that u need. def take him!!!!,1
"Did not learn much, discussions where not helpful and were off topic, wish I could have gotten more out of this class.",0
"Tough grader, very intelligent. I would take her if you want to learn. If you're looking to coast, look elsewhere! The book was a waste of money, you can definitely google related information. The teacher assistant sucked this semester. Impossible to get a hold of. Other than that, I would take her again!",1
"The worst I've had. She picks a couple of students in as her favorites, and it is disgustinly obvious who they are all semester long. She was my advisor and did not advise me at all - didn't have a grasp of the requirements at HWS. Spends too much time in the bars trying to be your friend when she should concentrate on being a better professor.",0
"Took this class during Covid-19 Spring 2020 (graded pass/fail). Exam was easier than expected. Seems intimidating in class, but does care. I do not think that she dislikes Civil Procedure and did not get that feeling in taking her class. Be prepared for tough cold calls. Even if class goes virtual, you will be cold-called.",1
"If you care about your GPA, avoid taking the class with her.",0

"I am a medieval studies student. Proff taylor is a hard teacher because he expects alot out of his students.  To the writer who stated that medieval studies is not relevant,i would like to say that medievalists have a passion for what they do and passion doesn't have anything to do with practicality",1
"Awesome teacher!  Asked for a lot of class participation, opinions, groups, group debate and group projects.  None of it is terribly hard, just come to class and do the work.  Willing to work with you,  highly recommend him.",1
Dr. Currier is a great prof for this super hard class. She knows this stuff backwards and forwards and not only helps during office hours but has even come in extra hours to help us on the math. She really cares and I have learned a ton this quarter!,1
A very tough grader.,0
"She's a really great person, as a lecturerer a little bland but really wants students to do well.",1
"Most of the grade is based off of essay exams. He gives extra credit that really bumps up your grade. It's not a hard class. No group work, mostly reading and writing. Sometimes class was interesting but it could be dry and boring. He seemed to not care about his job and students but that could have been his quirky sense of humor.",0
"I hated this guy while I had him, but in the end he passed me. This is not to say I didn't bust my backside trying, and in the end that is what made the difference. Study hard if you take him because that is all that will save you. Accounting is a miserable subject no matter who you take.",0
"Such a great prof. Knew the material and how to explain it pretty well. Start your PAs EARLY. I recommend putting effort into your project plan and following it. Schedule your assignments for this class. Koh had some funny stories at times, though the end was a bit rushed. Wish we could've learned RB trees and hashing a bit better.",1
"Even though i got a ""B"" i learned so much, including how to write better proper English. This for sure has helped me in my other courses that require writing. This course was full of current events and epidemiology in 'real time'.",1
"Lots of circular reasoning, and endless babbling with many useless readings.  Terrible class.  Papers are poorly explained and do not tie into class.  Do not take this class!",0
"Russell certainly cares about her students, but doesn't know much and lets her political bias seep into her classes. She called all Republicans ""Confederates,"" for instance, and when asked question about Shinzo Abe admitted she had never heard of him. She often got distracted in lectures, showing more Game of Thrones videos than actual material.",0
You have to admire her for her patience; having never taken Spanish before I was hesitant when she put me on the spot in class. She did a great job in working with me in reach an answer. At times I mispronounced easy spanish words and each time she skillfully hinted to the right answer allowing me to say them correctly and sparing me embarrassment.,1

"If you want a professor who cares about the material youre learning and is extremely confident in what hes teaching then he is the way to go. A/P is obviously hard, so taking this class without the right mentality is going to be that much harder for you. Learn to enjoy it and youll pass. P.S: ask questions!!! ��",1
"ACCENT HEAVY! I could never understand her, she was constantly asked to repeat herself due to her accent! She would also get frustrated when questions were asked about material. She is a sweet lady, but I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for a quality education.",0
"If you are not already fluent in Spanish, you will not learn with this instructor. This class is very difficult, do not let ""beginning Spanish 2"" fool you. I am fluent in Spanish and got an A, but my classmates who weren't struggled very much. he ""teaches"" too fast and doesn't allow enough time for a subject to sink in before moving to the next.",0
I had him for Theory and Aural Skills. He was so helpful! In theory you get homework every night from the workbook but it's pretty simple. Only a 2 or 3 pages a night. The tests are way easier than the homework too. Aural skills was easy too. He moves at a slow pace so everyone can be on the same level. I definitely recommend him!,1
okay,1
"Really qualified, charismatic guy. I took PS 361 and 201 from him in the same semester and he was great in both classes. Heard lots of the same stories though.     361: lots of required reading but I never read and got an A.      201: lecture style, kinda boring. 2 essays and the final are the only graded work- all pretty easy.",1
"this is one heck of a 4 unit class. no txtbook but she will make u work ur butt off for hrs just to get a bad grade on assignments. weekly u write long analyses of ur dietary intake, long discussion posts & take fill-in quizzes. if ur not too knowledgeable on nutrition i recommend taking it at de anza with another teacher. this is a tough class. ",1
Teacher is bad. Don't take his class. Took CGS1100 online and had to make up one of his tests. Had to email him 6 times before I could take it. He tells you to check blackboard for messages everyday but he doesn't even do that himself. Skip this prof. and pick a different one. Easy class but I knew 90% of the material prior to taking it.,0
Amazing professor. Passionate about the subject but keeps things very simple. Very straight forward. Only 2 tests the midterm and the final and one short paper which were all easy. Would definitely take him again.,1
"Really lively, funny teacher, although she might not seem like it by looking at her.  Once she starts speaking you can tell she really loves the subject and she made the class very interesting.  Had to use the book a lot for studying.  The class had very interesting topics as well.",1
"Loved this professor! An awesome and understanding guy. Easy going, clear, and concise.",1
"I liked the class, but he was a really tough grader.  I thought my final grade was unfair given the amount of effort and time spent inthe photolab, but whatev... I still liked the class.",1
"The most interesting class I've ever taken. You cover the medical field, midwives, contraception, conception, 3 trimesters of pregnancy, labor, birth, and post-partum, pregnancy in other countries. Class is non-judgemental, everyone is welcome, and acknowledges that people giving birth are not only women. I highly recommend this class even for fun",1
"Class is hard but you can really learn a lot from him. Hard assignments and exams, but since it's advanced course this is expected. Very personable.",1
He's one the best psychology professor I've ever had. He's amazing!,1
"I took every single class she teaches. She is fun and funny! You won't want to miss her class. Not only is she an amazing woman, she is an amazing teacher! Buy the textbooks and speak to her during office hours...she knows how to write an outstanding letter of recommendation!",1
"Deb is my favorite teacher I've had at Duke so far. Her French is fluent and crystal clear. She is very nice and she puts all her effort into making class a fascinating an educational time. As long as you participate and do all the readings, her class is fairly straightforward. After this semester, my French is a lot better.",1
"He is a very knowledgeable professor and is ready to answer challenging questions that a student can ask. He focuses on theories so its students responsibility to attend to tutorials and try to solve as many questions as possible to become familiar with the exam type questions! Generally if you like micro, this course and this prof are amazing",1
Just do all the homework.,1
"I took Professor Tulin for Honors Humanities 1. He is a great and passionate teacher but his course is very discussion board, essay, group project, and reading heavy. You will have weekly discussion posts and a group project over a book that he assigns. You will have to read several books throughout the semester and attendance is mandatory.",1
"Dr. Britton is fun, friendly & engaging. She really knows the material and she expects you to know it, too. You will get back ten-fold the effort you put in to her class. She's AMAZING.",1
"While he wasn't a bad teacher by any means, I just felt that he was really bored with the class this semester. I don't blame him, as most of the assigned material was not interesting (and I love literature!) and there was very little meaningful class discussion. Quizzes you every class, so don't miss. Do the work and you're going to pass.",1
"Kipp is the BEST! It's half way through the semester and we haven't had any homework. He just asks you to bring in an article from the web every now and then pertaining to the topic that is being covered that day.  You do have to show up to class, although he doesn't take attendance, he covers the test very well in class. It's HARD to NOT do well!",1
"When it comes to lectures, Professor Xian is soft-spoken & tedious, but provides plenty of opportunities for your questions. Don't come late, you'll get an icy stare down. Her study guides for exams are thorough. Do the practice problems. In this exam weighted class, it's as easy to pass as it is to fall behind. The exams are thorough, but fair.",1
"Wow! Lesley is a total pro. I checked other photo classes at DeAnza that were too easy then came here, saw Lesley's great ratings, so I took her. She is a kind teacher and really cares about you doing your best on every project. If you need help, she is right there with expert advice. She wants everyone to do well. Take it, you will learn a lot.",1
"While Dr. Turkovic gives interesting lectures, the only thing his class is made up of are 4 tests, all in essay form and participating in class discussion. If you don't do well on those tests, you're pretty much screwed. I would not recommend taking this class if you are not a good test taker.",0
"It is really easy get A !!! He is a great professor and always helps you. I totally recommend you to take this class with him. If you practice the quizzes and trainings, you will succeed in this class. Im gonna take him again next semester .",1
"You just need to show up, do the reading and you will do great in this class. She really cares for her students, and will care a lot about you if you show that you're engaged!",1
"She's not a bad teacher, but she's really weird and intense, she makes me uncomfortable. If you work hard you could probably manage a B+ but if you kiss her butt you can probably get an A",0
"Do not take him!!!! He dose not know how to teach. If you take him then basically you are on your own, he will not help you to pass the class.",0
"Her test are HARD!  I made 100 on ALL of her assignments, which are a breeze, but the test are crazy hard!  And if you take the online class be prepared to have to come in for EVERY test...kinda misses the point of online classes!",0
"You have to go to class. She really cares about her students. But she is very challenging, and I think she is aware of that.",1
Dave Orso Rocks! Very easy instructor. Hes younger so he relates to students. His lectures are very interesting and very helpful. He knows his stuff! I highly Recommend him!!!,1
"I have him as a lab professor, hes really nice and extremely helpful. He explained an entire lesson to me within 10 mins when i missed a class once. And he lets you use cheat sheets on the tests. And also, his 3-d drawings on the blackboard look pretty sickk haha",1
"He's pretty awesome.  He gave us muffins on test day and walks around the room to make sure you're doing the problems right.  He's super helpful and nice.  If I have to take another math class, I would take it with him.  ",1
Dr.Lamkin is an excellent teacher! anatomy and/or physio is NOT an easy course no matter who the teacher is so if you're not committed and motivated i suggest you postpone on taking this course. need to read book more than once/DO WELL on the QUIZzes even if you dnt As her exams/she gives lots of XTRA CREDIT!/easy pts on labs bt some r BORING&LONG,1
Get ready to read 40 pages a week. Extremely tough grader in writing. Hard to get points for discussion. You'll fail if you don't put lots of effort in it.,0
horrible...,0
Professor Yue is the most dedicated professors to a course that I have ever been taught by in my four years at RPI. She provides excellent feedback and teaches the material excellently. Class time is very productive and stimulating. She also provides opportunities for students to practice the language outside of the classroom with native speakers.,1
Mrs. Wedemeyer is A Great Teacher She Is Somewhat Weird But Overall She Cares About What She's Talking About.. I've Taken 2 Different Accounting Courses With Her As My Instructor And I'm Taking Another Class Fall 2016 Where She's My Instructor. I Like Her Style And With Me That's A Great Thing !,1
"this class is so simple. there is no homework, everything is done in-class or during computer lab. I like her class because she goes through the assignments with you in class and it's easy!",1
"Interesting class and knowledgable professor. Dr. Browning was good with communication and showed flexibility for my special situation when requested in advance of deadlines. Classwork includes weekly forums, weekly quizzes, and 2 case studies. Quizzes are straight-forward but I felt the case studies could have used some more clarification.",1
"His exams are multiple choice, but very detailed.  His lectues are infomative and entetaining.",1
"Professor Ruder can be boring if you don't pay attention, but is actually a great teacher if you listen even 10%. Class is very easy (He literally codes your homework on the projector in class) as long as you follow along. Knows alot about coding and if you ask more questions he is always happy to help.",1
"The lectures are a lot of fun, the exams, not as much. The exams are tough, you either get it right or completely wrong. Most of it is memorization with some math mixed in. Homework is optional, but you'll end up doing it anyway as they are on the exams. Algorithm Analysis is an interesting topic and I think Dr. Lewis does a good job covering it.",1
I almost fail this class even I read whole textbook. very difficult. Not recommend,0
"If you take her online, all she does is link you to Pearson's my math lab. I find it astonishing that she is getting paid to just have a link in blackboard without even making her own slides. If you can teach yourself statistics, its an easy A. I would recommend Doctor Kasha instead -- he is one of the best!",0
makes a lot of mistakes. Funny teacher. Likes teaching. Never take it in the morning class.,0
"Great professor and easy class. The lab is mostly a lecture however, pictures and diagrams helped to stay engage and understand the topic. We were always let out early and most quizzes were simple and with cheat sheets.",1
"Easy A in my opinion. If you are a student like me(someone who pays attention in class and reviews their notes for the exam rather than study from the book) you will be fine. If you are a ""dumb"" student, don't take the class. She is the only teacher to give soooo much extra credit at the end of the test, it's crazy. Im in Chem 2 rn and I miss it.",1
"Professor Nedd is a great professor. He cares so much for his students. is so attentive and a little awkward. He is one of the nicest professors, he knows so much and is so willing to help!",1
"Absolutely loved this class. She has a different, hands-on teaching style and is just a really nice person. I would take her again for sure!",1
He was a very nice professor always ready to help his students. He genuinely cared about the well being of the students during this hard time and he always tried his best to simplify things down for students. Office hours are very helpful attend them.,1
Pennell is great once you get to know her! Class can be very boring and difficult at times but she is very understanding with attendance if you email her. There is a lot to do in this class and she will not wait for you to catch up.,1
"This teacher is very easy but she treats us like middle school kids!I feel that she doesnt care if we learn the material as long as we follow directions, make sure u do EVERYTHING when u do homework because if u miss one question she dosnt give you credit at all !! oh and bring your books EVERYDAY even if you dont use them!!!other than that shes ok",1
YOU WILL NOT REGRET TAKING THIS PROFESSOR. I am taking her again for another class!,1
"Took him for Chem 1. I thought he was great, his lectures were very organized and he made hard stuff like stoichiometry easy to understand. But I have heard that he is less lenient on Chem 2 students he even said he expects you to know nomenclatures in Chem 2. Just study his lecture powerpoints and practice his practice tests!!",1
"You eventually get used to his accent and he is a very brilliant man! Pay attention in class and his lectures, and do the hw bc thats where he gets his exam questions from. Get to know him and make sure he knows your name bc he will help you out bc he knows you want to do well. If you show him that you want to do well he will help you!",1
"I found this course very hard and I regret take it because my GPA went down after taking it. The material is very heavy and hard to understand because its not clear about whats the course is! I am in a program of the education department and the course is EDUC, but it doesnt have anything with education. Do NOT take this course, VERY HARD!",0
"She was a fantastic professor who always ensures a good laugh and lots of smiles during class. Very friendly and helpful, and teaches mostly off her powerpoints.  Overall pretty easy course if you show up and pay attention.",1
The class was laid out well so you knew what she excpected and when assignements were do. The tests were very easy and are multiple choice plus if yo get the answer wrong you can try again and get some credit. She was very nice and willing to answer any questions you had. I would take this class again. ,1
"Worst class I have ever taken. Professor is unorganized and does not follow his slides. I can honestly say I've learned nothing in this class. Tests are multiple choice, but don't follow what he *attempts* to teach in lecture at all. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
"Mollie was super nice! Just take notes, show up to class and you're fine. She reviewed for tests and was very helpful!",1
This class was 3 hours long and would be pretty hard to stay awake if it wasn't for his lecturing. He always makes a point to keep things interesting and he is pretty funny nonetheless. Minimal assignments and more geared towards lectures and readings. The readings are actually well written novels not dry history books which is a plus.,1
"I can't judge her as a writing professor, but as a literature professor, she excels. Normally, I look on academic literature classes with dread, but I have to admit her passion for the subject matter pulls you into the lecture. If the entire class participates well/often, you'll have a rich lecture and might even get out early.",1
"Awful, awful, awful, awful. She goes off on tangents more than teaches the class. I've never had such a terrible professor in my life. All she does is read her ridiculously wordy powerpoints instead of actually teaching, and lectures you on how you should know the material as much as her. Stay away if you can, she enjoys making you feel dumb.",0

"He is AMAZING!! We only had 7 media critiques (at least 350words except for the last one which was 2-3pages), 7 quizzes and online participation on Yellowdig (commenting, posting, liking, etc). I wish I could have taken him in person. If you have a chance to take him, I HIGHLY recommend that you do!",1
"Very unique experience for a class, getting to meet the writers of the books you read. You do have to read the books within a week since you meet once a week but she makes sure the reading load isn't heavy. Also normal class sessions consist of group work every time so just a head's up if you don't really like those. But overall fun and easy.",1
"Kildea is an awesome professor and chairman. He's super nice and really funny! He can be a bit disorganized, but as long as you study for your tests (READ THE CHAPTERS!!!) you'll do great. He's a good guy to keep in contact with, so make sure you're courteous and nice.",1
Outstanding in class and out,1
"I have never written a review in my life, but this time I would not let it go, Bruce Cohen has no idea what he is teaching, no material in the class, the class goes by bad jokes and arguments, and he is the most racist Professor in the USA.",0
Mr. Prunty is really good with helpful lectures to help you pass tests and the class. He cares if you pass his class or not.,1
"Not the best, but good enough.",1
"Probably the worst class I've ever taken. Lab was awesome because I felt I learned a lot even though he gives A LOT of assignments designed to take over your life and negatively impact your grades in other classes. Never knew what was going on in lecture though and his exams are ridiculous, don't test knowledge, just ability to answer questions BLA",0
Our class got a 43% average on the midterm while Alex Crams midterm average was in the 70's .. she doesn't teach you ANYTHING. Midterm exam was horrible.,0
"This class is hard, but Professor Dutta does everything he can to try and give you the opportunity the succeed.  His YouTube videos are a step far beyond what most professors would do.  You should go to class and pay attention.  Doing the practice problem really helps.  Tests are open book, but if you aren't prepared, it won't matter.",1
he likes to talk and goes of topic very easy. class was boring. we only went over chapters 1-6 in the whole semester!!!! but it was super easy! he doesn't use Wiley plus. final and midterm easy. he gave two quizzes throughout  the semester both were easy and everyone got 100 regardless if you did it right or wrong,1
"Amazing professor! Your grade is made up by 7 quizzes, 1 final, 1 group project, 1 lab project and extra credit. ,Microbiology is a tough subject but he gives you the tools you need and is fair in grading. Responds to emails and answers questions. I would absolutely recommend him!!",1
This was a pleasant experience. This class was an easy A because the professor made it interesting enough to want to do your best! I loved every week of the course and would highly recommend this class to anyone wanting to take Anthropology!,1
"I do not why MAE dept kept Mook in this department. He basically refuse to provide bare minimum of the content of the course. On top that Mae 340 is a diffcult course. He literally recorded audio for this calculation heavy courses. It is a calculation heavy course, we need to see the math/calculation or order to understand the concepts.",0
"This class was not at all what I expected. Reading and writing heavy and Professor Haldane was not an easy grader. If you participate and talk to her via email or for this semester, over zoom she was willing to help. The questions are not at all opinion based, there is always a right answer and if you do not get it you will get a bad grade.",1
"Very serious and straightforward. Don't even try being funny around her. Still, I LOVE saying her name!!",1
Brilliant and very supportive professor.,1
He will teach you a lot about San Francisco history but it requires a lot of note taking. I have a learning disability but as long as you take great notes and study you'll do fine in his class.,1
"Took her twice, the only English teacher I want now. Was incredibly flexible, kind, and accommodating. She helped me send a petition to the school to dismiss the failing grade I got on my first year because I explained how anxious I was. Second time I passed with flying colors, and discovered my talent for writing because of her. Favorite teacher!",1
Jagolinzer is an amazing teacher and I cannot imagine taking Corp 1 with anyone else. He definitely picks favorites but it's not hard to become one of them!,1
"Kathy is a great teacher! She does give options for extra credit which is awesome. The class isn't super easy, you have to do the work, but if you do it, you can pass!! If you're confused or having a hard time, she is more than happy to help explain anything and work with you! The labs are usually fun and she comes up with neat ideas to help you!!",1
"He isn't an easy professor, but he is a VERY good professor. As much as you want an easy class, I've learned so much from him. I worked hard and found his choice of words on exams difficult, but he is so brillant. He really knows his stuff and is more than willing to help students who show an interest in learning. I plan to take him again",1
"I have had Dr. Vanderzalm more than once as a professor and she is great.  It is extremely important to attend all of her classes, but they keep you on your toes and her notes system is clear and keeps you engaged.  Make sure you ask questions because it is part of your grade and actually hurts it quite a bit if you don't ask anything.  Take her",1
"Her projects were really fun and interesting.  she is hard on crafstmanship.  she is really nice and friendly.  tough to understand at times.  contradictory in critiques sometimes.  she grades tough, almost impossible to get an A.  it's possible but very difficult.",0
"I personally loved having him for Psych 304, everything was made very clear during lectures and he goes over the problems specifically. His tests are kinda weird bc he focuses a lot on math during lecture but his tests have conceptual idea that need to be explained thoroughly in order to get credit. I recommend honestly",1
"She said at the start the focus was on learning and not on stressing. Barely any homework and the homework that we had was fairly easy. She hates tests so we only had the required midterm and final which were also easy to pass. Otherwise, she was the nicest and coolest professor I've ever had. Definitely would recommend.",1
I took this professor for race and culture 101. He is a very harsh grader and expects you to do above the required amount. He grades assignments very late and finds any reasons to dock you off points. Would highly recommend to avoid him as a professor.,0
"I have had Ms. Walling for 3 classes, and she is AMAZING!!!! Her lectures are  Interesting, she is very helpful, and makes learning the material easier. I would sign up for any class she teachers. She is kind, helpful, and loves to make lots of jokes. This woman deserves an award and/or her own TV show. ",1
"Where to begin *sigh*. I'm a solid student, I make A's. She makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make an A in this course. She does not hold lectures, only Zoom/Webex meetings once a week-which are impossible to get into if you have a life outside of school. She is snarky, she's very picky with how she grades, and you basically teach yourself everything.",0
"If you don't take notes fast, you probably won't get all of them. The lectures are long and if you miss one class, it's like you missed three.",0
"Very good professor, very inspirational for me. This was my first class I have taken at Oakton, because of Mr. Ragy I kept going.",1
"take this class i failed english 1101 last semester, not because i was lazy or stupid but simply because the class was hard so i took it again at 9am with dr.venus and i love it. he makes his class interesting and hes so spontanious you never really know what he is going to say next. i like that. his class is not boring and easy. TAKE HIM FOR AN A",1
"I absolutely LOVE Dr. Anderson. By far one of my favorite professors here at LSU. Truly has a passion for Latin which makes it more interesting during class time. He cares more about his students' success than any teacher I've ever had. Tons of in-class quizzes to help your grade. Must be willing to study regularly to get an A, though. ",1
"He is all over the place when it comes to his lectures , he talks really fast and you can never read his handwriting. Its hard to keep up which him when he teaches. Never gets into any real good details in his lectures. At the end of the day, he is passionate in what he does and is a nice and caring person but it can be hard to keep up with him.",0
"This is the teacher to take for chemistry. He explains what are normally confusing topics extremely well. 5 tests, but he drops your lowest test grade. There are also 10 quizzes after every chapter and some extra credit. Take him.",1
He's really chill. All his classes are fun and everyone learns in his class.,1
"She is an excellent teacher and an overall very kind person. The students who have problems in this class are the ones who do not put forth effort. She doesn't do the work for you, but knows her stuff and will help you until you understand.",1
just the best,1
"One if the best teachers I've ever had! I learned so much! She teaches it in a way that is understandable, she also uses power points and study guides so you know what to focus on.",1
"Good TA, very nice.",1
Mr Wilbrandt is the best teacher I have ever had.  Econ is not a subject that is particularly interesting to me and he engaged me in the topics. He made things related and interesting. I would recommend this class with him to any of my friends.,1
"I took this class online and was much easier! I took Econ 2301 and 2302. I took five classes aside of these and I was able to pass both classes with A's!!! She's a great professor and responds emails really quick!!! If you really have to take this class,I would recommend you to take her online!!! Expect homework cause you will have some. Not hard! ",1
"I literally taught myself this class, no joke. I studied and read the textbook for HOURS daily and watched youtube videos. There might as well have not been a professor teaching the class, she reads the powerpoint slides in a monotoned voice, does not really teach. 3/4 of my class dropped and I was one of maybe a few to pass. Do not take her class.",0
"Very helpful,  understanding.   Firm rules, but that is very  useful, no surprises,  everything is upfront.",1
"great prof. really shows that he cares about each individual, highly recommend!!!!",1
Great guy who definitely understands that this material is difficult.  He is very funny and very laid back.  Good grading system as well. Take him if you can!,1
"She is such a sweet lady and a great professor. She goes out of her way to help you if you ask for it and genuinely cares. There is a lot of reading required for the class but you'll spend the majority of the class discussing it. There are reading quizzes, a midterm, final and a few papers but if you do the reading you'll be fine.",1
"I think he is not that much into teaching, and kind of irresponsible. I gave the test for him to regrade, and I never got it back. The materials is hard, and he think we understand everything already, but in fact none of us understand the subject.",0
"Yue Laoshi is one of the best professors that I have had at RPI. She genuinely cares about her students and you can tell that she absolutely loves teaching. The class is not hard, per se, but very homework intensive. You have to study a lot and put a bit of time in to the course. If you think this will be an easy A, don't take a class with her.",1
"Presents relevant content with practical application.  Conscientious, generous, invested, knowledgeable.",1
"It is so disappointing that EWU lets this teacher teach at all. I have taken this class at another school and understood it very well, now I am in it here with this teacher and it is impossible to understand or learn anything. He does not grade anything or give any feedback. He also wont work with you on ANYTHING. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"He posts his previous tests online, and he takes his new tests right from there. All his notes are online as well. He goes really fast through the material in class, so it's almost pointless to go. However, the day before exams, he gives you really good hints as to what else is going to be on the exams.",0
"Dr. Kim is a nice, funny person, but her teaching is difficult to follow. She rushes through slides, spends lots of time writing mechanisms but that's only 13 of the test. First day she told us that if you make a C or higher in her class, you're doing well. Tried multiple times to meet up with her, but she never made an effort. Avoid if possible.",0
"It's hard to pay attention but try. Generate class discussion amongst your peers, otherwise it'll feel like you're being strung out and left to die of awkward boredom.",0
Ive taken Baker also for PSYCH. Ive taken both classes online so its always more work. He added Connect to his assignments but it pays off. I currently have an A in this class and got an A in PSYCH. Replies fast to emails and always gives you reminders and tips. He wants you to pass the class and cares for your well being.,1
"Dr. Fan is amazing at what she does. If you dont understand something that she is teaching, she will repeat herself and try to make things clear. If you have never taken an Econ course before, I highly recommend taking her.",1
"If you struggled with orgo, don't be discouraged! 425 is much better! Get the book to do his EC. It can bump your final grade by up to 5%. He's a good lecturer & lets you look at your old exams. People say he teaches similar to the ACS. That's a lie. Exam 1 is a lot of chem but bio comes in after that. Go to class for the notes!",1
"One of my favorite courses that I have ever taken, and I am normally not the kind of guy who likes literature based classes! Dr. Osborne is awesome in leading discussion, and makes sure everyone is engaged. I highly recommend!",1
"most AMAZING professor i have ever taken in my life. she is SO caring. she lets you come in early before the quiz since they are timed. she lets you come for extra help and will explain it until you understand it. she gives extra credit. she explains a&p perfect and gives visual real life examples. most caring, genuine professor that wants u 2 pass",1
Best prof ive had so far at nyit. I took him last year spring && enjoyed him very much. I wish he taught every subject. Hes hilarious and a great teacher. He can make a caveman understand tmat lol,1
"Well if you have to choose between Macintosh and Majumdar...haha enjoy your semester! lol This guy goes through the book. He gives notes, but if you pay attention you can just follow exactly what he is doing in the book. And his examples come from the book...doesn't add much. He is boring and sort of weird.",0
"Sanda's class was my favorite one of this entire semester. That said, there are always two sides to things. She's tough and she will tell it like it is. But she's also very light-hearted and funny. Put the work in and do what is asked of you and there are no issues. Fight for your work though. You'll learn so much from Sanda about design.",1
Don't take it out on me just because he didn't give you a good grade.,1
Hinshaw is extremely passionate about the subject he teaches and wants to transmit that passion to his students. His tests are easy and straightforward and his lecture style is unique but interesting. Great great professor!,1
"10 Tests,6 Quizzes,& Lab points=100. Anatomy is a lot of info, so you MUST be willing to put in time as she does put tricky questions on her tests/quizzes. Pros: You can drop 2 tests (100 points each) & 1 quiz (20 points). Few extra credit on tests. Cons: Very confusing on what she is asking on test/Exams are difficult (I studied a lot).",0
Maybe it was just my specific scenario but like the last weeks were brutal because all the assignments she had given out were all due the same day and MIND you were all given out the same day. Still a good teacher but not the best experience. She doesn't like hearing whispering so be silent once class starts. Participate or else she gets weird.,1
"Spectacular prof. He will definitely wake you up at 8.30. I'm not into accounting at all (econ. major), but I loved his class. The homework assignments aren't that tough, he's often in his office, and has very interesting case studies in the wake of corp. scandals. Grading is fair (emphasis on tests). I want Thibodeau as a motivational coach.",1
Awesome teacher.,1
"I don't get why people have a problem with Dr. Egiseli.  Yes, he expects you to be on time, pay attention, and do thorough accurate work.  In other words he expects that, if you want to be a professional, you behave like one.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I found him responsive and very helpful.",1
"Speaks too softly, constantly loses control/attention of the class. Questions his own intelligence in front of class. ""Does that make sense?"" You're the one with the PhD. You tell me. Easy classes. Got a B without trying, caring, or hardly even showing up.",0
"Great facilitator... makes you think.  Very fair.  Entertaining, funny, witty, and knowledgeable",1
"Prof. K is absolutely an entertaining and helpful teacher. He focuses on composition, and if you focus your art work on composition, you will get an A. As long as you try, he will see that. I thought he was hilarious, and his class was fun to attend. Overall, he's a great professor, I wish he taught more classes at UMBC. He is brilliant",1
He tries to make his class as interesting as possible. Just show up and study his notes,1
Hes was a great teacher!! He helps everyone with wutever they need! Hes also a cool person to talk to!!,1
"I thought she was awesome. She's hilarious, has been teaching for multiple years, and she has actual experience in her field in the real world. Make sure to attend every class because if you miss one you may struggle to get back. You're supposed to read the textbook but as long as you are their for notes in class, you'll be fine. Exams aren't hard.",1
Mike's feedback and grading criteria are unclear and subjective. Everything we read was gratuitously sexual and/or violent. The content of the class was honestly disturbing. Mike is not tolerant of the opinions of his students and is downright condescending and rude. My high school English classes were infinitely better.,0
"I would NOT recommend Eric for anyone who struggles with math. He is a nice guy, but he really isn't the best teacher. If you are the type of person who can figure out math on your own, he'd be good for you. For those who need extra help and an easier breakdown, he is definitely not for you.",0
"He hadn't taught Bio100 in a long time and it was very obvious that he wasn't as into it like he is with anatomy. Comes prepared, will answer questions. Okay teacher, but not a great teacher, or a bad one.",1
"Pretty easy course; five discussions, five quizzes, one mid-term, final exam, and one paper. His lectures are bit out-dated and hard to navigate so I ended up learning from the book most of the time. Make sure to stay on top of your paper though because it will creep up on you. Overall decent professor, and fairly solid course.",1
"Tanoukhi is hands down the most amazing professor I've had. She is extremely philosophical, but that helped change the way I approach literature. She is the most intelligent professor I've ever seen, and her lectures are never boring. I may be biased, but don't listen to the negative reviews. Take a class with her. If you work, you won't regret it!",1
The quizzes are really time consuming and require you to really read through the chapters. He makes interesting comments during class. Tests are half based on lecture notes and half based on quizzes.,1
"You have you to take this guy for any class. He'll get you all ""fired up"" about accounting. Go to his office and talk to him just to say hi, he's so friendly! ""How bout that?!"" P.S. ask him where he goes shopping for his clothing.",1
"Be prepared to do A LOT of homework (2-4 MyMathLab sections) and 1 quiz each week! Unlimited attempts with the homework, and 2 attempts for each quiz. Straight forward, the homework and quizzes are graded so heavily that you absolutely CAN pass with at least a C- even if you bomb the exams. DO YOUR HOMEWORK until you get 100%, quizzes based on HMWK",1
"Dr. Larson is a fantastic professor. He has been a great advisor.  I am not his assigned advisee, it hasn't prevented him from going the extra mile to ensure I was on the right track. Highly recommend taking as many classes as possible from him.",1
No Comments,1
"He is next to impossible to reach outside of class and does not offer office hours. There is no homework besides studying for weekly tests, and he does not accommodate you at all for missing a class. He does not give out any material outside of class so if you missed something he said or missed a paper handed out then too bad.",0
"I'm another student disappointed that he will not be teaching 494 in the spring. I was looking forward to this. I did 446 with him and LOVED it. A lot of work, but, hey, isn't college supposed to be hard work? We heard that the dean did not want him to teach because he always catches the plagiarizers. What does that say about WSU Admins?",1
"Sp 20 Honestly speaks in Spanish the whole time, youll be lost, and shes got a lot of attitude when she emails you. Stay clear",0
"Miss Dee is the best. I hated speech communication but since I met her, I realize how speech is very interesting. Not because of what it is but the way this professor delivers and her way of teaching. I never got bored not left alone. She really helps when you need help and easy to communicate with. I recommend her fully !!",1
"If you can get past his accent, Dr. Tang explains concepts exceptionally clearly. Lectures are well-paced. However, you'll want to write down what he says because slides don't have much text. He does post summaries though. Generous to students. Clickers are easy if you pay attention. Exams are fair. Textbook was not emphasized. Class is +/-.",1
She really makes you work hard for your grade. She's somewhat helpful but doesn't make sense a lot of the time. Easy-ish class. Just felt awkward in her class.,1
Prof. Brandt asks a lot of questions that make you think and loves to have discussions with his students. He is also super helpful. He is really funny and sarcastic. Lots to read but he gives explanations for everything and helps you understand readings. Make sure you ask him to explain his notes on your papers cuz they're essential to your grade.,1
"Great professor, willing to work with you if you're taking the class seriously.",1
"I took elementary span 1 online w. her & it was tragic. Homework was due every week (over 70 assignments, not exaggerating) The class description said it was for people with little to no knowledge of Spanish (me) but the work was for Span 2 speakers. WHATEVER YOU DO STAY AWAY SHE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING AT ALL. I WISH THERE WERE MORE CHARACTERS ...",0
She is a great professor. She works with her students and offers extra credit...Do the extra credit because she doesn't round your grade up for that reason.A lot of her test questions come from the diagrams in the book so study those...,1
Great funny prof. Average grader for the course. 100% would take again,1
The best professor at ACC.  Has an amazing ability to explain complicated stuff in a way that makes it fun to learn.,1
"If you have her for UI100 RUN!!! This was supposed to be an easy class but we had 2-4 worksheets of homework every day. The projects were also difficult. She wrote her own ""workbook"" you have to use almost your whole printing money to print out and then fill out the pages. We also had to recite these weird pledges to her at the beginning of class..",0
"I loved his class! He's really nice and is there for students with whatever they need help with! There are only two exams - midterm and final. They are mostly based on his lectures, so take copious notes and attend all the classes. Also, the weekly online assignments and quizzes were very helpful in understanding the lessons. I learn so much!",1
"Average professor. Tough but fair. I wasnt a very big fan & found him to lack connection with his students... despite being very interactive with him, I was just another fish in the sea. Usually I like weekly quizzes, but his were tough. He also comes off a bit rude, but I think he thinks he is trying to be funny.  He wasnt bad, but wasnt good.",1
No Comments,1
Easy class. Professor shows up late to class often but assignments and projects are easy.,1
"Dr. Shawn Kildea is a great professor and you can tell he really enjoys what he does. The class is a lecture-type, but he always wants class feedback and participation. His tests are easy as long as you review your notes and take advantage of the study guides he provides you with. He's funny, has a great sense of humor and isn't bad on the eyes ;-)",1
"Julie, I know I'm not alone for saying this, but you are wonderful, caring, and there for us. You stand out and the dept would be lost without you.",1
Prof. Tucker is so sweet understanding and understands communications throughly. She keeps up to date with current forms of communications so well!!,1
"The first 60% of the course is a joke.  Quizzes are moderately difficult, but all answers can be googled.  The ""Virtual Emergency"" exercise is easy in theory, unfortunately Ali botched it due to clericaltechnical errors.   The final exam is extremely difficult (and worth 40%), and would require a didactic memory to succeed.  ",0
"Shes the best professor Ive had by far. Shes so understand and sweet I love her. Her class is easy. Participate and do your work. Thats all that matters. She loves what she does and its obvious. Shes so passionate about what she teaches, and I admire her so much for that.",1
"This class has been the most eye-opening/thought-provoking classes I have taken at UofM. If you're Pre-Med, consider taking this course to learn about the other side of medicine. The papers are not easy, but if you engage in the readings and talk to GSIs, you'll be just fine. Liz is a fantastic prof and person--I guarantee you will learn a lot.",1
He has a good way of teaching things and is very knowledgeable. He is pretty funny amd knows how to keep the student engaged. Hes the kind of teacher that wont out you to sleep.,1
"Great class overall! Learned a lot, good lectures, some in class group work but it's not too demanding. Would take again.",1
"Hiking class; be sure to check dates of hikes before starting class. First class is about 2 hours of lecture and you wouldn't want to sit through that if your not available for the hikes. Also, hikes were said to go earlier and past the actual listed class time. Most hikes you will need to drive to and can carpool. Teacher seems really nice!",1
"He is pretty good at teaching the material, but pretty bad at giving feed back and sometimes is disrespectful when answering questions.  Almost as if he thinks its a dumb question or is trying to be funny.  Show up to class and do as much homework as you can and you'll pass.",1
"Dr. Kunz first tells you that he will be monotone and boring, but he actually pokes fun at himself and it's hilarious. He gives out quizzes once a week, 10 questions all multiple choice, and right from the slidesnotes. No surprises and everything is really interesting if you follow along. Study for the quizzes, and you're golden. ",1
"Great teacher. But, you shouldn't trust her. Be cautious when approaching.",1
Great teacher explains things very well. I failed math a few times before having her now I am getting 100's.,1
"LOVE this class! My favorite by far! Fultz knows his stuff, watch out for the final it's over the whole semester! I can't say enough good about him. I wish I could take his class for all of my Biol classes!!",1
"Prof Amitava Dutta is very knowledgeable about his subject, he cares about his students, he responds his emails very fast and his YouTube video is very helpful. Don't expect to get an easy A, you have to work hard and you will learn so much like SQL, ER using Visio that is related to your future job.",1
"Very caring sweet professor. Her exams are based off the power points. Labs are the only thing that is time consuming and slightly difficult. However, she will always check on you and if you have any questions she'll give you good feedback. She does give you extra credit and there isn't any quizzes. Study the objectives and you'll pass with an A.",1
"Saralina is the real life Leslie Knope. This is a professor that knows speech isnt loved by everyone and makes you as comfortable as possible while still guiding you out of your comfort zone. She supplements speech assignments with Ted Talks and readings about writing, and journaling is a part of class.",1
"Even though much of the class was failing, she would say that this was baby bio in comparison to the Biology course she took in college. This was demoralizing and humiliating. She also would discourage nursing students who have children, which I thought was odd because Goodwin is a career-focused college with a lot of students who have families.",0
"Professor Wang is an excellent instructor. Class notes and answers to classwork are posted on Canvas. Her lectures were clear and, overall, helped me improve my math skills. This is an accelerated math class. If you are up for the challenge, this class is definitely worth taking.",1
"Let me say off the bat that Duba is not my cup of tea. I think that he needs to spend less time creating humorously contrived analogies and more time learning how to teach and present information clearly. He is a neat guy, but a mediocre teacher at best. Still, he's much better than our little Greek friend.",1
"Don't know why others have rated him so low. He is really nice guy and great professor. No multiple choice questions. Easy exams. easy grading system. Show up in class and do homework, you will be fine.",1
"Gives tons of reading and writing, oblivious to your time. Thinks his class is the only thing you do with your life. Boring lecture, very repetitive, monotone voice. Grades and does not explain why you got a grade",0
"Dr. Gordon is the best history professor I've had at UA so far. You need to attend his lectures to pass, but its worth it. He has 2 tests (midterm, final), 5 book discussions and quizzes, and essay of your choosing. Gives study guides for tests. Guy is a solid gem and keeps his classes interesting. Would take again. Definitely worth it",1
She's honestly the most amazing person I've ever met she cares about you and really wants to help. the material in class is never boring because she talks about things we really go through on an everyday basis. definitely take her you wont regret it you'll have an amazing semester with her!,1
"She is awesome. Willing to help you understand the information. Study powerpoints, no surprises on test everything comes from notes. She records her lecture so you can go back and listen if you need!",1
Alyssa is really funny and likes to say a joke at the beginning of each class. Alyssa is a very tough trader so much do all your assignments. I loved being in her class and I really learned a lot about how my writing process needed to be improved a bit more.,1
Dr. Zhao is an incredibly good professor. His notes are basically the exams. Offers a 5% boost to overall grade with easy EC assignments. Very helpful in office hours. Go to every single class and you will get a point back on each exam. The only difficult thing about this class was the ACS final. Put in the work and you will get a good grade.,1
She is a good professor but the language barrier is an issue and she gives a lot of work. As long as you do all your work and show up for class you will get an A.,1
Harddddd class. Hardest of the series. If you can make it through this class the other two in the series will be a piece of cake. Don't get on her bad side :),0
"Professor Callaway is knowledgeable about the Old Testament and the kindest professor. Learned a lot about the OT that made the class really interesting. The microtheme grading was pretty fair in my opinion, and both of the exams have a study guide identical to the test. Would highly recommend especially for a core requirement.",1
"He lectures slowly so you will be able to take good notes and understands him. He is there to answer any questions during and after class. He gives group project which helps a lot because students are able to help one another to understands the material. Do not miss class,  study and do your homework; you will be fine.",1
He is really confusing,0
"I had Jorgen for an upper division metaphysics class and it is the most rewarding class Ive ever taken. He consistently raised the bar and helped me achieve what felt impossible every week. It was tough, rewarding, and I left a better philosopher and student then when I came in. Hes very accessible and really cares about student success.",1
"She is very helpful. Her directions for assignments and projects are simple, but you should always ask her for help when you need it. She was always happy to help me improve in the class, I'm sure she will be happy to help you improve as well. Remember to always practice every day for your speeches, and dress nicely for them. Have fun! I got a B.",1
Pat has been a phenomenal guide in the world of journalism. He works with you and cares about improving your writing. I can say I'm a much more concise writer because I took his classes. Thanks Pat!,1
"Brilliant teacher, passionate,  definitely recommend him. As long as you keep up with the work and ask questions when you're confused on whatever is going on you will do well in the class.",1
"I don't often take online courses, but I definitely vouch for her. I work full-time and there were times where I would miss a deadline for an assignment or even miss a quiz or exam. For whatever the problem, she was able to respond the next day and give not just positive feedback, but she allowed more time, and even curved my grade.",1
"He's a natural at teaching, and math is his passion. You can see it in his lectures, he's so good at explaining every subject and wants to do what he can to help you pass. The best professor you could ask for.",1
"Everyone on Dr. De Vos' profile seems to think he's a terrible professor but he is actually quite caring, and his lecture/exams are NOT difficult. He gives you the exam items far in advance and he is very thorough in lecture. If you need help, ask. He is very approachable. If you take accountability for your own education, you will be just fine.",1
"Dr. Beckman's classes are not only interesting, but extremely useful in the real world. Highly recommend the program and miss being in his classes.",1
"Overall, lectures are really boring, quizes are fairly easy if you watch the boring movies, essays are ok and no makeup or extra credit. Rather take a different class. Dont take this class unless mandatory.",0
"Rizzella is awesome.I was terrified of taking stats but worked hard and got an A...very fair,clear, and fun!Our class was a blast, and thats saying alot for a stats class!Wish I could take more classes with her.",1
Professor Parkhurst has honestly had a big difference in how I write. I have learned a lot from this course that I know will be useful for my upper level classes. He was very approachable during office hours and easy to reach through email. Mr. Parkhurst genuinely cares about the future of his students.,1
"Dr. Childs is great! I thought logic was going to be very difficult but Dr. Childs does an excellent job explaining the material and making sure everyone understands! She's very understanding and hilarious. If you want an awesome teacher and an A, take Dr. Childs!",1
"Mr. Hunt makes Law fun. He is constantly making jokes about lawyers and explains every single term, definition, case, etc. in great detail. He breaks everything down to make it very easy to understand. He included two curves on exams in my class and allowed extra credit as well. I would take any of his classes in a heart beat! one of the best!",1
Such a great teacher. Super easy and everything is in groups. Everyone pretty much passed with 90+. He also does extra credit. Very nice teacher and always helps his students EVEN ON TEST. Easy A,1
"Really great, he helped me improve so much. His class is fun, though you do have to work hard if you want an A.",1
he is nice and if you ask questions he tries to help you anyway possible. any students who wants an slower pace math class this is it(:,1
Boring lectures.  Assignments are VERY unclear.  She busted 1/3 of my class for plagerism on a website we built so make sure you document your sources.,0
Prof. Zhao is a pretty chill professor. The course content is a bit dry due to the nature of subject. The course consists of 2 midterms and 1 final making up 90% of the grade with 10% biweekly homework. The tests are pretty straightforward (although the class average always seem to be low). A relatively easy A compare to other econ classes.,1
I wish all professors be like him,1
She's really descriptive in lecture. She i really nice if you need help but she's really straightforward. I really enjoyed this class. The test was  a bit challenging though because it had 20 TF 20 MC and 10 short answer than were all sort of memorization. ,1
In this class you will learn about the cultural aspect of filmmaking. Deep dives into film techniques and events that impact various countries and how they revolutionized film. The readings are interesting and the professor is very knowledgable. I don't think the class takes a lot of effort but you do need to study in order to write the essays.,1
"Tough class, not many people expect Biology 160 to be so in depth.  Definitely have to put in A LOT of studying time.  Wouldn't recommend taking a lot of credits along with this class if you want to get an A.  She definitely knows her stuff, however, sometimes myself and other students felt that she forgets we are brand new to the subject.",1
"teacher is not clear with material, very broad but quiz questions are very specific and built to trick you. They suggest to log into the VOH sessions but they are useless and do not provide any important information. The reading material is extremely heavy for a 200 level  elective course. I strongly do not recommend this class.",0
"She is tough, but very organized and thorough. She returns papers within a week, sometimes less. She is very picky about punctuation, capitalization, and shows you how to improve your work. Does not accept late assignments.",1
This professor will change your approach to theater arts.  insightful very smart refreshingly weird  supportive of contemporary ideas/ student beliefs/ and personal truths  of each person in class- so that he listens to each.  intimidating   ,1
"Louis is one of the best lecturers I've had at UVa and SO. HOT.  He is incredibly charismatic but people with less of a background/interest in history might find his lectures difficult to keep up with.  I greatly enjoyed this class, and would recommend it to anyone interested in Southern history/art",1
She is very enthusastic about Biology.  She is easy to work with and will help anyone.  However her test can be difficult at times.,1
"Took him for Lessons from Europe. It was an interesting class and held in a large lecture hall in the AB building, but seats would fill up quickly so try coming in a few minutes early! I enjoyed the class but it's so easy to find yourself scrolling on Facebook a few minutes into class. Notes weren't as thorough so thats where the readings come in",1
"I love Cote! She is super tough though. I managed to get an A in her class but only after studying for hours for each test and I never missed a lecture. She is specific on what you need to know, especially what you need to memorize for each test and quiz. For lab, ask questions! if you mess up in lab she will get angry, so it's better to clarify .",1
"It's amazing Madam Pillai wasn't more frustrated by the disrespectful borderline hostile attitude some students had. Before and during class, ignorant backward comments could be heard from some people. She was always prepared and tried to teach, but unfortunately some students were openly rude and disruptive. Grading is clear and straightforward.",1
Just memorize random facts from his book and you will do fine on the exams - if you have sharp memorization skills. There's actually little to no actual learning about NUTRITION in this class. It's basically Biochemistry 2.0. I am disappointed because the instructor failed at articulating the material in lectures. Just memorize his book.,0
"Justice is a good professor. I had little difficulty in understanding the content of the course. He is always willing to help students. There are no exams but many quizzes, which are pulled from the optional homework. I recommend taking his class.",1
"What I enjoyed was the level of professionalism. Mr. Hoover goes out of his way to make the material easier and understandable. He is willing to work with you and help. If you go to class, listen, and do the homework- you should pass. If you fail his class- it's because you never went to class or your just stupid. He is fair and a good teacher.",1
Consistent lectures and light hearted. Easy to pay attention to.,1
"Take this course!! She is an amazing educator and the class was not only enlightening but very helpful in my career and personal life. Turn in your work on time, read every module, and you'll do just fine. The book is great as well. I plan to use the book's lessons in my everyday life.",1
Natalia is from Russia so she has an accent and demands respect from her students. She wants everyone to come to class and pay attention. She is not rude. If you do those things you should be fine. She will go over all the quizzes fully which will make the exams easier. What ever she says will be on the exam will be there.,1
Wow I took African-American Art and it was a complete waste of my time. Gelburd makes this class difficult since she grades like everyone is an art major.  She is no help in any way and doesn't care about her students at all.  Her scratchy voice gives me migraines and I'd rather fail than have to sit through her class for another year,0
"I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!!! But remember: Pittman expects you to do your work. Pay attention. Write your essays. Study. It's not hard to get a great grade if you study - but if you don't care enough about your education to study this isn't the class for you. Pittman has a beautiful Minnesotan accent, is a lovely person to talk to, and very helpful.",1
"yeah, tell her she's pretty, and you will get a good grade",0
"Worse 101 to take @ NYIT. Do not take this professor, she gives at least 4 pages of notes per class. Makes you write essays from a book with garbage. Her mid term and final are stupid, you won't learn anything here. You be better off in a English class than her trash class. Oh yeah btw she has a project which is stupid along with final so GL.",0
"Koh can sometimes come off as intense and strict, but Koh is a great professor. He has flexible office hours and always takes the time to answer student questions on Piazza. Lectures (ignoring the Big-O section in the beginning, which I thought was pretty rough) are actually taught well. The homework is difficult though. Always start early.",1
I took Dr. Makover's Calc I class a long time ago. Years have passed and I still see reviews that mirror the horror of my Calculus class. Avoid him at all costs. I dropped his class and retook it with another professor... took that professor for most of my other math courses.. Got A's in all of them.,0
Professor Aragona is an amazing professor who is very understanding. I enjoyed taking her class and I hope she is teaching my other edu classes next semester.,1
"Very good professor. One of the only profs in EMU College of Nursing who is actually a practicing nurse practitioner. However, her exams are very difficult. I came into this class with ALL A's my first year of nursing school and this class will be my first B. You have to study a ton for her exams and the info is not in the powerpoints.",1
"Professor Horan has a very simple grading procedure: if you follow instructions and do the assigned work, you will pass with an A. If you follow the rubrics, you will pass. He is also hilarious and a movie buff so that's a plus. One of the best professors I've ever had.",1
Easy B fench class!!! Try and you'll get an A-. She will notice if you're not there and homework may be posted on sundays,1
He's a great professor who likes English way too much.,1
"Greta works alongside you to help you earn the grade you deserve. She is a very fair grader, but is always willing to help you succeed.",1
"Online class is dreadful. She has no concept of design and should not be labeled as such. Does not give you the freedom to make an up to date website. Instead, she insists that your site be straight from the 90's. Class is unorganized. Rude when helping. Thinks you should already know. First web class was ok. This one is not.",0
"Great online class! All you have to do is read through the PowerPoints that she provides, and you will pass.",1
"Pete was a wonderful teacher this past semester. He was fun, energetic, and willing to broach the hard topics to get us to think. As long as you show up to class, participate, and do the daily response papers (a few sentences minimum) you will find it to be fun and enlightening, He is willing to help if you need it and will explain further as well.",1
"I don't understand the tough grading on here. My experience with Dr. Meche is great because I do all the assigned reading. He does, however, ask that the students really read the material and post six separate discussion posts. (at minimum 200 words a pop). I think he just wants us to actually get something out of the class. Clear on criteria!",1
"it is hard to understand her lectures, however her quizzes are super easy and help your grade. the exams consist of a lot of studying from the book since her lectures aren't the best. its doable, you just have to work for it. she's a nice lady and would respond to my emails. offers extra credit. final is online , I recommend her if you're not lazy",1
"Her exams are extremely difficult with no help from lectures. She's a tough grader and her assistants are even worse. she's VERY kind, very attractive, great personality etc but as a professor, she's a wolf in sheep's clothing. 100% AVOID.",0
"I can't stand this class- he teaches the 201 class like a 101 class. Having been in AP English for 2 years, I'm writing in a way that would have been used in my freshman year of High School. The class moves at a slow pace and I am learning nothing. He focuses too much on stereotypes and reinforces them. There is no research- just prove his ideas.",1
"Without a doubt the worst professor I've had so far. Very poorly organized barely teaches anything and the group project is a mess. Any feedback you get back from her is confusing and unhelpful I don't think she even knows what she is looking for. Attendance is a significant part of your grade as well, which is frustrating because of how bad she is",0
"Prof. Casteneda is the best professor to take for Spanish.. The woman teacher is probably an easier course, however, Casteneda teaches so you can actually use it later on in life. As long as you do your quia and wimba and go to class, you're pretty much guaranteed an A or high B, if not.. don't take Spanish at all!",1
This teacher is extremely hard for 100 level beginners spanish class. Wish i knew that before taking her. Although she is hard she is really thorough and does a really good job at explaining and helping you understand the chapters. Make sure you do every assignment possible and go to every class if you want the best possible grade (obviously).,1
"Prof Marsh is great in the aspect that he is very kind and has a vast amount of knowledge in Bio. His testing style killed me. Only 4 tests for a whole book sounds great right? Yeah, no. That means every test is 3-5 chapters of info. Even if you do reading, hit lectures, use his notes and study questions. Half or more of the class dropped. ",1
She made me mad that my previous professors have been so confusing! So sweet and kind just an all around great person! She went out of her way to help a student who almost fainted in class by taking them home to make sure they were safe. SHE MAKES MATH EASY!,1
"LOVE Mrs. Barclift!! It doesn't get any better than this. I had her for May and Summer I terms and I laughed the entire 2 hours we were there. She makes learning so much fun, and she really knows what she's talking about. GREAT teacher.",1
Ms. White was a good teacher and really knew how to make the learning environment fun. The only issue for me is there was only 3 exams and that was your grade. Personally Im not a big fan of that style of grading. Other than that she is a great teacher. ,1
Moves too fast. Doesn't go over unless it's the day of the test.,1
"Listen to me. Listen to these reviews. DO NOT, unless you have no other choice, take this instructor. Just save yourself a semester of pain.",0
"Nimrod Segev made me love macroeconomics, a feat that I thought impossible. He is an incredible teacher and is truly dedicated to teaching. During finals he stayed in his office for 12 hours straight to help anyone who needed it, whether they took his class or not. I want to have him as a teacher again, and I hope you do as well.",1
"Professor Hahn is all around very good. She has an accent which can make things difficult to understand at times but she tries very hard/is very enthusiastic. She is hilarious, kind and very personable. Some times she moves a little fast, but that is to be expected with the amount of material.",1
"MMA works with you if she sees that you're trying your best. She's kind and respectful. I jumped right into 051, and I was able to recall a lot of forgotten French. Classes are small. There's a lot of work every week. Assignments are often disconnected. You'll learn the subjunctive in 051. Google Translate and WordReference are helpful!",1
Very good.,1
"Attendance is vital to passing the class. The hardest class I have taken so far. Lots of homework, but it balances out your grade because the tests are brutal. Shes a good teacher, but talks very fast and once you fall behind its hard to catch back up. Its a lot of self-teaching as well. Be prepared for any question she asks, theres a lot.",1
"Prof. Thompson is a very cool teacher. Just read (skim) and bug him about giving you a study guide. Tests are a variety: M/C, T/F, short answer & short essay. Funny teacher. Would take again. Highly recommended.",1
Really great professor! He tries his best to make lectures fun and interesting. His grading system is very fair and as long as you do all the work its a real easy A. He does his best to help you learn and to help you with anything you don't understand. Very relaxed guy.,1
"Literally the best class ever. 5 essays that are 400 words minimum each, she gives us 2 topics to choose from and you just have to read the book and write about it. Finished majority of mine in 1-2 hrs because its so easy. Shes also a very easy grader and the quizzes you get 2 tries and you find almost everything in the PowerPoint.",1
Sets high expectations for all students. Does not let students get by without putting in the work.,1
"Excellent instructor. She clearly knows the content she teaches. She is approachable, caring, and gives real-world examples to help solidify content. If information is repeated in class, it is important to know and understand. Pay attention to her notes and then read the info in the book that correlates with the content and you'll do well.",1
"Not really any homework. Just a couple tests and a short paper. Book isn't really necessary, mainly just study the PowerPoint presentations. She will go around and call you out one by one to make sure you know the material. Other than that pretty easy class. LOUD speaker. ",1
legend!,1
"I took Prof Steiner for Intermediate Algebra to prep for College Algebra and this class was a breeze. She really takes her time to fully explain everything and make sure that every student understands. If you struggle with math, I highly recommend her. There is a fair amount of work, but it's easy to understand. The study guides prep you for tests.",1
"Great class, great professor! I am a really busy person so I appreciate that everything was so well organized, no last minute surprises. I used the study guides she provided and they seemed to match the tests really well.",1
"This class is sorta funky because it's centered around your midterm and final with a presentation additionally. Form a study group, and do the readings. Finding online summaries and analyses helps because it makes the readings easier to understand and that helps you with the in-class discussion. Be prepared to talk. But Osborne's understanding",1
"class was interesting, tests were very very hard, took the class in the summer and got a D.",1
This class is SO much work. There are 3 tests and a cumulative final which is optional if you have the average you need to not take it. There is a financial report that is submitted in 2 parts which is VERY time consuming and he doesn't help you on it at all. There are hw's on MyFinanceLab for each chapter. He doesn't explain concepts very well.,0
"She's difficult but you learn a lot. I received an A but it wasn't an easy A. She cares a lot about the students. She made classes interesting by having us do debates at the end of class. If you are looking for an easy A, she might not be the best for that. If you are looking to stretch yourself, do your best and learn a lot, then Karen is for you.",1
"He is a great guy and seems to really care about his students, he really wants people to do well and succeed in this course. His notes are pretty easy to follow and he tries his best to explain questions to make them easier on us. If you study and pay attention in class it's not a hard course!",1
She is nice and amazing.,1
"easy grader, easy A. you can revise as many times as you want. no grammar quiz , no reading, just writing",1
Sumi is one of a kind teacher. She gets straight to the point and teaches you the basics. Which gets you into trouble on the test cuz she throws in some minor details that you didn't learn in class but if you read along in the book her tests are pretty easy. Will definitely be taking her again.,1
Prof. Gibson is one of the best English teachers I have ever had. I have never been good in writing but she takes the time to help you and walk you through the whole process. If you get anything lower then a B in her class is cause you are lazy. I took her for 1101 & 1102 and would take her again if I could.,1
"Great professor! His lectures are super interesting, you will never be bored. He delivered the lectures in a way that keeps you engaged in the material. Also he is more than happy to meet w/ you if you are falling behind. This class does require a lot of reading (5/6 books). But all the reading is worth it, i learned so much in this class.",1
"His classes are a combination of ethology, human psychology, biopsychology, and research psychology.  If you are not serious about the subject then you are in the wrong class.  If you want to be a well rounded psychologist/ethologist/bio or neuro psychologist/research psychologist then you need to at least attend some of his lectures.",1
"I learned a lot about marginalized cultures and their values. The class open my mind to thinking as a global person and not myopically American. The professor, Dr. Olufemi, was very emphatic about student use of critical and creative thinking and less of rote learning. The topics entail videos, discussions, online activities, projects, etc.",1
Professor Bonner is literally my favorite and one of the best instructors that cares about his students passing his class. His syllabus is easy to follow. Hmwk is done on mymathlab. He gives random quizzes like 16 of them and will choose your 10 highest scores. If you stay on top of your hmwk and quizzes you will pass with an easy A !!,1
He talks A LOT. No homework.... just 4 essays. Fair grader. Nice and sweet person! ,1
"Seriously, jump at any opportunity to learn from or work with Professor Nelson. The way that he structures his courses is clearly masterful -- you'll learn heaps from lecture alone because this man knows how to TEACH. Be prepared for one of those rare classes that truly reminds you why educational institutions are sacred and indispensable things.",1
"Barbara was one of the worst professors I've had. Her notes are very dense, aren't really in order sometimes and very confusing for a first level course. Very hard marker, not clear on what she expects. In order to understand the material, expect to teach yourself. Several in class quizzes but the answers you could never get. avoid her if possible.",0
Prof Epley is a nice lady who grades fairly. There was only a total of 3 full essays wrote of 1200 words or more. Everything was pretty simple. She was a sign of relief for a first year college student. Engage in the class discussions! Overall she was a good teacher who is clear about expectations and assignments.,1
"Professor Smith's class was pretty easy, quizzes during and after each chapter that you can find the answers to in the text. She requires you to do a blog research paper on The trail of Tears which is 20% of your grade. I passed with a 94 and I made a 83 on my paper. Pretty easy class. 4 total tests/exams.",1
"She is a very ambiguous teacher, so expect to have to go to office hours if you want to know what she is looking for. If you like a structured class, I would not recommend her.",1
Very hard to get an A with her first off. Also kind of doesn't sympathize with students who work outside of class and can't make every meeting. Doesn't respond to emails. Negatives aside she is caring and energetic and I appreciate that in a teacher. Pretty middle of the road as they come.,1
"Professor provided the text book - Easy discussion boards, web assignment (reading article and answering questions) and a quiz for each chapter. All answers to quizzes and final exam are on quizlet. Lot of assignments for a 5 week course. 27 total.",1
"GREAT professor!  Best bussiness professor in bergen ccc. Very helpful, prepares u for the real world. Great sense of humor u won't fall asleep. Prepare for presentations, papers and group meeting. Great experience. He cares about the students. However don't get confuces! U have to study hard to pass this class.",1
"Professor Lane is a very nice lady, and she knows her stuff, but sometimes she'd get off topic or not answer the questions she was asked. Everything was pretty much straightforward, but the honors section has to write a group research paper which was a little rough. Provided review quizzes for the final that were very close to the final itself",1
"an amazing professor, take anything with him, it will be worth it",1
"Condescending, stammering, not interested in discussion or alternative viewpoints...kind of a jerk sometimes. Says the word ""uh"" about five times in every sentence, making him difficult to listen to for more than a few minutes. I will avoid taking any other class with him.",0
"great lady, she really cares about the material she's teaching and whether or not the students understand.",1
"Dr. Raja's class isn't that hard, but be prepared to be talked down to a lot...I just kept my head down and surfed the back row.  Not a lot of busy work outside of class at least.  You can pull off a B in her class relatively easily if you just study a bit and show up, but I found her sense of humor and attitude toward students really irritating.",0
"Truly the best teacher i've ever had. He not only enjoys what he teaches, but enjoys helping students learn. He also understands that not everybody is a Bio major, which is good. He is always extremely nice and personable with his students. I was always excited to go to his class just because he put me in a better mood. Absolutely take his class!",1
"Very good professor. Really loves astronomy, makes the class interesting. Everything is posted online and textbook is free online. Really easy class for general ed .",1
"Very hard teacher, acts as if you should already know everything he is teaching you. Does not give study guides, and tests are nothing like the hw on connect. Very rude and if you ask him a question he answers with a mean response and makes you feel stupid. Every test had a mean of 50 or less. Would not take a class from him ever again.",0
Very helpful! Great professor!,1
"The class isn't the easiest, but she's the best professor to take it with.",1
"The most unaccommodating professor I have had; having gone through 3 colleges. If you go to Broward College because you're a working professional, family provider, or anyone who's priorities trump school on occasion, run. If you email her ahead of time you're good. Unforeseen circumstances will end you. She forces you to make her your #1 priority.",1
He's really helpful if your willing to learn. If your not understanding what he's trying to teach he will figure out a way to help you understand it.,1
"Shes a good professor if you want to learn hands on and work hard, she makes you work for your grade but she appreciates hard work and youll be rewarded rightly for it. Do your research and learn as much as you can and youll do great.",1
"I had over 100 credit hours when I took her class and it was enough to make me consider dropping out. It was the worst college experience I've ever had. You'll pour days of your life into the project and be proud of the result. But regardless, she'll be offended by your efforts and tear every piece you turn in to shreds with no guidance provided.",0
"This class was a challenge, his lectures were interesting and understandable but not really exactly what you can expect on the test...TEST ARE REALLY HARD...I havent completed the course yet but Im praying for aleast a ""C""...if you want to learn than take this course,you cant slack at all....no room to,oh attendence isnt mandatory but still attend!",0
"He's a really kind & helpful professor. There are 4 exams each based on handouts given on lecture. Assignments are too much but very simple & manageable. He is very helpful on assignment due dates, grade curves, & gives you plenty of chances to complete unfinished assignments or improve your bad grades. Try all you can, do everything, you're fine.",1
She is a helpful teacher who knows her material.Discussions have a gender/class/race analysis.This is important in life. People who complain about that need to check themselves on  their personal discrimination and behavior.,1
"Not only did I think I would dread public speaking but at 7:30 am on Monday which is my one day off?  However, I will say I am so glad I took his class. I rarely looked at the time in his class because he made it interesting to be there. He allows you to pick your speech topics, making the possibilities endless. Mr. Carter really inspired me!",1
First 1/3 of class is basic socialogy concepts/framework. Teacher tries to make class interesting for 300+ people but doesn't care if you fall asleep. Attendence checks help grade. Tests are hard! Lots of material to remember-- lecture & text based.,1
"Excellent professor. As straightforward as one gets. She's tough, but if you do the work and come to class religiously, as anyone should, you WILL get an A. But know this- you need to understand the material and DO the problems. Taking notes simply will not help. Look over her slides, do all the problems and you really should do well on her exams.",1
"Professor Olson, truly has a passion for Anthropology. Her lectures are informative and a lot of reading. There are quizzes (15) for every module and lectures. There are two exams with assignments and discussions. Be prepared to fully answer her questions or she will deduct points. Study, she makes sure you have learned the material . She is nice.",1
"Dr. Russell is a truly helpful and compassionate professor, both inside and outside the classroom. In her classes, Dr. Russell sets reasonably challenging expectations, and her lectures are often both informative and enjoyable. I sincerely recommend Dr. Russell, especially for pre-law students (to whom she offers excellent law admissions advice).",1
lesley is such a cool teacher that is very helpful and encouraging to students.  Her and Brian are great photo instructors.,1
"he is one of the best teachers at Iona! def take him- both tests are open book and you have to hand in one excel project- overall great guy, work load is 5-6 but not hard at all",1
"Not a horrible professor, but also not the best. The cons were that you needed to use the textbook because she gives unit quizzes on the textbook and if you don't take your own notes from the textbook, you won't pass these. The tests are hard and she doesn't really help in class so everything is up to you. She doesn't show she cares about you.",0
Professor Goldner is a gem and was one of the best courses that I took this semester. There were about 4-5 writing assignments but all of them were thoroughly explained and were only 2 pgs. If you needed help with anything he always had office hours. The books he assigned made you look and see the world in a different view. 10/10 would take again.,1
"Professor Carson is a really good man. He is very kind and understanding. All work is done in class, so no homework with the exception of 2 essays. Very easy A and he made the class enjoyable!",1
"She is my all time favorite professor and possibly even my favorite person ever. I had her for HIS150 and WGS210 and never missed any classes. She really gives women a place in history. Her study guides are practically every test question. If I could take 10 more of her classes, just to hear her tell stories, I would. She's cool as heck.",1
"I see that Dr. Phelps only has a 2.7 on here and I don't know why! He covers the material thoroughly, giving students a clear understanding of a subject he obviously loves. Yes, he expects you to study for tests. There are only 2, plus the final exam. The only other assignments are papers on videos we watch on various artists. He's great!!",1
"Prof. Black was incredibly helpful. He's a good presenter and focuses on the most useful things to learn for your career. He has a lot of stories from the corporate world that show the class's application. He's a tough grader, but his feedback is specific and insightful. One of the hardest classes I've taken at BYU, but also one of the best.",1
No Comments,1
"This class was fairly easy. There is ALOT of reading, a 10 question quiz for every chapter. Discussion posts (3 paragraph essay) for every unit. Midterm was quiz questions. Final was a little bit more difficult than the midterm. There was a documentary project that was pretty easy. Overall an easy A if you do the work.",1
Kim is an amazing teacher and an even better athletic trainer. I would highly recommend ANY of her classes to anyone. She is really into helping make sure a person succeeds.,1
"Taylor is an incredibly engaged and considerate prof. His expectations are clear, reasonable, and he will offer great help if you seek it. Lectures are entertaining, and insightful. He also attempts to get to know a little about his students to better teach them. Reasonable marker, and gives good feedback. One of the best profs I've been taught by.",1
"He is one of my favorite teachers. Prepare to laugh while learning because he is a very funny teacher. He's very helpful, but makes you correct your own mistakes.",1

"This is the easiest online class! There is just reading followed by a quiz each chapter, which is about the content on the chapter and is very easy. Would definitely recommend!",1
This class is a step up from the PEX 189 which I liked about it. Unfortunately there was a small group which made this class a challenge. I offered to help with the steps and formatting which I loved and made me feel a real dance connection with this course. I would highly recommend her and her courses because she is a great break from a hard day.,1
"She is very willing to help you in any way she can, go talk to her and she will work with you. this class requires a lot of out of class time to work on pre lab write up, finish your post lab, study for the weekly quiz on mondays, and for the exams that cover 3-4 chapters worth of information. its quite the workload, but she is a great teacher",1
"Pretty tough grader.  Has this stupid policy where you can use your laptop during class, but not your phone, as a matter of fact, she doesn't even let you have your phone on you. She spends like 45-60 minutes at the beginning of class literally reading off of the PPTs that she didn't even make. Also, always unprepared (no waste beakers, etc.)",1
"Such a great professor! So sweet and adorable. She loves political science and gets so excited speaking about the topics covered in class. She prints out readings for you so no textbook, yay. Oral midterm, final essay, but beware of pop quizzes. Take her if you can!!",1
Take this teacher! His tests are short and easy if you pay attention in class. The group presentation is not as bad as other marketing classes.,1
Goodyear made the topic extremely interesting.  I would take a class with him again.,1
Pretty easy professor and class.  Weekly quiz based off the powerpoint/pdf readings.  Of course weekly DB's that were easy and 2 projects.  She doesn't communicate very much and grading was very slow.  I had a D in the class the last day because so much work wasn't graded yet.  Ended up with a 95.,1
Midterm is the biggest pain ever.  Don't take this class.,0
Best teacher at ACC.,1
Probably one of my favorite professors and courses so far while at UMD. Professor Waxler wants everyone that takes his class to actually learn something meaningful about themselves. There's 8-10 short books and 1-2 (easy) quizzes on every book. Occasional short papers. He only allows 3 absences. I would take another class with him in a heartbeat.,1
"Sometimes it's hard to understand what he's saying, but he usually speaks directly from the slideshow (which come directly from the book). He puts the slideshows on Blackboard so the students have access to them. However, that does NOT mean you can skip class. If you do, you'll get lost.",1
"Do not take this class if you want to learn something. Ms. Bouchard is interesting to look at, but she is not good at teaching. She is unorganized, does not follow the syllabus, makes up assignments as she goes along and does not grade anything until the end of the term. Her lectures are about the definitions and no real legal research happening. ",0
"Fun to listen to, he clearly loves what he does. Somewhat disorganized, but he doesn't mind being reminded of things he planned to do.",1
"Dr. Lyall is a very good professor to take For intro to counseling. For the class you will read a self-help book and do a summary for each chapter (about 15 chapters throughout the semester). His lectures are funny, interesting and informative and you will learn the basics of a being a counselor in his class.  He's an easy grade and gives easy test",1
"Definitely willing to help you if you have problems.  The class is probably one of the hardest at Allegheny as far as 200 level classes go.  He also offers review sessions along with individual office hours so.  If you are doing poorly and want to improve, he is lenient and tries to get you back on your feet.",1
"It's better not to miss her classes, she gives a lot of bonus questions in class. She is very attentive to answer questions and help if you don't understand something.",1
"She is a great professor. Review the power point she creates in canvas and even though her quizzes in canvas are not part of your grade they are a great tool to study with. Attendance to labs are a must , 10 points for each lab which will boost your grade nicely . She also has great test reviews on canvas to study from. Easy to talk to.",1

"I loved this professor!  Her lectures were well organized, the class was in-depth without being too complicated, and she used entertaining stories and analogies to relay the material.   Show up to class, do the homework, study for the exams, and it's an easy class to pass.  Plus, it was a lot of fun!  Highly recommend.",1
Dr. Beckman is by far the most engaged professor that I have ever studied under in regards to passion for the curriculum and also the students he teaches.,1
"He is a really smart professor. His lectures tend to get boring, since they get really theoretical, but he solves difficult problems in class to make sure students are well prepared for the tests. It's quite difficult to understand him sometimes.",1
"Mrs. Wang is the best math professor ever, no kidding/exaggeration. Her lectures are perfectly concise and she will do ANYTHING to help you master the material. She set up study halls on Saturdays for students who wanted to come in for more help (everyone benefiting from everyone else's questions). Correct ur mistakes on tests for half credit.",1
"A wonderful teacher and person. You NEED to take her for 115. She is so helpful, don't be afraid to ask her for clarification. She is so sincere and wants her students to succeed. Wonderful!",1
"Still uses moodle when we as students pay for D2L. Talks about himself like he is the the ""best."" The lectures are all over the place. He starts talking about one topic bounces around to another topic. Be prepared to be confused with his teaching methods very unorthodox.",0
As long as you participate the class is easy. You need the textbook to answer packets but if you can find one for cheap you're set. All grades are papers and if you email them to her ahead of time she'll give you feedback so you get an A.,1
"Sunny is like 2/3 brilliant and 1/3 bonkers. Amazing teacher. She's a hard grader but she'll give you a ton of chances to fix your mistakes. She's very sweet and caring but if you skip her class, she's got no sympathy for you.",1
This professor's lectures are very relevant and dead on what the industry expects,1
An immense waste of time!,0
"As my first time back in college in a little over 10 years, I was a little concerned about taking a psych class.  Especially online.  Although her emails to me seemed short, the syllabus along with other hand-outs were self explanatory.  If you do online, fill out the review material that's given and you should be golden.  ",1
"Miriam Lowi is a brilliant woman. She is very knowledgeable in her field of study and is widely respected. Be warned tho, she assigns extremely rigorous reading material, and will not have mercy on you in class if you fail to read or participate. She wants her students to be involved.",1
"Marty is a really fun teacher. Although class isn't mandatory, or even really neccesary to attend, her lecture is fun enough to motivate me to go. She goes over the past few days material covered in econ, and then talks about current events. Overall great teacher, lots of fun!",1
"This class is HARD! As others have previously mentioned, this class can break you if you do not take time to care for your mental health but do not blame professor Chooljian. She's also caring, I was going through a really tough time at home and when I spoke to her she was very understanding and let me take an exam a week later than everyone else.",1
Professor Lang is a great  professor. He is funny and very entertaining but also knows his stuff. His stories and jokes make the class super interesting. Tests are easy and there is just no way you can fail this class. He gives opportunities for extra credit and is very flexible with assignments. Definitely recommend him!!!,1
"Easily my favorite professor at DP.  Always had a sense of humor about class, yet took it seriously.  Not a pushover, however.  Very intelligent, and he expects you to get it or ask him to explain.  Willing to help if you ask, but won't go easy if you don't.  Drank coffee out of a skull mug.",1
"Mary is a kind and passionate professor, although she has basically no syllabus and her guidelines can be confusing/misleading. She's not very good at using moodle but I really enjoyed her class . BEWARE: if you want to gain a good foundation in geologic concepts, you should take the regular intro geo class, not environmental geo.",1
"Not going to give you an ""A"", but you can earn it. Wont hold your hand, as long as you show up to class on time and do the easy (sometimes long) homework you will be more than good.  2 exams given (first half of semester) & buying and selling activities (in the second half). I would take professor again. Quite a bit of Extra Credit available.",1
"If you don't follow instructions, you will be hurt.  Follows the APA style closely.  Grammar counts.  Lots of constructive feed back on papers.  Very involved in discussion questions.",1
She doesn't try to work with you. She has extremely high expectations of her students. I almost feel like she's setting us up for failure. Teaches pretty quickly and hates when you have a question. She also hates repeating herself. I highly suggest you not take her class.,0
She's an overall great teacher.,1
"Prof. Haidey has an excellent teaching style. However, I wish that he had gone through the suggested problems list for FNCE 3227 BEFORE the Fall 2016 semester even started because the list has problems that test concepts he does not even want students to worry about.",1
"Not terrible but not good either. The one good thing is that he curves your final grade at the end of the semester. His exams are brutal, but they're mostly based on the homework, not the slides. Very nice person, but too laid back... except for his exams. Lectures are pointless. He just reads from the slides.",0
"Deb is great. She really knows how to pick material that connects to what she is trying to communicate. The class is very much discussion style with a lot of participation necessary so do the readings. She is not always super clear on what she wants for assignments, but it never worked against me.",1
"I've been wanting to take one of Hersha's courses for a while now; I've always heard very good things. Currently, I'm 100% online, but I can't wait to take another course with her when I'm back on-campus next year. She's very thorough, and the module content is organized well. She is very knowledgable.",1
"Tends to use internet videos as a tool to teach students and requires students to participate in saying what they learned from the video. If not, a pop quiz is promptly given. Lectures given are over  PowerPoints that are recited word for word.  Doesn't express much enthusiasm in the field of psychology.",0
"7 assessments (1 being the discussion post which are not weekly), 2 of them are group check in points, 2 of them are group project presentation / evaluation form, 2 research papers. posted in the beginning of the semester can knock them out before the due date. group project of utilizing sustainable facility's. no test !",1
"Professor Luallen is one of, if not the best economics professors at Tufts. He is able to teach the material in an easy to understand way. And if you have questions he is able to actually clarify the topic, instead of rambling off on a side note. His tests are hard, but doable. Just study and you'll be fine.",1
BEST PROFESSOR AT HOSTOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE.,1
It was an easy one credit class show up on time. Ask question participate if you can. She is VERY nice and tells stories that will make you laugh and think.Hand in the finial paper and you will get an A like I did.,1
"Absent and worthless if you have an issue. I had an issue with getting locked out of a test using the lockdown software she required and she refused to do anything about it, making passing very difficult for me. So lazy that she didnt even bother to post announcements weekly either. Do not recommend her.",0
"Great professor.This class was very lengthy and kinda boring, but he is very enthusiastic about acct.He goes above and beyond to help you pass even if you havent done anything.He is very funny and like one of the guys.",1
Prof. Shine is really a sweetheart! He really cares about his students and how they are doing rather than just pushing work on you. His work expectations were clear and grading is fair. The only downside of his class was that his voice is so soothing it is easy to doze off while he is reading.,1
Prof. Keeling is an amazing professor! she is a gem! recommend going to her office if you have questions about something or if you need help with something. would take her again.,1
Kaur is a very interesting professor.  She knows her stuff.  She is very friendly and always wants you to participate in class.  I think a lot of her final grade went into class participation.  Lots of reading.  Not a lot of writing.  Lots of talking and in-class discussion.  Don't miss class!,1
I was told by Mike that I should consider changing my major and he was insanely harsh in his grading. He never encouraged me or worked with me and everything I did was wrong. Ive had 3000+ level classes that were easier.,0
"His online course is very tedious. Each week there's a quiz, a lesson, and a discussion assignment due. You cannot work on them in advance nor can you work on them after the deadline. You have to stay on top of your assignments to pass. No extra credit given. You need the book to pass",1
"This guy's class ia a joke!  I would not call him a teacher, but rather a mere facilitator.  There is no input from him or any of the other professors that ""teach"" this class.  The class is pretty much run on auto-pilot with virtually no involvement from the ""professors"".  Useless busy work - This is from someone that got an A!",0
Do not take IE 332 with Wachs. Period. He's better in IE 474,0
"One of my favorite English teachers, always early to class, always helpful and always makes time before or after class for help",1
"I have Dr. Palmer for S&P, and I really like him. His tests are all based off what's in the book, and he doesn't spend class time teaching the material. He mostly just goes over some experiments and talks about why they happen. Tests are difficult and about what's in the book. Read that and you should be fine.",1
This instructor definitely wants his students to pass. Lectures are quick and easy to follow - usually got let out early. Extra credit is offered through weekly lab hours. Allowed to use in-class notes on exams. Homework is collected randomly. Semester is clearly outlined in the syllabus. Easy instructor!,1
This teacher is awesome! I learned so much from this class and I actually retained a lot of the information.  He gives great examples to help you understand the terminology and procedures better.,1
"Prof Z is probably one of the best professors I have ever had. Her class is tough and requires a lot of time to get the info into your head, but she is aware of this and tells you that at the beginning of the course. She is very flexible and will move a test date if she thinks we need more time. I respect her very much & enjoy her nursing stories!",1

"I cannot recommend Lisa enough! Not only does she know the material she is teaching incredibly well, she genuinely cares about her students-which you don't see often with college professors. If I could take this class again I would do it in a heartbeat. She cares about giving us the materials to be the best advocates/teachers, take her class!",1
"Dr. Vutha is not only able to make a very difficult subject like calculus digestible, he will take his time to make sure every student understands what he is demonstrating. I took this course during COVID and every week, multiple times a week, Dr. Vutha would run a study session for any student to attend. He is very king and genuine.",1
"What a great professor. He is patient, clear and understands what the students need to be successful in math. Meeting such a great teacher was an unexpected surprise this summer, because my original class was cancelled. I would love to have him as my teacher for statistics AND pre-calculus ! He's a keeper, but be warned, you still need to study!",1
Easiest A I've ever gotten in CS. If only every math class was like this. Feelsbadman. Protip: Practice exams are very similar to the actual ones.,1
"The best teacher I have ever had, he makes learning fun and easy!",1
"Tough course, but you have a variety of people more than willing to help. She moves through her lectures fast, but she offers outlines of everything she goes over. If you are taking this course you must have taken 67 A so be prepared to incorporate what you learned from A into B. Go to her office hours, tutors and don't be afraid to ask questions.",1
The only thing that i did not like about the class is that the test are long for the limited time that you have!,1
I took accounting 1 and 2 in high school and was so confused with no understanding of it whatsoever. Professor Richards had such an organized layout of the class and assigned homework that was actually applicable and beneficial rather than just regurgitated assignments. I look forward to taking more classes from him again.,1
"He is a nice professor overall, but he is not a great teacher. He is hard to understand and his tests are very difficult. I believe that the average grade for tests was a D.",0
"She's an alright teacher, not great not awful. Be prepared for lots of reading as the semester goes on and you have to read chapter books. She never posted any grades online the entire semester which was annoying because you can't tell how well you're doing and if you need to do something differently.",1
Professor Wellborn is a great person and Professor but tends to care about details when taking tests. Any sort of detail that is not put in will be taken off. Maybe its me who just isnt into history or I found this professor tough.,1
Excellent teacher who wants you to succeed! However currently she is under review from her department. I noticed that she seemed more stressed as the semester went on and her tests increased in difficulty. Started out getting A's then  I believe the class final exam average was 73%. It was sad to see her change her teaching ways due to politics...,1
"I had Garyen half in person and half online for my semester. In person, he's really informative and teaches the material very well. His online class is a bit frustrating because his quizzes are really hard, but his exams were manageable. If you have the chance take him in person, otherwise take a different prof for online because he'll be difficult",1
"This could be the worst professor on campus. She has no leniency so anything late is a 0. She makes you read out of a pointless textbook on a weekly basis, and then asks questions on quizzes that do not relate. This teacher is terrible and I highly recommend that you do no take this teacher, every other public speaking teacher is better than her",0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
"Very straightforward, tells you exactly what she wants. The exams are tough but she if you show signs of improvement one bad grade won't kill you. I also agree her accent is very cute.",1
She is an easy professor with a thick accent. Runs through the powerpoints quickly and her test are timed online. Strict on attendance. Had to drop this professor because she would not let me miss class for a family matter. Was very rude to me and hard to contact her through email.,0
"Dr. Terrenato obviously knows Roman Archeology very well, as he's done excavations.  He's really interesting and funny, you won't fall asleep in lecture but you have to go (!!).  Material was straight from lecture.  The coursepack reading helped clarify things if you're not familiar with the material.  Overall this was a GREAT course!  He's good.",1
"You have three books and lectures to read each week, averaging at about 140 pages per. Then you have a 30 question quiz, often with paragraph long questions. Then you have pages long ""discussion"" board topics to write weekly and bi-weekly journals. All the while you need be working on your 40-50 pages term paper. This class is busy work.",0
"Test questions very broad but she marked looking for specifics. Wasted a lot of time, went into overtime or had to finish because people would leave. Lecture was disorganized and she never summarized. She got distracted easily then lost track of the lecture. Did not seem to want to give a lot of time to helping students when it was needed.",0
"Cooney is a really nice professor, the subject is just hard. Make sure you read the textbook and do the study quizzes in them because they help with exams. The homework helps with exams too. I was only able to get a B because of the curve lol. I also recommend going to office hours for help because he's really helpful.",1
She's awesome. Truly inspirational and well rounded.,1
Love her!!! She enjoys what she is teaching. Tries to make the class more interesting by adding little activities. She is great!,1
"This was the hardest class I have ever taken! But taking it with Professor Crumpler made it slightly easier. His teaching isn't the best (needs to give more examples). That forced me to look for outside resources. It was insanely crazy, watching tons of youtube videos to teach myself. It was a good learning experience though. Workshop required/wk.",1
"While most will find him difficult and most will not enjoy his class, Prof. Turkovic actually teaches you history and tries to get you to think and formulate ideas based on the events he lectures about. Not an easy A. Discussions are very open and opinions on events and people spoken of in his class are welcome. Free response tests.",1
Profe Ana is the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. 10/10 recommend her class. Very dedicated to helping her students learn and loves to see them do well!,1
"Detective Fiction class. Be sure to not only read all of the books, but to also take fairly thorough notes. While the quizzes don't ask for extremely specific detail, some questions may be details that are kinda important but you're expected to remember anyway. NO SKIM READING, I.E. READING WILL TAKE UP TON OF TIME.",1
He may be fun but the lecture halls are too big for him to actually care about you and your struggles in his class,0
"This is the worst teacher I have ever had. He does not provide handouts, he is full of himself and if you ask questions he tells you to read the book. He is lazy in his teaching and does not care about his students, only about his new house in EDH. Needs to teach to be a teacher not a money collecting job holder.",0
"Dr. Britton is fantastic! She is very helpful and wants to hear what you have to say. Prepare to read, cause the chapters are long and are well covered in the tests, specially the case studies. You have to work hard for it, but you're not alone, the GTA's are awesome and she is too. Totally recommend! ",1
"His lectures and notes aren't clear on what you are learning and what it applies to. Wasn't good at explaining things. However, go to the super tutorials and you will pass this course. You just might not learn anything.",0
I took this class on webct and the questions were challenging but in the end he really helped me out. He answers emails ans returns phone calls not a bad professor.,1
loved his class. Fair grader as long as you follow his instructions and put in the effort you will do well.,1
"Dr. Strange is a cool guy with many years of knowledge in this area of study. You need to study hard and take good notes to get a good grade, but the class isn't too bad. Show up to class everyday and you'll earn a TON of extra credit that balances out the rough tests. Get to know Dr. Strange, you won't regret it.",1
this teacher is okay. After the first test i realized showing up for her lectures was the dumbest thing i was doing. The test are 100 % based on you knowing the terms and identifying them in scenarios. What she talks about in class is so off topic and her slides are generic with no definitions or key notes. They will not help.,0
She's a very sweet professor who wants her students to succeed so she helps with extra credit and also explains material more than one time if requested to do so by her students.,1
Great teacher! Very kind and hilarious. My final paper was written about the work environment of the tv show Parks and Rec. Definitely recommend her!,1
"He is a very caring professor, but the course is difficult.",1
This class was fun. Fun labs and kahoots for lecture. She was my clinical instructor as well. Shes great at explaining things and 1 on 1 conversation. Ask her about Terri time. Study the book and ati as much as you can.,1
"I love Abdo! She explains grammar very well and helps you understand the material. Homework is for a completion grade, one partner projects, extra credit opportunity, and short/ easy quizzes. She's a real gem and is funny. Let's students teach the class at times and has class discussions instead of just lecturing. ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT UTSA",1
"best teacher, explains everything,helps if you ask him",1
wonderful teacher although hard to understand sometime.  He is always helpful and very patient with students,1
"Professor Martinez is really my kind of professor in that she's very passionate about the subject of Black History. I found the class to be very challenging in an intellectual but more surprisingly, an emotional way. She doesn't hold back on her lectures in presenting one of the most comprehensive classes you can take on ethnic studies.",1
"People learn in different ways and speeds, so Cote will be great for some students, but others not so much. She will not spoonfeed you nor will she dumb down the material for you. You are expected to keep up and understand her, despite how fast she may go. If you can grasp chem concepts fast & well, then shes good for you. Otherwise, AVOID.",0
"This class is not easy, but I learned a lot. You have to read the chapters and understand concepts to be able to do test 2 with 35 questions. I took the 8-week class HRPO2303. I found the book for free online after buying and make sure you convert the book to Adobe Acrobat to find the answers for the test quickly because there is a 2 hours limit.",1
"I have not taken this class, but I have looked over what she has taught from friends. I am a local administrator for many large businesses in fort myers and from what I have seen she knows nothing about networking or teaching it.",0
Dr. Butowsky is one the best professors I have ever taken at Mason. He is passionate about the history of world war 2 and a great teacher. It was a pleasure coming to his class every week.,1
mustari takes the time to explain each problem and answer each question clearly. he is open to suggestions for making the class more fun. the book on used only by the student for practice if need be,1
It was online so I did not expect any communication. All the information I needed was found on the syllabus. She gave a reasonable amount of work (the more assignments the better your grade will be!!) Homework and quizzes are easy. Just make sure you keep up with the deadlines.,1
"This guy is the worst. Plays favorites like crazy. God forbid you have your phone out in class or else he will take it. He runs his classroom as if it were a high school class, for an upper level business class with mostly seniors in it, it is quite ridiculous. He loves making people feel uncomfortable, has a serious superiority complex. Avoid! ",0
"Very unclear on expectations and takes forever to grade things. By the time she tells you that you did something incorrectly, you've already turned 2 other assignments in. Acts in person like she is laid back and an easy going instructor but she's not. She's very picky and will pick you apart.",0
"I loved this class!!! It was amazing. The quizzes were sort of hard depending on how well I read and the tests were standard, just do the reading. His lectures helped me understand what I read. Hes very kind, helped me when I couldnt take a quiz on time. Sincerely cares about ones grade. Open minded. Beware anyone who is too lazy to read.",1
"This is hands down the worst professor I have ever taken a class with. Please heed my advice and don't listen to the other reviews and get fooled like I did. Maybe at one time Jeff was a good teacher, but now, I wouldn't even call him a teacher because he does. not. teach. He drones on about irrelevant things & tells people their OPINIONS are wrong",0
Sanda has been one of my least favorite professors in the VCD program. Her talk on the first day of classes dismisses any chance of thinking you can get a good grade with her. Her critiques are demotivating and not very helpful. Her project guidelines are vague and usually she is displeased with what students bring in. Poor communicator.,0
Professor Khan is a great teacher. She gives writing assignments that are not difficult to do and many of them are interesting. Tons of group work and opportunities for extra credit. She is caring and understanding and brings goodies (snacks) to class. Do well and keep up with assignments and you'll get an easy A. I would definitely take her again.,1
Catherine is truly amazing! She picked some great texts (but be prepared for a decent amount of reading sometimes). Your grade is based on 3 papers and participation- it's a pretty easy gen-ed but there can be a lot to read occasionally. Her accent is a huge plus and she's super sweet and understanding! Take this class!,1
"I loved Mrs. Coyle's class! Computer information is not my thing, but she helped me learn more through her lectures on basic computer knowledge. Her lectures are amusing and her tests are not too difficult. I would highly reccomend her for CIS credit! ",1
"Best history teacher i have ever had. All tests are based on his lectures in class. The man is hilarious and the lectures are never boring, uses funny ""documentaries"" to teach as well. There are 3 books required to read which come with 3 discussions and quizzes. Then a midterm and final both have a MC section and Essay. Never a boring day in class.",1
"Professor crane is just a great human being, her classes are not boring, she uses only half of the time, she keeps it interesting, 4 easy papers and 2 super easy exams. An A is almost guaranteed. The most interesting part is that she has guest speakers for each class to talk about the subject we are studying. Really great definitely take her class!",1
"Professor Partovi is a really intelligent teacher. He assigns readings for each week but you don't have to read all the time. As long as you know what he is talking about, you will be fine. Participation matters for class. If you try your best to answer a question he won't criticize. There are a total of 3 take home tests and the final is a paper.",1
"Sooooo good, best prof. in ASU!!! she will give u all of things what u need in blackboard. Just 3 project for all semester and give u chance if u did not do it will.",1
"She is ready to help you succeed if you go to her for help. Always accessible through email or office hours. There are 4 papers, 2 quizzes, participation and 2 exams that make up grade. Gives out exam questions 2 weeks before the exam date, then will go over them as a review session. If you show you're working hard, she gives a good grade.",1
Easily the best professor I've had. Made the content seem simple. Good guy in general.,1
"Dr. Simerka is fabulous. Her class certainly requires a bit of reading. However, 53H is an honors level course so this should come as no real surprise. She is super passionate about the class and genuinely cares about her students.",1
"Too many and too long quizzes. Really Hard exams. Bad Lecture notes. Bad TA grading. Too many quizzes, too hard exams and bad essay grading. Bad TA. Tough class.",1
Awesome! !! ,1
"The teacher is very knowledgeable about the subject. She has a passion for writing and for teaching writing. She always makes office hours available. She gives a lot of work, but you learn a lot.",1
"she is a lovely professor! Gives great feedback and is willing to help you! She gives informative and concrete examples in her lectures. Its a manageable online class, she provides transcripts+audio for the lectures which was so helpful! Overall great class I learned a lot!She teaches super well!",1
"Because classes moved online the math dep. was very strict about time limits for quizzes and tests which heavily affected my grade. That being said, Dr. Vutha was amazing and did everything he could to make this semester easier. The notes he makes for his lectures are absolutely incredible and he is very funny. He replies fast and willingto help.",1
"Definitely recommend Luallen for Ec 11, man is a stud. Harder than other sections but definitely worth it and the workload is not bad, just study a lot for tests.",1
"I highly suggest for everyone who wants to take Int. Algebra I & II to other professors unless if your schedule is fixed. No mymathlab needed. Though he has a sense of humor and shares his personal stories as he lectures us, I don't like his real attitude when he did me a favor, like erasing a whiteboard. I don't deserve to be treated that way.",0
"Very laid-back professor with so much knowledge to offer to the class. His level of experience is impressing and helps keep the class interesting. Take him, he's very generous with extra credit and his tests and quizzes are easy! PLEASE teach Research Methods and Senior Sem!!",1
"If you like reading, take this class. If you don't, don't take this class. Generally read about 20 pages for each class period but sometimes it was up to around 80 which seams a bit excessive for a 100 level course. The readings vary greatly - we try to cover every subject from every area on the globe from every time period which can be interesting",1
He's very good with feedback and will take the time to explain himself and his expectations. I would recommend him to anyone. Really enjoyed this class.,1
"SOOOOO funny and smart, interesting assignments, absolutely love this class :)",1
Worthless.,0
"Be prepared for weekly tests. They shouldn't be hard if you study and come to lectures on time. Overall, great teacher.",1
She is really cool and easy going and she makes the class room interactive so you feel comfortable giving speeches. Attendance is mandatory but the class is not boring so its not bad. Also you have to study bc the quizzes and tests are pretty hard so dont go into publi speaking thinking it a blow off class.,1
"Super easy, super fun. Take this class. ",1
THEE ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER ALIVE. NEVER TAKE HIM. WAY TOO QUICK. DID NOT LEARN ONE SINGLE THING FROM HIM.,0
"Best lecturer I've seen at U of T; he's clear, funny, and makes Shakespeare interesting. However, he was very quick to anger (don't talktextbrowse the Webfall asleep)--HE WILL CALL YOU OUT. I found his marking tough and his expectations unclear. Extremely arrogant and self-centred.  He expects you to read 14 plays: 4 in 1st term, 10 in 2nd term.",0
"I took during the COVID pandemic & hadn't taken math in 8 years. Breaks down the basic concepts and makes it very comprehensive and interesting. Participating does matter. Gotta put in the effort, which counted in the end. Very responsive & explains the path to the correct answers, which is very helpful. He was recommended by friends. Na regerts",1
"Very nice and clear in class, approachable out of class as well",1
Excellent,1
he grades hard but is a really nice guy.  worth the work.,1
"Pretty Hard. Lectures aren't that helpful, but they're not useless either. Homeworks will take at least 1-2 hours. Tests are really hard and not enough time was given. Not many things are graded, so it's hard to end with a good grade. I messed up on the first few hws, which led me to fail the class. I wish there were another prof to retake it with.",0
"You can work ahead, which is good. Each chapter has a quiz, a related sim, a MS Office project and Office sim, due weekly. You can take the all of them unlimited times, so there is no reason not to get full marks. The final is 100 multiple choice that is fairly simple if you did all the previous work. Do the work, get an A. Simple as that.",1
"This was the easiest class I have taken at UNT but I took it in the summer and missed the most important assignment of the semester. I am retaking it and this time around I am actually doing the work. It is super easy and you learn a lot about yourself. Buy the workbook, do the discussion boards, and workbook pages and you will get an A.",1
"Professor Grange was AMAZING. Hardest class I've ever taken, but definitely the one I remember the most from. Tests are extremely difficult and if you want an easy A, this is not the class for you. The class seems relatively easy and straightforward, but that is not really the case. Take advantage of office hours-it will make a world of difference!",1
was such an easy class and he was very caring and graded very nicely.,1
"Even though I received a C, it was not her fault.  She is very helpful and very kind.  Good teacher.",1
"very good teacher, tough class if you don't work hard",1
Ms. Aguilar is more of a lecturer so be prepared to listen as soon as you sit down till you leave. She grades pretty difficult in English 1302. Always be there and never skip unless it is an emergency.,0
"Schaumann is one of the best professors I have come across, he is clear, helpful, and very knowledgeable. He uses a lot of real world experience in his teaching which makes the class much more fulfilling! Do not be intimidated by him! This class is worth it.",1
"Professor Delius is the best professor I have had here at Fordham. She is not an easy A BUT if you show you care and participate, she will respect you immensely and help you get the best grade you can receive. She makes urbanism so interesting and obviously cares so much about her students.",1
"She's definitely not helpful. She reads off the powerpoint slides when she teaches. However, her tests are fairly easy because she gives you the study guide which is the only thing you need to study for. Everything on the study guide is on the test. Don't take her if you're accounting major. But if you're not, take her because it's an easy A.",1
She is very helpful unlike other professors she wants you to pass.,1
"Discrimination, no science only politics! Hater of many ethnicities, including Russian people. Hater of some religious. He was disrespectful even to his wife during the class. The worse person I have ever meet. He is not a scientist because his mind is full of political propaganda!",0
"Professor Hanson is a somewhat boring teacher in terms of note taking. He does have an intellectual sense of humor that rarely reaches the students. He is helpful with all his assignments and provides as much insight as possible for you to achieve the highest grade possible. Good teacher, but tough workload.",1
"Dr Simerka is an AMAZING professor. This was my first honors class in Queens College. It definitely has a lot of reading involved, but she genuinely cares for her students. She pays attention to each students abilities and points them out often. She is very respectful and kind. I loved this class so much, if you try, she notices. BEST PROFESSOR!!",1
"Major is a good proffesor is you love english and to write. He works well one on one but is a strict grader, you must read the articles in order to write your papers. Many Papers.",1
"Run far away! Although Dr. Simerka is incredibly intelligent, she's very impersonal and her manner can seem very snobbish. This class was really not a great choice. The material is dry and class discussion can also be dry. Incredibly harsh grader, but also good because she expects you to work to your utmost potential.",0
"Although I took this class during the summer for three hours at night three days a week, she made it super fun and easy. She's based off of group work and interaction so be prepared to speak your mind in that class. She's very approachable and passionate about her career. And I can't forget the awesome snackfeasts we would have every class. ",1
"I'm horrible with statistics, but I went to class every day and tried. If you show up and at least try he'll work with you and give you a decent grade. There are a few tests, a group project, and some difficult SPSS assignments. Overall the class wasn't too bad.",1
best teacher ever!! she's fun and nice and is totally understanding about anything! im taking this class again next semester!! :D definitely recommend her!!!,1
No Comments,0
"Lacks a presence on husky ct like other professors, but compensates with his clarity and devotion to the students. He likes to have fun and is a great lecturer. No homework, not necessary to get the textbook, but can help clear up any confusion.",1
"She is boring. Students talk while she is lecturing and she can't control her class. She is a great person, just not teacher material. She is not punctual. We don't get started until like 40 minutes into the class period. I really like her as a person and she is a great social worker!",0
"Stuffy, puffy and full of himself. A joke, really.",0
"I took her summer trig class. It was kinda hard because it wasn't a regular semester class and the class required a lot of self teaching. Quiz everyday and a test every week. She took off point for stupid things even if you had the correct answer. Graded a little to harsh in my opinion, however she was always willing to help and meet with you.",1
"If you need to fulfill a requirement, take her! She was really passionate and wanted to see everyone get through the material. You have to be willing to read a lot and then do two presentations. Other than that it was a great class. Awesome teacher!!!",1
Awesome professor and awesome class.  Lot's of fun and you learn a lot from his experiences.  He tells some great stories.,1
She is an energetic teacher that jokes around which makes students motivated to participate. One of the best teachers Ive ever had and she also helped me get over my fear of public speaking.,1
She is wondefull. Always availabe for her students.,1
Beware of this professor. He assumes that all his students come from same have same educational qualification and they all have to undergo his FIRE TEST. I knew I will fail his test as he will give you 50 MCQ 0.5 marks each with 5 choices to choose from. Then short answer questions which are as difficult to understand as this professor himself,0
"Connor's lectures are extremely boring. All he does is read off of slides that he has already put on Brightspace. When teaching a heavy material subject, a little more enthusiasm and preparation on the teacher's part would be apprectiated. The use of youtube and khan academy is recommended as you will need to teach yourself. Beware: GPA killer",0
"I took this class hybrid with a zoom component, so I did not get to know the professor as much as I would have liked, but it is obvious she is a stellar instructor who deeply cares for her students. I plan to take as many classes from her as I can. She is funny & entertaining. The quizzes and DBs are instructive and comprehensive. A super teacher!",1
"Emily Bauman is an amazing professor. She genuinely cares for the knowledge of her students. She does her very best to keep people engaged. Her discussion can be interesting. As long as you don't fall behind in the readings, it's really not a terribly hard class. She is also very understanding with absences and personal issues.",1
Took her for ENG 1A as well. Grace Ebron best professor ever! .She encourages students to think critically and answers questions clearly.  As long as you do the work you will succeed.,1
"Professor Sieber is amazing. BIOLOGY is not easy because it has a lot of material to cover, but she goes over and over the material until we understand it. Also the test are part multiple choice and part short answer, and there is ton of extra credit. Don't skip class because you would be lost. The book is needed but no the access code.",1
"It's a hard class but not too hard, I actually got away with doing pretty little work for much of the course. I adore Katia's sense of humor and her sharp, quirky mind. Discussions go off track often and it gets confusing, but things always sound plausible when she clears it up. A very interesting class. I'd love to study with her again.",1
Pretty good teacher. Really helpful with any questions. Really wanted to help everyone learn and succeed. Not a big fan of the final project in Adolescence class but other than  that pretty good class.,1
Julie you're the best!!!,1
Awful professor. His lectures make no sense and he is always off topic. Do not take this class if you can help it.,0
"This was an easy class. Public speaking is hard to do in general, but he was straight forward. Show up  follow the instructions and you'll do great.",1
"Great prof who understands principles of finance can be difficult. If you show improvement from the first Mid Term to the final exam, he'll put more weight on the more important exam. Assignments were very tough and I had to use students that were majoring in finance to help. No need to buy the text book.",1
I would highly recommend taking a different professor for Spanish. She's highly unhelpful if you didn't take a Spanish class the semester prior to taking her class. ,0
BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!!! TAKE HER ,1
"Doesn't explain criteria explicitly for assignments, difficult to understand what she's looking for. hard to get extra help because she seems to think everyone should know what she knows after multiple degrees",0
"Worst class I have taken at MCC. Lots of homework, impossible lectures, no study guide (you are on your own between book info, online homework info, lecture info and info she assumes you know from previous classes. SAVE YOUR GPA AND DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She is rude to students during class. After having to deal with her I am changing my major.",0
"This was my first semester at OSU, and I'm extremely confident that this will be the best professor I will ever have. He is very caring and wants his students to succeed. He has weekend review sessions before midterms, and review sessions before quizzes. You won't be left hanging if you put in effort. He's a GREAT professor and an amazing person!",1
Not very helpful. If you want clarification on anything good luck. If he believes he covered it in class he will not help you outside of class regardless of how unclear he was. He skims through the course with a clear low interest in it. Nice enough guy and has a great amount of knowledge just not great at the teaching component.,0
"He's really funny. Tests a LOT on lectures. Takes attendance only like 3 times the semester and gives you points. He lets you know when he will be taking it ahead of time. Really hard to study for tests and does a really ODD curve. It's an okay course, unless you're looking for a GPA booster in which case... i advise otherwise.",1
"Mrs. Young is super sweet and helpful. Do homework and your grade will be good. Before each test do her practice tests, they are almost similar to the actual tests themselves. If you need help just email her or go to office hours!",1
"Really good cut and dry Professor, you need to go to class in order to pass because, his tests are based off of his lectures not the book. The book for this class was free so i would highly recommend",1
"She is a decent professor and sometimes funny, but she definitely wants you to agree with her ideas and isn't really open to other perspectives. She grades tough so make sure to do the readings. Get on her good side and do the work and you'll be fine",1
"The way he teaches can be confusing at times, but otherwise the class is fairly easy. Go to office hours to ask questions, he cares a lot about his student's success. 5 Homework is worth 15% (drops lowest), 3 Exams 60%, and Final exam 25%. Use his workbook, it has questions that will help you study.",1
"Professor Rich is very clear and concise in her lectures. Although lectures tend to be lengthy, the material she teaches is worthwhile learning and she makes lectures fun with demo's and videos. READ the textbook and pay attention to her examples as they often appear on the test! Tests can be tricky if you don't study enough.",1
"Dr. Meche is a tough grader. If you do not understand something in his class, GO ASK. I cannot stress that enough. Some times he doesn't seem like he's helping but if you go to him enough times he will realize how hard you are trying to pass. Make sure you get his title correct. Talking helps when assignments are hard.",1
"Bob is a brilliant teacher but grades somewhat hard. Because of him, my writing improved tenfold last semester. You should try and register for one of his classes",1
"Mr. Wilbrandt is by far the best teacher I've had at Auburn. I feel like he cares a lot about the way students learn in his class and is exceptional in explaining most of the information and if something isn't clear, he always happily goes into further detail at the end of class. He also holds study sessions before exams. Exceptional!",1
"Only went to lecture once and got an easy A. The T.A.s will literally review everything on the midterms and final in discussion, so you never have to study for more than two days before the exam. The tests are free response but they give you 5 prompts and you only have to answer 3 of them plus an EC question on the tests. Also discussion quizzes.",1
Great professor. Interesting. Lots of work but it is an English class. Generous grader and gives you the option to rewrite papers to get better grades. I learned a lot from his class.No textbook used which was great (no money spent.) Uses examples from current times which makes the class more interesting. Gives you 3 absences before he docks points,1
"I got an A in this course, but I don't feel like I learned anything.  The professor seemed nice on the surface.  However, he was a huge scatterbrain and his lectures often went on long rants about minor details.  Take this class if you have to, otherwise please don't.  Most of my classmates did awful in this course, he has a specific grading style.",0
"if you are looking for a professor who takes the time out to teach you and think about you, this is the one.  Awesome class.",1
A good guy and works with on attendance. Calm person and helpful with knowledge. I like that he is not on your back all the time. He actually lets you work at your own pass and no rush but you want to get that A.,1
"He's such a great person and I think his intentions are wonderful, but he is so disorganized and just doesn't teach in a way that is helpful to students. He teaches straight out of the book, so you're better off typically just teaching yourself",0
I really enjoyed the class.  You will pass if you do the work.  Professor Sprung made the subject interesting and brought real life as well as personal stories to the lectures.,1
"I took the online psych1 class. Bernadette is one of the kindest teachers i've ever had. Her feedback is great and she even adds "":-)"" to emails which I thought was cute. That being said you will do A LOT of group work in this class. You are basically at the mercy of your group members. Her exams are also really tough too. Expect to feel anxious.",1
"Polanco made this class more difficult than it should have been.  I had to spend way too much time for her class.  It was a disproportionate amount of time compared to my other classes.   We had to do group work which I did not really mind. The last project was actually kinda fun, and helped end the class with not such a sour taste in your mouth.",1
"Issues are understandable, but this professor does not take his class or himself seriously. The topics he discusses in class do not provide enough information to answer exam questions correctly. His questions feel malicious in that they are made to mislead and confuse students, while also being highly subjective. I could go on. Avoid him if you can",0
"Good teacher, funny, his course was easy. Very helpful in the essays. His test is rather hard, but his essays are easy. He takes off point for stupid stuff all the time. My English was good before I took his class. I had a little bit better teachers, but I think he is a good teacher, and I will recommend him. He gives clean answers for questions.",1
"I can't stress this enough, SHE IS GREAT. I took her las semester and I thought it was going to be super hard because I've heard so many bad things about A&P professors but she is great. It is easy, but you have to work for your grade since is a lot of material you have to learn. 1 presentation just do what the rubric says and you will be fine",1
"You must come to class to get points. She gives you too long on projects, specially in the beginning. You sit there trying to drag your work out for three hours. You sign role at the end, so you have to stay. She is kinda crazy, and sometimes blows off your ideas for her own. You only use the wheel once, it's all sculpture. Very boring and dull.",1
"Prof. Dagenais seems like she cares about the course content and is interested in students opinions. She struggles with her hearing impairment and I think some days this does have a negative impact on her, which is understandable, however her lecture style is very dry, often runs over and she faces the slides rather than the students.",0
I had her the first year she taught at St. Mary's for both O Chem and the O Chem lab. She's extremely smart and is very patient with you. She's very nice and is very willing to help you when you need it. Not easy at all (it's still OChem after all) but as long as you study hard you should do fine.,1
Outstanding intro to homeland security.  Comprehensive course material supported by a top professor who valued student input while providing outstanding feedback.  Good course but a brisk workload throughout the semester.  Professor was very flexible on due dates--he's very familiar with the real world.,1
"Each class is packed with information from the moment class starts. Professor Romani is not a bad professor, but the class in itself can become dull after doing the same exact thing every day. Same thing different notes. I would take her again for a class like health, she really does know what she's talking about.",1
"Professor Mcglynn was a great professor. She's caring and you can tell she cares about what she teaches and the education world. I NEVER used the textbook though. If you have to buy your own books, I wouldn't recommend wasting your own money.",1
"she's the bomb! she expect you to come prepared, she's clear with what she wants from you, and always willing to help. amazingly knowledge-able and talented as a teacher. also a really wonderful woman to get to know.",1
"He is very knowledgeable about film, interesting, and funny. This is my second time taking him and i would take him again if i could. I would take him and film criticism over burns and film history any day. He wants you to read the textbook but if you take good notes it's not necessary. This is a great class for electronic media majors =]",1
For a gen. ed course this was probably the hardest class I've taken at BU so far! She expects wayyyy too much out of her students when over half aren't majoring in ENVS! She doesn't give study guides you are just suppose to look over the notes and her exams are ALL SHORT ANSWER! I was happy when the class was over,0
"She is one of the sweetest professors I've had. She has an accent, so if you have a problem understanding accents you shouldn't take her class. She is very bubbly, and tries to get everyone to participate. Reading the textbook will definitely help you, but not everyone bought it.  She clearly outlines what will be on the test. Also 6 free absences!",1
"She is absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed this class very much. If you don't pass this class either you just didn't try or accounting is just not at all for you. She explains things very well and has many extra credit opportunities. DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE IN HER CLASS, she hates it and its disrespectful.",1
"She does not like to teach, every class is review. She rather give tips and then expects you to pass on your own.",0
His discussions are amazing and the papers were very reasonable.,1
Provides his students with a unique classroom environment which primarily focuses on current emerging issues within the business world. Experience and stories blend and supplement course material and are entertaining as well as helpful. Professor is more concerned with delivering  rich informative concepts than meticulous grading. ,1
"Easy class to follow, even if you don't show up for lectures religiously. Follow the powerpoint and you will be ok. Multiple choice Tests only, no papers, attendance not mandatory but strongly advised",1
Mr. Fry is a hard working and fair grading professor. He is really open and tries to assist his students in any way that he possibly can by providing Math tutors in the Math Lab and a chat box in Angel. He gives clear instructions and gives out treates randomly throughout the semester. He is a great professor and I recommend him to anyone.,1
His lecture is so boring but his tests are pretty easy. I just study at home on my own and get A+.  I would say that take his course if you want to raise your GPA.,0
"The subject matter was difficult & the class was time-consuming, but the teacher is excellent, and if you are willing to put in the time and do the work, you can get an A.",1
"I love this professor! I took her summer nutrition class and it was a breeze. The course had a normal amount of homework, nothing that takes to long to do. Just do the work and you will do great! She is very quick to respond to emails and cares a lot about her students. I would definitely take her again!",1
"He definitely makes you work for your grade.  His lectures are as I hoped, his powerpoints are only pictures which makes going back to study a little difficult.",1
"This is an easy online class. Mrs. Bartee is very helpful via email when you need her or have questions. The only bad thing, no extra credit.  At the beginning of the semester, print out your modules of 100 questions and COMPLETE them, and you will have an A on every test. Answers I couldn't find, she was helpful about letting me know the answer.",1
"Would very highly recommend. If you have the chance, TAKE HER! Her lectures/class are very structured and gives end of chapter problems that give you a huge hint on what to expect for exams. Exams are super straightforward.",1
"Takes attendance every class. Lectures tend to run upclose to the end. He's old school - no powerpoints, no use of iLearn whatsoever so you are unable to access any of the pictures or info that he shares. He speaks monotone. Seems grumpy all the time. Handwriting illegible.  I boughtused the Red CR.  Midterms: A-, B+ Overall Grade: B+",0
She is an alright professor but she does not allow students to have technology out during her lectures. I could not stand that because I was in a three hour night class. All together though the course is pretty easy and she is a fair grader. She makes her grades flat letters so I got an 81% which was a flat B for my final grade.,1
"Gives interesting lectures, is very helpful in lab, and welcomes questions. You need to know the material, both lecture and text, to get a 4.0.  Don't expect a lot of extra credit, but he is a fair grader.  Expectations are clear and he gets grades back to students quickly.  If he starts writing on the white board, take notes. ",1
"The class is called avoding sexual harassment.  I think there are way too much reading considering it is only a one credit class.  Plus there is a final exam which I think is unnecessary.  If you need a one credit class, take something easier.",0
"Don't take the class if you don't like reading. 90% of it is online readings (80-100 pages a week), and over subject that covers a lot of information with expert vocabulary in small print. ",1
"He's a good teacher. He will help you, although sometimes it seems like he doesn't really like you. Definitely don't go to class late. He hates that, and he makes sure you know. He really knows CAD, and is a great resource. I would recommend him.",1
"Pas assez interactif. Très linéaire. Il me semble très passionné et crédible, il a également un bon vocabulaire mais n'est pas capable de nous faire participer et s'intéresser a la matière. J'ai l'impression d’assister a une messe...",0
"It was a great pleasure having Dr. Hess again as an instructor. About 8 books to read for this class; interesting authors and their books amazing. The novels are intense and capture the readers' attention that one can not put the book aside. One essay about 8 pages, 2 resumes, and 1 presentation. Knowledgeable, nice and pretty. She rocks!",1
"An excellent teacher. he is very helpful, and has a great sense of humor. the only thing bad is that you you have to hand write your homework, but besides that he is great",1
"Well arounded, understanding, humorous, down to earth kinda guy, understands that**** happens so fair with late work",1
"LPN teacher. At first I liked her, as the course went on... I liked her less. By the end, I didn't want to leave. Very helpful. Never wastes yours time. Fair. Everything she teaches is important. Tests are all multiple choice. She is always there for extra lab times. Strict and stern, but a piece of cake compared to the rest of the program.",1
Stay far far away.,0
I absolutely adore Lois. This was Contemporary Political Protest in America and you could tell it is one of her favorite classes to teach. She is not that hard if you pay attention and do the work. She was inspiring! Especially since I took this class fall-11 right as Occupy was causing waves. I am looking forward to taking another class from her.,1
"She is greatest! Before I take her class I am not smart for english. Now, thanks to her hard effort I am great. She does not hit if word is spelled wrong. Does not lash for speaking bad words. i like this classing",1
"Dr. Bowman was my favorite teacher at Mizzou. I took 2 classes with her (healthcare in the U.S. and ethics, both of which I learned a lot of useful information in. She is such a nice teacher and really cares about her student's success. She is always available outside of class to help you, personally or related to class. Would highly recommend her.",1
good professor. easy class. you do have to read and participate though. if the class participates she excludes the final. I would highly recommend her.,1
"Professor Elliott is great!  She's knowledgeable about the literature and theories you read, and what she doesn't know, she'll find out!  This class was very reading intensive, but that's the nature of 498, not specific to her.  She grades tough on papers, but here, at least, we had the opportunity to rewrite.  Great prof overall. Take her!",1
"Ok so as a person, Kelli is great. As a teacher, she sucks. Meandering lectures, literally NO feedback till the last possible second, and she grades everything at the end of the semester when it's too late to change or help your grade. She's also not super reachable, often if you message her on Slack she'll ignore it till you @ her.",0
"I Love her!!! Didn't want to take bio now I am minoring in it, she is wonderful!!!",1
"Blanton is the harshest grader ever. Since he used to proof read for an insurance company for decades, he takes off point for any little thing on an essay or summary. For example, he takes off five points for leaving too much space between your name, the date and class subject on an essay. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER, BLANTON. STOP BEING SO RIDICULOUS!",0
Knowledgable and understanding.  Her class could benefit if she did not use power point and goes through the material faster.  The TA's can be very critical.,1
"I took her for my first year of college. She was honestly the best teacher I had. If you do good in her class, she can skip you into college level English. She gives you good feedback on essays and assignments. She is a very caring person and helps everyone. Overall, she didnt leave  too much hw. I definitely recommend taking her.",1
"Dr. Hartman is an amazing teacher, intellectual, and person.  He is the best professor I had in my five years of college.  Do NOT pass him up.",1
Dr. Wike is such a nice lady and she makes the class extremely interesting. I took the class a year ago and still remember most of the readings because they leave an imprint on you!! She does a very good job preparing her class especially her reading selections and her witt and inteligence are clearly shown in her classes. Take her. I love her!!!!!,1
the worst professor i've ever had. he's very knowledgable in the subject but he doesn't know how to teach it. he rambles and often tells us that things are going to be on the exams and then they aren't. he comes across as rude and is not accessible to students.,0
"Class is very interesting. Do not be intimidated because it is a writing intensive course. She is a very sweet lady that is always willing to help you with papers. She gives 4 papers: one 2-3 pg, one 3-5 pg, one 5-8 pg, and one 8+. She gave 3 EASYYYY exams, almost impossible to fail. Book is not required for this course do not waste your money.",1
"If you are in the psychology field, it is a must to learn about your professors as you expect them to learn about you. You must read and learn the flow of this class and if you are involved and listen to her lectures, she pretty much tells you what will be on every graded quiz or test. Reach out and you will be met at the other end. Effort is key",1
Awesome teacher .,1
"She was a tough one. But every time I was in her class, I felt like i learned something new and instantly applied it to everyday life. Her Mid-Term and Final was tricky! So you either KNOW IT or don't. She dressed so fab everyday. She is definitely a great teacher and DEF knows a lot about the subject she is teaching.",1
She is a great teacher! Explains everything to the fullest and doesn't give a final! She does it by progress. I was terrible in math and she got me a 90 average by the middle of the semester! I highly recommend this teacher!,1
"If you want to simply pass the course without hard work and don't care about good grades, this class is for you. It is easy to pass but getting a A is hard. The professor takes forever to respond to emails and the reply is short and rude. The power points and other materials covered in class are outdated. Horrible class.",0
"I absolutely loved having Professor Turkovic for my AMH2010 class. He is lecture heavy, but the lectures are in-depth and require you to think. He gives a clear study guide which are the verbatim questions on his exams. He is a funny and caring professor and I would recommend him to anyone, so long as they are a diligent student.",1
"Cares about what you learn, really wants you to pick your topics so it allows you to be interested and care about your work! Good professor and very reasonable!",1
Steve Kipp is an INCREDIBLE professor. Really cares about his students and their success. He relates the class to real life experiences and it's so helpful. I truly didnt want this class to end. There's about 5 tests and a huge group project at the end of the semester but it's easy! TAKE THIS CLASS,1
"Pretty typical science class, lecture and weekly tests.  He grades on the curve, so don't stress if you don't get excellent test scores, most students will still get an A.  All of the microbiology classes have interchangeable curriculum that includes an unknowns project and a group research/presentation project. He is friendly and helpful.",1
"Gets offended by people not coming to class in a lecture with over 200 people. This is college, people shouldn't be punished in lecture courses. She does these industry exercises randomly in lecture throughout the semester so it keeps kids coming cause they dont know when they'll happen. First lecture I've never been able to use my phone or laptop.",0
Unorganized and scattered during lectures. Uninteresting but the class is easy. A few short papers and easy online quizzes,0
"Dr. Gonzalez is respectable and highly intelligent in his field. His instructions for essays are clear and concise, he provides an outline of how the format of the essays should be. Attend the lectures, do thorough research for your essays, and do your MyWritingLab and you will pass with flying colors. Overall, great professor and would recommend.",1
Great Teacher! I had her for microbio and human anatomy! She is very helpful! I learned so much! The classes were really fun!,1
Best class I've every taken. Phil teaches more about how to succeed in life than anything else. He wants classes to be interesting & about learning important life skills like negotiating & lie detection. Grading is entirely quizzes that are verbatim from the board. Study the board hard & you'll pass.,1
"Took her for ""Latin Nightclub Dance"" but really it was just a rhythm ballroom dancing class more than really ""latin"". Nonetheless, I learned a couple of moves to use while out dancing, and developed better rhythm than I had prior to this class. Just don't expect too much Spanish music. Also, super easy A. Just put some effort and you'll pass easily",1
"Bridges is really one of the nicest people that you won't forget, she's hilarious, caring, and really encouraging! however, she does get off topic a lot of times, and she messes up arithmetics a lot, which makes her a tough grader b/c a simple careless mistake of yours that messes up the whole problem will get you 8 points deducted out of 9",1
"This is a GREAT class to take, especially if you're working a lot. The slideshows are posted online, and the bulk of the quiz material is there. The lectures are optional to show up to, but they're really good, so I recommend showing up if you can, even though it isn't necessary. Prof. Law is very sympathetic and accepts late work/make-up quizzes.",1
great Instructor I got the opportunity to work for a non- profit organization. He is awesome.,1
"I would take this class. It's completely changed my political beliefs. I'm not sure if it was the reading material or Professor Brownlee's lectures, but I walked in a moderate liberal and came out a leftist.",1
"She is a very kind and good teacher! She does everything she can to makes sure everyone in the class understands what is needed for an assignment.  If you come to class, do the assignments and take part in the discussion, and ask questions if you do not understand, you will be fine and you will be glad you took her.   ",1
She is a fantastic Spanish professor! She truly cares for her students and she gives you all the resources you need to be successful. Definitely take her if you want an easy Spanish course,1
Great!,1
"I really enjoyed Dr. Vanderzalm's Bio 2 lecture.  She makes lecture as interesting as possible, and really encourages students to ask questions and have discussions.  Tests are not easy, but also very fair - I studied a lot for them, and always did well.  She also has you do online at-home assignments, which can help with easy points.",1
Took chem 101 and physics 104 lab with her. TOUGH PROFESSOR!! Either way I earned an A in both classes,1
"Everything is lined out and the teacher follows according to her plan.  Reading with weekly tests and end of unit tests.  One major project that you work on with an assigned group (yes, group project) however it seems to work out well with what the project is.",1
"Great professor! Easy-A! Graded by a few things, 3 exams (open book take home online tests), discussion board on an online budget simulation. He gives everyone extra credit to replace the lowest test grade. Literally no way to fail this class unless you are a complete and total failure!",1
Cynthia is a bubbly and interesting teacher. She really cares about student success. Kind of a lot of difficult reading (with homework attached) but it's always talked about the next day if you don't understand it. You get points for attendance. Really liked her class!,1
"Mrs. Michelfelder has been one of my favorite professors. Drops lowest test grade for attendance percentage, extra credit on every test (and if you attend outside speakers), easy to follow, tests are directly from power points that are posted online, homework is completion (can always earn 100%)",1
"Professor Perkins lacks in the area of professionalism. I have never been so offended by an educator. She constantly berades her minority students and passes it off as having a "" unique and hands-on"" teaching style. There also have been several instances where I have feared for my personal safety under her leadership.",0
"Her class isn't an 'easy A'.  She gets off topic/ out of order occasionally and goes too fast for notes. At first the class was interesting but as the semester went on, I regretted not dropping this class (so much reading!). She grades insanely hard but she has good feedback that is helpful in rewriting papers or finding sources.",1
Mr. I is a great teacher. He loves his job and truly cares about the students. He makes sure each speaker is comfortable in their environment. Teaches life tools to make each student successful in everyday life. You will not be disappointed with this class.,1
She is a good professor but she does not give A's.. you have to really write a great paper in order to get an A. But overall she is very helpful and she knows her stuff.,1
Spent too much time in class trying to get other student's to participate instead of focusing on the ones who cared about being there and getting a decent grade. Most lectures were a waste of time but you couldn't miss class or you'd lose attendance points -- could cause you to fail class. Most content was in online portal and discussion posts.,0
To say I am a horrible math student is an understatement. I have struggled my whole life with math and have never had a teacher as caring as Tori Ryburn. She is extremely accessible outside of class and truly wants to help. She is very understanding and helpful. I am so fortunate to have had her this semester!,1
"Caring defines her best. The first professor I took time out of my day to leave a positive review about. Orgo Lab was really intimidating, but Sara is definitely one of the few instructors ""on the student's side."" She's very sweet, patient, and helpful. The work load is average for chem, but she's there to help at all times.",1
"Show up to class and turn something in, you get an A.  He tells you ""you will get an F if you forget to do this"" yet when you don't do it, he still gives you an A.  If you want an easy A, take all his classes and just put up with his condescending attitude but if you care about journalism, run the other way.  I changed majors because of this dept.",1
"Awesome professor-- he is very into what he teaches and he is extremely helpful in office hours. Exams are challenging, but very doable if you pay attention in class.",1
Highly recommeded.,1
"This is my second course with Professor Wilson. He inspired respect for each other, and he is a fair and compassionate educator.  He's working on his PhD thesis and he is a faculty advisor for several Leadership organization, so I think this might have been the reason for his not showing up for the final.  I would take him again.",1
"Best professor at Rider. His classes are well structured, clear and engaging. Always willing to answer questions in and out of class. His real-world experience is tied into his lesson plans and is extremely intelligent. Would take his class again If I didn't already take both.",1
"The sweetest lady you'll meet. I love her freshman experience class!! She brings in guest speakers, cares about her students, and is an overall wonderful woman. If you get the chance take her! She is an absolute blessing!",1
She is awesome! Had her this year for Trauma and Abuse and she did a fantastic job teaching! She does soo much outside of school and still manages to be on top of stuff. Hope to get her again before I graduate :),1
"This instructor is terrible at getting back to students, grading, and completely unorganized. This was the worst course I have ever had. I would not EVER take a course from this instructor.",0
"Easy A. Obnoxious amount of easy extra credit that will offset bad grades on exams. Final is NON cumulative! Yes, she is hard to understand, but her slides are very clear and exam questions are exact copy of what we did in class.",0
He's a down to earth professor and loves to get along with the students. Is willing to help and usually available. If he continues teaching biomechanics there is no reason for you to get lower than a B. Lectures may be boring. Do well on the midterm/final and your presentation/project and you should get an A. (He brought donuts on finals day!),1
Enjoyable online class. Very clear outline and grading criteria. Normal amount of reading + HW. Got super behind because of the hurricane and he was more than accommodating for all of us to turn in very late work + retake exams at no extra penalty. No time limit on test. Very understanding + easy A. Definitely recommend online if you are busy!,1
Even though the class is a little hard she does given plenty of extra credit and is very nice if you talk to her one on one. She makes the tests very easy too. ,1
"Speaks loudly and clearly, and is decent at conveying the material. However, he is unorganized, so the lab time tended to be done ad-hoc. But, this gives you tons of time to ask him questions if you're unsure of something. Also, despite assigning homework frequently, he only collected it as a large bundle twice, so you didn't get timely feedback.",1
"I really liked her, she was friendly but informative, she taught well and was knowledgeable but managed to also be relateable and kind.",1
If anything class moves too slow for me with too much explanation and I get bored and start to draw.  Dr. Meehan is an excellent teacher though.  Take her over others.  Dr. Oross is awesome for psy too!  Dr. Meehan has an easy course with the only complaint ever heard is that too much explanation goes into very basic things.  Keep it up Dr. Meehan!,1
"Not accessible outside class (and class was ONLINE!) Brings in a salesperson into lecture just so he can sell us LSAT prep material. I literally PAID to listen to an hour-long ad. Is strict on deadlines, while she herself never follows them. She gave us feedback on our papers 24 hrs before the final was due! Avoid this course. A true WASTE of money",0
"I really enjoyed taking Kildea's class! He's a super funny, down-to-earth guy and his class is easy. I would definitely recommend taking his class!",1
Don't take her class! was super excited to learn HTML but was slowly ruined by this prof. She signaled me out to always answer questions I didn't know and wouldn't take that as an answer. She's not helpful and I just learned HTML on my own time because it was easier than learning from her. This course would be good if there was a different prof...,0
"This class is taught as a practical application of counseling. Students must actually do counseling, videotape the sessions, and bring them in to class. I found the class frustrating at times, but a great learning experience. I would do it again.",1
"Her directions are unclear and almost rude. be ready to spend some serious cash on makeup. $80 for the makeup set then another $25 for the ""Lab fee "" when there is not a lab. Required book cost over $200 because it's out of print. Only uses that book cuz friend wrote it.  If you miss a day she will call you out in front of everyone. Horrible teach",0
Such a funny guy. Really enjoy attending his lectures.,1
"Very low voice, soft-spoken. Gets embarrassed when things aren't clear. Went over individual example programs in class. Let us write our own with guidelines for added practice, without grading. Not really able to clearly explain in simple terms. Fairly attractive.",0
Dr. Brown was such a good teacher.  The expectations were pretty straight-forward and assignments were easy.  He did not grade hard at all and gave people the chance to make corrections.  You should definitely take one of his classes.,1
"Marc is a very nice guy don't get me wrong, but I took him for geography and physical science. The test are mad hard and the study guides do not help. Half of the stuff on the test aren't even on the study guide.",0
He is very good instructor. I would take another class form him.,1
"Very smart, cares deeply for his students, class is interesting ",1
Saralina comes into class smiling everyday and is always so excited to dive into literature.  What a great teacher to have first thing in the morning.,1
The content is OK but the prof is helpless. never have homework or extra practice but the final is something beyond the handout,0
"This was a really helpful class, and one that I needed for my degree. I've taken Dr. Swint before and knew he was a really good teacher but I usually don't like online classes. It worked out pretty well though. Dr. Swint is now the head of the political science department but he still took the time to help out.",1
Best professor I have ever had. His legislative experience is super impressive but he is also a great teacher. Always willing to help you out if you want to learn. He ended up writing a job recommendation for me years after I took his class. Great guy. Take his class if you have the option.,1
Wonderful professor.  It is obvious that she has a passion for the material and her students.  She is now one of my advisers and she works very hard to help me out.  I value her opinion and would recommend her to anybody.,1
Great teacher,1
Does anyone happen to know if Professor Abrams is still teaching here at Hofstra??? Did he retire or move to another school?,1
"He obviously knows a lot about the subject but is just a terrible teacher. He plays a video which teaches all of the concepts and he isn't too keen on doing examples after to actually use the concepts you just learned. However, his class is easy simply because he tells you everything that will be on the tests and you can use a cheat sheet.",0
"Well, this is week one of her class... i have not spent about 16 hours over this weekend writing her chapter summarizes and have another whole chapter to go. I am a graduate of a nursing program and currently quit my job to accommodate classes for a higher degree in nursing. Yes i am taking biology again due to credits not transferring.........",0
"Professor Gilmore was very clear and his lectures were extremely easy to comprehend. Took sociological theory over the summer, and there was only one class that i was completely bored in. Definitely recommend him! Very helpful and very nice.",1
"Summer AP II is extremely rigorous. Use the Pearson site lab tools to prepare for lab practicals. Those helped me significantly to learn models/diagrams, even more so than actual lab time did. Take pictures of the microscopic slides and memorize key details. Complete the objectives in precise detail. Tests are hard",1
"Wike overall was very good, but an extremely tough grader. It is next to impossible to get perfects, or near perfect scores on anything. I am not at all interested in the healthcare field (history major). I learned a lot, but be prepared to not get a A, and to work your ass off.",1
"Kildea is a great professor. He is very relatable and is always willing to help inside and outside of the classroom. He does not always remember to take attendance, but just show up because the class is easy if you pay attention and participate occasionally. His syllabus is clear but he rarely follows it so always ask him in person about due dates.",1
Great teacher! Gives lots of extra credit!,1
"Dr. Ryner is a very nice man. His class is a good intro to closely reading Shakespeare. His readings of the plays are heavy on continental philosophy (performativity, instability of identity, leftism). If you are into that stuff, take the class- if not, you will grow very tired of words like Other and gendered bodies. Very pleasant person overall.",1
3 Exams: are extremely difficult. No notes on the exams. There is a Term paper or book review you have to do. Final exam is accumulative,0
"Fantastic prof. He is so helpful. The classes can be boring at times, but if you're confused about something, he is VERY helpful and explains concepts very well. His speech is a good tone too. His enunciation is very clear, which makes it much easier to understand him.",1
"For an intro class, he does a good job. The material is not to hard and he goes through it enough times in class, and call you out, to make sure you get it. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you go to class, it will seriously make the class an easy A. He isn't boring and isn't mean. Overall, pretty good deal. ",1
"Subject matter is interesting, but unless you are an art major I would not recomend taking this class. I studied 5 days for our second exam and still ended up getting a low grade because he thought I wasn't ""specific enough"" even though I essentially described everything about the paintings in question.  Harsh grader + harsh subject  Not good.",0
I thought that this class was going to be very easy but some of the assignments we did were difficult. All of the assignments are done online and if your answer is slightly off you wont get any credit. I also didn't think she was very helpful especially during finals. An A is for sure achievable if you put in enough effort.,0
"Dr. Dewald is a very repetitive lecturer. He will repeat the same lecture two classes in a row with certain things paraphrased differently. The lectures are a complete bore. Make sure you bring coffee. Class is very easy though. Pay attention and focus on the books, not the actual history.",1
He has an interesting character. Very friendly but double faced. Likes nice chicks too and his face gets brighter when nice girl is in the class. He has a 10 point question aka chopping machine where he violates your grades. He doesn't have idea or computer skills. Not able to communicate on D2L and has an arrogant- smart attitude. Do not take him,0
great Prof,1
"Just the worst class I've taken at Duke. It's so poorly structured. Homework is arbitrarily long, exams are unpredictable, no supporting materials or practice exams. I was depressed for most of it; I just hope I haven't failed.",0
"Randal seems shy and has a monotone voice. Thus, if you're taking his 6:50 am class, you'll find it difficult to stay awake. You'll have a reading assignment and a quiz due each week, along with a project relating to the topic. The final is a combination of the quizzes (mean 123/150). Offers XC. All in all, loved this class, fun & creative.",1
"Professor Shields is one of the main reasons I am graduating with an AA in cinema production this year!! His classes are fun & informative! He has great special guests & he even made time for me when I had a movie deal going down to give me some insights. He is a great guy! His mountain man beard can get outta control, still a brilliant producer!",1
Avoid.,0
"Mrs. Johnson is my absolute favorite professor so far! She is kind, fair and charismatic! Her tests are pretty long, but the class itself is so interesting! Amazing professor all around! I strongly recommend her to anyone, especially anyone interested in social work. ",1
"I took this class last semester, and it was terrible. I expected to actually learn. And all I did was read the entire book. This teacher literally reads off slides and expects you to know everything on the test with a little bit of help of a study guide. I wouldn't recommend him at all. Not worth your money!!",0
Awesome prof! Worth taking. The content of the lectures is very diffecult,1
he's a nice guy but he disarms you with his kindness then half way though the quarter you realize your doing way too much unnecessary work to justify for an English 101 class. Attendance is graded and you will be test on his lectures on the finals. You will turn everything on canvas & online quizzes are taken in class. he's very loud speaker,0
"Monahan is the absolute best professor I've had at any level of my education. He not only cares about you as his student, but as a person as well. He made my two years at Suffolk worth while and is a role model to myself and many others. If you are a business major and never have the ""Monahan experience"" you are doing it all wrong!",1
"Anyone that says this guy isn't great simply doesn't get humor. He is hilarious in a very intelligent way. So awesome to see the world of simply education in a way that you have always been aware of but never been able to experience for yourself. The most relaxed class, and yet I learned the most and had the best grade.",1
"She is very nice and understanding as long as you try. It is sort of like a high school class with the amount of work because sometimes it seems to just be busy work (all easy though). The only negative thing I could say is the discussion questions are tedious, but again pretty easy. Easy A as long as you do the assignments and go to class.",1
She prefers women over men. She is very moody. I bet all these good comments were made by women in her class.,0
"BEWARE !! FOR NON SPANISH SPEAKERS, AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE",1
"Sarcastic, unhelpful, favors certain students and do not give attention to the rest, rude, always late for class, does not explain and expect students to know it all, have seen almost all international students dropping from her class. She exhausts students with long papers on top of readings and a weekly quiz. Spends the first hour of the lecture",0
"He's really kind if you take the time to go to his office hours, I was going through a tough time over the semester and he really helped me out. He was very understanding.",1
"Took him for American Government, one of the best professors and classes I have ever taken. Very knowledgeable about the material, and shows a passion about the students. Any people who have a passion for learning should not look any further than Dr. Baltodano. Not a lot of homework other than easy online quizzes.",1
She is agreat and helpful profesoor.,1
"I got a D but only because I turned in a lot of work late. You had a week to turn in late work for 20% off the grade, but the ""grader"" assignments were all given 0's instead of getting 20% off. I learned a lot of useful skills and would take this teacher again.",1
"I have taken Dr. Bamford three times to date.  She is a wonderful human being, she loves cats and also she is British!  She is very compassionate and loves her job.  If you need a humanity, take her... if you need an elective take her.... She is the BEST! P.S. You will never buy a book for her class.",1
"He loves to make jokes and the stuff he covers in class is easy, but he makes the tests quite difficult. Read the chapters thoroughly and go to class. All the extra credit goes a long way. Nice guy.",1
"Allyson is my favorite teacher. She doesn't really assign much homework, and when she does she makes sure it isn't clashing with projects for other classes that you have. She is very passionate and loves what she teaches which makes me love it too. She tries to be as helpful as she can for her students. She is big on class participation. ",1
"Dr. Lim seems to get a bad rep and I'm not really sure why. In my opinion, out of all of the other choices of professors for Thermo II, I think he's the most solid choice. He's not the best lecturer but if you do the homework, the practice tests, and use office hours for help with these things, you'll be fine. Easier than Thermo I.",1
"She was great, I was having a rough term and she was very understanding and very helpful!",1
He's a really great professor! He takes attendance and says you can only have two but he really doesnt care as long as you dont miss like 10 days. Class is just a lecture about pretty interesting stuff. He asks you to read some books but you can pass without them. All you have is 4 tests and thats it. YOU NEED TO SHOW UP TO PASS. TAKE NOTES!!!,1
"The feedback she gives is fine, however sometimes can be contradictory. Seems like she wants to help but also gets frustrated easily. Does NOT give clear instructions for projects and often left cramming towards the end to get everything you need. The more work you do for the class the more she will like you, however she has very high expectations.",1
"I took an online summer course with Professor Hegbloom. She seems nice enough, but none of the work I submitted was graded until there was just a few days left in the summer semester. Considering the course is only one month long, it was frustrating to have no idea how I was doing the entire time and to receive zero feedback whatsoever.",0
"Dr. Barber is the worst at grading anything. You will not get grades back until the last week of class, so no feedback until it's too late. Every assignment's instruction is so confusing, and every assignment repeats every week. I don't think I learned anything in this class. I learned how to do busywork.",0
"John is a very caring instructor and is easy to relate to, he is one of the best at Vol State and is a must for accounting.",1
"He made me wanting to transfer to management major. He is great at teaching, easy grader, just 3 essays through the whole semester. Take him.",1
"Velleman is an excellent teacher. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which he wrote), due to its conversational style and interesting examples. He posts all his lectures online, so attendance is not mandatory. If you choose not to go, you should still watch the lecture videos - they help with the homework.",1
"Cooney is a great teacher and has really enjoyable lectures however, he treats the gen ed astronomy class like it is an upper-level science course. He says that he does this at the beginning of the class and is going to treat the semester like everyone is an astronomy major. This resulted in the class having way too much work for a gen ed class.",1
"I had Mallinson at CUI for philosophy. He is always so enthusiastic about the topics However, he gets side tracked easily. I attended every class and didn't read any of the 5 assigned texts and still got a B in the class. Tests are easy if you MEMORIZE ANSWERS TO THE REVIEW GAME!!!! make flash cards of them if you want an A",1
Dr. Liszka is really talented as a lecturer and I enjoyed all of her lectures. U need to take serious notes and she gives some serious exams but I found when I studied I did well and when I didn't study it hurt.,1
Pretty easy class. Just don't sleep or go on your phone and you'll pass. ,1
I did not like the fact that I couldn't understand her with her accent so it was very frustrating. I am good at math and I couldn't do it so I had to drop her class and get a better professor.,0
"Sometimes late and missed some classes, but very helpful and knowledgeable.",1
He is very straight forward about what is on the tests and what is expected from labs ect. If you pay attention in class and do the labs you should be fine. He's a nice guy and seems to care about his students. He will go over things a few times if you ask him and if he sees your trying will go the extra mile to help you out.,1
"Dr. Brown is an awesome teacher, I have and will continue to take any class he teaches.  He is funny and most entertaining teacher I have ever had! Just love his classes, makes you really want to attend class!",1
He's alright. He shows a lot of videos that are pointless. There's a lot of reading in the book but don't buy it all of the stories you can find online. If no one speaks up and talks about the readings from the book he'll start giving quizzes on them. He wasn't bad just not good at connecting with his students.,1
She is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She is kind and funny. I took her class in Summer and I loved it. Attendance is a must. Watch all the movies and youll get an easy A.,1
"She is wonderful! Very helpful..and wants you to learn & understand the material. Her night class is real fun! All Bio tests are hard, if you stay on top of it & do the work your suppose to, you'll be fine. She's really nice & has a great sense of humor! I highly recommend her.",1
"The workload is heavy and he's a bit of a tough grader, but the feedback he provides on both your ideas and the actual quality of your writing is far more helpful than the average English instructor. His lectures are also consistently engaging, funny, and insightful, and he's always willing to help you out, either in person or over email.",1
Professor Lhota is literally the best professor I have encountered in my entire life. I have never met a nicer person before. She's really sweet and care for the students. She gives really good feedback on the papers. There is no pressure in the class if you do the work. Take her help if you are stuck. The class is not easy but she makes it easy.,1
One of the smartest and nicest professors at QU.,1
A very straightforward online class (due to COVID). Watch the lectures he posts and do the assignments. One of the easiest classes youll take.,1
MA comes off crazy at first but she ended up being one of my favorite professors. She cares about her students. She's really entertaining too. I definitely recommend her for BUS1010 but I'm not sure how she is as an accounting teacher.,1
Not such a great experience. Dont recommend,0
I'm taking his class as we speak he a great professor... he knows his stuff sometimes the lecture are boring his midterm are hard and so his is paper.. but he gives you all the material for the paper !! would i take him again maybe not !!,1
My first class with Dr. Major and he has been excellent.  Enthusiastic and excited to teach.  Hard grader but loves discussing the material he assigns.  Definitely worth taking a class of his.,1
"Amazing professor! Loved the lectures and discussions we would have in class. He is  not your basic professor that puts you to sleep when he speaks. You will be very engaged and want to be involved in the discussion. Grading is straight forward, do your work, and study! Make sure to do all assignments before the exam, they will be on there!",1
"17 questions essays to read and 30 words from glossary to know for each exam, and he takes only 3 questions essays and 5 from the glossary. Very hard!",0
Test are long and difficult. He'll provide the information but it's a lot of it and he crams it all in instead of spacing it out.,0
"Mrs. Padgett,is a wonderful professor, this is the second class I've taken with her, my first being online in high school. She is a tough grader, but you can always make it up. She is available for extra help at the high school she teaches at and she is willing to help those who do the work. So friendly, and super sweet, I just love her!!",1
"This is genuinely the worst instructor I have ever had. He is rude, condescending and extremely harsh in his grading. He does not respond to emails and is rarely present during office hours. Class consists of 15 minutes of verbal roll call followed by 20 minutes of a verbatim reading of the already posted notes. Tests are nothing like the homework.",0
"obviously intelligent, possibly hides behind an incredible sense of humor, witty, has a keen eye for detail, respectful even when using derogatory statements, so applause for that.",1
"Professor- mostly serious, dull The class- only guest speakers, boring and long, annoying, heavy group work. On top of this class being pointless, he was not a good professor. Constantly talked about himself and about how he made it through college and complained about his paycheck like theres no tomorrow. Super Easy hw Pointless class but easy A.",0
Very hands on and knowledgeable instructor. Has respect for the work he does and dispenses material in the most understandable manner. He knows the material and has many ways to facilitate understanding. Teaches what should be taught and uses all class time for class work. Approachable and willing to give study tips and info on how to study,1
He's a great prof. Explains everything well and cares about his students. Straightforward class.,1
"This class very much based on participation. Not necessarily in class, but on your group projects. There are a good amount of assignments, but they aren't too difficult. Just make sure you get them turned in on time and you will do just fine.",1
Great teacher. Helped throughout the course. Had extreme anxiety about speaking in public going into the course. She made it much more relaxed and the course layout couldn't have been any better.,1
"I LOVED LOVED LOVED DR LYALL! THIS CLASS IS GREAT, HE'S AN AMAZING PROFESSOR, VERY RESPECTABLE, VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD, AND HE MADE THE CLASS INTERESTING, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR. THERE'S NO TEXTBOOK, BUT THERE IS A REQD BOOK TO READ, AND I LOVED THE BOOK, IT REALLY GIVES YOUR GREAT INSIGHT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY APPLY IT TO YOURSELF, IT TAUGHT ME GREAT TECHNIQUES. HIS TEST ARE EASY, IF YOU STUDY AND TAKE GOOD NOTES, YOU WILL BE FINE.. WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE HIM AGAIN, OVER AND OVER. I WISH HE TAUGHT OTHER CLASSES... THUMBS UP DR LYALL ",1
"I love this professor. He is helpful and neat with everything. He even decided to make the quizzes a group. When you do the clicker, it is just to show that you are present in class.",1
I took Professor McGregor hybrid  course for Chemistry 101 and 102. I got an A in 102 and  B in 101. Since this is a online course you basically have to teach yourself the material however if you have questions the professor answers them and show many examples. The labs and review sessions are on campus. You can skip one on campus lab. Great Prof.,1
"If you work hard for this class then you will be rewarded by a good grade. He's very lenient with the grading of the students. However, if he sees you trying hard then you will pass with either an B, C or A.",1
"Great Professor! He was really easy to connect to and very animated during lectures. When writing papers, he will give great feedback on how you can improve. Most of the due dates are set at the beginning of the semester, so stick to the schedule, show up to class and participate. Would definitely recommend him to anyone and everyone.",1
This class is very difficult. 30 seconds to answer a question on lab exams so its basically you know it or you don't. She's really hard on the students and makes the excuse that if we want to go to the medical field you need to be able to do well under pressure. I would say this class messes with you mental health.,0
This course is just for learning the software. ,0
"Dr. J was an awesome teacher in my first semester. Funny, engaging, and knowledgeable. He always made sure to be clear and always asked if he needed to clarify. Always helpful when you needed extra help and never felt like I was bothering him. Will likely take him again.",1
hes funny.,1
I think most of these ratings are good because when he was younger he actually knew what he was talking about. This man needs to retire. He is a very harsh grader and can not be reached through email.,0
Professor Juarez is a great professor I had the pleasure to take him for three classes which I grew to love social work as a field. He is very knowledgeable in Social work because he is a social worker himself. I want to become a social worker like him! Please take him he is a great and caring professor!,1
"Loved, Loved, Loved this professor! He was so helpful and made this class interesting. I thought it would be an easy A but I was wrong! You have to work for that A, but worth it. One of the most professional professors I have taken.",1
Wonderful teacher. Learned so much. Clearly he is passionate about the subject and shares that with the class. A real gem for canadian jazz - hope more people get to benefit from his great knowledge.,1
"Russell is awesome. The class was a little jumbled because it was her first time teaching it, but it wasn't that bad. Very little work and interesting discussion topics. Only criticism is that the TA grades papers and there's very little variance in grades regardless of quality--it's going to be a 90-92 regardless, which makes an A (96) difficult.",1
Currently studying for this final and I really don't think I'm gonna make it. At 2 on the dot he walks in dims the lights and begins lecture for the entire class time. He is not good at lecturing and makes no effort to get students engaged. His voice is monotone so it's easy to zone out. He seams like a good guy but the class is a struggle.,0
"Took her twice. Got an A and a B, respectively. She teaches everything throughly. She seems strict, but is willing to help. Homework not mandatory but certainly helps. Overall, a great professor and you can't lose by taking her!!!",1
"Mr fultz was my favorite professor! Such a sweet guy and really loves his students! Go ahead and buy about 8 packs of note cards they are essential to making that A! His study guides are identical to the tests! Study your note cards and you will ace his tests, Multiple choice! I wish he taught a&p 1 and 2! Take him!",1
"Dr. Teekell is amazing!! Hands down the best professor I've had at CNU.  She really cares about her students, and although the workload is a bit overwhelming, it really pays off and you can see the results.  I definitely saw an improvement in my work from the beginning of class to the end.",1
"DO not take this professor she is rude and does not care about students doing well in her class. She is not helpful and gives you homework every week, TAKE another professor!!",0
"Quite to the contrary of others beliefs, Professor Hutton is a decent person.  She helps out as much as she can, to whomever asks for help.  If you attend the 3 FEA meetings, you receive a full letter grade of extra credit.  The only thing I didn't like was that she referred to elementary schools instead of secondary.  She is a very good teacher.",1
Adams a great guy. Super straight forwards and gets to the point. Best math professor I've ever had. Just make sure to put effort into the class and you will do fine. Highly recommend him!,1
"Ragy is a great teacher ! This class was a Saturday class that he made very interesting and easy . If you pay attention to lecture, and do all homework and quizzes this class is an easy A! Ragy loves what he does and is very passionate at teaching and helping his students ! TAKE HIM !!!! He is phenomenal .",1
"Graded on many things. She gives a lot of examples for both the multiple choice and math problems. She expects answers that are overly specific. Allowed us to use a cheat sheet on the quizzes, midterm and final which is the only reason why the class average wasn't a fail. It was her first time teaching the course, so I'm sure she'll get better.",1
Very poor attitude towards students. Weighting of material on test was very unfair. Students were given the opportunity to give feedback after the test. Dr. Balshine was only willing to listen to positive comments and when anyone made a negative comment (true and valid) about something she had done she rudely shot them down and ignored this input,0
"She is incredibly knowledgable about the topics she lectures on, but because she has so much to share and teach, the course moves pretty quickly.  She is animated and fun, and you can really tell that she enjoys teaching.",1
"I liked this dude. Tells you right away he has two types of teaching: the classic way, and what he refers to as ""Jazz"", meaning impromptu lecturing. Always interesting. Essays are GRUELING, luckily, there's only 3-4 of them. You're given 3-6 sources and need to write 2000 or so words. Lots of effort, one of them took me almost 20 hours to prepare.",1
This is a difficult course but Ms Hall will break down the material in a way that is easy to understand. One of the best instructors i have ever come across. She really wants you to succeed. Will like to take another class with her.,1
I have taken a lot of classes at Arizona Western College and this professor is one of the better ones. He is very helpful and makes things very understandable. He was very fair and I definitely plan to take him again.,1
"I loved her online class, Anthropology 1. Everything is detailed and she is organized, due dates are correct. she responses e-mail quickly. Well organized set up helps students to focus on the subject.",1
"This professor was so nice!  He was extremely helpful and a little on the crazy side, but was always nice and always there for a student.  He is a very understanding man.  You may think he is crazy at sometimes with the way he delivers his message, but deep down he is doing it out of true feeligns. Great professor. Take him! Bring textbook!",1
"James is an awesome teacher! I loved his class & his sense of humor. We learned a lot and he was very patient with our group. He's an amazing guitarist! Also, it's too bad he's married... Rawr! :)",1
"Hands down best professor to take for a difficult class. Anatomy is one of the hardest class I ever took and this professor made is easy. She doesnt give notes but she will write things down on the board she gives you what you need to know, willing to work with her students. She truly wants her students to pass with good grades. Take her!!",1
"awesome professor for both old and new comers to the music world. the guy really knows what he's talking about and he's really chill too. he'll be glad to answer any question you have or to help in any way. he's always reminding his students to practice what he teaches for 10 min a day, and if you dont know music at all this could really help!",1
"Such a handsome, hot guy. Makes me go crazy everytime  I see him. Wow makes my heart melt. Easy grader, wonderful dude and just an awesome professor. I recommend him. Makes my moo moo go wild.",1
"I do not like sociology, but her class is a must take. Gives extra credit for just showing up to class, reviews every test showing you the answers prior to taking the test. If you et lower than an A in this class then you are trying to fail! ",1
"Gravitationally challenged, says 'tickle me elmo"" when projector breaks, makes bugs buuny jokes ""use the stragety"" and says calc can be used for human problems too. LOL this guys hilarious but knows his stuff",0
"Sanda was amazing! She is one of the directors on the VCD Board so she knows her stuff and will be very helpful and attentive to you. She is a hard grader (only gives one A) but it is worth it, she pushes you and constantly brings in examples.",1
"Nice guy. Hard to hear him, but helpful if you ask.",1
Also took ENV 101 and 345 amd PLS 232 with him... Truly amazing guy and professor and I feel honored to have known and learned from him. A true mentor.,1
"Dr. Keeling is obviously knowledgable about toys and games.. but she changed the topic of the class after registration from a topic I was interested into toys so I went from being really interested into the class to not. She is an okay grader for papers, but a lot of the class is busy work. Participate lots bc its part of your grade.",0
"Unlike some professors she will make time to meet if you need help. She emphasizes doing the readings, but the work she assigns is manageable. She is really intelligent and she makes philosophy seem interesting. Make sure to speak up in class and you will do great.",1
I LOVE him and would take again BUT get ready to work! He is a genius and is eager to share his knowledge with you. Papers due every week and longer papers due sporadically make his class HARD. His assigned reading is easy and short which makes it easier to be prepared for class. He also requires you to attend events out of class which can be hard.,1
"I can definitely see why people may not like him, but he has been one of my favorite professors here at Temple. Makes you work hard and earn your grade, but you get so much out of his class.",1
"He is an excellent teacher who gives his students mnemonic and analogies to memorize even the most difficult concepts. With him, anatomy and physiology was fun. He remains my best professor so far. I recommended him to many of my friends and they all attest to his good job!",1
Were lucky he left brandon University to teach here at York U.,1
He is hilarious. He will show you the real world challenges.,1
"Mr. Landrum is a very great teacher, he hates phones, so dont use them in class. He has many pop quizzes, so read all the stories he assign. His test arent really hard at all, but he have to essay questions on the test that you really have to study for. The multiple choice and matching is very easy, if you went to class and took the notes.",1
"I would take the class again if I could. I passed anyways though. This was a tough class to take in winter intersession. Im sure I would have gotten an A in a regular semester. He is sweet, hilarious, and answers any questions you have if you dont understand something. Hard course but he helps you through it. Thanks Mr. T!",1
"He reminds me of Andy Dick, and Tom Green.  Steve is HILARIOUS! Says hi, outside of class, and even remembers students names.  He grades a little tough but is always willing to help, and seeing him for help WILL pay off.",1
"It's very disappointing that  EWU continues to employ this professor. He is extremely unprofessional, he even takes pictures of all students on his personal phone without asking permission. If at all possible, take statistics from another professor! He sets you up to fail so work hard and you can pass, the math is extremely easy.",0
"I've only had him for intro, but I find that he relies too heavily on his Power Points and spends the same amount of time on complicated material as the easy stuff.  Overall though, he's a good prof.",1
"This is by far the most incompetent professor I have ever had. I have had her for two classes now, and the second was worse than the first. Hey syllabus is nearly never correct, she is unorganized, and her teaching is a joke. She stays so topical, critical thinking and discussion would never be fostered in he classes. Her tests reflect it too.",0
Professor Khalid is great goes the extra mile to help you understand the lectures and labs. Would deff take him again.,1
"Justin is clearly exceedingly erudite and intelligent, but he is also a wonderfully down-to-earth man. A philosopher, Justin also has a working knowledge of economics and other disciplines, which only further informs his brilliant lectures. Justin is lenient, true. But if you give your best you will walk away truly enlightened and inspired. A+.",1
"Take any class he teaches, he is a very kind man who is a very generous grader to a point where you can resubmit any paper until the end of the semester. You will leave the class feeling like you know at least a general sense of the topic being taught. ",1
Probably one of the best teachers i have ever had. Very funny and very reasonable. I would take this class again if I could!,1
"Long boring lectures with a somewhat uninterested prof. He told us he never actually wanted to teach. Easy online quizzes for grade boosters. Tests are somewhat hard, you must study, but not too difficult to get an A. He seems nice, just not for me.",1
"Horrible. Do not take period. One quiz had an insane hard problem. No way to study for it. Smart book takes way too much time. Double work, online and his. Doesn't grad anything. No idea where you are in the class. Doesn't explain the lab. Lecture heavy, but you are still lost. Had to withdrawal. Will take with Tang, he was much better for Chem 2.",0
Challenges you to become familiar with materials and explore greater meaning of content. Very educated in his topics. I would recommend him to any student that takes Psychology seriously. ,1
"I took intro stats and although Velleman is known for ""taking the math out of stats"" the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences. And he's super approachable. If you study, you'll do well. When he says he's taking the math out, he just means you don't have to do rote calculations; you THINK and logic it",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. Introduction to counseling, you need to take it with him. Smart, funny and he knows his stuff. Two counseling videos are required and a summary of every chapter in the book he assigns which is 8 dollars. TAKE HIM",1
"Ive taken a lot of college and english courses in my career as a student and its VERY safe to say that Professor Wardens Comp 1010 course was the highlight of suffering, anger, and rage. Her grading is nothing short of rage inducing. You can do the exact work she wants and shell still make up something about how you didnt do as you were told",0
"One of THE best professors at MCC, this guy is humorous and he explains the topics very well and gives plenty of real world examples. If your taking an economics class, his class is the way to go, I took a night class where lecture was 3 hours long and it went by in a breeze. I would take his class again in a heartbeat and highly recommend him.",1
Nice guy but too disorganized to run an online class. Spent hours trying to figure out which site each assignment was on (never used blackboard like most online profs). Paid $100 for book + $100 online course fee and got an A but couldn't even tell you what Human Geography is. Easy enough to fulfill requirements but you won't learn anything.,0
"Textbook reference is essential. There are about 20 assignments, which are usually due 2 days apart from each other. Just do a bunch of them at once and you'll be ok :-)",1
This professor is extremely unprofessional and disorganized. He waits until the last week of the semester to grade assignments so you are not aware of what grade you have in the class. Responds promptly to students' questions but the majority of the questions are based on the lack of the professor's organizational skills- overall not a good prof,1
Dr. Xing is incredibly knowledgeable. She takes the time to explain things until we understand them rather than rushing through the material. Online is hard to follow with any science class. But Dr. Xing did her best in everything. She is very kind and always available to help during her online office hours. Take her if you want to learn.,1
"An amazing teacher. Tough, but you learn so much. You must study to pass this class. She is passionate about what she teaches and wants her students to learn.",1
"I wouldnt take anyone else for statistics classes. I took him for both 362 and 363. He made it easy and simple but I was actually learning. Him and his wife are adorable! Take them if you have a chance, do yourself a favor.",1
I was a student of Jeff's at Trinity Lutheran College. His ability to get students excited about theology is unmatched. His clarity and breakdowns of complicated concepts is awesome. Brilliant professor.,1
Aunave is like a drill sergeant. Classes are mandatory and you loose points if you're always absent. There is a lot of homework and she expects it done and neat.Their is progress in french grammar and she is helpful during office hours. But we didn't practice speaking french; she did most of that. Exams are not bad but her study guides are useless.,1
"If you want to pass you must attend! His favorite sentence is ""I'm here to help you learn!!"" Class is pretty dang hard and hard to understand the lectures but he's pretty approachable. You can sit there and listen to his lectures but it's easier to write down the information in your own terms. Ask him a lot of questions!",0
"sUCH AN Interesting and smart and caring professor and his stories are very interesting and fun to learn and reflect about take his classes and you will learn a heavy abundance of information that you want to learn Also, he is accessible outside of class and it is very fun talking with him about anything please take his class",1
"Good teacher, cares about his students, maybe to a fault actually because the tests were too easy and easiness doesn't always promote learning",1
"Hyrum La Turner has a consistant easy going personality, he can break down concepts very well and yet has a good sense of humor",1
"This is a good choice if you have responsibilities outside of school, attendance is not mandatory and slides from lectures are posted online so studying can be done from home. Professor Law is a kind individual who is passionate about philosophy and cares about his students. My one complaint; he speaks quietly and is hard to hear sometimes",1
If you are really good at understanding American literature and old English you will probably do good. But the majority of my class doesnt understand what the book is saying so most people are failing. He also gives in class writing assignments almost every week that he grades pretty strict.,1
"AMAZING teacher. Great grader, interesting paper prompts, and extremely open to student input. Came to him multiple times for life advice out of class, and he was always helful.",1
"As obviously smart as David is, he is a terrible prof. His lectures are all over the place and completely disorganized. His voice is monotonous and he mumbles to himself a lot - it's incredibly difficult to pay attention to.",0
"He is one of my favorite profs. I highly recommend him to anyone, even if plants are not your thing. He is easy to understand and is always willing to re-explain for better understanding.",1
"Hard class, but she makes it easy. Make sure to watch the lectures before you come to class - sometimes gives quizzes to see if you did.",1
"I've taken all of his music courses, and he's my thesis advisor, so I'm a little biased.  However, he's amazingly knowledgeable about nearly any topic you can think to talk about, he's clear and informative, and very helpful and friendly.  He loves his work, too, which is very important.",1
"I had a hard time learning from Logan b/c he sped through the lectures. He gave out practice tests before each test which was a lot easier than the actual test. The final was super easy which helped push my B up to an A. He is super quiet and boring, was very hard to sit through his class.",0
No Comments,1
"I don't know enough about Poole's teaching methods in-person, but online they were really poor. Two lectures split into a mandatory ""active learning session,"" and the other a link to a 10-20 minute long Youtube video. It was very disappointing because the topic of the class was so interesting, but it was difficult to learn with her teaching method.",0
Best teaching professor I have had yet! She is just amazing and truly cares about her students! Buy the books for this class they are invaluable to you as a teacher! You learn so much and she truly makes you want to be the best teacher you can become.,1
"Easiest level 300 class I've ever taken. Great instructor, let's you know exactly what to expect for tests and he lectures in a way where it's interesting and fun. Group project can be fun if you think outside the box. Definitely take HRM 305 from him.",1
Dr. Gordon is one of the best history professors I have had. He has a good sense of humor and he makes the lectures fun and interesting. If you show up and take notes then the tests are easy. I would definitely recommend him if he teaches again!,1
Amazing professor. She used the Margolis Method from a woman named Kari. The method worked. And she creates her own vocal warm ups. I would 100 percent take her again.,1
"Overall a great professor.  This is a challenging class expect plenty of homework and assignments, but don't be too stressed out because he does try and help his students out.  The homework is 55% of the grade in this class so don't slack off.  He gives good examples from his experience in tax accounting.",1
"This man is an absolute legend. Dr. Vohs is an incredible lecturer. He uses funny analogies that will most likely make you groan, but they also help you understand the material. Dr. Vohs is just a generally good person and will help you through literally anything he can. He's also hilarious when you get to know him. He's a true gem and cares a lot",1
"I took this as an online summer course so it was 6 weeks long. This instructor does not give feedback throughout the online course.   There's a discussion board every unit, but the professor does not respond to them ever. I had no idea of my shanding in class until the day grades were finalized. Would not recommend",0
"Stewart. Total madman. Why can't there be more like him? Cuts to the chase, takes no prisoners in his approach. I am the better for having taken this course from this instructor. You will be too.",1
Mrs. Palma is an excellent math instructor. She has good methods of doing math. She keeps you informed of how well you're doing in her class. I strongly recommend her!,1
I really liked this seminar! She is friendly and helpful. I would recommend this to students who want to really understand Japan and East Asia in general.,1
"I took Prof. Blake for SPA 101 as well. SPA 102 was a little harder in terms of learning grammar but the lectures and Portales exercises really helped us learn the concepts. The tests were a mix of open book and closed book and were a little too easy to be honest. However, Prof. Blake always gave extensive lectures to ensure that we were learning.",1
"Dr. Andrews heavily lectures but they are interesting. The tests and homework are very manageable as long as you put in the time to study and learn the material. Pop quizzes (3) per semester. Offers OH and is warm to students. Also, he's British. Sunny is the TA I had so if possible take her - she is lovely. Long essays. Class requires time.",1
"Way too much work, especially during a pandemic. She's a nice person, though. We were doing 2 projects at once which was stressful, both due at the end of the semester. There were DQs due for one of the projects and for the class in general. I don't think she graded too harshly.",1
I absolutely loved his class! He was so great at explaining concepts and he helps you every step of the way in your writing process.  He does rough draft workshops so it is important to attend class.  Sometimes he lets you out early on paper due dates! Love his glasses :),1
Dr. Venus is very intersesting man. he can be harsh when it comes to grading but he explains everything throughly. he is extremely helpful. and likes class discussions. he also has writing assignments evryday,1
"Yonn is a very dedicated and passionate instructor. He is challenging, but never negative. Extremely well versed in all aspects of planning. Class is never boring. The more classes you take from him, the more he challenges you. Every UWT student should take at least one class from him.",1
Clas is easy if you keep up with weekly work. Lots of flexibility.,1
"Be prepared to study 20+ hours a week for a C. She is a passionate teacher, but VERY nitpicky I spent more time reading her rules and grading criteria than the book. Tests are insanely difficult, and class is regimented. Shes all about application of material which is great if you're going into healthcare. If you just need the grade go with Bassett",0
"Professor Bowman was, hands down, the best professor I've had in my 3 years at Mizzou. Her class is challenging - There is a lot of information to learn. But she explains it all perfectly and gives many examples and stories from her own career. I will definitely take another class with her if I get the chance.",1
"Not a bad professor. Can get pretty long-winded.  Work was concise, grading was clear, and work was very manageable.",1
"TAKE HER!!!! She is a great professor. I learned a lot, especially after this past election. For her exams I suggest you study her power points and IDs. The exams will only be hard if you obviously don't study. She doesn't give hw but requires you to read the books. I would recommend to just rent the thin/smaller book.",1
"Despite the seeming lack of effort to convey during class, he is a genuinely kind soul, and he always responds to emails in a timely manner and he is more than willing to help when you ask for it. The class was canceled several times but he was so apologetic every time. The class really was not that hard, and he was overall very understanding.",1
"Tang's lectures can be boring and he is sometimes hard to understand. However, if you can actually pay attention he explains concepts well. His tests are very fair and not too bad if you study. He is willing to help his students if needed.",1
"she's nice but not sexy...but looks arent everything. She is very open minded...and helpful...but she made me raise my hand for too long...that cheesed me (that means she got me mad for those who don't understand)
 
 One",1
Best professor I've had at FandM.,1
"Take this course online. I took the class in person and it was really boring. The class is extremely easy as long as you do the assignments on time. She gives you an unlimited number of attempts on the assignments, so there is no reason to get a bad grade. If you do take this class in person, be prepared to sit through a lot of Power Points!",1
Easy A if you go to class and take good notes. She is also super accessible during her office hours and will reward you if you participate in class,1
"Mrs. Johnson is an excellent teacher! She expects you to behave like adults, but she is very reasonable and fair. Tests are not difficult if you show up and take notes. She makes the subject very interesting! Great class!",1
"He is not nice with students. When we ask something, not in the class, but when we're doing the exercises, he is rude.",0
"mr. hernandez is awesome. best math professor i had at HCC. he did lectures and discussions online (not required) and also met with me one on one to discuss my exams, which helped a lot. asnwers all emails quick, and we did discussions on canvas for points. he also answered all replies to discussion which was also helpful. i HIGHLY recommend him!!",1
"Rudest professor at FAU. He seems to hate what he does. He is very confusing on explaining the material, and makes it too hard to understand. Run away!",0
Will is a captivating prof. He is very knowledgeable and wants you to ask questions. He took a few weeks to get back to me on an email. And LFS 250 will have unequally distributed grading because some TAs mark differently. Your writing will improve over the course of the year.,1
"Somehow manages to make a simple subject (first year calc) confusing, even to the people who have taken it before in high school. All he does Is write proofs and make weird jokes. We have seen more of his hands writing out messy proofs on the projector than anything else. Just stay home and read the book.",0
"Super nice guy who genuinely wants to teach students about software and information students. Teaching isn't his only job, so my only complaint is that he may seem a little scattered when it comes to an organized schedule and syllabus. Regardless, he is very forgiving when you ask for help and very lenient on grading. Would take again.",1
I LOVE Madame Reisinger and this class. She saved my love for French after a horrible year in one of the lower levels. I think this class is definitely the easiest 300- level and one of the most interesting. Take ANYTHING with her!,1
"pretty easy, tests straight from book, participate in forums and will do fine. more involved in this class than evsp411. the 2 assignments are pretty easy if you just follow directions and use references provided. I think this is easy A",1
"Attendance is not mandatory but definitely recommended (it was once a week!). Really easy class, I would have had an A in it if I hadnt went on vacation for three weeks (still got a B). Just memorize the lecture words. Poor guy comes from work and is tired but still puts the effort to make the class interesting.",1
"He is a smart man he just needs to stop speaking down to his students, this is not elementary school we will be fine with it being said once not three times the same thing at once.",0
"Not only is Professor Dattolo an excellent professor,but if you need extra help he is always willing to meet you outside of class and spend the time to help you. He is a very special professor and I highly recommend him.",1
She is one of the greatest professors I ever had! She explains material clearly and very simulated. I love being in her class. Not a single day that I want to miss her class!,1
"a great instructor, remember her stories, they show up again",1
the class was ran very well in parts 1st and 2nd half the professor explains what you need for this class form textbook and exams he does games and reviews for exams and extra credit take notes his reviews will help you on your test he makes the class fun and interesting gives good lectures show up and pass and try not to be late,1
"Liked him a lot.  Was hard at first, but his grading and comments are really clear, and he's really helpful in meetings.  Class can be boring but not too bad.",1
"Class was pretty easy. Miss a day though and you could miss one worksheet thatll be worth more than actual papers so show up. Read textbook, lectures/videos are all over the place so tests can be difficult",1
"I LOVE Gina her class was an amazing time and I hardly missed, Shes a very great lecturer and shes so relate-able because shes pretty young, Her units were interesting and she sometimes brings her therapy dog to class. Great class and shell totally help you pass",1
Amazing prof! She loves what she does and it shows. Simple weekly assignments in class and one midterm/final. Be sure to keep up with hw or else you are screwed tho. 11/10 would recommend.,1
"Dr. P is awesome!!  She really cares about us -- when the university was going to charge us extra tuition for half hour courses, she got them to stop.",1
She is a great Professor and very lively. She is kind and wants the best for her students. she is also very fashionable.,1
"She was an awesome teacher! As long you attended class you pretty much pass. clear grader, but also easy.",1
Required presentations.,1
Professor Casada is a nice and fun person. Only assignments are online homework and test for the chapters. i spoke him for psychology and learned a lot. He allows you to take tests in groups if you want and gives donuts! He class was super easy! Definitely recommend him. if you want an easy A just do the work and study for the exams.,1
"Mr. Prunty gives help whenever it is needed, you just have to ask. He will work with you on a problem until you are able to do it on your own. I won't say he's hilarious, but he can be funny and he likes to joke around. He does not tolerate foul behavior or language- he respects you and he expects the same back. It's understandable.",1
"Very interesting class. Dr.B knows her stuff very well. She is willing to help students whenever they need it. Her tests are very fair and if you study your notes for a few hours before a test, you should be just fine. One of the nicest professors I have had and its a very interesting class. Highly recommend you taking this class!!!",1
"Prof. Clausen is AMAZING! She goes out of her way to make sure you understand the material. She hosts outside class review sessions after each topic, take home midterms, and tons of practice questions. Does on call by the seating chart, but not harsh whatsoever-just give good faith effort. She feels like the cool aunt you can go to for help.",1
I had Dr. Venus for one semester and he was great! He was a little slow when it came to getting grades back but he had great classes! He was always making jokes and making class fun! I always enjoyed his classes and looked forward to them! He would always help you if you got stuck on finding a topic or needed help when writing your essays!,1
"I've taken two courses taught by Dr. Coutinho (one online and one in the classroom) and I thoroughly enjoyed them both! Father Coutinho's classes are really interesting, as he shares his knowledge and life experiences. I learned not only about the subject matter, but also a lot about myself.",1
"I took Ancient Law and Politics and Ideas in Antiquity. The lectures are great, very informative. Let's you gain an open perspective. I highly recommend this professor. The books that he recommends are really good.",1
"She's a terrible teacher. She's a tough grader, very vague in directions and isn't very helpful when asking for help. Secondly, this is just an assumption, but she's been picking on certain students for harder samples during the labs.",0
"Susan is a great math instructor. She works with the class on anything that they aren't really clear on, even to the point of changing the homework schedule and the content on the exams. She brings real world examples into lectures to further clarify the concept. She really does give each student the opportunity to be successful. Great experience.",1
"ENG120 is going to be a lot of work no matter who you take it with but she will make it painless, fun, and enjoyable. I've never loved English so much.",1
"This was my second class with Prof Williams. The exams are definitely more confusing in SF350. Pay attention, take good notes, and study a lot. There is a lot of overlap with the technical details so you have to pay careful attention during lectures and when studying. Use the powerpoints to make sure you have all your notes correct before studying!",1
This class is simple. it basically consists like all of his classes. Just do the tests and do the discussions well and you should pass fine. Had no trouble with any of his classes.,1
"Ms. Fletcher is absolutely a delight to have.  She loves to laugh and always has a funny story to tell.  She makes Spanish so easy, tells the class exactly how to pronounce words and is always willing to make herself available if you need help.",1
"I took Business Calc. She is really good at teaching this class. I spent a lot of time during her office hours, because I slacked the first 2 months and still managed to get an A. She is the best Math teacher I had at ECC.",1
easiet course ive ever taken.,0
Dr. Zhao is very enthusiastic about biochemistry and more than happy to help students. Biochemistry is a difficult subject so you do have to put in some effort as far as doing well in the class. But the study guides and homework assignments correlate nicely with the book and lecture.,1
good teacher. he used to be a cop so he knows what hes talking about. doesnt end class early. gets a bit boring but easy class. and he even lets you use the textbook on the test! definitely study tho! oh and theres like 2 fieldtrips.,1
"This was my first time ever taking a philosophy class and I'm glad I took it with Tim. He does generally explain things well and truly teaches you to critically think about various issues, which is the purpose of the course. If you listen and put in the work, you should have no problem getting a good grade.",1
Mrs. Johnson is an all around great instructor. She is probably the nicest professor on campus! If you have to take a sociology class make sure you get Mrs. Johnson!!!,1
"Awesome professor, nice, and loves to help students.  10 short homework assignments, two midterms, and final.  The tests get harder as you go, but you know exactly what will be on them. Gives a little extra credit, but it raises your grade almost a whole letter grade.  And you learn a lot!",1
"had dr. Lowi for many classes. She is a great professor. You must take her if you are interested in politics. She knows her materials, very VERY smart. We need more professors like her.",1
"Professor MacCabe teaches a tough subject so bear that in mind before signing up. He gives more assignments than any other teacher I've ever had, but I will say he is also very FAIR in both grading and allowing late work to be turned in. You take his class you better be ready to not only read the textbook but also get ALL your assignments in.",1
"Awesome instructor! I took his 100W course and loved it. I don't know how his other courses go, but I would highly recommend this one to anyone having to take the upper GE writing course.",1
"This class was tough but I'm so grateful that I chose Mr. Ariail's Capstone course. If you want an A in this class you will have to earn it. Mr. Ariail is willing to help you every step of the way and is always available, he truly cares. Looking for a Capstone course to take? Do yourself a favor, sign up for his class! Best instructor I had at TCC.",1
"Professor Peters is one of the nicest professors you will have in college, I cant say enough great things about her. She made the material very interesting and did her absolute best to engage the class. She is also extremely understanding and kind. I dont really understand why the rest of the reviews are negative, she is an amazing person!",1
Avoid at all costs.,0
Encouraging  teacher and very good class.,1
"Larsen is tough. She truly loves math and teaches like so. But, the pretests always caught everyone off guard. &, the tests were no easy task either. Study enough and it is definitely possible to get that A. Also, don't be afraid to take time and complete the extra credit (most of which is due before the sem starts). & do the HW daily, she checks.",1
"Review sheets and in-class quizzes do nothing to prepare you for the tests. She is a great teacher with passion for finance however her tests are insane. She expects you to know how to solve problems that you don't discuss in class. If possible, I would recommend another professor just because her tests are INCREDIBLY hard.",0
"Gives copies of his notes and all tests are open-notebook, but don't think that will help you much.  His notes are dumbed down versions of the tests.  Tests are only 2 problems, so if you make a mistake, ""you are dead"".  He is very unapproachable in the classroom, however, if you go to his office for help, he is actually very nice.  Huge curve.",1
This class is impossible. The papers are are really hard.,0
"Professor Leung was fantastic. He cares more about learning than grades, and it shows. He is my first professor that allowed me to actually keep graded quizzes for review. He requires dedication, but if he sees you trying, he will help you. He is also really fun to be around, which helps when you have to be in his class at least 4 hours a week.",1
This class was great! The teacher knows what he's talking about. If you submit every assignment and attend the class you're bound to pass with an A. It's one of the easier classes that I've taken at UCF. I would recommend to any business major!,1
"I am now a 5th grade teacher and I use the Total Phys. Response that I learned from her regularly with my students. With Common Core being implemented, writing your own lessons is now a necessity. I scored 4's on my TPA's and real world teaching takes just as much time and preparation.",1
"He's cool. all i can say. easy to people who cares about the class, and should be more strict to slackers",1
"He is hard to understand and gives difficult multiple choice/open ended exams that most people get 50s on. He also fell behind on material. However, all the talk about his curve is true and will raise your grade by like 20%. Do better than the average and you will pass comfortably but it's still orgo, so it definitely isn't a cakewalk.",0
"I took his class for fun, and while he is a great person and is really helpful his class has me doing hours of reading and lecture notes outside of class. To add on to it he is an incredibly hard grader. Do not take his class unless it is imperative. You wont regret what you learn but youll want to die.",1
"Thomlinson is straightforward in what he expects. Only grades on the assignments in lab, with one easy species project you present with your partner, and a final exam that is straightforward as well. Everything in his class is group work with your lab partner. So choose wisely. Also, you go to 2 fun field trips. It's impossible to fail the class!!!",1
"I had a lot of trouble in this class. Her assignments made no sense an I often found myself stressing over due dates because she was so unclear about assignments. I love science, but this teacher has made me resent teaching the subject. I dread going to this professors class because she never gives us any breaks and we often have to stay late.",0
Had the worst experience with this Professor. Had a family emergency but he did not care whatsoever and would not reply to my emails. He will make your life harder than it should be. Lots of work and hes very extra.,0
"LOVED Jeanette-nice, caring, overall awsome teacher!!",1
"Shes awesome guys. Truly. I dont even come on here ever to put in the time to rate a professor but I had to take a chem class for my job and I hadnt taken a chem class since high school. I go to UC Davis but there was no room in any other chem classes (surprise surprise) and she made my life so much easier. Take her guys, for reals.",1
I was one of the people that didnt drop her class even after reading these reviews and it cost me. AVOID this evil lady at all costs!! She did not let me make up 1 lab of 1 week before in order for me to qualify for the NC grade. I attended all her classes and that was the first lab I missed. I have never come across someone so evil in my life,0
"Easy class that could help with fixing resumes and learning about Excel. I had a lot of background knowledge so it was easy for me. Only used textbook twice. Easy class if you turn in the assignments. Everything for the semester was posted at once, so you just have to keep eye on dates so you're not late.",1
"I took Theater Arts 41 with Danny in the winter semester. He was such an amazing professor! He gives excellent feedback on the scenes performed and, unlike many of the other theater professors, he teaches his students how to act and perform *realistically*.  I highly recommend Danny to any students wanting to take this course.",1
One of the best math professors that I've had in my college career. He teaches you the skills and the foundations that will help you in later courses. The class is tough and you must work for it. Really improved my algebra skills.,1
"In-class assignments every day, so your grade will drop fast if you miss. Extremely tough grader (I rarely got full credit for assignments and I'm an A student). She wants things done a specific way and if you don't ask questions or confirm how something should be done, you will lose points. There are easier teachers for this class.",0
"great teacher and guy, engages the students well... pretty easy and hilarious personality. I would definitely take his class again",1
Was a tough grader but makes an effort to help you as long as you make the effort as well. Simple as a i can put it.... just do your work!! Like i said if you just try she will try and work with you just dont be lazy.,1
"Sweet person. Not the best teacher. Would lecture us then expect us to automatically know how to do what she was talking about. Would then proceed to yell at us. Every class she lectured us about something not pertaining to Accounting. Acct 2010 has a history of being one of the toughest at Clemson. Go to SI, do your homework, it helps.",1
"You'll learn a lot. You'll work a lot, this is NOT an easy A class. If you don't like violence, cussing (C  and F word)don't take it.  Brent is a GIFTED teacher but you can learn the same thing with tame content. If you like: South Park: cuss episode, Curb your enthusiam: Denise Handicap & Tarantio movies, take it. If not, chose another teacher.",1
"Wonderful and kind professor! Pretty easy class no exam. Graded HW, debate, presentations, research papers.. She brought us cookies and pizza in class(:",1
"I took this class to see if I would get a chance to check out the SMAD major and it turns out this class is nothing like SMAD at all. It deals with media literacy and the effects it has on the public. Overall, Zheng was super nice and helpful and I love going to talk to her. She is there for you and tries to make everything as clear as possible.",1
her class is easy if you do your weekly hw! a few projects but all super easy and doable! class was about 3 hours but we always got out super early a couple weeks into the semester. i missed a few classes but you can easily catch up. super nice and caring :),1
"She's a great teacher, she is extremely passionate with her field of study. She knows a lot and expects a lot from you. Yes her test are hard but thats if you don't pay attention to the lectures, i didn't use the book for her class but it is needed for extra references. I say come to this class with an open mind.",1
"I took professor Schnell's high school accelerated class and I actually miss it sometimes, that's how well she taught it. I had no idea how to write one of the essays but she helped me through it and it turned out really well! Kinda makes me wish I was an English major.",1
His tezching method uses the material from the text but he goes beyond and incorporates real world experience into his lectures.,1
Take him if you want help and arent good at math. He gives alot of extra credit and makes math easier then other teachers! Great teacher would def take his class again,1
This prof is totally awesome! Amazing teacher!,1
"Graded by 3 exams 50 q mc (but she said they're written response from now on due to online), ec quizzes, and tophat homework on 12 chapters. Can get off topic when talking but it's insightful to know so it doesn't bother me. Very passionate about teaching, strict about cheating so beware. She provides lecture videos and always answers emails.",1
"Math is difficult for me. Mr. C made it easy to understand. Show up to class, do your work, ask questions, stop crying and blaming, do your due diligence and you get at least a B which is what I earned. First time I earned more than a C in math since high school.",1
"Spearman is cynical, hilarious, and you can tell she genuinely loves teaching. Class discussions are great and funny. The only thing I didn't like about her is she never put a single grade into Moodle before the final, and when I emailed her asking what my grade was she never answered. Other than that, an interesting woman who knows her stuff.",1
"Teacher was difficult to work with, test are timed and designed not to be completed in given period.  Capstone project can be easily gamed, just google it (in the end no point and it is the bases of the class).  Text is out dated and very boring.  If you can avoid this teacher do so (and you can).",0
"Erin is a great instructor! She's very straight-forward and gets to the point, makes great use of class time. The course is intense, but if you stay on top of everything, it can be pretty close to a walk in the park. DO THE OBJECTIVES. Don't make a habit of missing class. ",1
Professor Holcroft's online Human Nutrition class was fun and interesting. Her lectures were provided via websites that she put together with pretty straight-forward reading material. Weekly dietary analyses are very time consuming but they really help you learn. Expect putting in about 8-10 hours a week for an A grade. ,1
"Goes over material too fast, doesn't ever give out handouts to learn from. All he does is just talk and do quick problems on the board..",0
"Simply the best English professor I've ever had. She is well-invested in every individual student and gives feedback; she is there to help you excel and grow. She is so sweet, silly, and inspirational. I loved her course and curriculum and I wish I could've taken her for every Eng! If you apply yourself, there is no reason you shouldn't get an A.",1
Awsome professor. Always available when you need his help. I took him for a summer class and things turned out to be more sucessful than what I thought. I highly recommend him!!,1
"Best teacher in COB, also the person to talk to if you have any trouble with class schedule or similar. He actually knows what he is talking about, owning his own accounting firm makes it easier to pay attention. Overall great guy and teacher, take him if you can!!!",1
"There was lot of reading and work for this class. However, you shouldn't expect anything less for a graduate class. I found it pretty easy as long as you complete and comprehend the readings. Don't fall behind and post any questions you have. Work on your final paper ahead. You will learn a lot if you put in the effort. Overall, was a good class.",1
Dr. Warner is awesome! I try to take hum for every communications class. His taste is music rocks too!,1
don't take his class!!,0
"Once in a lifetime, you meet a teacher with the care and determination that Favara has and it is amazing! If you do the reading and take time to prepare for class (even if it's a skim through) you will be able to contribute to some amazing conversations! She always wants to hear what her students have to say and she has our best interest at heart!",1
This class is awful. He lectures for an hour straight and shows videos. The test are hard and there aren't very many of them. There is no graded homework. I do not like his lecture style or anthropology. I would avoid if you are not interest in this major. You can get a diversity requirement somewhere else.,0
"She's the best professor in the business management dept. Take her for all your accounting courses. That's what i did from my sophomore year till the end of my junior year. Trust me, you will pass. And she works with ALL students!!!",1
"The college is lucky to possess this fine young gentleman, educating the next leaders of the future!  I hope that he is well taken care of, not only financially, but as a highly respected educator of the residential district!",1
"Great teacher! Tries to make the class fun, but likes to talk  too much and refuses to do ""hands-on"" programming while in class (maybe this is the norm for all programming classes?) . He expects you to do it at home, however, if you are new to this and you get stuck, there is no one to ask.   He loves to give handouts after handouts after...",1
"Amazing person. So interesting and insightful. I took his class and enjoyed it a lot. Fair grader and not a whole loe to homework. Very smart guy, cool to talk to about anything.",1
"Professor Jacobo provides studentsclients NEGATIVE ENERGY. Read ahead and don't procrastinate. Your educating yourself with this professor, because she provides zero support.",0
"There are no tests, only quizzes but the quizzes are crazy specific and hard. She grades really tough on the essays and takes points off for not having the proper format. You watch videos and movies and she is a great person, funny and her lectures are so fun. It is just the papers and quizzes that you really need to be careful with.",1
One of my flavorite teachers,1
Dr. Lee is a pretty good professor. The class itself is not easy. I felt like I learned a lot in this class.,1
"I'm no history major, but this class was very enjoyable He knows and loves the material and it really shows in his lectures. Great lectures. Is there for students and gives great feedback.  You will have to actively read most of the material and pay attention, but the material is actually really good. I found a lot of joy in learning in this class.",1
"Awesome instructor, you cant fail this class. Logic is complicating period but you will be able to understand it the way he teaches. Enjoyed his teaching, and straight forward. I would recommend this professor.",1
"Funny teacher, if you go to class and pay attention, it shouldn't be hard. If you are shy or quiet or late, be warned... she will tease you in front of the whole class.",1
"Absolutely love her! She makes class interesting, and really gets everyone involved in the discussions. If you pay attention to her lectures, and if you go over the study guides, you should be fine. A lot of readings every week, but the textbook is the only one tht matters. Dont buy the African American Experience book! Its not referenced, ever!",1
"Prof. Hinshaw is by far the best prof, I have ever had: he is interesting, smart, REALLY involved and interested in the material himself, he is funny, and seems like a genuine and caring person (just as a side note). If you have to chose one professor to not to miss during your time at CAL, Hinshaw is definitely the one!",1
He loves to talk and share his life'S story. He gets off topic alot so he gets behind alot. He likes to teach about what he thinks and test you on it. He knows what he is talking about. His exams can be tricky but he gives you a study guide that lays out the exam for you. The material was really boring and he grades hard.,0
Wish there was another professor to teach this course at Fresno state. She doesn't offer plenty of extra credit which seems reasonable considering her test are extremely hard. You need to study so much for this class. She's tough on her students and expect you to know everything.,0
Dr. Conner is a good teacher. She doesn't use the text but it's good to have for a quick referrence if you need one. She sends lecture noted to your e-mail and usually will accomadate you in any way possible. I took her for 2 semesters and an A both times. I would recommend her.,1
"I took this class in 1994. This guy was the best teacher I ever had. I have personal knowledge of thousands of people that this man impacted in a profoundly positive manner. This man actually cares about people.  I know all this, cause he's my Dad. You rate perfect in my book. Love you Pop!",1
"Extremely easy class like everyone else is saying. She really cares about oceanography and cares about students doing well. Attend all lectures, don't buy book, do all hw, go to dis for help. HW is hardest part of class, IMHO. There is redemptive HW to make up any missed points. All test material will be from lecture, so take good notes.",1
"Pat is the best teacher in the Chemistry department, and one of the best at MSU. I was very pretty afraid of going into his physical chemistry class for biologists. He makes the difficult subject easy to understand and actually very interesting. I would any of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
Great course,1
"Shes the cutest little old lady youll find! Shes energetic and even when its a dark gloomy morning, her infectious joy will rejuvenate you! Shes super nice and approachable, but dont get her wrong, shes super tough too. Study hard and ask her questions when youre confused. She assigns lots of in class presentations so get ready for that!",1
"Hard to understand. Hard class, lots of homework. Just not my kind of learning",0
"Professor Kaur is great! She really knows her stuff and wants you to learn something. Take her, especially if your interested in english, because she will help you out in any way she can! =)",1
3 papers and a final exam. Takes attendance every class and ends lectures 15 minutes early most of the time. Books are utilized for the papers. Solid professor.,1
Prof. Gartland is super easy going and easy to work with as long as you go to class. She lectures the whole time and there was basically no homework. EASY A,1
"This was an online class that I wish I could have taken in person. It is clear she loves History and it is reflected in the materials. There is a lot of reading, but it is all extremely interesting. I have left this class with useful knowledge and a better understanding of the World. Do the work, put 100% in and you will receive an A, hands down.",1
"Lisa is a tough professor. She expects a lot out of her students. Her assignments are long and detail oriented. If you communicate with her regularly and show you are working hard to understand, Lisa will go WAY above the call of duty to help you. I have never had a professor care so much for her students. As long as you show you care, so will she.",1
Loved his class! He made it super interesting and I learned a lot. Attendance is really important and you have to read if you want to pass. The readings can suck (watch summary videos on youtube) but he makes the in class conversation interesting and fun.,1
"He gives very engaging and interesting lectures. His quizzes and exams aren't really that hard, and he gives people second chances when it comes to assignments. One would have to actively try to mess up in order to not pass this class . An easy A is not guaranteed, but actually failing with this professor is highly unlikely.",1
"An excellent instructor , an awesome character , easy to approach",1
I had Prof. Dattolo and not only did I learn so much in his class he showed his students that he really cares about our learning. He was always there for extra help and he would always be so clear in his lectures. I really looked forward to going to his class . He has made a lasting impression on me. All professors should be like Prof. Dattoolo.,1
"She's a super-professor! Always willing to help regardless of the situation. Her lecture tests get progressively harder, but her lab exams are equally difficult (just have to learn a couple more items as the semester progresses.) Take advantage of the extra credit! The textbook is useful, but not required. In-class lectures are very helpful & cool!",1
"This type of course is definitely ment to get you ready for upper level courses. Participate, study and use office hours.",1
i really dread anything pertaining to math. but actually enjoyed his class.,1
Great instructor. Wish she taught more classes in the department!,1
"I am not sure who failed for missing three classes, but I am not one for attending class as often as I should, and I definitely missed more than three classes in 315 and I didn't even come close to failing. In other words, this class was amazing! Keeling is amazing, and super sweet and SO intelligent. I learned more here than in any other class!",1
"This was a good class. All the information was on PPT, and those were online. Most readings you could just Google, but for ease of access get the course packet. Group work was meh, but it was a short one. Aizura was a great professor. He was critical and to-the-point, yet enjoyable even at 9am in the morning. Take good notes and show up  A.",1
"Dr. Pasquesi is a phenomenal English Teacher! It was a true pleasure to be a part of her class. If I had to describe her in one word, that one word would be ""Educator."" Most professors focus on the curriculum and syllabus. Dr. Pasquesi has a high focus on the development and progress of each individual in her classroom.",1
"Hard to take notes from his jumbled mess on the board. He doesn't answer questions thoroughly. The Mrs. even complained about the way he tried helping her with the PE exam. His final exam was impossible. Be sure to just make a really good reference sheet for tests, and try to do the homework.",0
he is a fantastic teacher and a wonderful person. very helpful and open to students' ideas/thoughts.,1
"Exams are fair and straightforward with no trick questions but you must learn ALL the material if you are aiming for an A. Matt is very approachable and thorough if you need clarification. Lectures are easy to follow and engaging. Time management for memorization is key in this course, it is not too difficult if you stay on track.",1
"In lectures he tells you exactly what you need to know. There are quizzes after every chapter, they're easy. Then the test are exactly what he teaches. He post that problems to do in the book to if you want to review for the test. Barely gives homework and extra credit. Go to class, take notes and you'll be good. Would take him again if I could.",1
"the most boring lectures, but easy class aslong as you do the papers. exams are easy",1
The only reason why I am passing this class is due to the fact that I teach myself every single chapter. The professor is a nice guy but isn't good at explaining what he is doing on the board and half the time doesn't even know what he's doing himself. I would recommend taking any other professor for chem 2 over this guy.,0
She does not answer emails. It is a professor's job to respond to emails.,0
"The WORST professor I have ever had. I would give her a 0 if it was an option. Some of the questions on the exam we haven't even covered yet. Homework is online, and we only get 3 tries for each problem. Doesn't give extra credit, a tough grader, and never answers emails. Please just DON'T take this class if you want a good grade.",0
"Definitely not worth the hype. The professor was hella dry and I did not find this class interesting at all. His lectures and extremely boring. I found his essay topics unclear, and some of the readings were just so tedious and inconvenient. The class is graded on very little things so your grade is very dependent on each test.",0
Challenging classes but great professor.,1
"This class so so so hard.  She not help me at all.  She think she know everything but don't know nothing.  If you know everything why not help people but since you pretend you do why don't you.  God Says: The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern...",0
"Great professor! I took theclass during the Mini Winter session. Though it was condensed into 3 weeks at the most, the professor was so helpful and replied to questions in a timely manner. At first I didn't know anything about HTML and feared of failing the class and the difficulty of it, but it was very helpful and fun to learn. Enjoyed it!",1
"Dr Souaiaia is really knowledgable and friendly. He is accessible at office hours. I look up to him. Make sure to go to lecture! You can't find answers online. Discussions aren't really helpful, which I hope will be improved in the future. I also wish we could get a schedule of lecture topics and dates in the syllabus.",1
"HE IS A GREAT PROFFESROR, HE REALLY HELPS THE STUDENTS AND YOU WILL LEARN A LOT IN HIS CLASS, HIS CLASS IS NOT EASY BUT IS NOT THAT HARD YOU JUST HAVE TO TO DO THE WORK ALSO HE GIVES YOU THOUSANDS OF EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES TO RAISE YOUR GRADE",1
"Not only is this class hard, his lectures are beyond boring. He missed his calling somewhere and should not be teaching. Even his extra credit opp. are more work then all my other classes. I would never ever taking a class with him again",0
"I am not a fan of history but Professor Gordon makes history interesting. He is wicked smart and definitely knows his facts. He takes random attendance but if you go to class on a regular basis, he doesn't waste your time!",1
"I did not enjoy the class, not relevant course material for a 4th business class. I felt like he spent more time guilt tripping the class about things versus teaching us something of value.",0
"the worst class i have taken at oberlin.  wow, so painful.  i got As on all my papers and a B+ in the class... she just overlooked it.  said nothing that i couldn't think up or read.  not a fan",0
"Dr. Brennan is the best professor that I had at Penn State. The homework is long, but actually interesting most of the time. He is very helpful in office hours and after class. Preprinted notes are awesome and the tests are really easy compared to the HW. The average test grades were like 89.",1
She has great lectures which do help you for the 2 midterms and final BUT their is ALOT of reading each week lectures are based on the reading from the chapters in the book you have to do 6 primary sources out the whole 10 weeks which are worth like a test grade all together,1
"This was my first class with Prof Heller-Garland and I absolutely loved it. She is definitely here to help you succeed and learn useful information. Weekly quiz/discussion post and 3 big assignments that require you to attend cultural meetings, but I found these assignments extremely beneficial. Just do the work and you will get a 100 on everything",1
"This is my second semester with this professor - great as always. This was his first semester teaching this particular course (E-Tailing and Retailing), and his lectures were built to reflect the most up-to-date topics.    My advice: participate in discussions (you'll get more from the course), re-read articles for the test, and pick a good group!",1
I miss him.  I wish I could have worked with him more.,1
"If you're interested in learning, she is great. If you want to goof off - don't take her.",1
"A great all around person/professor. She's amazing, easy to work with, understanding, attentive, passionate about her subject, etc. The material was great (3 essays throughout the semester). She never ever made the class boring. I seriously love her and worked my schedule around so I could take her again, she's just that great. Please take her!!",1
Unorganized and no concept of time management - lost grade book for some of the semester - I never knew how I was doing during the semester.  I spent 1 5 weeks feeling frustrated and confused and bored.,0
"best eng 101 teacher ever. easy class, but I genuinely did become a writer from this class mainly because she's so helping and caring and will read and revise your paper whenever you need it. class is basically 2 essays (only 2-3 pages long) and a super easy final online project. super easy A while also enhancing your writing skills",1
"He falsely accused me of not citing sources when I cited sources. When you do well on your exam, he is okay with your homework topic even if it's stupid, but when you didn't do well on your exam bcz exam was worded wierd and study guide was misleading, he has problem with your hw topic. He is not a good professor, and he deserves a bad grade.",0
Amazing professor. Funny. Very useful if you pay attention,1
"Sophomore biology seminar; He is great! Inspirational, helpful, and generous. He doesn't have everything in on time and doesn't expect you to either - life happens. If something is a little late it's no big deal he understands. Doesn't stress over citation details (you can worry about that for Senior Sem!). He gives solid constructive feedback.",1
"He is a very good professor. He is very polite and he likes to give his opinion and advice. He will try to help you out as much as he can and he will reward teams for their hardwork.   The course itself is not easy, because you will need to have a good team in order to deliver a good product.",1
"It's a very detailed subject with a lot of information covered in a relatively short time. Show up (most important!), read the text, do your homework and it's easy-peasy. Make sure to take notes because he gives a lot of extra explanation in class to help understand the text/labs.",1
"easiest classes ever, online classes, even though it said writing intensive but not much to do this class, easy A",1
"If you can understand his accent, this professor is excellent! After being completely lost in ECON 301 material, I took ECON 302 with him and it all started to make perfect sense. He is strongly recommended.",1
"First impression of Kata is that she has a strange accent, and after some more time in her class, you'll realize that's the least of her problems. She doesn't give guidelines about what she expects of her students, and she's highly disorganized. Definitely take someone else for 223.",0
"JP is a perfect example of someone who can't ""do"", so they teach instead. He is totally inept when it comes to software development and loves to tell you what the ""industry"" is doing, when it's not only completely inaccurate but it's laughable, he's never worked a day in his life in the private sector. Avoid, he's hard to understand and childish.",0
"Nakaji is a wonderful professor. She is helpful to the student and gives special notice to those that are putting in the work. She interjects fun and enthusiasm to her teaching method. When it come to helping students she will not hesitate to pause or slow down to be sure you, and your classmates understand the material. Great intro to ASL",1
"No final, just 5 exams which are difficult but if you really study you can do well on. I didn't really get to know her because it was a big class but if you read the book (long chapters), know the terms, review the questions in the back of the book (she uses them on her tests) and look over the notes from class and her outline, you will do fine.",1
"Wanna high a grade? Show your passion to her class and take the research paper seriously, and,DON'T MISS CLASS. Boring lecture, helpful teacher.",1
She is super nice and really helpful.  Her tests are pretty easy.  She is a great teacher for first year french!,1
Make sure to do the readings because he will notice. Grades are mostly based around participation but he will make sure you participate in discussions.,1
"Prof Goodwin changed how I felt about chemistry. My previous Chem professor made me LOATH even attending a class, but Karen actually made it fun for the first time! Her lectures are very easy to follow, makes sure to explain everything, and really cares for her students. Her videos, the reading, and the homework were a breeze for myself. Fav prof!",1
If you wanna have no life outside of microbiology go for it. Tests every week with questions that are tricky af and will make you question all of your study habits. If you are taking any other class that has the potential of being at a difficulty level of above 2 do not take this teacher!,0
"He's super funny, and really cares about his students. 1190 is a difficult course in itself, but Garyen teaches well. Difficult fill in the blank quizzes every week and constant iclicker questions, but they help you stay on track with studying.",1
"Jen was an awesome prof for sculpture! We had a super small class, she really made an effort to get to know everyone on a personal level.  Her comments were always constructive and she really values participation. She really knows how to cut through some of the art major slacker bs. She's very knowledgable about the industry which really helps!",1
Dr. Lewis will capture your attention with his witty humor and insightful lectures.  The enthusiasm and passion he has for Computer Science is infectious to all who dare open their minds to his teachings. Quite possibly the best that USC Upstate has to offer in Computer Science.,1
"Dr. Meehan is a nice lady and knows her stuff. However, if you miss one class, you miss so much! She's isn't very willing to help you catch up. She drops your lowest test, but doesn't allow you to make them up even when you have an excused absence. She does want the best for her students though and will like you if you put in the effort and show up",1
"This class isnt gonna be an easy class, but if you show up and just do your work youre going to get a good grade. People are complaining that she randomly has industry exercises, but she makes it very clear on the syllabus and in class that thats how she rolls. She lays out her expectations very early, then its up to you to meet them.",1
"Make sure not to turn in assignments late, he's very tranquil, just do the work and you'll pass with an A - C (depending on your writing skills).",1
"This isn't an easy class, no matter who you take it with. But he knows what he's talking about & is a great teacher. Go to class, do ALL the hw, never miss a lab & memorize the sample tests he gives you they are exactly like the tests. Great as answering questions. I couldn't be happier I took this class with him.",1
"She is an amazing teacher; very helpful and caring.  Her class is not hard at all if you just study her notes and her review sheets.  In this class there is only a midterm, final, and a project.  Not bad at all, I recommend her.",1
"Professor Nguyen is extremely wise and thorough with his material. Quizzes are fairly easy however the written assignments hold higher standards if you want to score a rough B or so. He is helpful and loves feedback from his students so don't be shy, especially when class participation is graded.",1
"Good prof, like his style",1
Karen is a completely disrespectful and discriminating teacher towards 1st generation students who work full-time. Ive dropped from an 88/100 to a 69.9 in one mistakenly missed 30 point assignment and wont get the courtesy of a 0.10 grade round up. I'll fight tooth and nail for this 0.10. Believe me.,0
"Wouldn't recommend taking this professor. If you do, use your own note taking system...his is very unclear and repetitive.  Also, he is very condescending...he treats you like junior high students. I've never written a review for a professor before, but this guy made me feel like I had to.  I enjoy history, but I do NOT enjoy his class.",0
I took this class as an online summer course and it was very straightforward. There were 2 exams and 3 discussions with two replies and weekly 20 question quiz. Professor Shan graded weekly and provided positive feedback. I enjoyed the class! Take it if you need a class.,1
Chase was a good professor. Although I think he could improve on wording his tests better.,1
"One of my better teachers, knowledge able on subject and makes work easy to get done even if you've missed class.",1
Carefully read his syllabus and refer to it before asking him questions. Online quizzes every week based on textbook chapters and exams based only on in class lectures. Lectures are not scripted so you have to write what you think is important which is a lot of  what he says. Exams were fair and you could manage a decent grade with good notes!,1
All I have to say is eh. Its an okay class. If you can remember stuff and like to read then youll pass. Everything is straight from the textbook.,1
No Comments,1
little out of classroom studying time needed for course.  Tough but fair grader,1
"Pros: Knows the content, Good at giving lectures, Replies to emails promptly. Cons: NO STUDY GUIDES! NO FEEDBACK ON EXAMS! (i.e. missed questions), 20%+ Fill-in-the-blank on all exams (Better know how to spell all your enzymes!). It is just cruel expecting a student to be able to do well in a medical-based class with those 3 cons combined.",0
one word. horrible,0
Prof. Murata was not my favorite professor but she wasn't the worst. She does assign A LOT of work papers and assignment and does take a long time to grade your work. She seems like she's a hard grader but I can't really tell because I don't have grades for a lot of my work. I do like though that she always gives you feedback on your assingments,1
"Dr. Stephens is a great professor. An A in her class is definitely rare. As with a number of teachers, you would have to read outside of the text in addition to the text to get those few extra points. That being said, if you have read all the material in class and took good notes you can definitely get a B out of her class.",1
"I took this class online and because of that her lecture videos were very long, however, she prepared me for exactly what was on the homework and the quizzes were just HW problems with different numbers. Accounting isn't easy but she is a great teacher. Also, i recommend to take this online because the at-home video is the same as being in class.",1
"Professor Blair was the best teacher I've had in a very long time. She is thoughtful, helpful and so knowledgeable! I enjoyed every assignment we had in the class and she gave such great feedback to each individual student. I liked writing before this class but I found a new love for it during her class! I hope I can take another course from her!",1
Terrible professor doesn't teach anything during lectures and definitely do not need to show up to class. She expects us to learn from the 200+pages of reading she assigns per week as if we do not have any other classes to worry about. I would not take her course again.,0
"As a Professor you expect them to be involved in the course and respond to student questions, this did not happen. Many questions in the virtual office went unanswered and it was almost as if he just didn't care. There are 4 modules in the class, each with 2 assignments and 1 test; so easy A or easy F depending on your test scores. No extra credit.",0
"Personally I enjoy her teaching style. It is completely lecture based and she gives key terms at the beginning of every class that will be what your exams are entirely based off of. It is her TA that is what you should worry about. They are the ones that grade the papers. I am an english major and my paper didn't receive above a C, usually get A's.",0
Poor time management. (Waited almost 3 weeks for him to post an online exam.) Very wishy-washy on the material he was using. Added a required book to the class with less than a month left in the semester. Also tells lots of stories. Im sure hes a hoot at barbecues but theyre mostly distracting and rarely relevant to the question asked.,0
"I absolutely loved Dr. Crockett. YOU MUST TAKE HER. She is so sweet and teaches very well. We had our class online because of the pandemic and she was so accommodating and made the class very interesting. No tests, just bi-weekly quizzes. One paper and forums bi-weekly and case studies. I learned a lot and she was very welcoming to the program!",1
Fun class!,1
"Yue Laoshi is a great instructor. Fully recommend. If you put in the work, she respects you. Even if you don't, she will still push you but it is only because she cares about her students. A wonderful instructor.",1
"Take this class! Super easy! Tests are simple if you study all the notes online. Attendance is not mandatory but it is extra credit on tests. Lectures can get boring, but still a great class.",1
You have to teach yourself in order to pass this class. He communicates terribly and even his TAs have no idea what is going on. He only does two examples of questions during lectures that dont even make sense with whats going on. You need the book in order to teach yourself if you want to pass.,0
"Terrible professor. Very difficult tests and quizees which the class is not properly prepared for. Most people in class recieved low grades in the C range. The MOST BORING teacher i have ever had, he talks in a monotone voice. Very inconsiderate with his grading.Recieved a bogus participation grade DNT TAKE. One of the worst teachers ive ever had.",0
"Does many many examples, sometimes it seems like too much. I feel like she only does examples but almost no theory at all. I don't mind that because doing examples in class makes you learn how to solve more problems without practicing at home. But some theory would not be bad for learning something extra.",1
"He needs to work on his people skills. However, if you have to take a religion class, take with another teacher please.",0
"I like Crewes, he's been really helpful with things that have come up with internet connection. I've had him in the past and catching on to his pace and way of grading has been pretty easy every time.",1
Finished with 107 avg any questions??,1
"After 60 hours worth of classes, she is by far the worst professor I've ever had. I took the summer session A&P course and it was the most sporadic and unorganized class ever. She would loose our graded papers,  biased when it came to essay questions, and overall rude to students. She would make you feel unreasonably incompetent if you asked a ?.",0
Les is awesome! He's a really funny man! He is a good prof to take this course with. He makes it very interesting and the info is clear cut.  Must keep up with the reading although you do take extensive notes in class. VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT SOCIOLOGY! He gets very into it and loves when you participate!,1
Amit is an amazing professor and you can tell he wants his students to be successful. He knows what he's talking about and his lectures are very helpful so I recommend attending as many as you can.,1
"Nice professor, but cannot teach. He has video tutorials up on youtube, but they still do not help. He will however take his time out to help you during his office hours, so if you have him and need help, go to his office. Grading systems is weird, but be sure to do assignments right.",1
"Prof. Lichtman is awesome! He explains the material very well, and he really cares about his students. He wants them to learn what covered in class. He gives many assignments, and the final is a lot of writing but not hard at all. Very interesting class if you want to learn!!",1
good teacher. exams are easy.,1
Good lecturer loves teaching history and is energetic about it. Best thing to do is participate and do the assignments. Provides test guides for every exam.,1
"This is a class you have to put work into, if not you will fail. He knows his stuff and gives great real life experience examples. He asks questions about the chapter being reviewed be prepared. Marketing pan huge project but you will appreciate him after for it. Group project case study, awesome experience. Pick a good group!",1
Professor is excellent. All her material was acquire to the class.,1
"Mrs. S is a very good nurse and a great instructor.What I learned from her helped me with the RN classes. The students that don't like her are those who just want to slide through. Nursing can not be done by just passing the classes because the students who managed this couldn't get HESI done after 15 and 20 times.Mrs. S rocks. Believe me , I wasn'",1
"In the beginning you think what a great teacher...then he grades analytical essays that he makes you do all semester. He has very opinionated views and grading system. This shouldn't be a history class, more like a essay competition class to make him jump out of his seat but that won't happen b/c he thinks everyone sucks at writing except himself.",0
"he was amazing and lightened the mood, kind of a fun class when you did preforming arts and debate",1
great prof,1
"He's a great professor. He always explains what you can do better in your drawings, and will understand if you speak to him about any problems you have. Classes are very entertaining and he fully explains what we need to do for each assignment. Dont be afraid to ask questions. He grades you based on your improvement in drawing, not how good u are.",1
Extremely patient and understanding.  Gives you the autonomy to learn the material on your own by reading the material or he will guide you and help you through if you prefer otherwise.  Good Guy!,1
"Not going to lie this class was my most difficult this semester. Bobs a bit of a tough grader and the speeches take a good amount of time to prepare. However he gives back great feedback. I actually think Ive grown as a person in his class. Im glad its over, but Im really glad I took it.",1
"Mr Ariail is a great professor! You should definitely take his class! The assignment are easy, just do them and you'll have an A. The simulation game really is fun and that's homework. He has a great way of teaching, not boring at all!",1
She is an amazing professor! She knows her stuff; never boring; funny( great storyteller! You gave to do the work to pass! She will help you if you are struggling and gives extra credit for whole class. Not to individual students!!,1
Dr. Birx is a prolific author and an exceptional teacher. He pushed me to look beyond and challenged me on my suppositions. He was also able to shed illumination on a whole area of Anthropology that I overlooked. He was also available for questions and gave great advice!,1
"Awesome professor super funny always tried getting the class to laugh. Have to do all hw and quizzes since he usually doesnt give work, if you miss class youll miss a lot of info",1
"She is strict when it comes to grading. Syllabus was confusing, had to buy a whole textbook for an online code. Didnt use the physical textbook at all. Didnt really like the online program, either.",1
"He is a good professor, just a really easy class. The lectures are kind of hard to take notes on, but if you pay attention you'll be fine.",1
Dr. Meshelemiah is a ridiculously hard grader. I will NEVER take class with her again. The expectations are way too high for a 2 credit hour class. Classes are always boring and she just puts random google pictures (that are probably not relevant) on every slide. Group projects are expected to be exciting although her class is boring as hell.,1
No longer teaching. Professror Emeritus. Laid a good foundation for future teachers to model. His clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses. Master teacher,1
"I really like Dr. Cochrane, she is extremely nice and personable. Anthropology is not my major but I still  enjoyed her class. She is an easy grader and doesn't over complicate things. She truly just wants everyone to succeed in her class. Complete your assignments and you will do fine. I definitely recommend!",1
"If you can, take her! She's an amazing teacher and is really helpful if you don't understand something. I wish she had been my teacher for all my Spanish classes. Come to class because it is a high percentage of your grade and pay attention. If you do both of these, you're pretty much guaranteed an A.",1
I took this class online during the pandemic and she made the process so easy! She made all assignments due at the end of the semester and gave multiple attempts for assignments. She also squeezed me into her class last minute so she was definitely super caring and always willing to help. Just get your work done and its an easy A mostly.,1
I really learned a lot in this class and I'm taking Mrs. McGlynn in Jan for my second intro to teaching I'm so excited. She is very easy to talk to and she really cares to see her students pass and know the material,1
Great professor! Very very easy class!! As long as you do the work you will get an A. Most of it is completion and he is a super easy grader on essays.,1
"I would make sure to attend the lecture because there are randomly assigned projects during class. Definitely would take Kelli again she is funny, cares, and kinda understands the coursework can be dry.",1
"Weekly assignments on MasteringNutrition website, takes an hour tops to do, fairly easy. I recommend doing the practice quizzes as well. Beware that (weekly) quizzes are 20 ?'s in 25 minutes, tougher than homework. Take advantage of extra credit. Midterm & Final are taken straight from quizzes & assignments. Wants you to do well, very helpful.",1
"I took two of Dr. Brennan's classes, because he's fantastic. He wants students to learn without losing sleep over his class. He gives a fair amount of difficult homework, but it can be fun and will help you learn. Tests are EASY. Attendance is important due to (easy) pop quizzes. I've used a lot of things I learned from his classes in grad school!",1
Might be a great researcher but definitely a REALLY bad teacher. Most of his explanations are unclear and messy. Will not answer student questions. Barely available. Cannot solve his own exams without making mistakes.,0
"This teacher is so nice. If you fail her class it's because you don't show up for class or do the homework that she stresses for you to do like the entire semester. She lets you do 1 group/take home test, lets you make up a couple of your tests for a better grade if you choose to do so, and she is there to help you anytime you need. Take her!!!!",1
rude and unhelpful. tests are hard,0
"I learned so much not just about drawing, but life from Prof K's class. what a classy guy. as long as you put in an effort and challenge yourself a bit, you'll do fine. usually just one homework drawing a week. nothing too crazy. no midterm or final. just some one-on-one crits. COMPOSITION, QUALITY OF LINE, and PLAY OF LIGHT. that's it. rock on.",1
Gabe Shapiro is always willing to meet with us students.  Not always focused in class but very enthusiastic and motivating to be around.,1

Professor Appel is by far the best math teacher ever! She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. As long as you do your homework you'll practice a lot and you'll do great. Highly suggest watching the youtube videos she posts on canvas the night before the lecture and you will do awesome! She is very understanding! AWESOME!,1
"Your entire grade is based on three tests (including the final) and one term paper. Everything you learn is from a lecture, so missing even one day can really put a dent in your ability to do well on tests. He can also be a little bit difficult to understand at first. The class is fine, but you should be aware how important attendance is before.",1
"Dr. Zlesak is one of my favorite professors, and my advisor. The way he teaches keeps the class engaged because you can see how much passion he has for plants and he often makes funny jokes in class that help you remember important material for his ""celebrations of knowledge"" (quizzes or tests). He is a genuinely nice person, I recommend him!",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. He is clear, fair and really loves teaching. He is easy going, makes you feel like you ask question and no one fails. Would love to take another class with him!!!",1
there are only 2 tests in this class. midterm and final. he is an incredible person and there are 3 book discussions but theyre easy,1
I had this prof for A&P and she is so great!  She will do whatever she can to go the extra mile to help you.  She really knows the material and lectures very clearly.  She is tough but is a wonderful professor!,1
"Easy Class, Great Prof. Make Sure you do the reading and watch the shows for the class and you'll be fine. A couple of classwork grades, and two major papers. Textbooks for this teacher are cheap.",1
"loved her, You either get her or you don't at first, but trust me she makes life easy and she is by far the best English teacher I've had. She is NOT harsh and relates/understands her students. TAKE HER CLASS (English 111)",1
"I took the late start and there are only two case studies and two exams and a final. It says you have to purchase the book, but you can definitely pass without it. She provides PWP lectures and answers to quizzes and essay questions from the book for you to study from.",1
GREATEST PROFESSOR EVER. Has great lectures and is very passionate about History. Will definitely take again!,1
"Professor isn't bad like everyone else makes her out to be. She is very knowledgeable about this topic, and I really enjoyed the course. Everything you need to know is in her powerpoints, Kahoot quizzes, and study guides. Course consists of midterm, final, and group discussion assignments. Very straightforward.",1
Best class I have ever taken. I had it in the morning and couldn't wait to go to class. Test can be difficult. Dr. Strange is hilarious and has many great stories. Take this class. Best thing I ever did.,1
"For this class, he did not follow or measure up to any of the stated expectations that he set for himself in the  syllabus. Got irritated anytime he was asked a question, replying ""i don't understand question, look in the book, I am not an expert.""  Overpaid seat warmer.  Take the online course and save yourself the hassle.",0
"Go to class and pay attention and you will be fine. If you ask stupid questions, she will hate you. So pay attention, be intelligent and you will absolutely love her class like I did. I absolutely recommend taking professor Sumi.",1
"Class was supposed to be on inductive logic, though we didn't cover much of that. Not really a way to fulfill math requirement. West got off topic a lot and seemed more into trying to entertain than teach. Easy A, but don't expect to learn much.",0
"Not really the most interesting class. It seemed that he didn't really know the material that he was teaching and even said that he specializes in modern art. If you're looking for an easy A, he's the teacher to take but don't expect to learn much. He doesn't care if you're not paying attention. It was like a study hall instead of a class.",1
"Easy A, just make sure you buy the textbook that has answers for test.",1
"Sammons knows a lot about San Francisco. Crazy to see how much of his lectures are given on the spot, mainly ad-libbed, in monotone. No power-points or anything to go off of which makes it difficult to differentiate between what needs to be known for tests and what are just ""fun facts"". Pretty chill class overall but the tests take you by surprise.",1
Easy class and he entertains with his stories.,1
"She does not provide study guides. She is always late to class but requires her students to always come to class and be on time. She lectures to us as if we have a degree in Biology already. Every time you ask a question her response is 'Well, what does the book say?"". She is a nice lady but a HORRIBLE professor. Please do not take her seriously.",0
Good professor.,1
Wonderful instructor. Attendance is not mandatory but it helps if you show up especially since there are in class assignments that are easy credit. Buchanan wants everyone to learn so he makes his lectures easy to understand and is very friendly. The final is optional but if taken won't affect your grade. Mainly it is to replace a low score.,1
"While attendance isn't mandatory, you won't do well in this 8 week course if you don't attend unless you already have an IT networking background. Be prepared to do the Netacad online learning at home and for best results, get ahead on the modules so his lectures make more sense. Great instructor with professional experience in Cisco.",1
If you're looking for a prof that doesn't care then don't take a class with him. He is very kind and he enjoys when students want to learn. There are no assignments except for a couple reflection papers on the books you read. He believes traditional assignment/quiz based teaching styles restrict true learning. I learned a lot in his class. 10/10,1
Gina is awesome! She really cares about her students and makes sure she is doing everything she can to help us. She gives great feedback. You will have short writing responses for homework and not many big papers. Take her class if you have the chance!,1
"Awesome teacher, easy A as long as you show up to class take notes and study for your exams. 4 test drop 1 and final. test are straight form powerpoint.",1
"Lori was a mess of a professor. Rude, arrogant, and all over the place quite honestly. The class taught themselves each chapter every week and she completely could care less about the stuff being taught. As a matter of fact - she never taught once. Also, twice a week meeting class only met once a week, forcing tighter deadlines.",0
"Mrs Hays was an okay instructor. She does expect you to keep up with weekly schedule as do most instructors. You can ask her questions. You will need your book and you will have to do most homework on cengage, then weekly discussions/replies to peers. Most homework was due once weekly and that is it! She was not hard!",1
This class is very easy if you do the assignments; they aren't hard. The only hard part is the resume & interview because she likes everything to be exactly how she says. If you look like your not paying attention she locks the computers. If you participate in discussions shes pretty nice. If you miss class & don't  pay attention good luck.,1
"Makes sure to share several good sources of, well, sources.  Loves the topic, very knowledgeable.  Plays guitar.",1
just say no.,0
"Don't fall behind. Very clear, responds to emails quickly, very tough- but if you do all (and i mean all!) of the practice examples then you'll do well - if not then it's too tough to do well.",1
Prof. Walsh was very willing to help students.  He is funny and is really knowledgeable about philosophy. Very organized.,1
"Linda is pretty chill. I like her sense of humor. She always walk around to examine students' work and offer help. This class had shown me that sculpturing is more than just molding clay, you will experiment a variety of projects. There's only about 4 projects throughout the whole semester. Totals up to 4 presentations and 1 quiz and 1 paper only. ",1
"Schellhorn is deffinetly your best option for Finance 201. Gives study guide, tests are exactly what she teaches in class, and little homework. Do yourself a favor and take her for Finance 201, especially because all of the other teachers are so bad.",1
"the best teacher around.full of wisdom.his jokes are funny and tells stories. I wish I could take more classes from him.he's a good teacher, willing to teach his students to use logic.very smart good at teaching..if you want a good teacher take Mr. James West.No doubt the one of the few good teachers out there.Take him and you'll never forget him.",1
OMGoodness she is the best professor ever! Prof Errico cares about her students success. Accounting isn't necessarily easy but she helps you understand! She is truly there for you and is willing to help with whatever she can! Take her!! Do not take anyone else or you'll regret it! Take her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"This class is an absolute mess. I missed almost half of the listening assignments because he was not clear how to access them. A nice enough guy, but also very unreliable for extra help outside of class, due to his position in the philharmonic. This is the first ever music class where I will likely not do well, and I've been taking music for years.",0
Jenneke's the bomb. She understands language and how to explain it. She loves engaging her students and is funny and interesting. She also very literally wrote the book on learning Dutch. 10/10,1
"Probably the most repsonsive instructor I've had in grading, responding to questions",1
"She is great teacher and learned a lot from her class. I feel that she gives a lot of extra credit , and no one should not be able to pass the class. Has a lot of patients.",1
"This professor give you from 2-3 project for each of the 12 Chapters plus a Test with 30 to 50 Question. Every 3 Chapter he will add 1, 2 or 3 Project call Caps on Project from those three Chapter and after all that work you will also have a Final Exam with limited time and very long so he divided it in 3 Final Exams with 50 questions each.",0
He is nice and trying to help.,1
"very good instructor, knows his history, grades fair, I would take his class again if I could.",1
"Professor Washburn is my favorite professor, I've taken 3 of her classes. Her lectures are clear and concise. Tests are based on materials covered in class. She is caring and is devoted to child development and her students. She has worked in many areas related to CD and offers great career and life advice. Show up and you'll get a good grade.",1
"really great professor, cares about his students. The tests are fairly difficult, but he offers a lot of extra credit. also does not take attendance, but has questions to be turned in at the end of class that are graded. must read the book to do well on the quizzes.",1
"Dr. Irani is by far one of the best professors I ever had.  She is brilliant and obviously invested in her students success.  Trust me, she is a ""must take"" if you have the chance.",1
Professor Stewart was an easy grader and very straight and to the point.,1
"You have to have him, so good luck. (there should be an easy rating below 1.....) Material is OK, but his choice in the book makes it extremely hard.",1
He was very rude and set unrealistic goals for the class. I would not recommend anyone to take him!!!,0
Awesome teacher! Knows her stuff and has great memory techniques. I wish she taught other courses! would take another class with her for sure!,1
"I don't normally review my professors, but this time seems necessary. The semester was online due to covid, so its was a new process. I originally thought that the Legal and Ethical Business course was going to be boring, but the professor did a really good job with keeping the videos interesting. I would defiantly take his class again.",1
"Had to drop this class bc after a 51% average on the midterm, he refused to curve and would not help ANYONE. I know like 16 other people who dropped. Material would've been fine with some sympathy and help. He's so unclear",0
"Took this online  in the fall14.I'm a very good student,and I was just very displeased with her teaching ability. She takes 1-2 wks to return phone calls and emails(when you ask her about this in person she says she never received them).We had nothing but trouble with the Mastering Biology,and she even had us re-do some due to her wrong doing.",0
She is the worst teacher ever. She literally stands there with a microphone and talks. No one paid attention and literally the whole class failed every test. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE HER. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.,0
Extremely easy! He gives you the EXACT questions and ANSWERS that will be on your midterm and your final. All you have to do is memorize them. Speeches are easy. Class is enjoyable.,1
"Dr. Irani is a great professor of an awesome subject! She is actually a practicing psychologist, so when our class would meet, we would have great discussions rather than ""lectures"".  You are expected to read the chapter on your own.  You definitely need to have discipline to complete the online work on your own, and the tests can be difficult.",1
"Really enjoys the subject matter. Very difficult grader, and not very helpful for improving. Tends to keep all of her grade the same so it's really tough to improve once you're locked in to a certain grade.",0
"Best professor ever! I adore her and admire her so much. Hands down, shes the best professor ever!",1
Seminar on Internet and Politics.  Great class.  Highly recommended.,1
"Best teacher at school, taking another teacher would be a mistake. Extra credit as well",1
"Monica is great! I had some trouble understanding certain parts of biology, but she is always available to help you. You have to be in class to really understand everything, so attendance isn't mandatory, but if you aren't there, you will fail. Great teacher!! Highly recommend her!",1
You have to submit assignment beginning of class if you submit at the end of class 10% percent deduction. I wont recommend this professor,1
"I passed this class, with little to no help from adam. He speaks in monotone, is extremely difficult to get a hold of, and is extremely vague with his explanations. i tried going to his office hours, but both times he was not there. homework every night but thats expected. Good luck!",0
I love this professor. Her classes are difficult but she is there and believes you can succeed. She is is wonderful professor and would recommend that everyone takes her course.,1
"Professor Chris, Is a true example of social worker, he proves the empathy withing himself for a student that are ready for a better future, he is calm, respectful and tolerant, ready to help a student as many as possible to pass your papers. I will always recommend him to all upcoming student. The best advice I will give is communicate with him. ",1
"AWESOME professor, would take any class of his again in a split second, just do the required readings overnight and be prepared to discuss them the next class period... he is over-helpful and prepares you with ten times the information needed to make a great grade than any other professor will...",1
Study and you will do fine,1
I took this class back when I was a college newbie. Man oh man as soon as professor walked in I thought it was pop eye. That shaker bottle. Those guns. I knew we had an instant connection because I lifted too. He shook his shake up. I shook mine. We both looked at each other and knew gym sessions were gonna be great.   Great class. ,0
She is one of the best professors I have ever had. I am a very lazy student and this class was one of the easiest yet insightful and best classes ever. Highly Recommend,1
She is a great english teacher but very picky.,1
"Hands down one of the best Profs at CCNY. Her lectures are amazing and she really tried her best to make sure every student understood the material. Go to her office hours because it's really helpful. She gave amazing feedback on my essays, which further enabled me to do better on any other upcoming essay. I highly recommend you take her!",1
"If you want to learn history this is not the guy for you. If you want to learn how to read a ton of pages, write several papers, and take exams which are only free response and essays then Turkovic is your guy. Not my cup of team but maybe he is yours.",0
"Professor Marshall is super nice, she's always very helpful and treats her students friendly. Take her and you'll love her class. It's an easy A if you follow her instructions, which are pretty simple and concise.",1
"Great guy, explains the information well and does lot of in class examples from the homework to help even more, definitely recommend Adam",1
"Let me preface this by saying I majored in Math and have gotten A's on all previously math classes. I took his Calculus III online math class in 8 weeks, and it is downright impossible. His ""notes"" is just copy/paste from the textbook, and that's it. It really seems he has no idea about Calc III, and conversely, his students have no idea either.",0
"Energetic, ebullient, enthusiastic! She is very accessable and available to review and discuss your drafts. I really enjoyed the class. She has a passion for writing and her enthusiasm is contagious! She is very with grades and getting papers back. I hope that I have the opportunity to take another class with her.",1
She always gives so many homework questions and she takes them up as part of your points with your quiz grades. There are quizzes at the beginning of almost every class and she only gives 10 minutes for them. She takes off points for the SMALLEST & STUPIDEST things. She will be the reason you'll fail the class or drop out if you're not on top of it,0
"Professor Livingston is awesome! She's very clear in what she wants, and is always available to help. Class is very structured and organized. She's definitely a tough grader, but its done in a constructive way and she really wants students to succeed in her class. Would definitely take again!",1
"Made Atlantis Debate harder than you would think.  Often times the class seems unstructured, but always went quickly.  Interesting some days and boring others.  Wears funny glasses, but not a bad teacher at all.  Have no idea how he is about music.",1
Really tough quizzes are extremely difficult ,0
"Registered for calc expecting to end up with a B. The exceptional Dr. Vutha is the reason I have an A, a newfound interest in math, and much-developed skills. He breaks down the most complicated concepts, keeps you engaged, & gives you countless opportunities to improve. Abundant review sessions. Will tailor his help to your needs if you reach out.",1
"Professor Monahan is truly one of the best professors I've ever had. He makes class something to look forward to, he tells stories that relate to the topic on hand, he is extremely understanding and accommodating, and he is great at explaining. Not only is he one of the best professors I've had, but he's also an amazing person period. Take him!!!",1
"Great teacher and great person, but the only way you'll do well in this class is if you're a good student and go to class and pay attention. He lectures really well and often goes over things multiple times to make it clear, but the problem is that a lot of students (including me) don't like accounting and tune out. Final was pretty hard.",1
"Professor MacCabe is very patient with students who want to learn, but has little patience for disruptive students who try to hijack the class (we all know that one kid). Sometimes the subject material can be a little boring, but bare with it. If you are willing to show that you are actually trying, MacCabe can be the most chill and flexible ever.",1
"Honestly, Professor Miura is a kind and knowledgeable professor. I personally just wasn't all that interested in the course topic itself but, the students in my class who actually were into the course topic I could tell enjoyed it. Overall, Miura is a good professor but the lectures were a bit dull for me.",1
Take Voice and Movement !!! It's sweeter than HONEYYYY ����,1
"He told us on the 1st day of class that he was lazy. What kind of a teacher tells you that. He gets mad when the class did not get what he was teaching, and he even used very BAD words in class. NOT COOL!",0
"She is a great teacher if you have interest in actually learning the language. Alas, if you are taking the class to just fulfill requirements, she is not the prof. you want. She is understanding with your problems, but she is strict when it comes to class. Be prepared for work if you take her.",1
"One of the best teachers at CCC. She truly knows her stuff and enjoys every minute spent in the classroom. She makes you work for it though. She's not there for her paycheck. She truly cares about the well-being of each and every student. Would love for her to teach more classes here. Show up on time, she hates when you're late. Turn in assignments",1
Boring subject material but very straightforward. All tests open book. Great guy but horrible material.,1
"Well, come the final, half the class is failing, and Kari made a whole spreadsheet about it, while instead, she could be using her time to try and make her students be successful in the class. Yes of course some of the students are failing because they are slacking, but, if half the class is failing, maybe the teacher could do something different",0
"Anitori is a very interesting man, to say the least. He clearly cares and knows a lot about Micro, but his class is definitely on the more difficult side. Study, study, study, and you'll pass with an A.",1
Adam is clear and hot.,1
I do not understand the negative reviews for professor blake. He is a very passionate individual and his grading could not be more clear. His office is always open for questions. I learned more in his 6-week course than I did in high school Spanish.,1
"She was super nice, tries her best to teach well. We did use the books she told us to get, she tired to make sure that everyone passed her class. We wrote a few essays that we got feedback but after the COVID she stopped giving us feedback before turning in the final draft which sucked and made harder to get a better grade.",1
Not very helpful outside of class.,0
I've taken professor Hanley several times and he's one of the easier professors to take. Discussion board postings are due one week then responses are due the next week which is pretty easy to me. There was a group project but it was not hard. Everyone pitched in and there was only an 8 slide requirement.,1
"Great professor. Be prepared to do a lot of work though. He places the learning responsibility square on your shoulders, but is also there to help. He tends to give word banks even when he says ""don't count on it"" just to surprise students. Enjoyed his class a lot.",1
"Madame Aunave is an excellent professor. She pushes students to learn the language to their fullest of ability, and is a great course to take to get familiar with the French language, and culture. Attendance is highly recommended for this course, because it is a foreign language.  I highly recommend taking it with Madame Aunave. ",1
Lots of extra credit but tough class and not so good of a professor,0
Great professor! Explains material in a way I could understand. Very patient and fair. As long as you do the work you will pass the class. ,1
"By far the best teacher at KU. She's smart, funny, and knows her stuff. She simplifies the material and breaks it down into layman's terms but then follows up with the appropriate vocabulary just so all the students fully understand what is going on. ",1
"I had to take this class though it isn't part of my major so I knew nothing going in but I felt like I left with a lot.  I can see why some people don't like him, he is the kind of guy you like or you don't.  But he knows a lot and is willing to help.",1
"Dr. Holtan was a really good professor. She did a good job of explaining the topics, and she played videos from tv shows that helped explain the material. The class was fairly easy, and while most people did not read the textbook, it helped during the quizes. She was a tough grader on the two presentations we did, but she offered extra credit.",1
"I thought I hated ""art music,"" but this class changed my perspective.",1
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"I took the Psych-1 6 week course during summer and it wasn't bad at all. The class consists of weekly discussions which are easy points. There were two 10 question quizzes & a few other assignments, four 50 question exams and an 80 question final. The exams and final were a bit difficult but take advantage of the 2 chances the professor provides!",1
"She's an easy grader, but  she makes sure her students understand everything.",1
"Have to read about 30 pages per reading, does not answer emails, does not post grades, doesn't update things that she says she would. Honestly one of the worst English teachers I've ever had.",0
"Great guy! Not a great prof! He has no order to his lectures and bounces from place to place and it's almost impossible to follow. Also, his topics for essays are beyond bizarre so if you are going to take eng 1122 don't take it with him.",0
"Definetly a great professor, cares a lot about his students and is passionate about teaching. Exams are not the easiest but drops your lowest one, also has lots of buffer grades built into the class. Attendence isn't mandatory but you won't get far if you don't show up and pay attention.",1
doesn't know how to give proper instructions for the test,0
"As a response to the earlier comment about Tim ""talking down to students"": The only reason he has to do this is because he is on a completely different level from any of his students. Dr. Goodwin is so incredibly smart that it's hard for him to talk with us like he talks to colleagues, to he actually has to dumb it down.",1
"best professor love him. yes, you have to study in order to pass, accounting is hard and you have to teach yourself, exams are basically the hw study it and you'll be just fine",1
"I learned a lot and enjoyed the content, but she is a tough grader. Sometimes it really difficult to understand what she required in an assignment. Even if you go to her office hours, first of all, you need to wait in the line for at least an hour, then she will just keep repeating one question over and over again.",1
"Awful course layout - 4 exams spread over the semester with term paper; also overemphasis on ""community service learning"" where you basically do academically-based volunteer work for organizations (How can this be worth 40%?). Lots of reading in this course as well, but that's to be expected for courses like this one. Lectures are incredibly dull.",0
"A very nice person, but grades assignments very toughly (does not give you clear expectations). Does not help to prepare you for the labs very well and does not go over the theory behind labs of previous weeks, you would need to visit her during her office hours in order to get the help you want/need.",1
She grades really easy. You have a couple of exams that you will pass because the study guide has the same thing on it. Only have to do 5 discussions and a couple of worksheets on top of that. Pretty manageable!,1
"She is really nice . But she takes this course way to seriously. Do not expect the easy A's you should be getting out of this course. All the assignments are marked hard as if they are upper level English papers. Students sometimes received 0's on assignments, in foundations. The class is interesting as well but it is not an automatic A class .",1
"The ancients told us of a man who was born beyond time who would come down to bless us engineering students with the wisdom and knowledge from beyond. But seriously, this class is definitely the most helpful with understanding engineering in an industrial setting and will prepare you for real-world engineering.",1
"Do not skip his classes, becasue there are pop up quizzes and he puts in the exams what he explains in class.",1
Great textbook written by him,1
"Scheduled another prof. and got Nicastro. If you want to get yelled at and feel stupid for an entire physics lab take Nicastro. As the chair of the department, he was teaching a very low level physics lab and was taking it wayyy too seriously.",0
"Pretty nice guy. He stops at every slide during lecture and can talk for hours about whatevers on it, so sometimes he rambles on and ends up telling you irrelevant info. His pronunciation of Greek words bother me. Hes a bit of a tough grader but hell mostly heckle you for grammar. Dont worry if you miss a class bc his notes are always online.",1
I love this teacher! She's great :),1
"Camarena is super laid back and funny. Gets off topic sometimes, but in a 2-hr math course it is refreshing. Cares about students passing and taking school seriously. His lectures are straightforward and takes the time to answer student questions.",1
"I really enjoyed his class. It's very informative and thorough, knowing his material inside and out.",1
"One of my favorite teachers! His extra credit questions on tests are always entertaining. He tells you exactly what is on the tests and goes over everything well in class. He gives u an outline of the content that is going to be on the test. If you study for tests, go to class, and do the online hw then it's an easy A!!",1
"At first I really enjoyed the class , but it went somewhat downhill. I learned a lot from the class, but felt that the teacher was judging what people said, even though it is supposed to be a share zone. She also grades papers very hard based on APA and wording, not so much content. I would rather not take again. I dreaded the last weeks of class. ",0
Save yourself the struggle and take Ryba. She uses his material anyways except Ryba is much clearer and actually knows how to explain the topics well. Take her only if for some reason you have to retake the course and you know half of the material already.,0
"Not just for this class, this is an overall review for Dr. Kamau. In my opinion, the best professormentor a student can have. Dr. Kamau truly cares about the success of his students and will help as long as you show a willingness to learn and be active in your own success. ",1
grades too hard,0
He is a smart guy but not cut out for teaching. Just reads off the slides unless he's talking about his own research. Covers way too much material. Would avoid taking the class or wait till a different professor is teaching it.,0
"There is a standard but it doesn't exceed students level. Her expectations are practical and plausible. For those who's says she's tough should go to Wong's(head of dep) class, then you'll know what ""tough"" really is. I took 1102 with another instructor and it was a disaster. I would definitely take her class again if I could. ",1
"Dr. Haldane does a great job of making the class interesting and relevant to what students want to learn about. This class was very small and so it became largely discussion led. I would definitely recommend Dr. Haldane as she communicates what she wants on assignments very clearly, and doesn't simply assign ""busy work.""",1
"She is super hesitant to give As on anything. Even with little 10 point assignments; you do everything she tells you to do and you still won't get full credit. Must read the book from cover to cover to do good on tests. Also, lectures are a waste of time. Avoid taking!! ",0
"No txt.  Investments class was basically a review of topics already learned (currently learning) in other couses.  Easily approachable.  Syllabus changed throughout the term as there was too much material/components to cover in what time frame was available.  As a former UNB grad, Culligan (for the most part) really knows the key areas to focus on.",1
"Class was alright, but Brandt repeats his weird anecdotes such as buying butter at the grocery store too much. Gets old fast.  Claims attendance is mandatory but only took attendance once. 14 quizzes, lowest 2 get dropped. NOT ALL QUIZ ANSWERS ARE ONLINE. 3 tests - provides 1 makeup during finals, but only if you missed an exam. No extra credit.",0
"Laurie is the best human being you will ever meet! 14 modules all posted at the beginning of the semester. There is a LOT of reading but, that's every history class. 5 essays, 400 words. You are also given the option to write creatively. She gives AMAZING, very detailed feedback. Best professor EVER!",1
"Very good prof. She is very helpful, and has experience learning other languages. She is good at teaching you HOW to learn a language and not just the language. I would definitely take another class with her. She is very nice, and easy to approach for extra help. The class expectations were very reasonable.",1
"I took this class for credit and ended up just absolutely loving it. Melissa is a real treat, she's a very respectful instructor with the greatest feedback. We had two students who had been very shy at the beginning of the semester and ended up becoming some of the best speakers.",1
This teacher is pretty good at times.  He digs into your personal life and sometimes does not keep things confidential.  Doesnt have you do much during the semester but make you write 15 page journals...its a JOKE!  Quizes are true/false on each chapter...very easy. Wouldnt recommend but easy A,1
"Awesome professor. Every student deserves to have a great teacher like him. He adapted to the class's needs as the tests came and gone, which is what impressed me. He is very nice and loves teaching the material, you can tell that he is passionate about his subject. Tests can be tricky at times, but overall not too bad. Highly recommended!",1
"Learn from the book. Didn't buy the finance calculator. He doesn't know how to do the problems without it, so if you can't teach yourself. well good luck. Review is not helpful. He cannot give formulas or extra help unless it is directly from the slides given to him. Why pay for a class when the teacher can't teach?",0
Emails long reading assignments/outlines an hour before class with many unused pages for you to print out. Doesn't go in depth more than social mobility of a specific time period. Avoid teacher at all costs.,0
"He lays out his structure very clear. Online participation is on yellowdig, which is better than basic discussion boards. There are media critiques and quizzes due every week and both are pretty easy as well. No trick questions on the quizzes either & you have a whole week to do them so no excuses. He gives excellent feedback. Would recommend.",1
"What you do in class is she assigns a page from the packet, gives you wayyy too much time to do it, goes over it with everyone, and repeat. Homework is completion based, and she allows note cards for exams. Easy, but mind numbingly boring.",1
"Lots of lectures. He has a ton of experience in the field, which is a good thing but is also very annoying because even though he is trying to teach, its more like bragging and is not very interesting. Everything you learn in this class comes from the textbook.",1
"Mrs. Sexton is a good teacher, she knows her material. Her test are pretty hard . She gives several quizzes and projects throughout the semester, but nothing to bad. Just make sure you study and know the material !",1
You must come to class! He takes attendance at random. His class is SO boring and all he does is show videos. I learned nothing in his class but passed with a A simply because he only had 2 finals and they were both take home essays.,0
She was all over the place!,0
"Really nice guy but so confusing, especially when it comes to math.  Sometimes he does experiments which do cover concepts much better than the way he covers the math. BUT there is so much you have to learn on your own, including more concepts. To be fair he does go over things in lecture that end up on the test.",1
"Take Harris!  He is so nice and tests are generally pretty easy--he always tells you exactly what is on them so if you don't study that is your fault.  Not an extremely easy A, you need to put some effort in but a little will go a long way.",1
"Professor Hess is really sweet/fun (has a MAJOR shoe fetish) Although I did well in her class, she's a bit of a scatter brain (unorganized & forgets alot; complains about having too many papers to read/grade. Overall, I wouldn't say I learned much in her class. Basically, if you get decent grades on compositons & exams, her class will be a breeze.",1
She likes the whole new-agey interactive teach each other type of style. The rare times she lectured she was wonderful (VERY charismatic) but it's mostly group work. Lots of test questions end up hinging on technicalities or her interpretation but don't panic. PARTICIPATE and  demonstrate you know what you're talking about and grades will follow.,1
"Dude's a walking meme, love it.",1
"Pretty easy class overall but the content can be confusing at times. He lectures well but goes really really fast which was frustrating but he posts all the lectures so that helps out. His exams are short answer but the study guides are pretty straight forward. Nice guy, willing to help you if you need it. I would take another one of his classes. ",1
"Ms. Gronlund is an okay professor. Her quizzes are not hard if you do the objectives. You work in this class for the grade you want. If you don't like to read don't take this class because you will read almost the entire book to answer objectives. She assigns work for every chapter, a paper, one recipe project, midterm & final. Overall study & pass",1
very optimistic professor concerning your ability. she is willing to answer your questions without you feeling stupid. The only thing I did not like was the school splitting her between two classes. Hopefully they will realize how harmful it is to the student as well as the professor. I learned so much from her.,1
"She's a hard professor but she is one of the few that will truly give you the education you pay for, She is respectful, does not like bad language in the classroom, this is a class you DO NOT want/should miss!  I've taken her twice and have received good grades but it was all hard earned, by far one of my favorite professors.",1
He moved from Hofstra to NCC for anyone who is confused. He was amazing! At first I considered dropping him but I'm so glad I stuck with it. He's such a sweet man who cares about his students and is VERY passionate. Only grades are midtem&final plus some extra credit opportunities. I got a C+ on the midterm but ended up with an A in the class.,1
"Waxler is very passionate about his area in study, but he is also very boring, I found myself falling asleep in class. We had a quiz once a week, very easy 5 points, just read the stories he assigns and they were actually very intersting. He goes on even when class is overy probably 5 minutes after. He says class in mandatory but i never went.",1
"The class isn't that bad but it'll put you to sleep. She speaks very slowly about very boring things. There are a ton of quizzes over really boring readings but she's a nice professor, if a bit long winded. ",1
"A pretty awful professor (her lectures/powerpoints do not focus on what is on the exam at all -- it's like you're taking an exam for a different class). Goes on tangents about the importance of not being stressed but just stresses you out. After we went online due to virus, she completely abandoned the class and only did weekly ""check-ins.""",0
"I love Landrum. He is such a great teacher. As long as you read the short stories and take great notes, you'll do fine. He gets really passionate about the subject and he makes it interesting to keep showing up and listening. I looked forward to his class. I am actually taking him again for 373 a film criticism class and I am excited.",1
very tough grader. She knows the material but doesn't know how to teach it to the students at all. Not very helpful when it comes to exams. Her exams are impossible to pass with a a decent grade.,0
"Tests are super hard, but if you go to class and she knows your name, she will help you out. She's always willing to meet outside of class and explain things to you. Her accent can be tough to understand, but she is SO EXCITED about teaching multi. Her knowledge of math is like way beyond multi, so sometimes she forgets how to explain things simply",1
"Took Professor Riley's 9-week course, it was a really good class. Learned a lot about computer parts and there's are hands-on Labs that you have to do with a partner. The class was easy and Mr. Riley is willing to help out if you don't have any experience with computer parts. Highly recommend him!",1
Makes lessons funny and personable,1
"Great professor.  500/510 were great classes.  A lot of work is required, but it is not difficult.  I would definitely take classes with her again.",1
"Worst class I ever took in college. PLEASE FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE. This class is a waste of time and money. She has no reviews, the practice quizzes have nothing to do with the real quizzes, and she deducts points off your labs for no reason.",0
"good teacher, easy to talk with, fast and fair marker.",1
"Jill is the best prof I've ever had! She's the kind of prof who tells anecdotes and jokes to add to the lessons, posts all slides and recordings online, and she knows what sections people find boring so she comes up with new fun ways to teach them. Her tests are extremely fair, all MC with one SA. Definitely take every course you can with her.",1
"Dr. Xing was a great professor- I was a visiting student and took her class this summer and she was extremely helpful and accommodating. I would go to her with questions on the homework and she would always help a lot, her tests are very fair. Put in the work and go to her office hours often and you will do fine!",1
Good at explaining mathematic concepts,1
He talks A LOT.... but class is simple. Participation definitely matters. You work with him hell work with you. Come to every class.,1
"I took him for both 301 and 311 and it really is a self taught class to a point. His teaching occurs when he goes over the HW in class. If you don't understand, just speak up and he will explain it until you get it. His anecdotes about his history in the business make the class very entertaining. Good class to take.",1
She was number one Adobe Professor in the world.,1
"Perov is the absolute best physics professor at Suffolk University. His accent is hard to understand at times, but he is a kind, caring, old Russian man, who just really wants you to succeed. To pass his classes you actually have to try. There is a daily group quiz ( if you pay attention to his lectures you'll 100% always get it right).",1
Dr. Vohs is a very fair and great teacher. His class is very interesting and his tests are not bad at all as long as you take notes. he is definitly the chem professor to take,1
"I strongly disliked his class. It was super expensive ($40 textbooks for one or two classes). It was confusing and seemed to have no relation to the real world. I know less about political participation in the US now after taking this class, than I did before. But now I know a bunch of useless models of voter turnout.",0
"The worst experience ever. She doesnt help at all, you ask her a question,  What does your book say? Will be her response. The amount of work expected is excessive. Please save yourself the time and pick another professor. She expects you to know 8 chapters worth of material for her tests, no multiple choice questions either. Just horrible!",0
"he definitely knows nothing about teaching a class!!! his class is no use at all, and the lecture is just reading from the material. never teaches anything useful, the lecture and the homework and quiz has nothing related!!! definitely do not take his class ever and ever!!!! the worst teacher in this University!!!",0
Worst math class ever! Goes over material too fast. Before you get one thing done he is already starting another.,0
"Taking a class with Dr. De Vos is like being held hostage by a narcissist. He only likes to lecture on Freud, Buddhism and himself. Work on the study guide during the lecture and you should do ok.",0
Mr. Hafey is a great professor. I have never been good in math and he makes sure you fully understand and even teaches different way for those of us with ADD. If you ever have the opportunity to have him as a professor make sure you sign up for his class.,1
"She's an extremely flexible and understanding professor in terms of accommodating the students. As long as you make sure to communicate with her, you are sure to pass the class with a good grade. On top of that she's very enthusiastic and jovial about her lectures which keeps it from getting boring.",1
all i can say is GPA booster :D,1
"Garyen is overall a nice prof that tries to do his best in an online setting. Though, if you're expecting anything beyond going over simple questions on the quizzes/midterms then you should probably look elsewhere. To do well, read the textbook, memorize diagrams, and get used to his wording on quizzes.",1
"In a creative writing class, she is a really good professor albeit stubborn and at times rude. She knows the craft very well and she does a good job engaging with your poetry in a meaningful, helpful manner. However, as a teacher she is a bit disorganized and can be a harsh grader. If you are not on top of your work, do not take her.",1
Super easy 5 week summer class. Discussion Boards and quizzes are very easy.,1
"Professor LeFlouria is awesome! She helps you with your essays, she engages the class during her lectures and she shows interesting documentaries on the time period. You have to study but this professor is one of the best I've had so far at FAU!",1
Greatest professor I ever had!,1
"One of the best professors I've ever taken at ccc. She really cares about you and if you put in the effort she most likely will give you a good grade. The one thing I will never forget is ""BUMPERS UP!"" This class was so much fun on Mondays. Wednesdays not so much on account of the teacher who's a doctor is very arrogant, and  is there for the money",1

He is so nice.,1
"Not a bad guy, he's at times humorous and obviously passionate about what he does. That said, NOT the professor to take if you are not a math major. His accent and writing can make him hard to follow, particularly at the pace he goes through material. He had a hard time conveying the material to most of my class. Over 50% dropped, more failed...",0
"An amazing professor, she is so sweet and funny. Clicker question daily for attendance. Weekly chapter quizzes. Her lectures are great I love her",1
"Diane was a great prof, she is very knowledgable and her class was interesting. Her tests however as other people have stated are insane. She puts WAY too much material on them and the average was super low. Would not recommend as an option class, pick something else that isn't as heavy because you won't do well.",1

"He is a very smart guy, but I personally did not really enjoy his lecture style, he gives very long powerpoints (100+ slides) and you have a 3-4 of those for every test. He's not very good at condensing and simplifying his material. All the material on the tests are in his lecture slides, however there is a lot of material so that is not a big help",1
She is ok. She doesnt respond to emails in a timely manner. Live chats are annoying but hw otherwise is easy. Overall class was decent.,1
"At first it was boring & monotone but towards the end you notice his humor, he's really funny, I enjoyed this class and lowkey kinda miss it!",1
If your don't show your work exactly like he likes he will not give you any credit. Do not ask questions in class unless you like getting belittled in front of the class. It was a struggle for everyone in my class throughout the course and the only reason most people passed is because he curved the course at the end.,0
"Matt is one of my favorite professors at Mira Costa. He is very clear in his lectures and his powerpoint is very organized. If you need help, he will be more than happy to help. Anatomy is hard anyway so make sure you study a lot!!! If you need help, ask. If you have a question, ask. Overall, he is one of the best professors at Mira Costa College!",1
Best professor at Hostos Community College. Love her,1
I absolutely admire him so much. He's a really great guy and the class was not even that hard. All you do is do your assignments and boom you'll have a passing grade. The only thing is that there are 4 exams and you only need to pass 3/4 and they are a bit rough but you have time to prepare and you have his lectures so its time consuming but okay.,1
"Professor Miriam Keller-Perkins is a nice teacher, but she doesn't know how to teach. When I take her class, only 1 out of 7 is passing her class. She said she won't fail you if you fail all her tests or quizzes, she will give you a D ( a passing grade). If you want a better grade, I hope you don't take her class ever again.",0
"If you're scared to take stats, TAKE THIS CLASS!! Professor Herring is a sweetheart who makes every chapter approachable and easy to understand. I absolutely hated math in high school, but truly enjoyed this class. There are 10 homework assignments, 2 exams, and then the final. If you do the work, it would be hard not to pass this class.",1
"Amazing professor, great at teaching!  Fun class with a lot of personal stories that make things very clear.  I learned a lot and would certainly take another class from this professor!",1
He was a very tough grader and he was super excited for you to participate.,0
She is dedicated and kind.  She cares about her students,1
"You need to buy SIMnet for this class ($90) cause thats where all your assignments are. Its an easy class, its just a lot of work online with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. Also, the text book will help you with your tests so you should buy it!",1
i love mrs.hutton super easy to get an A if you follow the rubrics really nice and down to earth def taking another class with her!,1
"dr. lapresto knows her stuff.  if you are willing to pay attention, and open to learning, you will have no problem in her class.",1
I absolutely loved her. She truly does want her kids to succeed. Her midterm exams are fairly easy and it's possible to get over 100% if you study and do the practice exam she gives you. This class wasn't too bad as long as you did all the work required. Alex tries to be very flexible with her office hours so she's always available to help.,1

Shes an awesome teacher and helps as much as she can. Tests can be easy if you know the material. 3 exams.,1
Terrible subjective grading and do not try and bother trying to follow his feedback. He changes what he wants every week and nothing is good enough.,0
Shes a hard grader. You should go to class regularly and listen to the lectures and pay attention. Dont fall asleep in her class. Do all assignments. No extra credit. Go to office hours and get help.,1
"Good lecturer who gives clear specifications of what she wants from you. The topic was really interesting, and she taught it well.",1
I did not like this class at all. Her tests are extremely hard! You have to study every waking minute of the semester to even get a passing grade...,1
Not a fun class,0
He is a great guy. his class was made up of a few short papers and one 10 pager plus a final. He gave you ten or so essays before the final from which he picked about 3. Put it this way i've taken 200 level classes than are harder than this class and it was really interesting. ,1
I am not sure what the bad comments are about.  Ms G came in with a day's notice and tried to make a terrible class somewhat entertaining.  She is funny and doesn't read the power point slides and encourages you to think.  ,1
"I went 15 weeks and didnt even know his name, let alone what he was talking about. discussions are pointless and vague. tests, book and discussions are all so different from one another. 1 paper, midterm, final. I have no idea what I was supposed to even get out of this course. Def wasn't what i thought it was going to be. movies SUCKED.",0
Great professor. Easy on the eyes too!,1
Very kind and caring PROF. Strongly recommend her!,1
"I can honestly say I really enjoyed this class. It truly opened my eyes to the world. She has actually been and studied overseas so she knows what shes talking about when it comes to the different material we covered in class. Gives study guides that are identical to the exam, a couple writing assignments and we only had one group project. ",1
"TAKE THIS CLASS. He is very smart. If you work a little harder, you'll get a better grade. Besides you'll learn things you might really want to know(aside from academic concerns)",1
"There's a reason why this class was still available to add a day before school started! Constantly passive aggressive and will talk down on you. Semi easy, but it wasn't a fun semester at all. Creates a bad environment for writing stories. No talking to classmates, no music, no fun. If you like journalism, go somewhere else.",0
"Excellent Teacher! Knowledgable, easily approachable with a awesome sense of humor. Gives you every possible opportunity to pass. Honestly, you'd have to be a lazy dolt to fail.",1
"If you want a job in journalism, take this class and talk with Marty regularly.  She will teach you the things you need to know to succeed as a journalist...and she will work her butt off if you are one of her best students and show a real effort.",1
"He gives a few opportunities to earn extra credit. Definitely be sure to do them. Tests are difficult but he does provide study guides and class notes. It's a hard class, but he does his best to help you out.",1
"Sheryl is VERY CARING! I left my sunglasses in her class room after hours and could not return that evening. She went back & got them for me! Sheryl gives her students chances to pass her class if she sees that they are trying. Be prepared to do RESEARCH papers, take quizzes each week, READ a lot. She helps students better understand the course!:)",1
BEST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.,1
"If you enjoy reading, take this course. It is a book a week plus projects.",1
"Professor Shively is super sweet and is willing to answer any questions you might have. Even if it's after class or during her office hours, she'll help you with anything. She has notes that you can follow along with in class and all of the notes are on D2L as well. Tests aren't too hard if you follow the notes and she doesn't take attendance.",1
"If you are taking Trigonometry with Prof. Gaworecki, then get ready to spend most of the semester focusing solely on Trig. You will have to keep up with her during lectures and she hands out pop quizzes every other day. (I would recommend studying the homework before class in order to not fail the pop quizzes.) Study weeks before the exams to pass.",0
I took this class online and I don't regret it. There's a lot of writing but the assignments are super easy. It's an easy online class and a stress-free class. This class can also boost your GPA. Take this class if you have the chance.,1
Cool!,1
"Awesome teacher. Really makes you think twice about how your living your life. Class is easy as well as the tests but you learn more from him than any other professor you'll ever have. One paper, five review guides and a presentation are due but easy A if all handed in on time and attend class.",1
Dr. Tulin is a very intelligent and knowledgeable man. I took his Law and Pol class and I  can honestly say it was one of my best classes. Dr. Tulin sometimes talks about topics that are not related to the lecture material but are enlightening.  Be ready to take good notes in his class because tests comes out from lecture material.,1
Delius is an amazing and kind professor! She is very knowledgeable and good at making the class fun for students. She adapts the course based on feedback and will talk about recent developments. One test and two papersharder than expected because she's so nice but if you work hard you'll do well. Participation is worth a lot of the grade.,1
"He's amazing. I always loved going to his lectures and had fun. He would always crack jokes during the lectures, and he would let us use our notes for the test and the final. I would honestly retake his class for fun.",1
This was a very easy online class. Just remember the due dates and you'll be fine. A lot of the exam questions come from the book so you will use it.,1
Always late to class doesn't teache you hands on . You can't walk out the class without him even knowing,0
I have taken this professor for all 3 of my science classes for nursing. Since thats what Im majoring in. She is very caring and easy. I am glad I have taken her for all those classes she makes the material easy to understand.,1
"good prof. watch his lectures read the textbook and youll pass, quizes are shortly times so you will have to work fast!! the rest was pretty solid .",1
"SHE'S AMAZING! I'm taking her for winter 2016(2 days left). By far the best English teacher I've ever had! Not only is she supper clear about what she wants, she willing to help!! She helps broaden your horizon! ENROLL IN HER CLASS!!!!! I PROMISE YOU'LL LOVE HER!!!!",1
Pretty easy class if you go and do your work on time. Make sure you do your outlines right and be there on the day of your speech.,1
She grades so hard and is useless. Terrible class and terrible teacher.,0
"She also teaches at AMU. She is Very knowledgeable and seems to care a lot about her students succeeding in her class. She promptly responses to messages and grades papers quickly. Overall, she's a fair grader and has a sense of humor!",1
Great teacher and lecturer.  Makes class very interesting and plays alot of relevant videos to keep attention.  I genuinely enjoyed the topic.  It is not an easy A by any means though.  Paper was graded very harsh and the exams are sometimes hard to prepare for.  I enjoyed every class and never missed a lecture.,1
"Focuses on what the student(s) want; gives great, helpful feedback; efficient teaching style. Just be yourself and everything will be fine, and probably kind of funny.",1
"If rate my professor would allow me to give this woman a 0, I would. Horribly rude and disrespectful. She is one of the most unreasonable people I have ever dealt with in my entire life. The final was nothing we ever learned in class so good luck.",0
"Had Mook for both Dynamics and Dynamic systems. Probably the most helpful professor I've had, but he does make you work for your grades -- quizzes at random, and at least one per topic. Honestly wish he taught more of the higher level courses, but that would just make it too easy.  TL;DR: Show up to class, ask questions when lost, get A. ",1
Writes in-depth comments on written work.,1
"Had her as a TA. Was not enthusiastic, constantly has an attitude, and is not helpful. Seems to want to get through the lab as quick as possible, and has high expectations for students that she can't live up to herself.",0
"Knows her stuff as far as English goes, but makes a few too many assumptions about other things. If you have a passion for the intricacies of English, more power to you, but not everyone feels this way and often times this class that you'll fail for a couple absences is a waste of time that could be spent on the unclear papers she has you write.",0
"Great professor. Best math teaching experience ever. I actually got an A in Math . Just make sure to attend all classes, do the assignments and reach out to him if you have any issues.",1
He is an amazing teacher and his class is an easy A if you keep up and do the work,1
"Professor Hahn is all around a good teacher. She has a bit of an accent, but after a couple of classes you can understand pretty much every word. She is funny, which makes lectures much more enjoyable. The homework is long but she will push some of it back if the class thinks it's too much. Tests can be tough but aren't bad.",1
"Very respectable professor. Although can be seen as a strict and rude professor at times, he really wants to help you if you want to help yourself. Course contents are very beneficial for graduate studies if planning to do so.",1
"Tammy was a great instructor to have for MKTG 360. She doesnt use the textbook to save her students money. Lectures are very short and normally last 30-45minutes. There are 10-15 applied assignments which just get annoying after a while, but drive home the information from her lecture (10-20min a piece). Overall, great professor and easy class.",1
"She is very hard to understand. She uses powerpoint, but I think she just photocopies the pages out of the book because it is exactly the same. She doesn't explain anything and acts like she doesn't understand what you are trying to ask if you have a question. Most of the people in my class were completely lost the entire semester.",0
"Awesome teacher! Mr. Hogan's lessons were very informative, and he was very patient. I highly recommend his classes. He is an amazing guitarist!",1
One of the best at Del Mar!,1
"TAKE HER CLASS!!! Easy class, great professor, take notes it will help you a lot, only 4 papers to write, no exams/tests. Would take her class again, class was fun and not boring and she is really sweet and cares about students passing.",1
Had the chance to take Political Science with Professor Montero. She can be intimidating but really knows the material. She cares about the students and tries to relate the material to current events. Great professor.,1
Dr. Lewis is THE MAN. I didn't even know how to open Microsoft word when I took the class and now I can write elaborate video games! This class changed my life! Dr. Lewis is my hero.,1
"One of the best professors I have had in my college career.  I learned so much about all different aspects of film. We didn't just watch movies the entire class, but would watch scenes and dissect them as a class, very helpful.  Be prepared to participate. I may even retake Intro to Film because he is teaching it this time and I know Ill learn alot",1
"Very in depth class. Gives positive feedback. Great hair, beautiful eyes and his backside aint too shabby either!",1
Textbook is good study/practice aid but not mandatory. Grade consists of 4 unit exams only. Beware!!! Needed class for major but difficult. one mistake can ruin your chances.,1
He is one of the best professors at SLU. Take him if you ever get the chance.,1
This class was hard only 3 tests which count for 90% of your grade. My advice for any students interested in majoring in business stay away from buiness adminstration if you are not good in certain class,0
"Very good teacher, gives ALOT of work though. As long as you work and work hard you will be ok. Answers emails fast and is helpfull",1
A hard teacher.. the assistant chair for history.. I believe he will be off fall 2007 but makes you learn!,1
"I thought this was a very difficult class-I managed to get a C but was afraid of an F. He seems to be a good teacher, kind of quick, but the material itself I just had a hard time with. Attendance is not mandatory, but I def recommend it because he covers a lot in a day.",1
People say all you have to do is read from the notes and you will do fine on the homework and tests. You do realize his notes are excessively long and tedious to read? He also assigns some huge project which takes forever to do.,0
Her grading is out of three exams only. She does give e.c. but she is very strict on the way she wants it. It's her way or the highway. The first few e.c. assignments majority of the class received no credit. Attendance is mandatory and no phones allowed. Doesn't return exams. Btw 365 is based more on marriage counseling than family psych.,0
Great course. Very knowledgable professor.,1
WARNING!Only take him if you really want to know how to conduct research and are VERY interested in the technicalities. Otherwise you will not fair well! There is a lot to absorb and do in a short time. Lots of busy work.,1
Pretty good prof.  Knows her stuff and tries to hold fairly deep dicussions in class.  Be ready to read for her b/c she assigns half a novel each week.  Tests are a joke b/c grading is very easy.  Take her if you can take 3 hour classes.  Sometimes boring,1
"Although intimidating in the beginning, Swartz is probably the nicest professor at daemen once you get to know him.  He helped me not only with the material, but also with some personal problems too.  Made it abundantly clear that he was there for me if I needed him.  He's SO helpful during office hours so ask him questions!  Love him he's the best",1
Best Accounting Instructor hands down in Fresno. Look no further. Tests were straight forward.,1
Professor Qualls is the greatest professor you will ever encounter. He may grade a little more harshly than most professors but it HELPS so much and he is always willing to discuss your work with you. Great guy.,1
Extremely helpful. Her main goal is to make sure her students know the work.  Will go the extra mile for you.  If you do a paper wrong she will send it back and explain what the problem is and allow you to resubmit it correctly (with a slight penalty). Her main goal is not the grade but did you learn the material and will go out of her way to make ,1
Outstanding professor. Explains materials very clearly. Lots of fun exercises. Makes class fun. Participation & Attendance are a must. ,1
"Prof Hallett is not a bad professor, but she isn't kind. She's a bit rude and will often project her anger onto her students. The class is heavy is SPSS. There was a medium-difficulty assignment due every week. Her video lectures were actually very helpful especially with COVID going on.",1
"Easiest professor ever. 1/3 of your grade is quizzes which are easy if you skim through the chapters, 1/3 is attendance which now you only have to go 6 times a semester, and 1/3 is the final which is now a 4-6 page paper with 6-10 slides outlining the paper that you can work on with 1-2 other people. Take this class with a difficult class.",1
Please do not take this class.  She is the worst!!! The information in the text book was slightly used in class!,0
"Took class online during summer session. Discussions were very easy. Two essays were required outside of the discussions. Start essays early because he expects A LOT from you! Make sure to follow guidelines on essays. Other than that, pretty easy class.",1
Stanley Walling is an asset to any student. He genuinely wants to see his students succeed!,1
"easy but his structure of the class is confusing and unorganized. you literally are completing online h/w course on your own, it grades you automatically. Due dates to assignments were all over the place and he made it difficult to find them and just wants to look at the syllabus. Theres more to teaching than stating to look at the syllabus.",0
"Save your time and money. This was the worst chem 1 class I've ever taken. from the lectures to examples she just does for you. You don't have a chance to really Learn the material. The homework is online, not very useful and takes time. its expected you know everything before you walk through the door. You can fail, even if going everyday",0
"He is a very enthusiastic professor and shows that he enjoys what he's doing. Reading the textbook, asking questions, paying visits to his office, and writing everything you possibly can on your midterms and finals will help you out tremendously in his class.",1
Amazing teacher! Explains everything and is very enthusiastic about History. He's so nice and as long as you go to class and take notes you'll be good. You'll do good on the tests as long as you thoroughly describe everything.,1
"Very cool guy, very humble, knows his****, has two masters and a bachelors degree. definitly wayyyy better the Mr.Norris",1
This is a pretty easy class as long as you keep up with the work and participate in class,1
"Had my reservations about him prior, but this was the best class I had.  I heard he may teach other classes poorly but insurance is his wheelhouse.  He is undoubtedly an insurance super expert.  I learned an incredible amount.  Tests were not impossible but challenging.  I got all A's.  This class was for 3 hours long and in no way was boring.",1
"Professor ChinooThaGod is one of the best professors at John Jay. He offers extra credit, 1 midterm paper and 1 final paper, he really makes learning about Pokémon easy.",1
I am generally a very competent student; I have done well with my classes up till now. Ams just does a terrible job explaining things in class. He makes frequent mistakes in lectures. He is very unsympathetic to students who struggle and made me feel like an idiot at office hours. My classmates tell me that he is very unavailable for them.,0

"Unless you're someone who likes to regurgitate the class discussion in your assignments, don't take Camp. He doesn't allow research or information learned outside of his class; if he didn't say it, he won't grade it fairly. Nice enough guy, but god-awful teacher.",0
"Don't expect to know your grade ever. He is usually all over the the place and always cancels class. He grunts a lot too. But if you are struggling, he will help you, but only if you ask him for it. He gives a lot of extra credit though.",0
"Great teacher, helped me understand it all.",1
"very good professor, very helpful if you ask for help she will help. attendance is mandatory!",1
The homework itself is easy even though theres a lot. Just pay attention to due dates. Also quizlet has basically all the answers. Final and tests are online and not in lockdown browser. Easy A. The assignments that she grades can be biased however if your opinion doesnt match hers. She gave me a B on a writing assignment that shouldve been an A,1
Hard Class like reallllly hard. Mrs. Sharon is a respectable teacher. yes you have to work for it but she will help you along the way. ,1
"She is the most amazing professor that you will find at Sheridan. Her energy is so positive and she makes you want to go to class. She makes herself available to all her students and helps them succeed in class in their own ways! She takes any and all feedback, passing on information to her superiors that will help the students learn better.",1
"She is very helpfull, fair, smart. She always answers questions. I didn't know Chemistry but I learned from her a lot. She is good professor.",1
"I don't know what these people are talking about, saying she's a bad teacher.. I love Dr. McCartney! She definitely gives a lot of work (especially to the honors class) but she'll help whenever needed. She's very friendly and makes the class go by fast. I recommend this class if you're not afraid of writing papers!",1
"Angie is a good instructor, nice, funny, and helpful. Her lectures are a little confusing, and unorganized. Expectations are not always clear. That is really frustrating. Her knowledge on the topics taught are questionable. But her class is easy to navigate if you are organized in a way to make up for her lack of organization and self driven.",1
She is from Mexico and really knows her stuff! Very nice and helps everyone understand the language. Lots of practice options too.,1
He was terrible.  He refused to help students and when he did he was very vague and just confusing.  ,0
She's a great teacher. She is willing to go out her way to help you understand the notes. She loves when we ask her questions. She loves her history. ,1
"Chem 2 is harder than chem 1, but it's better with Dr. Evans. So long as you do all of the suggested book work in addition to in class problems and online homework, Dr. Evans will also put in the work to help you in return. Some people think he's unorganized, but he forgives your mistakes if you forgive his. Empathetic and approachable, also cool.",1
Maybe he is a better teacher in person but I have learned very little from this online course. Some problems are explained through videos but many of the videos are extremely confusing and unhelpful. Plus $80 for mandatory WebAssign membership even though the point of City College is to be free/cheap and accessible to all. Worst online course imo,0
"As much as I enjoyed the class, and yes he is a good instructor, he talks about his students pretty badly. Saying they choose wrong career paths, etc. Not to the class but to other profs. Also seems a bit off, but you will pass if you do mediocre work.",1
he is a very helpful teacher. he is funny too! before he give you quizes he will give the answers right before the test. if you make a bad grade on one of your papers he will let you revise it to get a better grade. very easy teacher!!!,1
"Ngl, it was hard to pay attention in lecture and a lot of us students had to teach ourselves. So if you're good at that, then you'll be fine. That being said, she is genuinely such a nice prof and wants her students to do well: makes time for you outside class, gives marks in other places (group quizzes), provides extra online resources, etc.",1
"Ali Asgary is an amazing professor! He is a very helpful professor and his instructions are crystal clear. Attendance is mandatory, textbook use is medium, but his course was definitley worthwhile. Ali get's an A+ for eing a damn good professor.",1

Mr. Hogan is THE MAN! We are so lucky to have him at this school. I liked the last guitar teacher I had here at FSCJ although I honestly didn't really learn much from him. Hogan is an unbelievable teacher and player. Highly recommended. ,1
"I will never again take this teacher again. Yes he sounds positive and I can tell he has passion for his teachings. BUT he canceled his class TWICE!!! YES TWICE!! (One for a whole week, and did I tell you? This was on a mid term week.) This professor has the audacity to go to JAPAN on our mid term week. I wish to God i have more characters to writ",0
"Dr. Kunz is by far the best professor, psych or otherwise, I've ever had. The class is super interesting and he is hilarious; which helps. The tests are pretty straightforward as long as you go to class and take good notes. Excellent dude, fun class; a must take! Plus he's hot.",1
Paige is super caring and really wants her students to succeed. My biggest problem with her is she is a very slow grader. You won't know your grade in the course until the school posts it. Overall the class isn't hard but it is writing heavy.,1
Terrible! Completely chaotic class meetings. Discussions are not guided. Most unpleasant class meetings I've experienced. Expectations unclear. Opportunities to excel are few. Just take something else instead.,0
"Her lectures are somewhat interesting, but can be rather boring at times.  She is usually very disorganized and sometimes tells you something and then forgets that she told you.  She is very caring, though, and wants her students to do well.  At times she is not very clear with her feedback on your work and exactly what she expects from you.",0
Awesome teacher!! Cares about the students(which is rare nowadays). Goes out of her way and expects nothing more than what she puts into it. Take this class if you have the chance.,1
"Good instructor. Very thorough grader but always on point in class.  He provides lots a very detailed feedback and the course is well organized. Dont get me wrong, its a lot of work, but I learned something. Follow directions, read and ask for help if you need it. Stagg was always willing to help anytime I asked.",1
Hawks is the platform used to teach math from module 1 till 11. This class is COMPLETELY self taught. The test grades very precise so if you dont answer the question in the format they want you 2 you will get the entire question wrong. Prof Hunter was great. He is willing to help if you need that extra push. But you have to put in your OWN WORK.,1
Makes it incredibly difficult to understand your own grade. Not a clear grader. Incredibly picky on tests.,0
"I took her for Psychology of Gender in class. She is very unorganized, she can not keep up with lectures, does not keep up with assignments that are coming up. I understand it's our responsibility to look, but she doesn't instruct how she wants it done, until you do it and gets mad because its not the way she wants it. I do not recommend her!",0
His class is realistically a 10 credits class worth of work.  So be prepared...,0
"This was my only professor using non-synchronous meetings; meaning I could watch the recordings on my own time, at my own pace. He did a wonderful job making the lectures fun and easy to understand. Just a bit of studying and a solid understanding of the material make this class an ""easy A"" with this professor. Wonderful prof choice.",1
"Dr. Aguilar is great would definitely take her again, i did a maymester and almost die. Papers are very overwhelming because there is one due every day or so it feels like it. But she is very helpful and was you to succeed.",1
"I did not enjoy his class at all. The lectures are extremely boring and vague. He doesn't give many assignments but when he does, he grades them toughly. So if you do take this class, I recommend putting lots of detail into your papers. Also the mid term and final are 50 min and difficult and out of 54 people, 2 got an A on the midterm. Good luck!",0
"His topics are interesting. Sometimes, they're off topic but they're related to the subj. His explanations are well-thought of. He is kind, active, energetic, helpful, versatile, and engaged student learning. He also participates in learning w/ students. He comes to class five minutes late. He provides assignments today then quizzes the next day.",1
Dra. Hess is extremely friendly and her tests are very easy. her students' success is a big concern for her.,1
Lisa is great! She works so hard to make sure that every activity in class runs smoothly. She is really easy to get a hold of and she is so passionate when she lecturers. Participation is critical to the class though but she lectures are great. Its a great class!,1
I took this class over the summer and Dr. Raney did a good job of sparking interest and making the class fun. She is very helpful and really cares about her students succeeding. I look forward to taking another class with her!,1
"Tove isn't very clear during her lectures and when you ask a question she gets easily confused and makes it ten times worse. The lectures are long and dry. She's an easy grader though, but just be prepared to teach yourself.",0
Great teacher!,1
Dr. Vohs is a great teacher. He does his best to explain concepts and make chem easy to understand. His tests are reasonable. He is definately the chem teacher to take,1
"Great professor, class is easy if you know what you are doing and doesn't require much work, but at the same time she provides plenty of workshops and points to receive feedback to make sure your grade is as good as it can be.",1
Awesome professor. Make class fun and easy to learn. Be on time to class as she like to give quizzes for extra credit; which you will need. Go over her slides and the book.,1
"The topics of her classes are very interesting but I feel as if I had not learned anything at all. Her lectures are very disorganized, she expects you to read more or less about 00 pages before every class time, and she gives confusing and unclear answers to questions. If her classes are not mandatory, I strongly recommend that you not take them.",0
"She would try to engage the class, but I don't think teaching is her strong point. The online Cengage program is ridiculous, the textbook reads like it's catered towards high schoolers, but the material in the exams online is nothing like what we learned. I barely passed them, despite having a strong interest and background in abnormal psychology.",0
"AMAZING. Made accounting soo interesting and tries to make the subject as understanding as possible. He provided a ton of practice quizzes, and if you're willing to put in the effort, the class is easy. His lectures are super easy to follow and he is just amazing. 100% would take him again.",1
"Lisa is one of the worst professors I have ever had, hands down. I have had for a few classes now and she is a good teacher when in the classroom but her online classes are some of the worst experiences I have had at school. She is the least helpful teacher I have ever had both in and out of the classroom.",0
"I took Kelson for A&P 1 and he is now my favorite professor at STCC. Hes very passionate about A&P and always ready to answer questions. The class was a lot of work, so if youre not ready to put the effort in do not take it. I personally loved the course, labs were really interesting. Tests were very challenging, but Kelson prepares you for them.",1
"He is really nice and loves his subject. He tries to make class fun and is always making jokes. He is tough when it comes to grading papers but you only have to write two. His tests are pretty easy, you get a cheat sheet, but they are all short answer.",1
Best teacher I have had at Fresno State. She cares so much about her students. She tries her best to help each student understand the topics. She also gives extra credit the next class day after each exam which helps a lot. DO ALL the extra credit it will help you in the end when the tests get harder. I wish she taught more accounting classes!,1
She will make you work for your grade. She curves her exams and offers lots of extra credit only because majority don't do well on her exams.,1
this class was ridiculously easy he cancelled class often and it was tons of fun! plus hes a really really funny guy. if you want this class to learn dont take him but if you want an easy and fun class hes the best to take!!!!,1
"Started on campus, was very lecture heavy, speaking almost entirely in French from day one. Transitioned to an online course (Covid) and the lectures/teaching stopped for the most part. Zoom sessions were mainly review for what you learned on your own with VHL/HW. Offers little to no help outside of the classroom. Don't recommend.",0
"Professor Qualls is great! He is a tough grader, but he is very friendly and more than willing to help outside of class. I recommend having him look at early drafts of papers before submitting the final draft. He makes you think in his class, not just absorb information.",1
"I have never studied harder for any class I have ever had. This class was honestly harder than ACTG one and two combined. Regardless professor Sarver was still a fine instructor of this very difficult subject. I took this remote class so I was able to rewatch any lecture I needed to. Personally, I wouldn't take him on campus.",1
Very rude to her students and does not respect them. She does not care about the success of her students.,0
The best professor I have ever had the experience of  learning from. I highly endorse any topic he teaches. MT should clone this guy.,1
"I took Anthropology and Film, in a past semester, didn't remember the course number, sorry! Anyways, Professor Birx is everything higher education needs: a teacher who cares about his students, incorporates a wide mixture of viewpoints, and thoughtfully prepares the course.",1
Very interesting class. Watch movies and turn in a weekly paper. Easy A if you're looking for an elective. No text book required.,1
"She is a wonderful professor! Tough love is her way, she does not appreciate slackers and will push you in the right direction every time to improve your work! I would recommend her to anyone and I will have her on my thesis committee for sure!",1
"Mattson is one of Suny'sbest professors. He likes to talk, but he knows his stuff. I took Vietnam history and thought his class was interesting. I left learning a lot about the subject. I Thought he was so great, that I took other classes with him.His tests are fair and he mostly gives take home papers.",1
Love her! Great professor.,1
I absolutely loved her Personal Fitness class. She was never boring and made the class fun for us. Had a few workout activities to do but I enjoyed it. She really influenced me when it came to exercise and living a healthy lifestyle. I would definitely take her again in a heartbeat. She's great!,1
"Professor Hinshaw is a genius!! He knows so much nformation, he can answer everything and give examples of studies for EVERYTHING! The midterms are tough since there is so much material, he expects a lot but he's an awesome professor!!",1
"Professor Perez is a solid instructor. She can be a little snappy sometimes, but she means well. She's tough on attendance and gives minimal but easy hmwk assignments. She also gives extra credit opportunities. Her exams are all info from the slides she lectures in class. Show up, take notes, ask questions (when needed) and you'll do fine.",1
Challenging but rewarding class. She is very passionate about animation. Shows animated films during class which are very entertaining. If you love to draw this is the class for you!,1
"He grades fairly easy.  Near the end of the semester he offers an opportunity to make up for any missed work and gives you full credit.  In addition, he gives plenty of chances to do extra credit. So,it's pretty hard to not pass his class.",1
Great professor in class quiz and final are super easy if you do the readings however online quizes were quite difficult at times and essay was hard seeing as I am not a philosophy major most essays are informational but this one is more argument based,1
She was so fun and made class very interesting even at 8 am. She wants you to do well and there's no reason that you should get below a B in her class. She keeps it interesting and as long as you talk a lot with the class she's happy!,1
He loves participation in online discussions. As long as you do the assignments on time youll get an A. He responds to emails quickly. Not a hard class. All the answers to the assignments are in the book and in the learning objectives.,1
Attendance is mandatory and Parkhurst.  He is a hardass in class with a dry sense of humor but he truly cares. His class had a bit of reading but not bad. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS for every paper he gives great feed back! I promise he isn't that scary!,1
"Dr. Cornish is honestly one of the best professors at UNI. She is SO caring and understanding. She really takes the time to get to know her students. Her classes are not challenging, come to class and you are fine. Even if you don't come to class read some material you'll be fine. I could talk about how wonderful she is all day. You will LOVE her",1
class a waste of time. Didn't use textbooks or discuss readings. Allowed some students to monopolize class w/inane diatribe. Did not give constructive criticism on assisnments. Wasted too much class time for group project instead of teaching. I learned nothing from sitting in her class....would recc a different professor.,0
"The WORST Math teacher I have ever had. Highly not recommended if you want to pass the class and not destroy your GPA. Do not answer questions clearly. I felt like a prealgebra student in a Calculus class, will take points off if you skip steps that you are supposed to master. Also, imposes you how to write ( printed and not cursive).",0
DO NOT take Nicastro unless you absolutely have to. He knows his stuff but is horrible in actually iterating it to his students. And don't get me started on his tests. They are a significant step up in difficulty from the homework. His finals are worse. Not to mention he reprimand us ons a daily basis for not understanding concepts (it's that bad),0
"Has a great personality. Wants his students to do well, wants student to participate in lecture. Makes sure everyone understands the information and is available for help outside the classroom. Tests require memorization and final is cumulative. Easy A, would not take economics with anyone else.",1
"Easy material, however, she makes sure that if she doesnt like you that you will not pass.  Cannot pass class if you miss ANY homework assignments.",1
"One of the best profs I've had in my year and a half at school. Comes off scary first class or two, but you will learn a ton. Provides good feedback, if you ask the right questions. Lab helps reinforce lecture material. Has no problem talking to you outside of class, as he is at school for the majority of the day. Throws a couple extra credits in.",1
"She's not a bad teacher exactly, but she isn't clear on what she wants. She does cancel class sometimes and isn't specific about what answers she wants on exams. I think I'm doing well in the class, but she's very hot and cold depending on the day. There are only a few writing assignments, but the exams are difficult. Participate and it's fine!",0
"I liked Michelfelder a lot, although i skipped class a time or two it didn't matter because she puts the Powerpoints on blackboard. Also she replaces your attendance percentage with your lowest test grade so go to class!",1
thinks hes the smartest person in the world and perhaps he is. he just isnt that great of a teacher and doesnt seem so interested in students opinions. grading very arbitrary,0
Easy A,1
No for this professor.,0
"Prof Roberts' class changed the way I think about the world. I'm not an Anthro major, but I've still found myself using the ideas from this class throughout college. Take it if you get the chance!",1
"She makes deal out of everything. she say she'll help but takes forever to reply her e-mail.when class  is done she only worries about leaving the class, and when you ask for personal attention she only assumes that you werent paying attention in class and denies to help. avoid being related with this person in any causes",0
"I slacked off this sem big time, so it was difficult for me. If you arrive to ea. lecture, take good notes, study in a distributive manner, prepare for the short essays he gives beforehand, then you can get an A. Although his lecture material sufficed for the exams, still read the book, it'll help.",1
"Dr. Brown has a very different approach to teaching when you get out of the entry level 110/116 course.  I enjoyed 211 and anytime someone had a question, he was willing to help.  He runs a mock ""business"" to give students a glimpse of the working world, but nothing the average student can't handle.",1
Learned a ton from this professor! Did a lot of writing for him but I got a lot out of his class in exchange. He's very helpful during the writing process and alway's available for students. I started graduate school lacking some confidence but after taking his class I feel set up for success in the rest of my classes. Thank you!,1
"Disorganized, boring, draconian, bad feedback, etc. Easily the worst SOC prof at Temple. Perspective: The only other prof offering this Required course has their roster fill quickly w a long waiting list while Allen has open seats. $160 for vaguely relevant books is excessive. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!",0
"His focus is on critical thinking more than writing. But that's what made it fun! Lectures can get boring but its ok for the most part. All you have to do is write 4 short essays, that you can write in a couple hours. Defintly recommend his class!",1
He is a very helpful teacher. He'll take the time to explain something if you don't get it. Plays lots of Zambardo films. Makes jokes all the time! Nice Guy! Total of 3 tests ( which came from the quizzes from each chapter) 10 question quizzes from each chapter.,1
"Great professor that offers clear guidance, good feedback, and more concerned with the content of a paper or essay.  Would not hesitate to take another class with this professor!",1
"She grades weirdly and words her questions/directions weirdly because she doesn't proof read. Also, she wants us to cite our sources but will give us a 0 on the assignments/discussion posts if we quote from them like what??? She expects you to do your own research in addition to the chapter reading for the test so you'll see q's you wont understand",0
agree great prof.,1
Funny little man.  Nice and intelligent.  I did not get the grade I wanted in his class but I didin't do much either.,1
"This class is awesome. It involves a lot of work, but nothing you cant handle. She gives lectures the whole length of the class, but they are very helpful and interesting. The group project is fun at the end of the semester and as long as you do your work and show enthusiam, you will definitley pass. I would recommend this class!",1
"Great Teacher:
 tests are straightforward and come from quizzes and handouts, no curveballs... gives alot of handouts which IS VERY USEFUL and HELPFUL...",1
"Tough class, excellent teacher. Expect to put in a lot of work for this course. An A is attainable by attending daily and doing all coursework. I will be honest, there is a lot of homework and tests can be quite difficult. This will be a breeze, however, if you are passionate about the language. Highly recommended for aspiring Russian learners!",1
Great Professor!,1
Mr. Prunty truly cares about his students and goes over and above to be helpful. I would definitely take his classes again.,1
"She has a tendency to rant or try to make the class a group therapy session, however if you go to her website and work on the test reviews in class you'll do fine on the test. She gives you an oral review right before the quiz/test with exactly what's on the quiz/test so that helps too.  Overall easy A. Do the work, show up to class, you'll be fine",1
He is a very GOOD professor! He's interesting and he is clear about what he wants on his exams. He has a very special way of teaching the material-one that captures your interest and makes you understand the material. He's great!,1
"Ray is a cool Prof and absolutely loves what he teaches, and he liked getting the class involved in discussions. Vague rubric,  sometimes too much class discussions in class which sometimes made it hard to understand what the point was.",1
"Wonderful professor and a wonderful woman! Her enthusiasm in what she was teaching kept me going through the course. If you need help, just ask for it!",1
"Amazing professor, enjoyable class.",1
"Laid-back guy. Doesn't seem to take teaching very seriously - he canceled class twice to stay home with his son and took a whole week (3 classes) off to complain about the election. He also canceled the final since he ""doesn't believe in exams"". Class is mostly discussion.  Will single out anyone w/ a different opinion, and offers trigger warnings.",0
Very knowledgeable and intellectual Prof,1
I honestly like her and her class she is very approachable and knowledgeable about her field and is willing to help students who need it. I suggest you take her if she's available. I took her for both chdv 492 and 493 and will be taking her in the fall for the 496 senior seminar class. Group projects are fine just keep up with the work,1
"Read the book and memorize and you will be fine. It was a bit of a struggle reading his book, because it went on and on, but overall he was a great professor and I learned a lot from him. He was very nice.",1
"Shes really helpful, fun learning environment, couldn't have asked for a better teacher. Main thing is to show up everyday and do all the HW.",1
"One of the smartest professors I have had at WMU. If you are a finance major, you want this guy to be your best friend. However, his class is tough. Go to class and know the numbers. If ya don't, welp, your parents couch is hopefully still open.",1
"Really friendly and helpful guy, but I didn't care for his teaching style. Kind of just scribbles all over the blackboard. Tests were really difficult and didn't relate to lectures.",1
"Dr. Khadka is a great professor, he is very smart, and it can be seen from his teaching style. his lecture were great and his structure of teaching was excellent and helped me thrive in this class.  Everything was organized and was easy to follow for the most part!",1
The best accounting professor at Leeds and probably in the whole country. He was the first professor I had that also was a mentor to me. I personally hate accounting but still loved this class just because he was teaching it. Take a class with him. You won't regret it.,1
"Mr. Woodcock is a little bit arrogant, but still a nice guy. He's also a good teacher and very caring. As long as you participate and do the work plus show to class, you'll do very well.",1
He's a perfect teacher love the way he teaches and if you get stuck on anything see him during his offices hours and he will help you. If you study the lesson before his next class from the previous class you can easily pass his daily quizzes. ,1
"Class was really good. Theres alot of writing, but Mr. Molnar gives you a lot of freedom to write want you want. We spent alot of time on individual papers and that really helped improve them. The novel was really good and he really helped me understand it.",1
"Listen people, this was THE BEST class I have ever taken. If you are planning on going into the medical field, this is the class for you. Your brain will be challenged daily, but it is well worth the struggle. In class, Dr. K lectures very quickly, but he will talk to you outside of class until you fully understand the lecture material! Take 341!",1
"Great teacher, but she's a hard marker (especially when it comes to papers). The subject material is very repetitive and gets boring after a while. Make sure you read the assigned readings as there are class discussions and a lot of group work. I took the night class btw.",1
"Honors Humanities. Dr. Osborne is so-so. Assigns lots of readings over Plato, Aristotle, etc. and has class discussions over the material. He's very knowledgeable and makes discussion fun, but it's often dominated by a few students. The only homework you have is a midterm paper, research project, and a final paper. Interesting, but quite difficult.",1
HANDS DOWN THE BEST teacher/professor I've ever had! Go into the class with an open mind and I promise you will leave with a whole new outlook on life. I wish I could take every class with him! I really looked forward to attending each class which says a lot because I generally dread going to class. He is very intelligent and thought provoking!,1
Easy class and wonderful professor. Just do all the chapter assignments and you'll get an A!,1
Chill as ICCCCCEEEEEE,1
Gives really good lectures but the test will hurt you.,0
"Dean is approachable, understanding and overall just a very nice guy to have class with. I've had two classes with him and received a 4.3 in both. With a little effort there's no reason you can't do the same.",1
"This was an online Friday class, so the lectures and readings are on your own. There are weekly online timed quizzes based on the power points, fairly easy. midterm and final are multiple choice. Also a partner essay, straight forward. I enjoyed this class. I used the book for the essay mostly.",1
"Good class. You have to write a lot, and re-write, but if you do this you shoul dbe okay.",1
"Prof Gilbert is a great prof. I only came to class because he made it and the topics so interesting.  His slides are great so we dont' ""scramble like rabbits!"" His jokes and time for discussion are great! we talked about everything related to tlbg2spirit etc. best part was when we had a ""guest speaker"". :)",1
Amy is a great professor! She makes class fun and interesting by having you do creative projects. She is open to hearing students' ideas and is a very fair and clear instructor. She sometimes brings candy and treats for the class!,1
"He is the worst teacher possible. All he want's to do is talk about himself. His quizzes and tests are based on novel readings, that have NOTHING to do with sociology. Tests and quizzes are short answer and essay. They are extremely specific questions and if you don't read you will not pass.",0
"Not my favorite professor, but she is very good. Way above average. Knowledgeable without being condescending. Actually knows what she is talking about.",1
"The class was well balanced and discussions were always interesting/enjoyable (which is saying something for an 8AM MTWR class...). The assignments were varied, grading was fair, pace was just right for a 4000 level course. Don't let the other 1st year ""college writing"" course reviews fool you, he's a great professor, especially with this topic.",1
"I love professor Wedemeyer! I'm not a fan of any accounting class, but I enjoyed her lectures and she tries to make you interested so you can learn the material and do well on the tests. She wants you to do well but you have to do your part and work for the grade you want! I would gladly take her again if she is teaching another class I need.",1
"Ken's a tough teacher and sometimes get confused even at his own words, but he's talented and a great guy to hang around the dark room with. Plus, if you ever get the chance to drink with Ken, do it. You won't regret it.",1
"There are a few essay tests, but they are not difficult. Tests aren't too hard if you study the study guide. Overall, pretty good professor. I definitely recommend taking her.",1
Unclear about class he's teaching & unorganized.,0
"She is the best professor for Language development and emergent lit. I like what robotics that we did with kids. Lots of assignments! Whenever you ask for her help, she is right there. I would recommend her.",1
Absolutely amazing professor. she is willing to help when you get stuck. Best Math teacher ever . Take her you wont be disappointed . She is the Best!! but make sure you do your work and you will pass.,1
"Dr Lane was flexible and she provided genuine feedback. You need to read the IT textbook, but don't bother reading the Microsoft text. There's no assignments on it.",1
"I usually wait until the end of the semester to review teachers but so far, Alice has been the BEST online class I HAVE EVER TAKEN. She is helpful, friendly, understanding, and even at 12AM, responds to emails lightning fast!! What is clear: she cares deeply about her students and genuinely wants them to succeed. Thank You Professor Stevens!!",1
"Funny dude on piazza, cool dude irl",1
"Joscelyn is the man; only he could make 13 century chant exciting.  Of course, he also expected us to sing the music we were studying, and his tests were the typically impossible, but music history with Godwin was still a great experience.",1
"This Professor gave us no essay requirements for our final essay. The requirements that were given out previously were vague, and the Professor proceeds to grade us hard on these essays. The work load is excessive as well, and even if you do it all on time it doesn't matter because those who were tardy get to remake the assignments scott-free.",0
"He's so great!! Very helpful. He gives quizzes, midterm and a final exam. But honestly if you pay attention you should be fine.",1
"Good guy, helpful,tough but fair",1
Love her! She is dynamic in teaching and passionately engages in the subject. I enjoyed this class because of her.,1
"This professor responded quickly to emails and graded quickly. However, She does not provide additional instructions for assignments. So, even though there is a good bit of extra credit, you may end up with ZERO points if you don't complete how she expects it. And if you reach out to ask questions, she is somewhat rude.",0
"Teaches from pictures from book. Not very helpful, hard grader,must read the book to pass.",0
"Very easy going, but that could be bad if you are not able to keep up with material.  Good lectures but poor in practice.  Regardless, I was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time.",0
Very unclear about anything.  Handed back assignments 4 weeks after we turned them in.  Makes me want to vomit everytime I am in that class.  By far the most uninspiring teacher I have had.  I have learned something in the class...shes the model of what not to be when you teach.,0
"She is VERY into the material she is teaching. Although I am not english major, I admire her zest for life. Good teacher!",1
"Students only like Garyen because he is funny and caring in lectures. In terms of actually learning something in his class, chances are you probably have to learn it yourself. He's forgetful and sometimes tests you on material that you haven't even learned in lecture and not even found in the textbook which is unfair. He's not as hype as you think.",0
"Calc 1 & 2 were not my favorite, but Dr. Justice managed to make calc 3 much easier for me. I can't speak for in-person, but online Fall 2020 has been great. It's still difficult content, but his lectures are easy to follow and his exams are very similar to his lectures. Honestly, quizzes were harder than exams. We love Brad. Take him if you can!!",1
"Very clear and organized. Handouts are very helpful when studying. Lots of material covered, but prof makes it easier to understand. In class short answer midterm and final.",1
"I think he was very creative as a professor and assigned us interesting work. I learned a lot from him, however I found myself very frustrated with his personality. He has a tendency to be very passive aggressive and condescending towards his students. Overall, he gets the job done but I wouldnt take another class from him due to his attitude.",0
"I just finished University--I took all of Dr. Phelps' classes at Nashville State. If you show that you care about the material--he will care about you. IT IS ART HISTORY! Opinion matters! Right, wrong, other, undecided, let's talk about it, whatever. This is not a ""hard"" class. Do a bit of reading, venture a few opinions during lecture. The end.",1
"Teach yourself the stuff. he teaches his class with videos and lectures (although, you'll probably get bored and stop listening). Not a particularly fun class, but he made me laugh...probably not on purpose.  I would say: TAKE THIS CLASS. He's not much fun, but it's an easy A...although he'll try to trick you into thinking his course is hard.",0
"Very much loves his personality, and loves attention. Talks about him more than the actual class. Does not have much experience, and does not have many examples for the class. Give tests, but leaves the room. Intentional late. No care for the students unless they are female. Grabs women in front of all the class, and has not a good reputation......",0
"one of the worst classes I've taken. For an online class, it is all busy work. They're a multiple videos to watch that take up 1-2 hours a week. The quizzes are so specific to the videos and the questions on the quizzes/exams are all very challenging.",0
Honestly this class was literally the most demanding class out there so if you have anything to do outside of class dont take this guy. His exams were too long didnt give curves more than 80% of the class dropped. I failed this class took another professor and made an A. He just makes this class confusing af take another prof and let google guide u,0
"Good professor, a little monotone though, making his otherwise good lectures a bit hard to listen to. Take a lot of notes, tests are very hard. Extremely long-winded in answering questions. Still a good prof and a good guy.",1
"He's great! really friendly, very approachable, and know a lot about his area. Take his class!",1
He makes pre-calculus fun to learn. Hes easy to understand and goes at a slow pace which at times can be annoying if you understood the material the first time around. He also gave me 100% on a hmwk I missed just because I went to his office hours and went over some problems.,1
His exams are fairly predictable but he is a total male chauvanist.  Doesn't think girls have any place in geology... or the world for that matter.  avoid at all costs.  he's been around since the university opened.  hopefully he'll retire soon,0
He have the answer of every question,1
"Professor Sonntag is extremely funny, has compassion and just an overall great human being. Yeah, whats up with all the hate here, I am starting to think that some of these comments are coming from the same person. Her updates through canvas was really the only reason to log in aside from studying, eww.",1
"Homework is easy , not so hard ! Lecture is easy ,",1
No Comments,1
"I took his online course, and didnt know what to expect. He was a great professor, very understanding and structured. I would definitely recommend taking him for your Divisional or in general. There are weekly meetings, group projects & discussion post but if you work with the same group youll be fine.",1
"If you're not interested in history then the lectures will be boring, assigns weekly texts (don't need to read, you can spark note it all), exams are very easy if you pay attention to recitations, he knows his material very well, extremely nice, and he posts outlines online that he reads off of during the lectures. Easy A.",1
My favorite prof. at LSUE. Definitely go out of your way to schedule her.,1
"Ruder is not an engaging professor but he's learned to be somewhat helpful and has made the class obnoxiously easy. He doesn't expect much from you. Do ALL the homework, easy points and gives you a basic understanding. Also the practice tests were *identical* to the actual test. Take it with him to get it done if you're not a BMIS concentration.",1
Best teacher ever. Sad hes leaving so soon! Crazy about golf and always makes me laugh! Great prof!,1
Hes a nice teacher. Loves to take the whole class time to interact with his students..BUT his papers are so hard. He grades so unfairly. I wish he wasnt so difficult with his assignments he gives..its hard to pass the class when his assignments are so hard with such high points.. I honestly wouldnt reccomend him if your not good with English,1
I took her class and LOVED it! Its like story time with Mother Goose. Her eyes light up while the time slips away from you. You will feel like you are actually there while she is telling the story (HISTORY). She makes the class fun and is full of extra history fun facts. I feel grateful to have been in her class-  A real live mother-goose. ,1
"If you study, ready the book a little, but mostly just read the slides, you will get an A. He gives a practice exam before each exam with no answers, 80% of these practice questions are the exact same on the real exam. Deni really loves to teach and wants his class to do well. Class is boring, but it is not mandatory to go.",1
"I have never rated any professor before but because this class was SO bad and because he was the most boring teacher I have ever had, I want to warn anyone who thinks about taking this class or this teacher in general...DON'T DO IT.",0
"Great teacher with very clear guidelines from day one.  She is sometimes difficult to understand, as her Korean accent is thick at times.  However, her tests are fairly straightforward if you read and UNDERSTAND the slides she posts.  Doing the optional problems she posts from the textbook help and attendance is optional but essential to passing.",1
"Monica is extremely helpful and generous. She has worked around my schedule to help me out and explains things in a way that works for me. She is tough where it is needed but for a class like this, grades are hard.",1
"Without the final exam redemption policy where I BARELY got an A (86%), I would've failed this class. Lots of iClicker questions and the midterms were ridiculously difficult. My TA told me that 3/4 of the class got C's and below, the average for both midterms were 51% and 48%. I had to do over 300 problems from old exams and problem sets for an A.",0
"I took his religion and politics class and loved it! He's not a hard professor, as long as you put in the work. He didn't give us an actual test review, but gave us a brief summary of what would be on the final in class. I got an A on everything, so just put in the work and you'll be fine.",1
Awful teacher cares to much about attendance even if you have a good reason to be late or absent. Boring lectures and quizzes are easy but gives pointless homework wouldn't recommend,0
"Love him!!!! Definitely taking him again for MG. Class is interesting. One chapter of reading a week. 3 papers (including the final paper) about interesting topics. Not a tough grader, I got 3.74.0s on all papers. Recommend taking him for any class",1
"She is the coolest teacher, she is such a funny person.",1
She's the nicest prof. Chemistry is a hard course in general but she's so fair and really wants the best for her students. She makes the outline so you can get a really fair mark. So approachable and absolutely amazing. TAKE HER!,1
This class is interesting if you're an erudite because It's basically self-taught. Doesn't respond to emails or doesn't read them correctly. It's sad because it's a great topic but there was no passion for even showing people how awesome it is.,0
Fultz is nothing less than amazing! he gives you everything you need and if you have any questions he is always available to help. He is clear and has an amazing teaching method! If you want to know what you are doing this is the class to take. AMAZING!!,1
Really great!,1
"He just read off his power points, so lecture wasn't really necessary. I NEVER used the book, and the one he tells you to get is the wrong one. He want you to get a CD-ROM version, but the one listed is for online. He gives you a practice test from past years to study from and some of the questions are word for word on the actual test. No Final.",1
"The professor is a nice, fair and great teacher. At times, he gets off subject here and there, but he is always on track.  He knows his subject.  No quizzes at all, only mid-term and final exams but you must study, study and study for those exams.  We do have class projects on case studies but it isn't hard.",1
"She is a great professor. She makes learning more enjoyable and has a sense of humor. She does not do power points, she does over head slides and a lot of writing on the board. I would taker her class again, I wish she was teaching AP2 as well.",1
"Good professor, he replies fast to emails and clears up any misunderstandings you may have. However, this course is not an easy A, it requires a lot of reading and make sure to do all your discussions! He drops the lowest test score and the final is optional!",1
Cool,1
"Palmer was a really good professor. The only reason people give him bad ratings is because they dont do the readings. He only assigns 2 readings a week and pop quizzes which just means theres a quiz for every chapter. These quizzes are not hard. They actually help your grade a lot, and help you retain information!",1
Mr prey does not give feedback. He is not availble to answer questions concerning assignments.,0
This Professor is great! Lots of socializing because its lecture/lab combined. He does make you work for the answer but office hours will help clear it up. Exams were easy even one group exam (may help or not). Exam Qs come from HW. It is on you to ask questions to understand the material. He is very approachable and will help you however you need.,1
"Valuable course. Imparts much knowledge and wisdom about linux system administration. You would not come close to replicating the value of this course through online tutorials, so it's well worth tuition. Every class is a follow-along lecture; there is no structure to homework other than working on your own to make sure you understand things.",1
"Lopez is an amazing prof. He is passionate about what he teaches (I took his Shakespeare course) and has great focus and challenges your writing style and essay structure. Also, he makes entire lectures about sex. He's hilarious, clear cut, interesting, but BRUTAL about deadlines. If it's late, it's a ZERO. Tutorials are a MUST.",1
She is a great advisor. And I enjoy being in her class.,1
"These reviews almost scared me off taking Dr. Boydstons class, but Im glad I did. If youre a slacker, expect to be coddled, or think that because this is a hybrid class, the coursework should be easy, then this isnt the class for you. However, if you put in the work, And take advantage of all the extra credit, theres no way you can fail",1
"Orser is a lovely woman, however, she is way too tough of a marker and not active online through moodle, feedback was less to none. I think everybody failed one quiz and expects you to read all books ( which are expensive) while having a full courseload and life",0
I usually dislike English classes. However - Pekarske has been one of the few English teachers that I genuinely feel has helped to improve my writing. Her essay critiques are of the best I've ever been given. I highly recommend this professor.,1
HE IS SUPER!!!!!!,1
all lecture from PowerPoint which is from the book boring class all you do is take notes no taking to people next to you for help.  Review below me is on point about his grading  For me the test were hard his review did not help different from test. Bad eyesight people he writes small and bright color seat on first row. you learn one python script,0
"Attendance is not graded but he only posts the slide from lecture, most of which have a few words on them. If you don't go to lecture you will never know what is going on. He does include pictures on all of his exams that you have to identify from the lecture slides as well.",1
This professor wants you to know how to do each writing assignment that she gives to you. I thought we are suppose to learn not come into the class having a background in writing. Even though I am a wonderful writer she still found ways to be very critical of everything I turned in.I would not recommend her class please do not take her.,0
"Dr. Simerka is AMAZING. I have never had a more helpful or involved Professor. She is quick to answer emails and gives incredibly helpful constructive feedback. She was encouraging, funny, and provided a plethora of support to her students. She is an expert in her subject and I thoroughly enjoyed learning from her. If you get the chance, take her!",1
"One of the best professors at ONU. Brilliant writer and great constitutional law professor. Gets the message across really clear about you need to get out of each case and is really relaxed. Even though I am from the opposite end of the political spectrum, I love this class and feel he teaches it in a real evenhanded way.",1
"LOVED her so much! She is very kind, caring, intelligent, and such a sweetheart. The class was never overwhelming. I honestly enjoyed coming to her class. I highly recommend taking her. You will not regret it. This class does require observation hours, please DO NOT put that off and think you have all the time in the world to do it.",1
Easily the worst professor I have EVER had here in my time at Temple. Completely arrogant in many regards. Sees the world in his perspective and if you do not agree with him your wrong.  Worst books I have ever had to read for a class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!,0
"This is a tough professor.  She doesn't play.  She expects and demands your best.  She can be somewhat intimidating.  While this was a difficult class, I believe what I got from her will last a lifetime.  Also, she is a highly educated and capable instructor:  Make no mistakes, you will be earning every bit of your grade.",1
"Prof Lohrey leaves everything for you to figure out on your own. Class lectures consist of him flying through ppts, and writing out the solutions to a couple of problems. You should go to class since he goes over probs that are most likely on the test. Two midterms which are 1/2 in class and 1/2 take home, final is in class. Hw on Wiley is helpful.",0
good teacher ,1
One off the best Prof at GBC. I recommend you take this guy course he will change your life.,1
"The best professor I have had at this school thus far. He knows his stuff! Great class, I learned a lot, and I'm really glad I'm majoring so I can take more classes from him!",1
"Have to read a chapter, take a 30 question quiz, and then do a discussion board or an essay (both 15 sentences long) each week. A midterm and final paper, no exams. Very friendly, helpful, and responds to emails within 24 hours.",1
"Professor is amazing. Show up to class for attendance, weekly assignments online, midterm and final and your done. Very good at catching attention and explaining political topics that are happening at the time. Would take again.",1
"Carlos is super nice, has his quirks (i.e. his rhythmic talking and random yay's) but that makes him extra cool. He is helpful and understanding. the class can run too long and it can get boring but i have no interest in the subject plus i grew up with the language.",1
"If you can avoid her, do it. The worst professor I have ever had. If you have her I recommend dropping the class if you can. I have no understanding why she is still teaching.",0
"Dr. Cote's the worst professor I've ever had. She's arrogant, rude, and a horrible teacher. She just reads off her slides and does NOT engage with the class. She gives problem sets as homework but never goes over them. Be prepared to spend hours teaching yourself EVERYTHING. WPUNJ should fire her, as she puts the school down in every lecture.",0
"The class is a ton of work, but compared to some older reviews, the workload has lightened. Three journals, a quiz every week, and a presentation to do in class. You will typically read 100+ pages per week, but at least he doesn't use traditional textbooks. If you need help, he is a very approachable guy.",1
This guy talkes in circles! If you're used to a teahcer who spells it out- he doesn't. Class is actually about sex in bible and other works. VERY boring-most ppl sleep or don't show up. Option to do papers or midterm & final. Mini translation quizes in mid eng. Don't know how you're doing- hands back everything weeks later than when you did it.,0
"Professor McCleod is truly an awesome professor. He really cares about his students and their success in his class. He is very willing to go over material as much as needed during lectures and in office hours. He also truly enjoys when his students understand concepts. Tests can be difficult, but if you pay attention, they're not that bad.",1
Awesome teacher!  He is very clear and thorough while teaching.  Very easy (at least for me) to understand and comprehend his work.  I wish i could have him for every math class.  He also cares about the student and is willing to work with you if you need it.  Definitely a good teacher for someone who may not be very good at math.  ,1
SHE IS  A WONDERFUL PROF!! TAKE HER CLASS!! Just 3 projects a semester. She gave us a lot of resources to help us finish projects. Really easy A. But no A+grade.,1
Great class. Labs were amazing. Cannot wait to have another class with him. Learned a lot.,1
"This class is very interesting and I do recommend it for a global course. However, Prof. Nelson really annoyed me, she is friendly and knows her stuff (she lived in Africa for awhile) but she is quite obnoxious at times. She assigns reading assignments, 5 of which you must complete, and they are LONG! Exams are lengthy and can be difficult.",1
Don't take him. Worst profesor ever! 3 weeks to hit finals and the only thing I learn was football. I'm so disappointed.,0
"She might be one of the professors that actually got me into depression. At first, I though she is nice lady, but reality hits and got me worried about my GPA. Thanks to her, I see her as someone who doesn't see her students as worthy successors but instead sees them as failed human beings or she really hated her job working there.",0
"Easy A. go to class, do and turn in your work on time and you will pass this with an A. ",1
"She doesn't assign a lot of work, but she's     picky about grading.",0
"Professor Abdulkarim Sekta was a great professor! Was very clear to his students of what to expect for tests so as long as you study the information he gives you, you will be fine! Responds back quickly with emails as well. He really cares for his students success.",1
"i took three classes by her and i loved it, she's very nice and the class was easy, i never read the book and got an A in all three of the classes. BUT class is mandatory!",1
Professor Kraft is an awesome teacher! He makes everything very clear and the schedule for the semester was very easy to follow. Definitely going to sign up for his 102 class in the Spring.,1
"He seems like a brilliant physicist but unfortunately he is more concerned with making the class laugh or awe at his math prowess.  The book for this class doesn't seem to corrolate with the lectures, but I suppose I learned something.  I'm just glad I have Mohrman this semester.",0
"very willing and available to meet with you outside of class to help. Don't skip class because he doesn't follow the book and everything you need for the tests we work on in class. We had a total of 2 tests, 5 problem sets and 2 data assignments. The book is free online. 2 extra credit opportunities based on attendance for every test.",1
One of the best teachers I have had. Very caring and helpful. Grades fairly.,1
Good person has a passion for music however the class was pretty hard to pass.  If your not into jazz and cant dedicate enough time to listen to it daily you wont do well on the exams. The exams are hard and on top of that they are only 12 to 19 questions so it harder to pass.  Lectures have nothing to do with exam. Reminder this is for MUS108*,0
"He's just awesome.. He makes lectures interesting to listen, and he has a lot of flexibilty on grading if he knows student is trying.",1
his test are open note no longer take home. You don't really need the book just take really good notes in class. When you write your paper make sure do a good job on citation.,1
"This class was very hard, but very much worth it, Dr. Liszka puts you in charge of your education. Daily homework, daily discussions, 2-hour group presentation, and a 10-page research paper, on top of midterm and final. I learned so much from this class and she is very willing to lend a hand whenever she can - very accessible!",1
Don is hilarious. Keeps the class entertained and engaged through his humor and quality lectures.,1
DO NOT TAKE HER! She gives a lot of assignments and takes a long time to grade them. She doesn't explain anything and never responds to emails. Plus a lot of presentations.,0
"As an African American student I very much appreciated the extensive look at African American Political Thought in his class. Prof. Solari is down to earth, accessible. Gave me lots of feedback on drafts of my paper. I really like him saying it was his obligation to help us once we graduate with letters or calls when we job hunt.",1
"She's not terrible, but she rushes during classes and she expects us to know as much as she does with the content. I asked her a few questions,&there are just times when she just assumes that you know it already. She reads from the textbook ,I thought going to class was futile. She goes through mechanics without explaining what purposes  they serve",0
All tests are online.  He drops the lowest test so if you do good on the first 6 then you don't have to take the last or go to class.,1
"I've taken all of his classes; Soc, Psych, Lifespan Psych, and Anth. By far the best instructor i've ever had. Highly recommended teacher. ",1
She takes this subject way to seriously for being a beginning 101 media class. Way too much outside work for no reason and doesnt let her TAs do anything. The lecture is usually super irrelevant to the tests which sucks because the whole class grade is the tests. Shes a SUPER awesome person and would be a dope friend but cant say Id take again,1
Such a good English class. Was my first class English class of college and was a breeze. 4 essays over the semester along with a well defined Syllabus. She explains things clearly and her tests are easy as long as you pay attention. Make sure to read for the book for reading quizzes. Loved her and would take again.,1
do the Mastering A&P. Do the Quizzes - copy and save them to a word document. they are locked out after you take them but are used for the majority of tests. do the group projects - let everyone else do the online searches and stick to your book. YOU MUST READ.,1
Prof. Ochs runs a fairly simple class. You have a reading assigned for every class and she gives you notes on the reading during class. Actually doing the readings is not all that mandatory. Showing up to class also isn't mandatory but the class becomes a lot harder if you don't because you really need the notes to do all the writing assignments.,1
"I never had him for class but feel he deserves a fair shot on here. I know some ppl don't care for him, but I found him to be an engaging professor to speak to, even to argue with. He is a brilliant writer who has found a niche with Thomas scholarship. Maybe it doesn't translate to his classes, but he isn't as bad as this site makes him out to be.",1
He's a very good teacher. Grades papers harder as the year goes on but makes sure to help you get better at writing papers as long as you try to do better. Very helpful. I never worry about writing papers for classes now. ,1
"I took English 100 as part of the high school accelerated program. Her expectations were clear and she does care about her students. Lots of readings but you only have to do 4 essays, one forum post a week, and a final exam. Feedback from essays were helpful and informative which will be beneficial for your future writing. Would highly recommend.",1
"She can come off as a tough, unapproachable individual, but if you show sincere care to learn and take the time to actually learn the material, she will see that and appreciate it and give you her time to help. She's a great professor and you learn the material in her class. Shut all of your technology off, pay attention, and listen :)",1
"Uncle Les is a great guy. He actually wants you to learn and enjoy learning Sociology. He is not afraid to call people out. Can NOT be on your phone in class, but lets you take notes on laptop. Review days cover every question on the tests, guaranteed A. If you stay extra time after class on review days you get extra credit.",1
"Honestly disappointed since I thought this class would be greatI'm interested in the topic. However, for the vagueness of her teaching, her tests are extremely specific and trickily worded. I felt like she was trying to trick us the whole time I was taking her tests and it was really frustrating to know you studied your hardest but won't get an A.",0
great teacher..you must work hard but you can get an a,1
One of the best English i have took at Medgar Evers College.  She not a good professor and all ask if you need help.  So always take the opportunity to receive the extended hand and you will get the grade you deserve.  Best of luck,1
Extremely boring. You will hate your life for the hour during which he speaks,0
"Had prof Hegner at the beginning of year.Skelly's hard for visual learners;does quiet explainations by mouth only and most people in the class were lost.When he did write on the board, it was sloppy,unstructured,almost illegible.Learned everything from reading the text-I only came to get attendence credit. Listening to his lecture only confused me.",0
I have to say that Dr. Feagin was great for me. I wish I had taken her in my first history class. She was very helpful and very responsive when I emailed her. The quizzes are on the easy side but the midterm and final format were tricky. It had fill in maps and fill in the blanks along with some multiple choice and T/F questions. Overall great!,1
her way of teaching is by giving hw and going over it in class barely any french conversations in class if that works for you i recommend her but if you want more speaking and less grammar i do not recommend,1
Professor Howell is one of the best teachers I've ever had at COCC because she is really great at helping students if they're confused on a topic. She is also really good about checking her email daily even over the weekend if you have questions.,1
Brilliant theoretical petrology-Very kind and approachable- a true denius,1
"Awesome teacher. Inspired me to switch my major. I never leave reviews but I will for Prof. Richards. He's a ""funny guy"" and also a ""bro"", but at the same time a respected teacher who knows what's worth teaching and what's worth skipping. If I could only take accounting classes from him, I would.",1
"He tries his hardest to make dull information interesting. The exam was difficult but I probably didn't prepare enough. The quizzes are very straightforward. For a required class, not bad. Really nice, genuine guy!",1
She's not even qualified to teach college courses.  She told our class that she only has a Masters degree in Education - not even in Biology.... Goodwin should give her the pink slip..,0
Best Spanish professor at CLU! He wants you to learn the language and creates the best possible environment for it. I've struggled through Spanish 101 and absolutely dreaded going to class. Not the case here! I actually enjoy his lectures and the in-class assignments.,1
Margarita is the best!!!,1
"Dr. V is a good teacher but expects you to work very hard. Her tests are extremely hard and remember to study alot  for them. Attend her review sessions and complete the study guides. You will not receive an A if you don't put in the time. Online homework, quizzes and participation points are only other grades besides tests. Overall great teacher!!",1
"An excellent teacher! He explains concepts very well verbally and also draws/uses visuals that I thought really help information sink in. The study guide questions reflect what needs to be known for the exam--thoroughly answer all in prep for the tests. His lectures were very interesting and engaging. Honestly, the best professor I ever had.",1
Great Math teacher and always responding quickly! Will take one of his class again!,1
"I want to be fair as much as I can, but she's a real tough grader she deducts a lot of marks for very simple mistakes, marks were flying out just like money on a shopping spree and she won't help you with any extra credit either. So, don't let your GPA suffer. She is a good teacher though but still Gen chem I doesn't have to be that hard.",0
"He's been teaching forever, and is a world class authority on many topics. Just when you start to know enough to think he's ""old fashionned"" he would come up with very modern, ""outside the box"" concepts. He is a walking encyclopedia and an asset to concordia music dept.",1
"Very good instructor, very knowledgeable. He cracks jokes everyday. He can be a little testy sometimes.",1
"Clear explanations and lots of enthusiasm for the content. Notes are not posted online, and not everything in the textbook is used or relevant to the course content. You must attend lectures to do well, but if you do attend you will have no problems getting a good grade in the class.",1
I'm glad I took all my accounting classes with him it was very easy for a pretty challenging material based class. He sometimes gives take home exams but the in class exams are open book/note anyway. I personally did not really pay attention and still got an A,1
"In my case, there were only four grades in his class: 2 papers, midterm, and final. This is what made the class tough. However, Professor Schuster is a great guy and a solid teacher. He keeps the class interesting (as interesting as history can get) and is willing to help those who seem to be struggling. Give him rough drafts of your papers.",1
"He obviously knows what hes talking about, the lectures were just really hard to pay attention to/boring. The quizzes after every class were really really difficult as well, even though i read every chapter and went to class. It was a lot harder than I expected and i normally love religion classes. wouldnt recommend",0
Amazing teacher. Made learning fun and very helpful,1
"Mrs. Young is very good at what she does. This class is for people who may not be very skilled at math. While there's a lot of homework and assignments to do outside of class, she gives chances to succeed. Attendance is not mandatory, but be sure to frequently check what you need to do.",1
Mr Mckean provided me with the tools I needed to pursue investigative writing and reporting as well as news writing.  He is fair and balanced .  His style and approach to teaching enables his students to develop and enhance their own talents and strengths.  Additionally his grasp and command of journalism concepts and tools is exceptional.  ,1
"He is very organized, kind, and really wants everyone to understand the material. Stats is a tough subject, but he tries to be clear about what will be on the tests. He also offers opportunities for extra credit. He grades quickly. The workload is reasonable, not much homework, but attendance is important for success because of in class work",1
The most difficult part of his course was learning APA format. I enjoyed the group work and chapter assignment. He encourages students to think critically and to get involved with community work. I think he is a great teacher.   He has a particular way of engaging students.,1
"She pulled a whole weight off my shoulders my first year of college. She is clear from the beginning of what is expected from you. Her feedback is very helpful and teaches clearly. She will contact you if it looks like you might be in danger of failing too. She's very helpful, I suggest taking her class. Time always flew by in my English 21A class.",1
Amazing guy! Inspired me to shoot to do more after college.,1
"I absolutely love Hegner!!  She is the reason I am majoring in accounting and almost done with my degree at CSUS.  I wish Sac State had professors like her!  Absolutely amazing and really breaks down the material.  Pay attention, do the work, study, and you will do fine!  She really knows the material and knows how to TEACH!  Love you, Paula!",1
2 Homework sections a week. Discussions are hard to understand. Difficult class. I took it online.,1
barely passed this class. She is very strict with attendance and will mark you late even if you were late for 2 minutes.,0
"Online class. Easy to search book for quiz answers. Interesting class. Nice professor. No final exam, only a mid-term and final essay on the topic of your choice.",1
Shes amazing!,1
This lady was pregnant the whole semester and still managed to make the class fun and easy.  No kidding....this chick was still teaching like two days before going into labor!!  What a warrior!!  And was back in class like 3 days later like nothing happened!!  Amazing!!,1
"By far one of my favorite professors. She's funny and genuinely cares about her students. There were four papers, including the final essay. She does peer review for every paper, and it is required. There is a group project at the end of the semester, and she bases many of her assignments off of TV/movies. She gives good feedback on all essays.",1
"i have taken her 3 times. comparative pols, women & politics and feminist theory. she's the best professor i have ever had. she makes you want to read and the classroom environment encourages it as well. tough grader, but you can definitely get an A if you try hard enough. highly recommended. not for the lazy",1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich fail to respond to your question in a timely manner and when he did finally respond the answer mada no sense to the question you had asked. I would not recommend this class unless you have no choice.",0
"Ignore the rating beforehand. Deadlines are all on math lab, why would you ""expect"" extended deadlines? She provides you with power points, my mathlab, and is literally always there to help. Open notes on everything, in exchange for hw you can legit complete in class. I got an A and it was the best class I've ever taken, she cares.",1
"Dr. C is not only a wonderful professor, but he's also the best adjuster around!! :-)",1
Makes math extremely hard. If you want to know how to do the problems you need to rely on the book. He doesnt give extra credit or let you make anything up. He will also grade things very tough and doesnt care how you do on anything. He is also hard to contact at times and will not reply on occasion. Seems like a nice person but not a nice prof.,0
i really wanted to take spanish i was so happy when i got the only class and then when i got there it was so hard and i asked for help and he said that i can do it...then after i was doing badly he said drop...after the dead line for money back passed,0
"Honestly this class was unreasonably difficult for a 101 class. It's not that it was hard necessarily, just way too much work expected for such a low level course. Lectures were not good and she just read off the slides for the most part that had nothing to do with the tests. Too much outside work and event attendances required.",0
"So here is the deal with David. He tells you exactly how to get an A during the first day of class. You show up, take notes on the things he repeats, do your blogs and wikis and understand the books enough to write a little on them. This class could not be easier but he leaves the grade up to you.",1
"Devey doesn't seem to be able to apply the educational principals he is teaching. Though i was well prepared, i barely survived the first exam- got an A, but scrambled to understand the questions. When I tried to contact the prof he ignored my emails and discussion board posts, and doesn't hold office hours. This class was a major bummer.",0
Dr. A is literally the best professor I've ever had in my four years as a college student. I've had him for the past 3 semesters for Hebrew 1-3 to satisfy my foreign language credit but I've had him for a normal humanities course as well. He connects with students as if he is their friend and will give you a good grade if you just try your best :),1
"Dr. Brown was an amazing professor. The guy is hilarious and will keep you entertained. The class was 3 hours long, but it went by quick. I took it for only half the semester as well. You have 2 test and they are very easy. Quizzes every class but it's extremely easy. He gives you handouts and there is 1 project. Take him at all cost.",1
"KB was awesome. He was very relaxed about attendance, but held you accountable by your work. He was helpful and open to ideas, never made anyone feel that they were wrong for their opinions. He grades according to the college standard guidelines (where a c is a good thing), so I was worried, but I did really well in the class.",1
"Dr. Searfoss is a really great professor who knows her stuff! She does talk very slow so at times it can be difficult to stay engaged. If you have taken phonetics and diction, then this class should be an easy A. The HW she assigns can be a lot but it truly helps you understand the material better. Highly recommend!!",1
"The class is pretty interesting.  He sometimes calls on people randomly, which can be annoying.  He knows absolutely everything about music history.  His tests are very hard, but he curves them a lot.",1
"Melanie was the actual best. She wants you to succeed in a creative writing course. I could not recommend her enough. She wants all students to feel comfortable and is so genuine. You write three major assignments; poetry, fiction and non-fiction. She wants you to succeed! Would love to take another class with her",1
"This professor is hard. You need to read tons of readings and articles prior class otherwise you have no idea what is she talking about. Participation is extremely important, she makes marks on her attendance sheet every time you participate. Her exams are tricky and confusing. If you want to get an A, then don't take her.",0
"Frank is the best. Plain and simple. One of the best professors at SUNY Potsdam. He's my advisor and he is one of the most helpful, funny, and honest people. He's a wonderful professor.",1
This class was super interesting and easy if you do the weekly assignments. My class was entirely online but Professor Ramey and his TA's were super accessible and always responded quickly to questions. It was a lot of reading during the week but he found out we were struggling and broke up the readings so it was easier.,1
"The best professor I've had in the ECE department thus far. Excellent lectures, and if you put effort into this class, it will be rewarded. Programming assignments are somewhat challenging but a fair testing of our knowledge. Would love to have him for another class in the future.",1
"Never take it, unless you have really smart friends to get answer from them. He is boring, not easy at all, you have to write well for every tests, and TA s are  hard grader, they grade hard for this class.",0
"Amazing professor. Super caring and knows her stuff. I've taken two of her classes so far and both were eye-opening. One focused on ""interpreting the other"" and the other focused on illness and disease in literature. She wants her students to be more aware of other things outside of our own lives. She is a tough grader on papers though.",1
"Knowledgeable, experienced, cares.",1
Professor Massnick is a Professor who will work with you at all times. She is very understanding and no matter what she will attempt to try her best in order to help you receive a good grade. She is not the type of Professor class who you will not want to show up. She keeps things entertaining and includes opinions and feelings on subjects.,1
"I liked Dr. K a lot. I am on the edge of an A and a B. He is a hard professor, but his tests are fair and a lot easier than his lectures. If you asks questions he tries to help you to understand. He also does a review at the beginning of every class. Take notes on these because it's a good review for the test! I would take him again.",1
If the person before me was in the same class theyre wrong. Majority of the class never skipped and many people complained because this professor doesnt explain things well. She will give you study guides but half of it wont be on the test. She tells you to remember things and take notes but it wont be on the test. Nice lady not a great teacher,0
"Excellent teacher, very helpful.",1
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! she literally does not answer her EMAILS! she is a communication professor yet her inability to get back to you with attitude is unacceptable. Her workload is insane she acts like her class is the only one, meanwhile there is other courses. too much for a 200 level class .",0
"A remarkable lecturer and person, easy to approach, breaks out into song during lecture & class and makes things fun/interesting. Don't get me wrong you'll work hard, ie: loads of HW, labs & tests are hard. But worth it! especially if you are a bio major. After this class you'll have strong foundational knowledge in all things cell/molec Bio",1
"To be honest I didnt really care for this class cause I dont like anything related to politics, but this professor was very upfront about it and never sugar coated anything like other professors do. Get ready to read those chapters he assigns after every class meeting and study those key terms cause thats really important.",1
"This class was really easy and I didn't mind having Professor Cornish. The main thing that I didn't like is that she wasn't active with her online students. I never really heard from her throughout the entire semester, just announcements when something would go wrong. It feels like she just forgets about her online students.",1
"She treats the class like elementary schoolers. If anyone says two words, she stops and says ""is my teaching interrupting your conversation?""  Doesn't give a lot of guidelines for the paper.It's just ""Write a critique about whatever you want:a book,a movie,a magazine,a restaurant,a video game, etc."" She is aslo nit-picky about punctuation on papers",0
not very clear when teaching. gives little direction on what to study-says the answers are all right their in front of u in the text but u will have a 10 question test on 30 pages form the boring text... hard to prepare for his class and exams.,0
"Good teacher, teaches the content in a very hands-on way, doing examples with you in class. The main thing I have to fault him on is he's an unnecessarily tough grader. You could demonstrate that you understand the concept by using the correct formulas in the correct ways, but god forbid you miss a negative sign or something because you'll get a 0.",1
If you are not living at home with access to recyclable products this class could become slightly pricey even with trips to the dollar store. If you come to class & work on your projects she will grade you easier. Listen to her tips she will like your project more and she is very nice and makes the class interesting. 1 paper & 1 vocab  quiz,1
"Prof. Van Der Poel literally teaches what's in the book, even using the same examples. She's a stickler for notation and exact solving of each question. Every minor error means a point deduction. If you don't understand something she said, she gets annoyed and asks another student to explain. Be ready to pay $100 to turn in homework online.",0
"Excellent course taught by an excellent professor, Steve really knows his stuff and is passionate about teaching.  Follow his instructions and you will do well in class.  Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended.  Besides, his lectures are so interesting, you won't want to miss them.",1
"I don't understand why people complain so much. He is literally the only professor who tells you exactly what you need to know for the exam. He is good at explaining concepts, and makes class interesting. It is easy to pay attention to him. Watch lecture captures again to process the material.",1
"Aschenbrener was a really good teacher!  I did not always keep up with the assignments.  But I did learn A LOT in her class.  She made it fun and interesting, she really relates herself to the students.  No need to buy a text book which is a bonus!  Only thing I did not like, she picks names out of a cup on popsicle sticks to answer questions.",1
"Not the easiest class, especially since it was all writing. She was often not very clear on what she wanted you to do, although if you took the time to ask she would try to clarify. She likes to get off topic and tell stories, but other than that lectures were pretty boring. She isn't a bad prof though.",1
"If you want to learn how to become an effective communicator with anybody, Mr. I should be your desired professor. His level of caring for students is unparalleled and he gave me useful tools for outside of the classroom. You have to take Mr. I if you need a speech credit!",1
"So far the kindest professor I've met, ever. Even was able to borrow writing materials off of her in the middle of a term test. Lectures are sort of boring but that's more of the course being inherently boring rather than her as she does try to make it enjoyable. Lots of inconsiderate/noisy kids disrespect her however and I wish they'd shut up tbh.",1
"Nice professor but the class is boring, alot of the stuff is repetitive. Dont really need the book, maybe just for the essay. To get an A you must know her powerpoints very well, better off memorizing them.",1
Professor Abrams is the best professor ever. He is very passionate about sociology .I learned so much from is class.  I wish all professors were like him. Very caring.  His exams are not hard . I recommend you take his class. Super teacher.  Nassau community college is lucky to have him.,1
Seems great at first but is bizarrely spiteful when you least expect it and refuses to be proven wrong.  Has blatant favorites.  Watch your step around her and suck up as much as you can early on.,1
Awesome professor totally committed to students and the environment. How can someone so brilliant like Radiohead?,1
"Don't be afraid to talk to Dr. Dewald after lecture, and try to sit up front. He will eventually get to recognize you.   A good TA is critical. TAs do all of the grading and some are more lenient and caring than others. If you don't have a good TA, you will receive a low grade if you don't put in maximal effort.  Sparknotes is your friend.",1
"She is so sweet, like a nice grandma. As long as you do the work you won't have any trouble. The reading notes are a little time consuming, but she grades pretty easy and the presentations are all done in groups. She tells tons of silly stories and shows some old fashioned teaching/parenting videos so be ready for that.",1
"Very passionate about what he teaches. However his lectures and his slides were SUPER complicated and lengthy. His slides had way too much information and most of it was not on the exam. Thankfully, his exams are mostly easy. It's nice to listen to his stories about RNA and DNA, but also sometimes he's really hard to pay attention to.",1
she's awesome she helped me with a different class yesterday when i was stuck for a lab.,1
"Emad was the best math teacher I've had thus far at LBCC. Tried Zugates for 815 but dropped. I am someone who has always struggled in math but when I went on to math 110, I aced the first test which was review from 815. Can't say as much about what I learned in 110. Take good notes and ask questions from homework problems and you will ace his exams",1
"He is THE BEST. Such a sweet guy that I enjoy going to class. The weekly quizzes seem like a pain, but its good for studying and you will see them on your exams and remember them. The course in general is tough and you need to work for a good mark anyways, but Garyen makes is funny and makes lectures interesting. Iclickers every class (easy marks)!",1
"She is a very nice and helpful professor. She is by far one of the best. She is very helpful during office hours. Stop by if you do not understand something during class and she will clear it up. Seven homeworks, Seven quizzes, two exams, one 3-4 page term paper. She is by far the best. It makes up for the term paper.",1
"Phelps is boring but so informative.  He really enjoys art and is knowledgeable.  He is funny in a sarcastic way.  Attend class, do your work, you will pass.  Lectures are long and boring and he says ummm a lot!  ",1
"I had him for Grammar and Comp and am currently taking Reading and Convo with him. He is very willing to help and explain, although he may do a couple of loops before he arrives at the answer. Although I am fluent, I missed two classes and only one homework and still came out with an A. He is very helpful when explaining the future exams in detail.",1
"He keeps the lectures entertaining. Can't really say to much about his grading-- he uses TAs. Ended up with a C+ in the class, but I hate Shakespeare. So, don't take if you're not even remotely interested in the subject.",0
Took her for my 1st and 2nd econ class online. She responds to emails quickly and always answered all my questions. As long as you do your work you will like her. If you turn in late assignments or try to skim by without doing any work she is NOT the teacher for you. You will learn in her class :),1
"Dr.M-H seems to not know what she is talking about most of the time and says ""Um"" every sentence. Considered a ""dr."" but students in the class seem to have more knowledge on lecture topics. Get ready to refer to the text when studying because class notes do little to nothing to aid test preparation. Cherry on top: Clicker attendance taken.",0
"I took her for stats and while I do not think she was good at teaching it, she truly cares about the students. She should be teaching clinical, she is a coauthor! She is sweet and goes out of her way to help students. She even apologized when the material got difficult and she couldn't explain it better. I love this woman.",1
Dr. Currier is an incredible teacher. However the material she wants you to learn is handed to you in great amounts and it is very difficult to learn everything. Her tests are extremely hard unless you read the entire book like 10 times a night. She does offer a lot of extra credit which is a big help.,1
"Worst teacher/professor I've ever had. She's a scatterbrain who loses work, gives inaccurate grades, plays favorites, and is always in a bad mood. She gives free grades out to students who help her with yearbook during class and gives grades based on if she likes you or not. I literally learned not one thing from taking her English Comp class.",0
"She was really easy to listen to and always responded to questions in an efficient manner. Online the class was taught through the textbook so be prepared for two chapters weekly. If you can manage your time wisely, it was easy to get everything done. Students posted meaningful discussions and were easy to engage with. Overall an interesting class.",1
"Easy teacher, just make sure you do all the class work and study for test. She even gives you a study guide.",1
"I love love Dr. Mahosky! She was such an inspiration and you can tell she really truly cares about her subject. She makes you work for your grade and tests you on your knowledge rather than abc choice testing methods. A very fun class, and really opened me to a lot of new perspectives. I am minoring in Disability Studies because of her!",1
Great dude and a great teacher.,1
"TAKE another professor even if you have to wait for next semester. I devoted at least 6-8 hrs daily on chem. You teach yourself. Tests are not similar to worksheets/quizzes as she says. Tests are specifically structured to confuse & throw you off track, no matter how much you study, even switches the periodic table day of exam.",0
"Dr. Du definitely your choice for this class! He starts tough, at least looks like, but he gives a lot curves on the exams after he found out the average is not that high. Class time is the most important personally speaking, he gives a lot using the class time. Plus review session and practice questions for each exam are must!",1
Amazing,1
Professor Juarez is the best ! Took him fall and spring which I definitely learned alot from him and I he is very inspirational to us students!,1
He was a great professor who really helped you out and was a nice guy! It was one of my favorite history classes!,1
"Saralina is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is amazing at getting the energy of the class up and the discussions are always high quality. I did have some trouble getting A's, though. She's a pretty picky grader. ",1
"Honestly, I hated his class. He came off as a nice guy at first but was close minded and rude to people who had other ideas. If you disagreed with his ideas he hated you the rest of the term. He assigned way too much reading for a 244 class. He's a great teacher for suck ups but if you aren't a brown noser and think for yourself watch out.",0
"I love Dr. Haspel. I had him for three classes while he taught at CCCC. ENG 111, ENG 112, and Critical Thinking. He genuinely cares about his students, and goes out of his way to make sure his students are enjoying what they learn. He also goes out of his way to make sure his students succeed.",1
"She's a real gem! I started learning French with her, and I doubt that there is anyone else who could've been a better instructor. Very encouraging and very caring, she prepared lots of interactive exercises for students to interact during class.",1
try and avoid. doesn't respond to emails.,0
"Super full of herself. First class she said ""Don't pay attention to RateMyProfessor reviews."" Thinks she's the greatest teacher ever. Super condescending and rude. VERY clearly favors students for non-academic reasons. Whatever you do, avoid at all costs. Seriously.",0
Excellent teacher.  Always helpful.  Wish he taught more classes.,1
"A very kind professor who does her best to engage with her students. Be wary if you have attention problems, though: especially in her online lectures, she has a droning voice that can make it difficult to focus on what she's actually trying to tell you.",1
"The absolute worst math professor ive ever had. Doesnt know how to teach whatsoever. If you have a question, dont even bother asking because it definitely wont get answered. Makes you teach yourself and if you have a question his answer is ask the person next to you. Terrible. 0/10 professor.",0
I had Professor Romani for a weekend in person CPR class. It was so much fun and I was so happy to be back on campus. There is an online potion to complete. The time went so fast. I learned so much from her. It was a great class. Take her for. CPR.,1
Great teacher. If you pay attention and take notes during class text book may not be required. Very funny in my opionion. Splits sender in 3 terms 3 home work assignments 3 tests 3 quizzes 1 research paper with option to do more for extra credit. Last test is open book open note which was a relief. ,1
GREAT TEACHER!!!,1
"Dr. Searfoss thinks she is the only one that is right. I never want to talk in this class because she never accepts anyone's answers, even though everyone is just giving their analysis of a reading. I am not sure why she even wants the class to participate when no one is right but her. I would not recommend her if you want to feel respected.",0
Best Math Professor in the WORLD!!! I would recommend ANYONE to take his course! He's the best! ^.^,1
"this wasn't technically an online class, but it might as well have been. no lectures, no class work. grading criteria was super clear. i learned a lot in this class. not the easiest, but he lines out exactly what you need to do for each portion of a project. the homework helped with whatever paper was coming up next.",1
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
Professor Winogora is really down to earth. He is super lenient on the homework assignments which are easy. He mostly shows John Green Crash Course videos which are helpful.,1
"Funny guy. He seems to enjoy teaching when the class participates, but if the class lacks energy, he will reciprocate. He's very knowledgeable, but doesn't really show it until he's asked to elaborate on something during a class. The underachiever of instructors, which is comforting as an underachieving student.",1
"Professor Adams gives very delayed feedback and is not good with responding to inquiries. There are unclear expectations for assignments, yet she grades harshly. Very critical. ",0
"he was my advisor i had him for tons of classes. incredibly nice, incredibly boring to listen to him in lecture. however he's very engaging in seminars and real life. plus he's the coolest guy in the PS department",1
"Dr. Kuss is a very bright man. HOWEVER, his lectures are so incredibly boring!! He mumbles, talks to himself, and ALWAYS shows up to class 15 minutes late. It was so hard for me to keep an interest in his class, I found myself not wanting to go. Bring your computer, you'll need some entertainment. (took western civilization I)",0
"One of the best professors hands down, makes the class super clear and her enthusiasm she brings to class makes class enjoyable. Take her if you get the chance!",1
"One of the best professors I have had. You do have 1 presentation of 10 minutes but she is by no means a hard grader. The best part is that she tells you exactly what powerpoints to study for the 3 exams you have and better yet the final is a cumulative of the 3 exams, its a given to pass. Also allows for make up work and labs to be done in groups.",1
Very nice. Very helpful. Very caring. Really makes class interesting for 7:30 in the morning! :),1
Get ready to work really hard. Midterm test was very lengthy and tricky as it was open book exam. Project was weighted 50%. So you must have good team in order to score good grades. Lectures were interesting and with practical approach. Go for this if you want to learn something and ready to work hard.,1
"I took her English 1A class and it was really boring. She's a sweet teacher and really takes her time to explain what needs to be done and how to write. However, it's at a much lower level than what most of the class seems to be at. She isn't a bad teacher, but I wish I had a more challenging teacher.",1
"I took physics 4B in summer, and everyone said it is really a tough class. But, I would say he is the best Physics professor in SJCC. Just study regularly and he asked most of the questions from his lecture slides and quizzes. Although you have to buy webassign for homework, I would say it is really worth it.",1
"Amy inspired me to pursue a major in Bioethics after taking her class. The material is very interesting and her lecture style is clear, easy to listen to. She is very approachable and understanding, so many students engage in the conversation in her class, she sets up the perfect environment for productive discussion.",1
I will never pick this teacher again. Makes things more difficult than they really are. Places doubt in students instead of encouraging them. Adds more stress to lesson plan than there should be.,0
compassionate and caring student. cares about student's lives. covers basics of research writing.,1
"A bit boring at times, but overall he's a fine teacher. He cares about what he's teaching which shows, but the class itself is not for everyone.",1
Yemut gets frustrated when students ask questions... rolls eyes and goes fast when going over the material. He will ask if anyone has questions but expresses irritation if a question is asked and has a strong accent. I used to love math but since i've taken his class i now hate math,0
Professor Michelle Lorimer is a great professor but she has very long and boring lectures. She is genuinely kind and caring to one's needs. There is a lot of reading but it is pretty easy. There are little quizzes that you have to complete but they are very easy. Make sure to take notes during lecture. Study the material before the test.,1
"Dr. Neupane was absolutely amazing! I took him for a five week physics course. It was extremely challenging; however, he was always available before and after class for additional help. In addition, he was very fair with grading, and he truly wanted his students to do well in the course! I would take him over and over again!",1
Awesome teacher! I took a lot from this class! Highly reccomend :),1
"She an amazing teacher. Very caring and helful. If you need help, ask her;  office hours, email, in class, she really helpful. One time I emailed her at 9:30pm and she responed back with a half hour! I will be taking 102 with her.",1
"This is not a very difficult class and if you show up he will gladly help you. I got A's on all of the tests and hw, if you do not understand the material at first he'll help you learn it. I found the class interesting & even funny sommetimes",1
"He's a great professor. Not afraid to contradict you in class, so you'd better have tough skin!",1
"Professor Allen is knowledgeable and funny. Sometimes his lectures are really boring, but he shows a lot of great movies and books. I think his grading is fair as long as you pay attention in class and read his notes online.",1
"Ms. Carter was professional and consistent with her teaching and helpful qualities. She applied real life examples of her work to the lessons so that we could understand the material  rather than memorizing, which most are use to Students who had issues with her were those who thought they would get good grades and not work for it Class had several",1
"BEST GEO LAB TEACHER U CAN GET. very nice, generous guy!",1
Potvin is a great teacher! His class is a modeling class so it is not a normal lecture nor a normal lab. If you're not comfortable with engaging with other students I do not recommend this class for you. He also doesn't give you a straight answer in the middle of discussions so that's a warning. You will constantly be changing who you work with!,1
"Dr. Stoner was one of the best professors I have ever had. I have had him for two undergraduate courses and two graduate courses and he served on both my undergrad thesis and masters defense committees. He genuinely cares about students learning and producing the best work they can. If you're looking for an A without trying, maybe look elsewhere.",1
Marketing research is the most difficult class in the marketing track. You should take this class when your fresh out of stats because it will come in handy. The tests are a bear not. Whole lot of people get as on them. Dr Mack comes off very intense but she lightens up toward the end of the semester so don't let her scare you. The book is like reading a dictionary which makes studying for the tests difficult. Overall I learned a lot.,1
"Grading is based on only a few papers he gives, but he is a very fair grader. I genuinely enjoyed all of his lectures, you will learn from them because he's very interesting. Only down-side is that he is stricter than any professor I've ever had regarding laptop or smartphone use, he is pretty old-fashioned with his view of the classroom.",1
Horrible Instructor. Does not communicate whatsoever. Pretty much getting paid for setting up blackboard & leaves you on you own afterwards.,0
"Prepare to do a lot of research if you take this class. This professor did provide feedback on the graded work, but even with the feedback, I was still uncertain why some forums were marked down and others were not. The tests and assignments are very time-consuming and work-intensive.  Overall, it was a difficult and frustrating class.",0
She is interesting and entertaining. However she grades very hard. I received a B- on an assignment that I spent so much time and was very concise and well done.,1
He does not teach. His notes don't explain anything and are written in the format of a horrible textbook. His exams are very hard and require derivations that no one in the class can complete.... which would be fine if they were anything we actually learned. Unorganized and one of the worst professors I've had in CHE,0
"Shes a nice lady, but not the best teacher.  Most of the time our class had no direction.  A lot of people just never came.",0
"She was the best teacher I have ever had! I was sad to hear she was not coming back. She showed interest in the class and preferred to have discussion rather than lecture, which made class more interesting.",1
"She's very fun, very nice, and very funny. However, sometimes you feel you arn't learning as much as you could.",1
she hardly helped with any questions I asked over email. Her powerpoint lectures don't really help with the tests because she asks tough detailed questions from it. Her assignments are pretty straight forward but her interaction with students is poor so you have to be good with teaching yourself the material given,0
This guy gives a lot of tough love in the classroom.   He made the girl next to me cry one day;  but that is his style.  I would go with someone else next time. He is a little too harsh for my taste. ,0
"Very nice guy, but not a good professor. Hard to understand, little information in his lecture slides, and his tests required so much detail over a lot of information, which  made it difficult to succeed. Try to get a different professor if you can.",0
"After reading some of Kari's reviews on RMP I was slightly hesitant to take her class, but she was an awesome teacher. She was super caring, took time to explain the concept until we all understood, and made her lectures interactive. I have no complaints from taking her class. She is a solid choice for a math teacher!",1
"not too many tests, not too much partner work or group projects, will always ask for examples when you answer a question, lectures a lot, most content is not on test/ exams. assigns paper every week",1
"Tough Professor util you figure out his style, then he becomes easy.  This was my second class with him and I was ready for what was expected before I logged in the first tiem",1
"He is very professional, makes you read to know the material, and write papers every other week, while taking quizzes the opposite week. Really learn about society from him. Very good class and very knowledgeable.",1
"Christopher is an amazing teacher, he hardly gives out homework, for the whole semester he only gave 2 essays in which he help you through it the entire time. The only way you can fail is if you don't show up and don't do the little bit of homework he assign. He's very laid back and the most chilling teacher I ever met. I would take him again.",1
Mr. Joe is AWESOME!,1
"Prof Wittman was an excellent teacher.  Attendance isn't mandatory but really helps.  This guy tells great stories and illustrations which helped me learn the med terms.  He really knows his stuff and keeps the long hours from being a snooze fest. Plus, he's really good looking, which helps, too.  Lol",1
"Mrs. Johnson is very nice and wants her students to succeed.  Notes are printed off of blackboard and the tests are based off of these notes.  The only marginally hard part of the class is typing up the Sociological journal which is due mid-semester.  After the journal is finished, just study your notes and the tests are a breeze.",1
One of my favorite professors! I didnt learn a ton in this class but everyday was a really good time! Extremely nice man who makes it almost impossible not to get a 4.0,1
"Pretty easy class if you've already taken a lot of science classes like I had. He does a great job of spelling out the entire semester from day one. No need to buy the textbook; everything you need to know for the quiz is on the study guide. Lecture tends to drag, but it's only once a week. I wish he taught more classes. I would take him again.",1
"it was an easy class. i didn't do well on 4 exams and i passed with a b ,and he is very helpful. the class was never boring because he gets the entire class talking in spanish",1
"Sharon London makes her acting class a lot of fun and everyone in your class will become close with each other. Warning: you have to be willing to make a complete fool of yourself and not care what anyone thinks. If you engage completely in every activity, you'll do fine and the time will pass by quickly. ",1
I am not so very good at English but she made sure I knew what to do and I did it and I passed and I am happy about the grade and her helping me.,1
"Took paper book and press with her. I loved it. I thought she was supportive, definitely excited by everyone's work, an easy grader. It's also a great syllabus - papermaking + bookmaking. (I learned letterpress with another student.) Awesome to get access to all three studios at once!! Great for self-motivated students",1
"This was Dr. Nelson's first year teaching this class. Although he has taught astronomy for several years at Drake & is an amazing teacher, this was most definitely the hardest class I have taken. Teaching styles did not match up to advantage students and made many mistakes that confused the class. He is super accommodating and cares about students",0
She just goes off essentially copying the textbook.  Kinda helpful outside of class.  Not concerned with students understanding the material during class,1
