0,1000% recommend this teacher to anybody. I was so nervous to take Bio online but she made it so easy. Yes it takes time to watch her lectures but thats with any bio class. Every week you have a 10 question lab quiz and around every 4 weeks is an exam. Stay on the work and you have no problem passing this class. She is amazing and incredible.,5.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley,1
1,"This was an online class and each week, there were anywhere from 2 hours to upwards of 3-4 hours of lectures you had to watch. This is added on top of the weekly lab assignment you have to do. There is a quiz every week, but they're all open note. Tests aren't open note and make sure you study or it's gonna be pretty difficult.",4.0,4.0,Virginia Dudley,0
2,"Dont waste your time with this professor. Nice person, but terrible teacher. If youre not a strong test taker, you will not survive. Also have fun purchasing a brand new text book, Lab Manual, Lab Guide AND online software (which you wont even use) no opportunity to earn any points other than the 3 100 point exams and quizzes every Mon/Wed.",2.0,5.0,Virginia Dudley,0
3,"When I first started the class I swore I would give her a bad review, but as the semester progressed she began to grow on me. She can be very firm with students who are not paying attention and put them on the spot, but she has a heart of gold and I ended up enjoying her class. Field trips are fun, you get to go to the beach (:",4.0,4.0,Virginia Dudley,1
4,"Oh my GOODNESS - I just want to say that Professor Dudley was the best professor I have had. However, if you are looking for an ""easy A"" this is not the class for you. You need to show up, do your work, pay attention (this is easy because she is hilarious and a great storyteller). I got the book but really didnt use it - all info in class on PP.",5.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley,1
5,"It's always nice when you get a teacher who is obviously experienced in their field outside of teaching, and professor Dudley is that. The only negative that I've experienced in class is that labs usually have a long block of explanation that is only done because not everyone in the class reads the directions beforehand. The dissections are smelly!",4.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley,1
6,Horrible.. no passion to actually teach. Seems like she likes to assert her authority or dominance onto students. Constantly makes kids feel uncomfortable in the middle of a lecture. Very unprofessional presence in the classroom. Doesnt know what partial credit means. All She is good for is putting your test threw the scantron.,1.0,4.0,Virginia Dudley,0
7,I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,1.0,5.0,Virginia Dudley,0

9,"She was like a guide introducing us to this brand new world that you can tell she was passionate about. Was the class hard? Yes! However, its better to learn from someone with her knowledge about the ocean than just out of a textbook. Do not miss the field trips. Theyre incredible!",5.0,4.0,Virginia Dudley,1
10,"She missed a field trip and made the students do it again to make up the work. She talked about herself a lot, too. Generally speaking, I found that the best way to learn the subject was to ignore her. The class itself was easy (especially since she has 60-79% as a C, with A and B being normal), but not because of her teaching by any means.",2.0,2.0,Virginia Dudley,0
11,"She's a really good teacher, just go to class take notes and you will pass easily. You get a study guide and a lecture guide that are both super helpful for the tests, there isn't much homework but you must attend the lab or you won't pass. Overall its an easy and interesting class as long as you put in a bit of effort.",4.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley,1
12,"This was a great course. At first I thought it would be difficult because of the diverse nature of the ocean, however the professor provided all the tools needed to succeed. She also didn't have any hidden or tricky questions and the course was very straightforward. I also walked away with a better understanding of the way tides worked.",5.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley,1
13,"A very smart professor with lots of intellectual qualities, yes with too much writing in her class also 3 or 4 heavy tests and like 12 lab quizzes but at the end a professor with to much knowledge in biology and zoology",5.0,4.0,Virginia Dudley,1
14,"Prof. Dudley's class is hard, but it isn't really her fault. Marine bio just isn't as fun as it sounds. Attendance to class and labs is mandatory. The labs are gross. The class is easier if you do the reading. She's very intelligent and the tests reflect the lecture material. Outside field trips were boring. This class is loaded with females.",4.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley,1
15,"Dudley is an amazing professor who cares about students and is naturally funny. She's very enthusiastic and passionate about marine biology! Be sure to show up to lectures because those notes will be important. The labs she assigns are incredibly fun and informational, especially the field labs. Not much effort beyond notes and occasional reading.",5.0,2.0,Virginia Dudley,1
16,Don't take this class if you have no business learning about marine biology. Tried to reach her many times regarding my grade and if there were things I could do to better it but she was never any help. She loves to talk about herself and is always making rude comments about perfectionists and ppl with OCD me. Not very nice and voice is annoyin,1.0,5.0,Virginia Dudley,0
17,"She's really nice if you get on her good side. The class is hard and she's very passionate about the subject, so be prepared to work really hard! Talks forever but if you start your work while she talks in lab you'll get out faster; take good notes in lecture and you'll be fine!",5.0,5.0,Virginia Dudley,1
18,Gets in your face a lot. Treats you as if you're still in Middle School. I wouldn't recommend her class at all. Less than half of the class stayed for her class before I left.,1.0,5.0,Virginia Dudley,0
19,"She's super sweet, and even gives the class a few laughs each lecture. Lectures are long, take a LOT of notes. Tests are the majority of your grade and can be extremely hard, especially if you do not study days before. Overall, she is great at teaching.",4.0,4.0,Virginia Dudley,1

27,"Very dismissive. Makes no effort to answer questions in detail. Very tough/unfair marking. Stubborn/unwilling to make accomodations to help students, even in difficult times like COVID.

28,"After reading the other reviews here, I think we can all agree on the fact that she's absolutely horrible at answering Piazza posts. She never actually answers your questions, she only dodges it, asking you to find the answer yourself (I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't need clarification!!) Lazy and very rude with her comments. One of the worst.",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers,0
29,"I've never met a prof who specifies using a (TERRIBLE) template for submitting assignments and refuses to let students add/remove space after questions. There's not enough space and all she can say is ""you can format it to fit"". These are equations we're talking about, NOT a resume. Assignments are also not on the actual content ""taught"". Horrible.",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers,0
30,"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again.

37,Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class?

40,"Professor Schap's lectures are fast-paced and pretty confusing. He assigns a lot of textbook reading and practice problems that are not graded.

If you take this class, do the extra work because it will be to your benefit in the end.",2.0,4.0,David Schap,0
41,"Very nice man, but this class was awful. He assigned YouTube videos instead of teaching and yet gave the hardest exams and homework I have ever had to do.

Run!!",2.0,5.0,David Schap,0
42,"If you enjoy submitting assignments and being deducted points for your PDF quality, then this is the course for you! Prof. Schap is your typical tenured professor: could care less about his students. Tests are super hard and do not reflect the material taught. TAKE THIS COURSE OVER THE SUMMER AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS!!!!!!",1.0,5.0,David Schap,0
43,"Professor Schap will hold you well over the time period every single, showing a blatant lack of respect for students as individuals outside of his class. He also decided to send us links to YouTube videos halfway through the semester and watched those instead of class. I payed a lot of money to watch random YouTube videos. Frustrating.",1.0,3.0,David Schap,0
44,"Honestly Professor Schap is actually really enjoyable and can be funny in lecture. However, his material is very challenging and he grades tough. Every class will go 5 minutes over so be prepared for that if you have a class after. Additionally reading the text and doing the problem sets are a must to do well in the course.",2.0,5.0,David Schap,0

47,Id rather transfer than take this class again. The class is an hour despite the 50 minutes allotted for the class. For the sake of your mental health do not take this class.

59,"McDonald is the best professor I've had so far in college. His lectures are interesting and funny. Only real grades are the mid-term, final, large 12pg paper and small 8pg paper. His exams are tricky and he grades more on concepts rather than facts. Study the examples he uses in class and try to see how you could recreate those experiments.",5.0,4.0,John McDonald,1
60,"major grades are the midterm, final, a 12 page paper and an 8 page paper. Papers are not fun to write but he gives you ample time to complete them, and grades fairly. Pay attention in lectures because there is no way to access the material outside of class (no udcapture,textbook, or posted powerpoints). he's hilarious and lectures are interesting",5.0,3.0,John McDonald,1
61,"Dr. McDonald is passionate about what he's teaching, and I got the impression that he loves teaching his students and preparing them for what actually ""doing Biology"" is going to look like.

62,Probably wont get an A but he's a great lecturer and interesting person,5.0,4.0,John McDonald,1

68,"McDonald does an amazing job teaching this class. Despite it technically being a statistics class, you do absolutely no math in it.

No CC or slides, he writes on a chalkboard, so show up !",5.0,4.0,John McDonald,1
69,Dr. McDonald is probably the best teacher I've had at UD. His teaching style makes it necessary to always be paying attention which helps you learn the material very well The exam material is not hard but you need to make sure you know everything really well or you will struggle.

72,McDonald's lab is probably one of the better classes I've taken here. You learn a lot of technical procedures (get ready to do 5 hours of gel electro. every week) but it is useful and you get enough time and leeway to do everything required. McDonald is also a notoriously easy grader and just a really nice guy. PS. don't take if you hate bugs!,5.0,1.0,John McDonald,1
73,"Dr. McDonald is a great and funny professor. You will not regret taking your required investigative lab with him. A 5 hour lecture one day a week seems like a lot, but this way you do most of your work (and even outside work) during class time. He puts in a lot of effort to help you and the class is EXTREMELY easygoing just like him.",5.0,2.0,John McDonald,1
74,"Dr. McDonald is a great professor; he keeps students engaged by randomly calling on them during lecture (it's not as bad as it seems) and presents the materials in an easy and understanding way.

123,"Good prof who knows her material and seems to teach thoroughly enough. Be sure to go to EVERY class and do EVERY reading; the exams are dependent on the readings much more than the lectures.

There is a very heavy workload as well.",4.0,3.0,Adelle Forth,1

Note: this class was taken online during COVID lockdown",5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham,1

145,"Great teacher that runs a no BS class. Grades are calculated entirely off of tests/quizzes, which he will prepare you well for.

Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",1.0,5.0,Micheal Graham,0

You have to really put in the effort and take it upon yourself to practice the material.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham,1
150,He teaches in a way that is easy to understand and will answer any question you have. He always has exams and quizzes graded by the next class day.

He never has anything in the exam that he didn't focus on.,5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham,1
151,His class was thorough and very easy to follow he explained everything perfectly and answered all questions when asked.

152,"Compared to other math professors, Graham is pretty good. His lectures are pretty easy to follow, and he explains things better than most. He does not grade on a curve however, and will be pretty tough on grading. He does 4 exams, a final and 10 quizzes for credit. Quizzes can be done as a group. He also assigns homework, but it's optional.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham,1
153,"Graham is a really nice guy and you can tell he actually wants to be there. The class mainly consisted of quizzes, 4 big exams, and the Final.

If you miss a quiz day, you receive a 0, but he dropped the 2 lowest quiz scores.",4.0,3.0,Micheal Graham,1

I highly recommend that you take him.",5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham,1

158,"There are many negative comments about Professor Graham's class. However, after taking his class I disagree. He won't give you an easy A and makes you work for your grade but he has a really good handle on the material, explains clearly and thoroughly, and is more than willing to meet after class. I wish I could take him again for Calc 4.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham,1

Also he's really funny despite what anyone else says.",5.0,3.0,Darwin Davis,1

219,"Clawson is really caring and interested in his students so it's an easy class to pass, although there is A LOT of reading which is important to quizzes (a pretty big part of your grade) and the final exam. There's a big paper but its very doable and Dan is very easy to work with. Lectures get a bit tedious but can be though provoking",4.0,3.0,Dan Clawson,1
220,This class was definitely not what I thought it would be. Heavily reading based. If you read the articles you'll be fine and he gives you opportunities to miss some of the reaction papers he assigns. The book essay is a big part of your grade: START IT EARLY! Overall he's an okay teacher but kind of boring and the class is not based on medications.,3.0,3.0,Dan Clawson,0

224,"Class was ok. Had an option to complete a certain # out of total assignments. Was always pushing deadlines back. He did tell me it was ok to take on a topic that has yet to be researched, went thru ideas for the paper, told me i needed to find research on it on graded last edit? that was a bit annoying. Nice guy. not very interesting. dont avoid",4.5,2.0,Dan Clawson,1
225,"Well I did learn a lot and enjoyed most of the readings. We had three papers and an optional final. All of class is just one big lecture with a small group of students that always participate. One time he was heading towards a biological determinism argument (crazy I know), and I think that was the highlight of my experience as a sociology major ha",4.5,3.0,Dan Clawson,1
226,"He has his agenda like so many others here. And though he appears to be erudite, he cannot help but be married to his radical politics. Well this is UMass at Amherst. I cannot wait to get into classes about reality.",2.5,1.0,Dan Clawson,0
227,"Dan is an awesome professor, so intelligent.  I was both a student in his class and a TA for him as well.  He's very reasonable.

DONT take it.  dan doesn't talk about anything real during class, just rambles on about his opinion on stuff and then will give you random facts to write down so you can write the essays well. paper due every week, do all of them. and id write all the essays so that you can get a good grade. go to class because of random quizzes.",2.0,5.0,Dan Clawson,0

238,"my suggestion would be to avoid taking this class at all costs. clawson drags lectures on and on, and is a kind of a jerk. there are 6 pop quizzes so while going to class is worse than watching your grandma clip her toenails, it's kind of necessary since you don't know when there will be a quiz. the only upside is not having to take the final.",1.5,3.0,Dan Clawson,0
239,"He doesn't provide feedback on the quizzes/test, so if you get something wrong, which you most likely will with how strict of a grader he is, it feels extremely bad. All he does for lectures are homework problems and he offers no real guidance for students. If you want an A, it'll be really difficult depending on your own math skills.",1.0,4.0,James Schubert,0
240,"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",1.0,4.0,James Schubert,0
241,"Nice guy, but GOD does he grade hard. If it was in person I would collapse from the work load. It's worth it because I learned the material. Like learned learned. Online is super flexible, doesn't mandate attendance. If you do the homework on pace, use it for the weekly quizzes, & use the textbook, you'll get an A. He drops 3 lowest.",4.0,4.0,James Schubert,1
242,TAKE HIM ONLY IF ur taking this class online. I took him couple years ago and failed the class then retook him online this summer and got an A! He posts all lectures on canvas and they help a ton during quizzes and exams- which he gives 24 hrs for. Very tough grader so just triple check ur work before submitting it. A lot of HW but its 10% EC!,4.0,2.0,James Schubert,1
243,"Schubert teaches slow enough for everyone to understand and is easily approachable to ask questions. He doesn't use Canvas and at times, he would go on a tangent and talk about his personal life stories; nonetheless, I recommend to take him for Math3!",4.0,3.0,James Schubert,1
244,He assigns a lot of homework and the 5 tests plus the final are the most important to your grade. He drops the worst test score and doubles the points of the final to help you boost your grade up. He has a different style of grading so be sure to ask questions early on.,3.0,4.0,James Schubert,1
245,"I took this class for my major for fall semester. Hes really funny in the beginning like what all Professors will do. When he lecture, someone ask questions, he would somehow answer it but the student still dont get it. I would rate more but the characters are limited. My advice is that if youre majoring math and want good grade then avoid him.",1.0,5.0,James Schubert,0
246,"Got to be the worst professor at PCC. His lectures are so boring, I would actually find it more entertaining to watch paint dry on the wall. And his tests are ridiculous. I feel bad whoever is taking him next semester, they don't know what their signing up for - AVOID this guy.",1.0,5.0,James Schubert,0
247,Schubert's Math 5A class was difficult. He expects you to know everything that he's teaching already. He works on problems on the board and basically solves it & talks to himself and asks the class if what he was doing was right and that's basically the whole lecture. He doesn't teach you how to solve the problem or say why he's solving it that way,1.0,4.0,James Schubert,0
248,"This professor is a very hard grader, points are taken off tests because of not writing parenthesis, or an equal sign. He is very disrespectful, the very first day of school he told us he was only trying to help and that we could look at him as our favorite grandpa, three weeks later he refused to answer questions. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!!",1.0,5.0,James Schubert,0
249,He refuses to use Canvas or email so contacting him outside of class is a hassle. He rarely takes time to explain the lessons so he almost expects you to know what he's doing. It's honestly easier to learn from the textbook than from his lectures. His tests seem simple but his grading makes it difficult. Just horrible and difficult.,1.0,4.0,James Schubert,0

252,"Honestly, one of the worst experiences Ive had with a professor in general. As a person, hes a good guy but when it comes to teaching the class and grading not so much. Very specific on his grading and will deduct points for missing a lim or parenthesis or something minor. No study guides. Gives hardest version of questions on test.",1.0,4.0,James Schubert,0
253,He is an old man. He makes lectures boring and gives only a limited amount of extra credit to a few students. He gives too much homework problems to do. He makes mistakes that involves math and sitting on his own glasses (Best Moment of his Class). He is disrespectful. He takes points off small details. He makes people feel bad. He shouldn't teach,1.0,5.0,James Schubert, 0
254,Tbh his teaching is not that good. He can't explain concepts well and it is confusing even to me as a student who have taken calculus before. But he is very organized in his class and test schedules. He give extra credits. Has a lot of hw to do. Tests are not too difficult. Wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't already know the materials.,2.0,3.0,James Schubert,0
255,"This has been my worst teacher in my time at PCC. Schubert does not teach well at all. He does all the problems and lectures with his back to the class and by the time he turns around, he's completed the whole problem and blocked it. Anytime someone asks for help he either says, you should of learned it in the last math or go to tutoring. TERRIBLE!",1.0,5.0,James Schubert,0
256,"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already.

282,His response to the events of the pandemic was unfortunate and unprofessional. I was embarrassed for him. Seemed to lack any self-awareness.

286,Attendance isn't graded but encouraged. His slides are online but he includes info on tests within each lecture. Never actually used the book.

288,I really enjoyed this professor. His lectures were lengthy and can get boring if youre not super into soil science but he is hilarious and keeps things interesting.
