1,4500 words report + 1.5 hr quiz for final. NEVER answer your question properly. Whatever you say is a complaint.,1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers
2,"She is the worst prof I've ever had. If you ask her a question, all she ever replies with is ""read the textbook"" which is also written very poorly. The Mobius quizzes are the literal definition of torture. It is timed 1h and you won't know how many questions there are (involves a lot of calculations as well). I don't understand why she is a prof.",1.0,5.0,Cyntha Struthers
3,"worst prof ever, doesn't want to help students, makes everything so difficult for students, stay away",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers
4,"This is her response after she put up a misleading question in a quiz ""Not all facts you are given on a test (and life!) need to be asked in such a way that NO person will ever make a mistake. The onus is on the student to read the question well and think!"" (while in fact, almost everyone misunderstood the question and got wrong answer) What a joke",1.0,5.0,Cyntha Struthers
5,AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!!!,1.0,5.0,Cyntha Struthers
6,"Worst professor ever. Her lecture videos are completely useless. I learned better through reading the course notes. Kept making mistakes in quizzes and penalize students for her own mistake. She has never ever admitted that she made a mistake, even when it's very obvious that the question had an incorrect solution or worded ambiguously. Avoid her!",1.0,3.0,Cyntha Struthers
7,"Very dismissive. Makes no effort to answer questions in detail. Very tough/unfair marking. Stubborn/unwilling to make accomodations to help students, even in difficult times like COVID. Uses same assignments each term, so no solutions are released and you can't know where you messed up. Interesting course, but she is not a good prof in my opinion.",1.0,3.0,Cyntha Struthers
8,"After reading the other reviews here, I think we can all agree on the fact that she's absolutely horrible at answering Piazza posts. She never actually answers your questions, she only dodges it, asking you to find the answer yourself (I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't need clarification!!) Lazy and very rude with her comments. One of the worst.",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers
9,"I've never met a prof who specifies using a (TERRIBLE) template for submitting assignments and refuses to let students add/remove space after questions. There's not enough space and all she can say is ""you can format it to fit"". These are equations we're talking about, NOT a resume. Assignments are also not on the actual content ""taught"". Horrible.",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers
10,"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again. The content of the final assignment was entirely around coding in R when the there has been literally no content covering R until that point. An absolute embarrassment.",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers
11,Tough grader. Rude. Stubborn.,1.0,2.0,Cyntha Struthers
12,Lets you write a cheat sheet and the exams were very similar to the practice exams. Taking this course with her online is a really hard to screw up.,4.0,3.0,Cyntha Struthers
13,She explains stuff very clearly and always willing to answer questions! Very engaging during lectures. Exams are fair!,5.0,3.0,Cyntha Struthers
14,Absolutely awful. Not helpful to students who approach and has the most terrible marking scheme. Avoid her class.,1.0,1.0,Cyntha Struthers
15,Stubborn and unaccommodating professor. Not willing to help students who approach her. Doesn't consider student feedback at all -- 0/10 would not recommend,1.0,1.0,Cyntha Struthers
16,"Extremely rude professor. Not very helpful to student responses, more often to just respond with a snark comment. Poor teaching skills, and course coordination skills. Doesn't listen to student feedback.",1.0,3.0,Cyntha Struthers
17,Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class? She doesn't consider if people would get injured on a slippery road when rushing from another classroom far from hers. Tends to give everyone lowmark,1.0,2.0,Cyntha Struthers
18,The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,1.0,3.0,Cyntha Struthers
19,"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",1.0,4.0,Cyntha Struthers
20,"I have taken about 6 classes with Professor Graham. While the material assigned is somewhat time consuming, the lectures are straightforward and Professor Graham is very good at responding to emails and providing help. I feel like he cares about his students and I'm sad that this is my last math class as I'd gladly take him again.",5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
21,"Took it online. Was available, had everything ready on time and split it into digestible chunks. Took an online teaching course beforehand and it showed. Really tried hard to help us succeed in the pandemic. Hilarious dry humor.",5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
22,"Professor Graham provided immediate feedback on homework and exams. Very well organized! There were almost daily webassign homework assignments, 11 or 12 written assignments, 4 exams and a final. This is a lot of work, but getting a poor score on one exam won't tank your grade. Note: this class was taken online during COVID lockdown",5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
23,"I wish I didn't take the advice from people leaving reviews here. I do not care how good you think you are at math this guy was a rude awakening for me. It wasn't until I started skipping class and teaching it to myself did I improve. Marks you down for doing math problems ""in a way that is confusing"" to him even if you get the right answer. Run.",2.0,5.0,Micheal Graham
24,"You will never fall asleep in Graham's lectures. He keeps them very interesting and rarely goes on tangents. The course work was difficult as expected, but whatever you do, do not get behind on homework. All in all a great professor who loves what he does, answering questions, and has a deep understanding of math.",5.0,4.0,Micheal Graham
25,"Graham is awful. His quizzes are unscheduled and so much of the quiz material isnt taught before the quiz is given. The tests are worth way more than they should be. You can fall as many quizzes as you want and be fine, but if you do bad on one test you may as well kiss your grade goodbye unless you do amazing on everything else.",1.0,4.0,Micheal Graham
26,"Great teacher that runs a no BS class. Grades are calculated entirely off of tests/quizzes, which he will prepare you well for. Homework is optional, allowing you the freedom to let yourself fail if you don't take the class seriously and practice, but also allows for more flexibility in your studies. Your grade will be a reflection of your effort",4.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
27,"He gives a lot of tests, non mandatory homeworks and is a tough grader but he is a great teacher and is always willing to work with you",5.0,5.0,Micheal Graham
28,"Graham should never be able to teach a college class again. If you want your GPA to get bent over then take his class. If you want someone who just expects you to learn everything on your own then take Graham, everyone I talked to from my class was also failing all quarter long. Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",1.0,5.0,Micheal Graham
29,"He was so bad I had to drop his class. Grades quizzes and exams only, assigns homework, but wont grade it so it cant help offset a bad exam. He is nice, but his lectures are confusing to the point it looks like he has never taught. I talked to ex-peers and they all told me he is pretty bad and were at major risk for not passing.",1.0,5.0,Micheal Graham
30,"He is a good teacher and an entertaining lecturer, but he gives you a list of problems and does not assign graded home work. the only things that count towards your grade are tests and quizzes. You have to really put in the effort and take it upon yourself to practice the material.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham
31,He teaches in a way that is easy to understand and will answer any question you have. He always has exams and quizzes graded by the next class day. He has an exam about every two weeks but he lets you know every concept you need to for the exam the day before so you can prepare. He never has anything in the exam that he didn't focus on.,5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
32,His class was thorough and very easy to follow he explained everything perfectly and answered all questions when asked. He does have random quizzes Which threw me off at first and he won't announce test so check the syllabus in advance also on the Note of quizzes he allows you to partner quiz almost the entire quarter.,4.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
33,"Compared to other math professors, Graham is pretty good. His lectures are pretty easy to follow, and he explains things better than most. He does not grade on a curve however, and will be pretty tough on grading. He does 4 exams, a final and 10 quizzes for credit. Quizzes can be done as a group. He also assigns homework, but it's optional.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham
34,"Graham is a really nice guy and you can tell he actually wants to be there. The class mainly consisted of quizzes, 4 big exams, and the Final. The quizzes, however, were more like in class assignments, because you can work together and even ask him for help. If you miss a quiz day, you receive a 0, but he dropped the 2 lowest quiz scores.",4.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
35,"Graham is Graham. He is a very good teacher and extremely thorough if you show up every day, which is awesome. He assigns homework, but you don't have to do it (I recommend you do) and he's a very rough grader on the test. He wants you to know the subject, but I also am not sure if he really cares if you don't.",4.0,5.0,Micheal Graham
36,"Dr. Graham is one of the best teachers I've had. He explains things in a clear fashion, often explaining in a "" how I would do it"" fashion. Never shoots down students ideas or questions, but explores them. Lots of pop quizzes, but you are able to opt out of them if you want. He does not assign homework either. I highly recommend that you take him.",5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham
37,His exams are really hard no matter how much you study you still fail. Dreaded going to his class. He is nice but hard.,1.0,5.0,Micheal Graham
38,He is a fast teacher and can be difficult to follow in class. He can make simple concepts more complicated than they seem. I had a tutor I met with three times a week and still got consistent Cs and Ds on tests. The quizzes are helpful but his class does not prepare you for his difficult exams.,2.0,4.0,Micheal Graham
39,"There are many negative comments about Professor Graham's class. However, after taking his class I disagree. He won't give you an easy A and makes you work for your grade but he has a really good handle on the material, explains clearly and thoroughly, and is more than willing to meet after class. I wish I could take him again for Calc 4.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham
40,She really teaches you to design and pushed your natural creativity. It is a shame many students try and take advantage of her supportive and kind nature. She doesn't let them get away with it thought! A gem to MU.,5.0,2.0,Jeri Robinson-Lawrence
41,"Jeri's a sweetheart, easily my favorite prof in the design department.

A really fun, positive learning experience... can't wait to have more classes with her.",5.0,2.0,Jeri Robinson-Lawrence
42,Jeri is an extremely fair grader and you dont need to be an artist in order to pass her class.

She has a sheep farm and a puppy she loves.",5.0,1.0,Jeri Robinson-Lawrence

47,Jeri is an absolutely amazing teacher. I'm looking forward to  taking another class with her in the future. She grades all work very fairly and is willing to help you with just about anything.

49,"A great professor and a great department head. She can be hard to get hold of out of class, but she does try. Will sometimes miss classes, but since this is usually due to family matters it's understandable. Only problem I had with her classes is that the book was more or less unused beyond its glossary.",5.0,2.0,Jeri Robinson-Lawrence

51,"For having a class that was way too full, she was really good at being involved.  She always made you feel really good about your art no matter how bad you thought it was.

There's a big paper but its very doable and Dan is very easy to work with. Lectures get a bit tedious but can be though provoking",4.0,3.0,Dan Clawson
61,This class was definitely not what I thought it would be. Heavily reading based. If you read the articles you'll be fine and he gives you opportunities to miss some of the reaction papers he assigns. The book essay is a big part of your grade: START IT EARLY! Overall he's an okay teacher but kind of boring and the class is not based on medications.,3.0,3.0,Dan Clawson

He did tell me it was ok to take on a topic that has yet to be researched, went thru ideas for the paper, told me i needed to find research on it on graded last edit? that was a bit annoying. Nice guy. not very interesting. dont avoid",4.5,2.0,Dan Clawson
66,"Well I did learn a lot and enjoyed most of the readings. We had three papers and an optional final. All of class is just one big lecture with a small group of students that always participate. One time he was heading towards a biological determinism argument (crazy I know), and I think that was the highlight of my experience as a sociology major ha",4.5,3.0,Dan Clawson
67,"He has his agenda like so many others here. And though he appears to be erudite, he cannot help but be married to his radical politics. Well this is UMass at Amherst. I cannot wait to get into classes about reality.",2.5,1.0,Dan Clawson
68,"Dan is an awesome professor, so intelligent.  I was both a student in his class and a TA for him as well.  He's very reasonable.  Although there is heavy reading in the course, they are for the most part very interesting. Make friends with your TA!!...Dan gives total power to his TA's in deciding grades, extensions, etc.",5.0,4.0,Dan Clawson
69,"Interesting subject but very scattered and biased method of teaching. Barely took any notes. Weekly 1pg response papers due, 4 unit papers (only have to do 3), optional final, 6 pop quizzes drops the lowest. If you muddle through the not always pleasant reading material and incorporate the ""4 key concepts"" in your writing then you should be fine.",3.0,4.0,Dan Clawson

DONT take it.  dan doesn't talk about anything real during class, just rambles on about his opinion on stuff and then will give you random facts to write down so you can write the essays well. paper due every week, do all of them. and id write all the essays so that you can get a good grade. go to class because of random quizzes.",2.0,5.0,Dan Clawson
71,"This is one class I actually don't mind going to. Most of the books you have to read are decent and the class is actually interesting. The papers are a pain but doable. You pretty much have to go to class bc there are 6 in class pop quizzes, but they're really easy if you do the reading.",3.5,2.0,Dan Clawson

79,"my suggestion would be to avoid taking this class at all costs. clawson drags lectures on and on, and is a kind of a jerk. there are 6 pop quizzes so while going to class is worse than watching your grandma clip her toenails, it's kind of necessary since you don't know when there will be a quiz. the only upside is not having to take the final.",1.5,3.0,Dan Clawson

If you have an interest in acquiring an extensive reading list of material with a focus on fanaticism and terror around the world, you will be rewarded by the course. His required reading for the course is demanding, and you will not succeed in his class if you skip.",4.0,4.0,Richard Drake
81,"His class was easily the most informative class I took while at UM. Lots of required reading, and lectures while not mandatory are incredibly dense and need a ton of notes or you wont pass. My one big turn off is he seemed to be more proud of who he knew, and had dinner with than the actual subject itself.",2.0,4.0,Richard Drake
82,"I strongly recommend a course with Professor Drake. The class I took moves at a quick pace and requires careful study of notes taken during lecture. It also required reading 6 books, watching a few movies and reading some essays/articles posted on the course webpage. Professor Drake is an incredible resource for UM.",5.0,4.0,Richard Drake
83,"Richard Drake is not a good professor if you want to learn about what you actually signed up for.

Terrorism in Modern America is the most frustrating class I have ever been in.",1.0,5.0,Richard Drake
84,"One of the best classes I have ever taken. If given the opportunity, take a Drake class. He will make you think in ways you never have before.

Do the extra seminar if you want to get to know some very smart people.",5.0,4.0,Richard Drake
85,Professor Drake is definitely the best history professor I've had. His lectures are very informative and can be confusing at times if you're not a history nerd. His tests are blue book and he usually announces when a pop quiz is coming up.  Definitely the biggest eye-opener course. Only complaint is that he does sidetrack sometimes about books.,5.0,4.0,Richard Drake
86,"Professor Drake clearly knows what he is talking about and conveys most of his ideas clearly, I have a few complaints. He spends far too much time referencing things from other courses and works not pertaining to the course, it is easy to get confused if you haven't taken his other courses. He assigns more reading than every class I took combined.",4.0,4.0,Richard Drake
87,"Took Terrorism from this professor. Clearly once a great class, but after decades has devolved into a long lecture on books that we do not read and general opinion. Not your typical history class -- No historical background in the traditional sense. The subject matter is fascinating but the class was disappointing. Almost dropped it twice.",2.5,5.0,Richard Drake
88,"Took terrorism and Contemporary . Amazing lecturer and kept me engaged and interested. Work is really not that hard if you go to class and pay attention to his anecdotes on the readings. Honestly,  I skimmed the books and got A's in both classes since he goes over books in great detail in class. Very interesting classes. Pop quizzes but small %. ",4.0,3.0,Richard Drake
89,"Great professor. You can tell he really loves Italy and that he prides himself on being a scholar. He doesn't teach out of the book.

You state your opinion and back it up, theres not really right and wrong answers.",4.5,3.0,Richard Drake

91,I dont know why everyone makes a big deal about Professor Drake being too hard. Its probably because he is one of the few professors who is actually legit here at the university of Montana.I get A's on all his tests.

93,"I have taken 6 classes in my 5 years here with this man. He is absolutely amazing. You have to know your stuff though.

344,"Do not take his class. For the field class prepare for the class to end sometimes more than an hour past what is schedule. Very strict grader, heavy on the report papers every week. Boden teaches intro level classes but teaches them in a more complex way than most people understand. In other words, if you dont know a lot about geology good luck",1.0,4.0,David Boden
345,"The main issue with this professor isn't his teaching style or course content but the fact that he always sounds angry. I don't think he's actually mad, but it's hard to feel comfortable in a class where the teacher's normal speaking volume is shouting. Expect to spend a lot of time on the labs and homework. The exams were very straight-forwards.",2.0,3.0,David Boden
346,"Do not take this course if you are not extremely, wholeheartedly, 100% passionate about this subject. Dr. Boden pushes his passion on the subject too much, causing for way too much information, homework assignments, and overall workload. All of his assignments can pile up easily if you're not caught up with the class. Watch the lectures and read!!!",2.0,5.0,David Boden
347,"This is an online students worst nightmare. Avoid this professor if you can. The GEOL 100 is more difficult than the 300 level courses Im currently taking. Concepts from the book dont match whats on the test, the lab made me feel like a 2nd grader, everything is locked until the week its due, and if you use the Calendar, you will miss some things.",1.0,5.0,David Boden
348,Dr. B is a very effective professor and will take time to make sure you understand a topic. He shows great interest in the work and has many years of experience to help. A field activity is required in 101 and it is a great help.,4.0,4.0,David Boden
349,"Dr. Boden knows his stuff and is very passionate about Geology. The 101 class is, lets just say intense. if you pass the class you will know much more than the standard GEOL 101 student. that being said, pay attention, memorize the stuff and stick it out. It's a hard class, but prioritize it and you'll probably be fine.",3.0,4.0,David Boden
350,Very knowledgeable. Very difficult grader for a first year class. Don't take if you like your GPA.,5.0,5.0,David Boden
351,"Dr. Boden is the only reason i use rate my professor from now on. taking his 100 level class was a great challenge and even though many hours were spent doing homework, lab reports, tests, quizzes, and taking notes i ended receiving a C for this class. never had participated in such a hard 100 level class, no extra credit avilable. not recommended!",1.0,5.0,David Boden
352,One of the best classes I have ever taken; an example of why higher education should exist. Dr Boden is a consummate professional with a dazzling array of subject knowledge coupled with incandescent enthusiasm and remarkable organization and presentation skills. A masterful communicator who motivates learners beyond their own perceived limitations,4.0,4.0,David Boden
353,I'm currently talking his 100 level class and it is a wast of my money and effort. He give no slack and I'm trying my very hardest. They way he gives his test makes it very hard to pass. He teaches as if it is a 300 level class. I don't recommend him unless you are really into geology.,1.0,4.0,David Boden
354,"Dave Boden is great! He is a great teacher and his power points are very lucid. If you just go to class, take notes, pay attention, you will pass this class. Dave explains  the material so well, and he is always there for help. This was definitely one of my easiest class, but he loves when you are very very very very descriptive in all the labs.",4.0,3.0,David Boden
355,I really enjoyed GEOL 100.  His exams are directly from his power points so if you take good notes you'll be fine! He gives three exams and lets you work in a group for the second half of class on them. There's a mandatory all-day field trip so expect to devote one of your Saturdays to that. I would highly recommend Dr. Boden!,4.0,3.0,David Boden
356,Dr. Boden's intro to field methods class is HARD. He is an extremely tough grader. He expects your reports to be like those of a professional. Having said that you will learn a TON in this class. The level of knowledge you will get from this 260 class is superior to UNR's 260 class. Just be ready to spend 12 hours on a report and  to get a C on it.,3.0,5.0,David Boden
357,"Not worth the effort if you are just taking this class for core credit. If you take his lecture back to back with the lab, be prepared for him to lecture well into lab time leaving your lab as homework. Spends a lot of lecture time telling you why you should be interested in Geology instead of just teaching it. Tests are extremely difficult.",3.0,4.0,David Boden
358,"Boden grades with an iron fist, but his lectures are interesting and fun with great pictures and examples.  He does grade hard, and his tests are tricky even with notes.  I took this class last year, and would still recommend it. Even though it was hard to get a good grade, it was better than falling asleep due to boredom like other geol profs.",3.0,3.0,David Boden
359,"Dr. Bowen was very passionate about his class, however, he was extremely scattered. His tests were almost impossible even with a 5 X 7 note card. The labs were long and confusing. Only two people passed when I took his class, myself included. Unless you have a lot of prior knowledge to the subject, do not take his class.",1.5,5.0,David Boden
360,do not recommend if you care about your GPA. the tests were all hard and he also had many assignments.,2.5,4.0,David Boden
361,Dr. Boden is passionate about his work but is terribly inconsistent    comes grading. there are grey ares in geology but he still  grades strictly for  100 level course.  to  this   a community college!   not recommend taking this class. it   gpa  killer! hw is  and long. way too much time   a good grade  an elective class.,2.5,5.0,David Boden
362,"lots of note-taking, quizzes, and little assignments to turn in as well as a few annoying labs. i like him because he's so into the subject, but it was hard to take him yelling for us to speak at 8 am. also, he sighs and groans a lot during tests, which kind of drives me insane. and the tests are hard, but multiple choice.",3.0,4.0,David Boden
363,"The class was the most organized . All modules were clear, we peer reviewed but it was for a GRADE!! and she explained things over and over again. She also curved the finals and added points to all questions that were not covered in class. The finals was long but it was all multiple choice. Do not listen to whiners. DO your work and STUDY!!!!",4.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
364,the most unorganized professor. she gets ahead of herself too often and you have to do a peer review which means to grade other peoples homework.. pointless. she also made us have a third exam and a final in the same week (which was a 124 questions.) some of the answers on the exams didn't even have the right answers sometimes. avoid her class.,1.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
365,"Obviously those who don't want to do the work will give the worst reviews. Those who say she has an accent are plain ridiculous. She is very organized, gives wonderful lectures and has emailed back in a few minutes. So not sure what the complaints are about! Tough class, so do your WORK!!!!! She made an online class WORK! Great prof.",4.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad

367,"You will have to: A: Learn all material on your own, her lectures are not helpful, also a strong accent. B: Memorize the entire Calender: Her online scheduling is bad C: Not have any issues, Her email response rate is poor. D: Have the patience to do this for an entire semester, while worrying about your grade. Just find a new teacher.",1.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
368,"I really liked Prasad but I gave her a 3 because she doesn't explain directions, the tests and reviews are nothing alike, and before tests, she has students teach the test materials. The problem with that is half of the students don't care about teaching the materials so you don't effectively learn them. She's pretty good, but maybe not the best",3.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
369,She is making students right now (during a pandemic) get a camera for the computer due to academic integrity issues. Some people have autoimmune diseases some have financial situations where they can't spend money on items like that. I think its fine enough to use lockdown browser but really a camera? I hope she realizes what she is doing is wrong.,1.0,5.0,Roopa Prasad
370,"Prasad is an amazing teacher, goes super in depth to make sure students understand chemistry. If you keep up with the online assignments, the class is fairly simple. Her lab classes are 2.5 hours so if you skip you miss out on a lot. Be prepared to put effort into your assignments. Super helpful if you don't understand things, makes chemistry fun.",5.0,3.0,Roopa Prasad
371,"Do not take her ONLINE class. I was expecting her to be teaching the class. It turns out she uses lecture videos from Prof. Crandall, so in reality Prof. Crandall is teach you the class not her!

If you don't plan on putting effort into the class do not take it,4.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
374,"Prof. Prasad is great. She does give reviews, they just entail what you need to know for the test. Furthermore, she spends an entire class period reviewing.

376,I liked Dr. Prasad for chemistry. She is really good at lecturing and helps students to understand difficult concepts. She loves participation and likes when students work problems on the board. She does not give out test reviews and rarely reviews for the test so your notes have to be clear and accurate to study.,4.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
377,"Let me be blunt, if you do not put in work, you will not pass. Mrs. Prasad is one of the most AMAZING professors I've ever had.

870,Ben was great for this course. Some people find R challenging - and he acknowledges that. He was always willing to help students in class and his office hours were very accessible. He makes it very clear what you need to do to do well on assignments. Follow those guidelines and youll be more than fine. Would take again!,5.0,2.0,Benjamin Kenzer

873,"Dr. Maher's exams are harder than I would have liked, but his quizzes help with grades, and give you a good idea about what the exams look like. They typically have quite a few short answers/essays, so be prepared to know what you're talking about. Overall, he makes class interesting with the studies he includes, along with cute videos.",4.0,4.0,Sean Maher
874,"I was excited coming into this class, but quickly realized it would be one of the worst classes I've taken at MSU. I don't feel the lectures accurately represent what he tests on. He is a touch grader and wants you to extrapolate your own answers from the little info he does give. Hard to get ahold of through email. All around a bit of a let down.",1.0,5.0,Sean Maher
875,"Maher is a great guy and has a funny sense of humor. The first exam was very difficult only because I had no clue how his tests were. I suggest going over the slides, studying the animal families, and reading the book for more specifics. PAY ATTENTION to the things he mentions multiple times and even the side stories bc they are usually on the test",4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
876,"He's a good guy, but not my favorite professor. He makes attendance worth a test grade (plus some extra) which is nice if you go to every class, but his lectures aren't very helpful. I and most of the people I know in this class only learned from the book. So definitely buy the book.",2.0,4.0,Sean Maher
877,"He gives extra credit for attendance/in class assignments, and i mean like 100 points worth so go to class. Also, do yourself a favor and use MINITAB instead of R.

I never missed lecture & still had to do lots of reading outside of class.",4.0,4.0,Sean Maher
878,"Maher has been great for me in both Mammalogy & Bio Stats. Very laid back teacher but at the same time he knows how to enforce his material properly.

Would take again. -NL",5.0,3.0,Sean Maher

Overall easy/average class and average teacher.,4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
880,"This class was all over the place. The HW questions out of the book were fine, but he gave no direction when it can to using R.

881,"Sean's class was very standard, and you will need the book to get through it. He's very understanding if you need help with something in the material. Do the homework, it helps a lot. I wouldn't advise a morning class, I kept wanting to fall asleep.",4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
882,"Class wasnt too bad, i showed up often and thats where he gives participation points for. Tests I found semi difficult, 5 total including final , drops the lowest  one. Homework isn't hard which is where most points come from. Would take again",4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
883,"Maher is a pretty solid choice. He can be boring at times but he's passionate about biology. Makes it super easy to understand. Takes attendance but does not tell you what days he is going to, so you have to actually go. 4 exams and a final, but he drops the lowest exam. I would suggest him, just be prepared for his monotoned voice. Easy A",4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
884,"I'm not really interested in biology, but Maher makes this class pretty painless. His powerpoints are verbatim from the book and if you do the homework, you'll do fine on the tests. Going to class is necessary though, since his ""attendance"" grade is from questions he asks in class and he does not announce when he will take attendance.",4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
885,Professor Maher is by far the worst professor I have ever had at Missouri State University. He is not willing to help you in any way. Tests are completely short answer. First exam was 5 front and back pages of short answer statistic problems to do in only 50 minutes. Would NEVER recommend.,1.0,3.0,Sean Maher
886,This was his first semester teaching stats. Professor Maher is really knowledgeable about statistics and how to use R software.

Gives extra credit in the form of a question during class, so make sure you always go!",4.5,2.0,Sean Maher
890,"Dr. Maher is a good professor. His powerpoints come directly for the textbook, and he posts them to blackboard so you really don't need to go to class but I would recommend going because he gives you participation quizzes which you don't even have to get the right answer to get the points. Lectures are boring, but the tests aren't hard, just study.",4.0,2.0,Sean Maher
891,The lectures are boring but that was expected considering it was a Gen Ed bio class.  I always felt aware of what material would be on the tests. There are a few hwk assignments.

I absolutely adore her.,5.0,1.0,Anne Pringle

She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,2.0,4.0,Anne Pringle
897,"Dr. Pringle taught the second half of the course, focusing on fungi, diversity of life, and plant life cycles and biomes. It was her first semester teaching any class.

She asks belittling questions that nobody responds to.",3.0,4.0,Anne Pringle

927,"Loved this class! Bertram provided straitforward assignments and even told us exactly what we needed to know for tests!

928,Too much material for him to teach. I've never heard anyone say anything good about him. Very arrogant and impressed with himself.

He forgets about the PP behind him that goes along with his lecture and clicks through it at the very end. Avoid.,1.0,4.0,Eric Bertram
929,Bertram is overall a good professor he talks to you like a person and is usually reasonable with everything he assigns or if you need help with something.

He said he does this on purpose b/c in an emergency you won't have time to think about answers.",1.0,5.0,Eric Bertram

934,"Tries to be the cool professor, but fails. He fails because he relies almost entirely on PowerPoint and reads off the slides.

Ineffective, test-heavy, and unfunny. Avoid if possible.",1.0,3.0,Eric Bertram
935,"He explains how to get a good grade in his class from the first day. Yes you have to work for it, but if you do your homework and study HARD for the quizzes you will be fine.

He's pretty much all over the place.",3.0,4.0,Eric Bertram

975,"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",1.0,4.0,Carmen Lemoine
976,"If you're not already good at sight reading while singing, you're in for a hard time. I was sick for my final and she failed me without letting me re-do it when I was better.

Professor Oakley is a nice lady but doesn't seem to understand no one gives a crap about Geology besides herself.,3.0,4.0,Lisa Oakley
985,"She's a good professor, and is easy to follow. She goes through powerpoints every class so its easy to take notes. Gives a lot of extra credit and tells you whats going to be on a test.

Complete waste of time, do not recommend.",1.0,4.0,Lisa Oakley
988,She cares way too much about rocks. Its weird. She expects us all to be geologists even though the majority of our class are not geology majors.

989,"I love Dr. Oakley as a person, but this class is very hard for non geology majors. There are SO many opportunities to bring your grade up from the tests throughout the semester, but if you don't get As on those it can stop you from doing well in the class.",3.0,4.0,Lisa Oakley
990,Professor Oakley makes this class harder than it needed to be. She takes pride in how hard her tests were. Truthfully you have to study for hours to get a C/B. The one perk is that she does provide study guides and 3% extra credit for your total grade. No homework and group projects will balance out failing on tests.,3.0,4.0,Lisa Oakley
991,Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,2.0,4.0,Lisa Oakley
992,"Professor Oakley is one of my favorite profs yet. Class seemed to be a friend gathering to discuss Geology. Always answered questions and was so sweet.

TAKE HER!",5.0,2.0,Lisa Oakley
994,She is a fantastic teacher and it is very evident that she cares about students success and loves the field she works in. The group projects are easy A's.

Good for non science majors.,5.0,3.0,Lisa Oakley
995,Erickson might be the best bio professor I've had. His lectures make a lot of sense and I actually feel like I understand the core concepts of molecular biology now.

Great professor!,5.0,3.0,Timothy Erickson
996,"Dr. Erickson is great! I took this class with a ton of people who disagree, but honestly, if you show up and do the work, youll do fine.

Hes also more than willing to help and easy to talk to.",5.0,5.0,Timothy Erickson
997,"He's a nice guy but his lectures are just not interesting. He doesn't make much of an effort as a teacher to keep the class interested. He gives online quizzes spontaneously and they're sometimes assigned at the last minute when they do take a bit of time to do because they are difficult. He does give a little bit of extra credit, nothing too big.",1.0,4.0,Timothy Erickson
998,Dr. Erickson is awesome! Bio 3260 is very hard but Dr. Erickson only wants you to succeed. He gives 3 tests and a final but also includes clicker qs and in class worksheets.

999,"J564 was an interesting class and Prof Mcleod gives great lectures, but there is quite a bit of reading and the tests were pretty tough.

Good class overall, but be prepared to but in a decent amount of effort.",3.0,4.0,Douglas McLeod
1000,This class is asynchronous during COVID-19. The lectures get a bit dry but I can tell Doug is a kind professor. He seems to be easily accessed (I just never have). The TA gets a bit confusing with deadlines and assignments. The class is 5 exams and theyre kinda hard. No extra credit this semester but I think he will give us a bit of a curve.,4.0,4.0,Douglas McLeod
1001,"Doug is a great professor! In 564 I found his lectures to be super boring, but in 445 when he wasn't lecturing regularly I really started to like him. He is really funny, casual and relatable. He gives fantastic feedback and is so encouraging to everybody in class regardless of skill level. He keeps it real and I'd definitely recommend him!",4.0,3.0,Douglas McLeod
1002,"Doug was great in J564. He is super engaging and has great stories and examples to support his ideas. My only criticism is that his lectures are a bit unorganized: there seemed to be one long lecture for the entire semester with no clear-cut stopping points for each class period. I would recommend the course, but know that readings are essential!",5.0,4.0,Douglas McLeod
1003,"Great professor who actually cares about his students. He connects his lectures well to the real world and makes content easy to understand. Tests are a bit tougher than other journalism classes and only have about 30 questions, so not much room for error. You can make up for it by doing the extra credit though.",5.0,3.0,Douglas McLeod
1004,This professor is amazing! His lectures are funny and engaging. His workload is not heavy only a few assignments. He provides a study guide for the two exams in his class and has a couple of quizzes due throughout the semester that are super easy. I highly recommend taking this course to get an easy upper division done.,4.0,1.0,Ty Kopp
1005,"I took his online class. 2 Minor Speeches and 3 Major persuasive speeches. Quizzes every Sunday, based only on textbook and after 2 lowest grade dropped. 3 Exams based on selected chapters. The textbook was expensive and the access code is required. His lectures were based on the quiz after it is taken, which was repetitive. Overall, easy grader!",5.0,1.0,Ty Kopp
1006,I loved Professor Kopp! He was so kind and I appreciate how hard he tried his hardest to make the material more fun. His class may seem intimidating at first but honestly it became a real cruise once you start! Make sure you practice your speech beforehand thoroughly and utilize is grading rubric! Would take his class again!,5.0,2.0,Ty Kopp
1007,Kopp's a cool dude. Laid back and open to all ideas. The textbook (online) is needed as there are short quizzes every Sunday. Speeches are fairly easy and you will do will if you follow the rubric and maintain good eye contact. Attendance does matter. He will mark 5 points per unexcused absence which got me a B. Fairly easy class and cool professor,4.0,2.0,Ty Kopp
1008,"In the beginning the class may seem difficult, but it eventually gets better. He has quizzes open for only a 24 hour period on a SUNDAY. Which is pretty inconvenient. He is nice and will try to assist as much as possible, but he can also get pretty defensive. Not too hard of class in general, lectures are just extemeley boring! Attendance matters!",4.0,3.0,Ty Kopp
1009,"I took the Honors course and it was fairly easy. There are quizzes every Sunday, but the questions come right out of the textbook so they are never difficult. There are 5 speeches you have to give and the major ones are weighted pretty heavily, however, they aren't that difficult to get an A on. Downsides: hard tests and drags out the class talking",4.0,4.0,Ty Kopp
1010,Prof. Kopp really helps you come out of your shell. Public speaking can be difficult for some and Kopp made it a welcoming and less intimidating environment. Speeches are graded fairly easy as long as you're prepared and follow the criteria sheets. Quizzes every Sunday based off the online textbook chapters & are also super easy.,5.0,1.0,Ty Kopp
1011,"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Lectures were a tad boring due to the type of content being taught. But he really did his best to try and make it more interesting.

1016,"All in all, I liked his class. Hes a good teacher and builds you up to speak in front of the class.

I know people would have appreciated the extra time/practice. Highly recommend",4.0,2.0,Christopher Forsythe
