She was very good about responding to emails promptly and when Myaccounyinglab was down for maintenance she was very good about allowing us extra time for assignments and quizes,5.0,3.0,Janell Spencer
,"Professor Vannier rambles a bit but is an okay professor. You can easily pass the class by completing the weekly quiz during lectures and briefly skimming the lecture slides. Anything difficult is pretty easy to figure out with at most a couple minutes of searching. The text book is a waste of time, the internet can suffice.",4.0,1.0,Ryan Vannier
,The lectures are heavy and that is only because he takes the time out to go over homework(one of three things that will determine your grade). He is funny and open. I liked the class alot. The homework and exams are online. But he does care and wants you to understand the work.,5.0,3.0,David Park
,ten out of ten would never take a class with her again. she prides herself on failing pretty much every student on their first essay and takes forever to hand back the essays. she can be very rude and tough on students by calling them out and then humiliating them.

,"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",2.0,3.0,Linda Besemer
,"Lectures are 3 hours long, yes he is a bit boring and some topics are hard to sit through depending on your interest but it is very easy to do well in his course. He provides study guides that are 6-9 pages but if you go over it the exam will be easy since he pulls questions from the study guide. He also gives xtra credit 6% added to final grade.",4.0,2.0,David Coleman

,No Comments,5.0,3.0,Yvette Flores-Ortiz
,"He is NOT a hard professor. Every test comes directly from the notes. If you look over your notes at least once, you are going to get an A. He also is more than willing to repeat himself or further explain a slide if it is unclear to you. I highly recommend him.",4.5,2.0,Jared Wells
,"Well I did learn a lot and enjoyed most of the readings. We had three papers and an optional final. All of class is just one big lecture with a small group of students that always participate. One time he was heading towards a biological determinism argument (crazy I know), and I think that was the highlight of my experience as a sociology major ha",4.5,3.0,Dan Clawson
,"Thad is a really nice guy. Phys is hard, but he does his best to teach it. Lab is really easy and so are the tests. Recording the lectures helps,  but the tests are harder. He takes a long time to get grades back. Best phys teacher there is at Butte.",3.0,4.0,Thad Winzenz
,Dr. Bland is a great teacher. I took her class last  semester and she helped me a lot. She is  one of the best teachers that I ever had. If you are planning to take English 102 or ENG 203 I suggest you take her class. Her class is not hard. Ask questions about anything that you don't understand about her lectures or MWA's and she will help you.,5.0,1.0,Marian Bland

,No other professor has devoted so much time to drafting and helping us with our work in progress.,5.0,2.0,Michael Parker
,He is seriously the best teacher I have ever taken. His in class lectures are so clear and right out of the book which makes it easier for the students to understand what he is talking about. He is very helpful either it's in class or outside. He will meet up with you for any kind of help you need. His tests are multiple choice and you get to use a 3x5 index card. If you need to take a math 81 class TAKE HIM. You won't regret it.,5.0,1.0,George Morrow
,"The take-home quizes were based on the book, but attendance was still graded.  A sign that an instructor doesn't know what they're doing.  I dropped the class because I  got sick of extrapolating conclusions that weren't in the book.   If you're not learning anything, then why are you even here?  Seriously, no joke, don't take a class from her.",1.0,2.0,Sarah Bowman
,"Mr. Odien is a very good professor with a distinct drive and passion for what he does. His well-presented lectures are important to your success in the class and his personality makes everything interesting. He is always available to help, even during tests. That being, if you're looking for an easy class or dislike geology, I wouldn't take him.",5.0,4.0,Bob Odien

,"Tony is the BEST professor I have ever had. He is so understanding with everyones situation. If you have issues with speaking in front of class for participation points, he has alternative options.

,"Professor Benitt spends more time discussing UFO's and Big Foot, than he does teaching Astronomy.  He is obsessed with neatness and completely irrational.

,I  took this class and I didn't feel understand very well.,3.5,4.0,Lawrence Lawson
,"Currently in his PHY125 class. He has an unrealistic expectation for Non-Science majors. Talks to no end during class, not requiring feedback. A lot of his opinions infiltrate the lesson plan. PROCTORED Quizzes and Tests. The theme is that he simply can't teach. He is smart no denying but doesn't make for a good prof. Get ready to teach yourself.",1.0,4.0,Bernard Leikind

,"She is such a terrible teacher. First test covered 12 chapters of material, class average in the 60's and she didn't curve. She doesn't really care if you're doing well or not. So lazy.

,She was very helpful with homework and quizzes. Helps you work the problems you missed for 5 percentage points.,5.0,2.0,Jean Phillips
,"This was by far one of the best professor's I've ever had. Very dry and kind of weird, he really knows what hes talking about.

,"Professor Niu is a very nice teacher.  She cares students feelings.  She is very patient and friendly.  When you have any dont understand math questions you can ask her any time,  she will answer you.  For me, this class is very easy.  Homework, you can hand it in any time, but at less before the final.   May this information can help you.",5.0,2.0,Kun Niu

,"For someone not interested in math, this class was very dull and seemed to be a lot harder than it would have to be. She seems pleasant enough but doesn't make any attempt to connect to most students. Not a great teacher; take someone else for 125 if you can.",2.0,3.0,Linda Barton
,Insane class. This professor did nothing for us. When we asked questions we were shut down with rude responses that were smart ass like. It was just not a good course at all. We worked so hard to receive such petty grades. She obviously had favorites. I mean give me a break. We literally are having class over a screen. -GIB,1.0,5.0,Rory Moore

But, attendance is mandatory, which isn't fun because the lectures are a little boring.",3.0,1.0,Brian Williams
,"gives quite a few lectures and gives a lot of handouts but is clear and concise- lectures are easy to follow. Tests based on lectures. Extremely helpful and understanding.

Got an A- last semester in PSY112, hoping for an A again.",5.0,2.0,William Quinlan
,None of the upper level UB Math professors are going to hold your hand.  Dr. Sikora is a great guy and a decent professor.  Be sure to put effort in on the homework as it is a good part of your grade.  Tests are fair and you'll do well if you understand the homework,3.5,3.0,Adam Sikora

She posts on Blackboard exactly how she expects the homework so it is very easy to understand.,5.0,3.0,Carlette Lockett
,He is a very sweet teacher. He very quiet and shy. Attendance isnt mandatory for lecture or recitation. Make sure you go to lab though.

,"Has an accent, but while it is easy to discern what words are coming out of his mouth, it is impossible to understand what he is talking about.

After the first test the class becomes impossible do not take.",1.0,5.0,Volodymyr Nekrashevych

Attendance is also extremely necessary to be successful in this class!",3.5,2.0,Tarah Foster
,"She is a caring person, but communication on projects and assignments were not clearly stated.

I do still recommend her for this course, but make sure to stay on top of classwork.",5.0,3.0,Alisha Woodman
,"I took Prof Ryan for a 7 AM 4 day Winter Physio class and it was a lot eaiser than I expected.

,You get what you put into the class knowledge wise. You can just show up for the midterm and final and get away with an A . But i would highly encourage you to go.

Essays can be difficult but do help you absorb the material.",4.0,3.0,Bridget Chalk

,Course is set up so you basically can't fail because 45% of your mark is weekly quizzes. She basically reads word for word off the slides and it's very hard to stay engaged during her lectures.

,"I would only recommend you take his classes if you READ!  There is no need to go to class because he posts pp's & audio online.  Tests are 3/4 lecture material and 1/4 reading.  Again, only take his classes if you plan on reading.  Losing points for the reading questions will have a HUGE impact on your grade. There is easy extra credit.",3.0,4.0,Paul Jesilow
,Harsh grader and doesn't provide rubrics. You never know what he is looking for.

Gives practice tests very similar to actual tests",4.0,2.0,David Hoffman

,I really don't like his class. Too much work for an introductory-level class. The final Essary requires you to find your own objects from 3000BC -1600AD (you need to secure the object when you are only halfway in the class). There are huge problems with the teaching style and hard to communicate. Doesn't care about his student. For online courses.,1.0,4.0,Darren Provost

I never missed lecture & still had to do lots of reading outside of class.",4.0,4.0,Sean Maher
,"Good intro to all business topics (mkt, fin, acc etc). Easy class so attendance is huge. 2 exams with questions right out of the book. 1 large group project.

,"The online quizzes should have been true/false & multiple choice only; if typed answers are going to be required then just give us the quizzes in class or as a midterm. Make sure you do the readings, even though the textbook is optional, and go over all the notes before every quiz. Be as clear as possible on the take home, easy to lose marks there.",4.0,4.0,Leslie-Anne Keown
,Definitely a solid professor. He's open to everyone's opinions and you can tell he is really passionate about his lectures.

Labs took hours and hours",4.0,3.0,Fabio Pasqualetti

,"Although I had absolutely no interest in operations going in, Darwin was a great teacher who made the various topics interesting.

,"Mr. Brooks was wonderful. Very clear in his expectations from his students and your outcome from his class. I believe he had realistic goals and followed his syllabus about 90-95%. He would push dates back a couple of days to benefit the progress of his students. Was always available to answer any question, a positive classroom enviroment! :)",5.0,3.0,Keith Brooks
,"I had Dr. Thomas during her first semester teaching. She was amazing! She truly cared about the students in the class and wanted each of us to succeed. It was a lot of studying for the lab quiz each week, but it is doable. She made the more boring or in depth material fun and relatable to us. Also, lots of opportunities for extra credit.",5.0,3.0,Jessica Thomas
,"My GPA was a 4.0 until this class. This woman is ridiculous! I received a F for my milestone 3 for my final project. She said I needed to use parenthetical references which I used 8!

,"An extremely difficult professor for my particular section. This class will not receive any free pts, and he sticks to his schedule.

,"This hybrid HISTGLBT class on Dissident Sexualities was incredibly interesting. KM provided interesting lectures, but most of the semester was driven by student discussion. There was only one novel required for the class, but more than 600 pages of various journals and articles to read for the class, which can be tough on the CLA printing budget. ",4.5,2.0,Kevin Murphy
,"Group project that is worth nearly half of your grade and is semester long. Very intense, but he grades it fairly. Must show up to class. For a tough subject, he does an adequate job of making it somewhat interesting. Core class that you must take, I would recommend him, but just know that you will have to work hard.",3.0,4.0,Douglas Harding
,Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Completely useless. Does not know anything about graphic design and is horrible at giving feedback. He belittles his students and finds pleasure in embarrassing them in front of the class. Any good reviews on here were probably written by him.,1.0,3.0,Bert Emerson
,"He is a very good professor. He did not lecture in class but if you needed help he was super eager to help you. Since the class was online and let us have our space, he stays up front and his tests are easy. He's a great professor when you need help and when you don't. He did not take attendance but if you get too far behind he'll withdrawal you.",5.0,3.0,Mike Malone
,"Professor Prez is a great teacher, he assigns a lot of readings. But you kind of don't need to do all of them, just do the one that the asks you to reference in paper and you'll be fine. He gave the prompt for the midterm to us to take home and write on an index card and then copy in class. One paper to do at home. And the final was take home too!",4.5,3.0,Robert Perez
,"He is not really the personal teacher that would memorize you're name, and I personally liked that. This class is extremely easy, the only thing needed is half a brain a or a ton of work. If you struggled, even failed a math class in highschool (like I did,) you'll do fine with his detailed teaching",5.0,1.0,Nicholas Eisenberg
,Professor Gentry is by far my favorite professor I've ever had. I loved his class so much. There was a good bit of reading but the passages were usually short and we always discussed them before taking quizzes. If you do your research and actually try for the speeches you'll get an A no problem.,5.0,2.0,Glenn Gentry
,"Professor Gibbons was very hard to reach beyond class; she seemed to always have an excuse. Readings were a bit dense and lengthy, but were always discussed in class. On paper assignments she was a tough grader. When I finally meet with her to discuss the papers, she tore them apart and offered no constructive criticism. Would not recommend.",2.0,4.0,Rebecca Gibbons
,"Overall, she was a decent teacher. Her test reviews are pretty much exactly what is going to be tested. Only bad thing is I'm afraid I am not going to be prepared for BIO 226.

,"There is so much reading. The worst part is for the test, she gave us 54 terms for us to define and only 10/12 will be on the actual test and out of those 10/12, we only have to do 5/6. Lectures are alright but they do not redeem for how much reading there is or how she handles the test study guide.",1.0,5.0,Lisa Gill

,"She was very helpful. The class also isn't a lot of work; there is just a small homework assignment after every lesson, 4 quizzes and exams, and the final exam.

,Tom D'Angelo is a great person and professor. You can tell he really loves what he teaches and cares for his students. I wish more professors were like him!

,"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",2.5,5.0,Kate Hudepohl

,"Class was unruly and prof was not good at managing it. Class was regularly disruptive and off task. I don't think we finished one lecture in its entirety before I decided to drop this class. The subject matter is dope and prof seems to know it well, but it did not translate well into her teaching methodologies.",2.0,4.0,Beverly Natividad
,"Literally the best professor in MDC. No doubt about it. I've taken both german one and german two with Herr Morales. It is with him that I have realized that loving an afternoon class is possible.

Would definitely recommend!,5.0,2.0,Kathleen Hurlock
,"The worst teacher I've had. If this is your first time taking a college class talk to your advisor and make sure you don't get her.

,Take literally anyone else. Chemistry is a strong subject of mine and I am struggling to do well in this class. Get a tutor if you wind up with Brown because he does not teach what's on the test. We spent 2 lectures on a chapter that was supposedly on a test just to find out on the test that it didn't matter. Do not take Dr. Brown,1.0,5.0,Phil Brown
,"He is the best teacher for students who want to study. He is smart and funny. He wants to help students, easy to talk or ask questions. I learn a lot from his class. It's not an easy class, but you will learn a lot. His passionate on teaching inspires me sometimes.",5.0,4.0,Lawrence Lawson

,"Dr. Clementz is clearly very passionate about neuroscience, but because of that he spent a LOT of time going into excruciating detail on minor topics. He also went way over 50 minutes every single class. Never responded to emails either. If you thoroughly read the textbook it isn't very hard to do well, but these things were pretty annoying.",2.0,3.0,Brett Clementz
,"He can be interesting, but he records and posts all his lectures and slides online. The text was very interesting. He is a bit rude. Had no problem until grades were released and it said I hadn't taken the final, which I had. He ended up losing my scantron and giving me a lower grade then I had earned. His TA was useless.",2.5,3.0,Paul Jesilow
,"Very friendly individual and at first the class seems like it will be like any other math class. Slightly challenging but do-able. His exams, however are some of the hardest material I have ever seen. His examples and homework do not help at all. Save yourself the pain and do not take his class.",1.0,5.0,Alekzander Malcom
,She only allows 3 absences. If you're on your phone or daydreaming she counts you absent. She is super hard grading on papers. You have to read short stories and take quizzes on them on very specific things from the story. She barely smiles and is very monotone. I would not recommend taking this teacher.,1.0,3.0,Catherine Jewell
,Stay on top of the readings for this class because there is a lot of them. The work was at a level as if it was an in person class. Prof Pfeifer seems like a cool guy though just based on his lenient grading and how fast he responds to emails.,3.0,3.0,Michael Pfeifer

,"Dr. Besing is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's always willing to help you outside of class, and while his classes are a lot of work, you'll get a lot out of them if you're willing to do it. His lectures are very high value, and really worth attending. His sense of humor is unique, but he can be funny. Occasionally.",5.0,4.0,Kyle Besing
,I HIGHLY recommend Professor Wood for your communications course! Shes such a great teacher and makes notes on your outline and most of the time lets you revise it. Shes also very understanding with the online transition and how WiFi is unpredictable. You just have to communicate and do the assignments and youll pass!,5.0,2.0,Kathryn Wood
,"Out of all my classes I have taken overall, this has been the most disappointing. The overall course setup is very unclear and the lack of explanation on assignments leaves you guessing on what needs to be done.

,"First of all, Pannell seems like a great guy and will respond to you if you have any questions. The way he lectures is a little tough to follow.

,"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",1.0,5.0,Masud Khawaja
,"Dr. Norris is cool (for this class). There is a quiz each Monday but during his lectures, he will tell you exactly what is on it. He'll say, ""In the not too distant future, someone WILL ask you..."" There's a lot of information that you need to memorize but he makes it easy. Quiz every Monday, 1 midterm, 1 final & a paper... piece of cake.",4.0,1.0,Brian Norris

,"Ben gives a lot of complex reading but pares it down to the essential (and tested on) concepts in class. The lectures are alright, usually interesting, but can be dry. If you come to class, take notes, and do the review guides (make friends & split work), the exams are very easy. Otherwise, good luck trying to understand the readings on your own.",5.0,2.0,Benjamin Kenzer

,"Dr. Weiner is a tough guy to figure out. He can be totally charming and kind, but with the flip of a switch, he can be a real ass.I got stellar grades in his class with the exception of one grade and he failed me because I didnt ask him about the status of my grade (even though it was all on blackboard). Stay as far away from his class as possible",1.0,3.0,David Weiner

,"WORST TEACHER EVER. He is a horrible teacher. My friend did better than me and he never went to a single class. Not only that, he's a prick.

Just awful.",1.5,5.0,Ted Chang

Staff loves her, I'm not sure why.",1.5,5.0,Sandra Kauanui
,"I have mixed feelings about Maureen... she was so helpful in pushing me out of my comfort zone with speaking in front of the class. However, shes a tough grader and has issues with time management.

Reads straight from PP and you can barely understand what she is saying, but she puts all PPs on blackboard. It is pointless to go to class. Only gives grades for tests and doesn't grade them correctly. You can pass but you'll be miserable.",1.0,4.0,Lacie Cupani
,"One of the worst professors I've had. Nothing she talks about in class is on the tests so if you don't memorize the text book, you won't do good on the test. All she talks about is sex because apparently she is a ""sex anthropologist"" -which would be funny if she didn't make the class so hard.",1.0,5.0,Debra Curtis
,Once of my favorite professors of all time! Dudrick makes you want to show up to class because he's utterly adorable. Motivates you to read and learn the material. 4 papers (he's a fair grader) and a slightly harder final. I'd recommend him to anyone- truly a pleasure!!,5.0,2.0,David Dudrick

,"He's very fair with grading. Just do the work he assigns and you'll be set. I made B's on 3 of the 4 online tests and still made an A because of the blogs. Never miss a blog post. Very strict about phones. If you have it out at all in class you'll be kicked out. If you have an A before the final, you don't have to take it.",4.0,2.0,Tony Bartl

,"Don't take if you're not good at math. She doesn't teach. Her goal is to answer questions for 20 minutes then have you work with your peers to figure it out. She won't explain any concepts.

,"Dr. Hill does a great job at lecturing for the number of students in the class. She is interactive and tries to make what we learn relatable.

Overall, as long as you go to class and put in some effort, you will get an A.",4.0,3.0,Laura Hill
,"I took his class a year ago, and did everything he said to get an A in the class. First off, he will grade you tests/papers poorly if you are a Republican. I would site pages from the text books he gave in class, and would go into detail about my explanation. If you even show a glimpse that you are right wing BOOM C- on a final. What a joke.",1.0,3.0,Mark Berkson
,"Professor Berry is responsible for the work. She provided a lot of information for us, and I just followed her instructions to finish homework and lab.

,"Dr. Zietz is extremely nice but doesn't teach the material well.

,"Dr. Day is pretty friendly, easy to talk to, and willing to help. The majority of the points for the class are in the labs which can be difficult but Dr. Day usually has very good input if you're stuck.

,"Professor Capper is awesome! His lectures are super interesting but they are pretty long, around 40 minutes each. I'm not sure how he is in person (mid Covid time) but online he's super easy.

,I usually try not to judge professors because I know they have other classes but I couldnt let this one go. Shes very unorganized and does not give back your work until the very last minute. Our class didnt find out our grades until the week before the final and it was too late to drop. Do not take.,2.0,5.0,Mary Mathis
,"Not an easy class regardless of who your professor is. You will have to spend hours studying on your own or you will not do well.

,"This guy is a joke of a teacher. He took us on a mandatory field trip that was suppose to end at 5pm, but due to his own inability to schedule properly, forced us to stay until 9pm. Other things are his over sensitivity to being challenged. He is not understanding at all either. He's gone downhill in the last couple of years.",1.0,3.0,Rick Bevis
,"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",1.5,2.0,Olga Wilson
,"Really nice person and teacher! Goes off topic quite a bit but it does relate to what she is teaching (most of the time.)

,"Lectures are lengthy and he gives out many many long packets but he explains everything you need to know for tests in his lectures.

Also, she has knocked one week off the course making it 7 weeks (The final was due on the 12/6 and now is due 11/30). All of this would be fine if she gave more feed back, since she does not though, knowing your grade is a guessing game.",1.0,3.0,Andrea Schultz

,"Prof. Koehlinger was great. A decent amount of reading, but not an overwhelming amount. Quizzes were exclusively on the readings. She is a fair grader and very responsive.

,"Started out the class warning us we wouldn't pass which made me study my butt off and if you do that too, you will pass especially because he curves grades. He speeds through lectures, so I spent a lot of time outside of class studying. If you don't have time for that, I recommend not taking him. He is VERY helpful and available outside of class.",4.0,4.0,Eric Bertram
,"She sees students as peers. Anyone can stop her while giving lecture anytime, she will pay tons of patient back. She has a really good temper if you don't try to bully her.

He surely knows his stuff, but teaching is not his forte. Very disorganized and we never used the book or lab manual. Be ready to lean a lot on your own...",2.0,4.0,Bill Merdian

,"She's very unclear, her lectures are beyond boring, helpful I'm sure but also at times I'm questioning relevancy. The entire class is one long group project which she can be very unclear about, she lets you know when things are due the day before and then when no one turns it she questions why.

,"He is a very nice guy, and as long as you make an effort to participate in class and try on the tests, he is a pretty liberal grader. However, he is not necessarily the best teacher.

,Love this prof! Solid choice if you want you want to learn. Always go to office hours if you are confused because he explains step by step processes and doesn't make you memorize random things. He's really funny too and doesn't make class boring. 2 midterms and lots of homework. and a final. Easy A if you work hard,5.0,2.0,Derek Chang
,"Howell expects a lot of work for a one unit course. He isn't very helpful and gets fairly hostile when irritated. Most of your grade is from lab reports, which are quite long (expect to spend several hours per week writing these up) and minor mistakes will lose you a lot of points. The tests are easy but don't make up much of your grade.",1.0,5.0,Gary Howell
,"Professor Draper teaches great courses, with a caring feeling for her students and a concern for future careers. She makes you want to do the work you NEED to do to move up in the world. You can tell that she wants to be in that classroom with so much energy, and talks about real events happening in the world off campus. Fair grader, smart lady.",5.0,3.0,Elaine Draper
,"Took this class online. In the beginning of the semester, she made us do a discussion post every day for her class. I missed one, and my grade dropped from 98 to 87.

Do Not Take.,1.0,5.0,Ping-Pei Ho
,A gentle giant. You basically read the textbook cover to cover so you'll get your money's worth. Discussion questions assigned each class and fosters participation.

She was so condescending and rude people refused to ask questions.",1.0,2.0,Dean Atkinson

,"Lectures aren't the most interesting, but he has a very forgiving exam policy. There are 3 exams, and he will drop your lowest exam grade if you went to class. You can also get a two-sided cheat sheet. The ""miniprojects"" are easy and usually has a good real life application. Homeworks slightly more difficult but manageable.",5.0,3.0,Praveen Kumar
,"Took 4 classes with her within the passed 2 years. Her classes are boring and can be hard to get used to her accent for the first week but after that, no big deal.

She's helpful too if you actually go talk to her in her office.",3.0,3.0,Wei Xing

,"Ive been doing great throughout the semester, but then he has had us study our two last assignments and study the answer key. The 50% midterm was based almost entirely on those two assignments.

,"Take this class and you'll be sorry. He pulls up the book online, throws it up on the projector, and reads directly out of it for the whole class period. While he's doing that he explains how the book is meant for mathematicians, not students. His grading system seems completely random and will give you 0 on a question almost randomly. Do not take.",1.5,5.0,Gerard Thompson
,THIS class was absolutely amazing. He gave you multiple chances to redo papers when you didnt recieve the grade you thought you deserved.

,"Way too much reading for a graduate class; lots of readings were redundant.  Piled on a major paper during spring break which is really bad because by then I needed a break from his class.

He is the best accounting teacher I have taken so far at CSU.",5.0,2.0,Mark Holtzblatt

She takes a difficult concept and makes it harder.",1.0,4.0,Laura Ridenour

,"I haven't been to school in almost 20 years, and I was able to understand what he was teaching.

,"Dr. Costanza taught a hybrid course this semester. Overall the class went well.

,"This is a tough class, but it actually works! Dr. Krings is quiet, but he's really knowledgeable and can be funny. The class only has two exams, but has a lot of homeworks that are easy to do well on. It also ends about a month before the other classes since all the plants die, which is pretty nice!

,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,1.0,5.0,Evelina Mengova
,"Horrific. She gave us a quiz one day after syllabus day that was extremely specific and difficult.

A professor's job is to teach students, not watch them struggle.",1.0,5.0,Rory Moore
,"(This course was taken during COVID, so take this with a grain of salt) Falk is a nice, kind man, but he is the worst professor I've ever had in my life and I no longer want to pursue a math minor because of him.

Glad its finally over good freaking bye",4.0,3.0,Richard Kim

,"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass.

,I really enjoyed this professor. His lectures were lengthy and can get boring if youre not super into soil science but he is hilarious and keeps things interesting. His tests are not easy and a lot of questions are from lecture. Attendance was not mandatory but not sure how you could pass without attending most classes.,4.0,4.0,Mike Konen
,Knows what he is talking about but boring lectures. Tests are multiple choice with take-home short answers and you get a 3x5 note card. Multiple chances for easy extra credit and gives study guide with exact topics. Group project is unnecessary but easy to finish fast and it doesn't matter how well your partners do. Helps with online hw in class.,4.0,2.0,Mariano Baez

,She's pretty cool and the class is a lot of readings. Attendance isn't mandatory but the whole class grade rides on a group project and she gives pop quizzes a few times. She's a pretty fair grader once you have to do papers and there's no final except for a group presentation.,4.0,3.0,Kim De Wolff
,"Reading, a discussion post, and 1-2 assignments and quizzes per week. Everything is pretty simple and Prof. Lirenso is very understanding of people's situations.

I recommend him for GEO 001.",5.0,2.0,Alemayehu Lirenso

But if you do, make sure you can manage your time",3.0,4.0,Trista Wang

Easy A as long as you do the work.",5.0,2.0,Francis Olive

The class was much easier before we transitioned to online though.",1.0,4.0,Liina Ladon
,He's a pretty good professor a tip for the final is know the formulas or you won't pass the final which is worth 45% of your grade. I would take him again. Also go to class because he takes attendance and gives extra credit for coming to class,4.0,4.0,Cornell Fulop
,"Dr. Mkhatshwa goes out of his way to ensure that each student understands the material, and if they don't, he's willing to meet with them outside class anytime to go over it. He often gives chances to make up bad exam grades. His PhD is in Math Education, so he's also just good at teaching math. He's great. Can't recommend enough.",5.0,3.0,Thembinkosi Mkhatshwa
,Good class overall,3.0,3.0,Jenny Collins
,"Nice guy, tries to make jokes. Lectures are essentially from the textbook. He does give helpful tips about certain strategies for problems though, so maybe have a friend who goes to class. Tests are graded fair, and you can ask him for a regrade of a problem if you think you deserve a few more points.",4.0,4.0,Yook-Kong Yong
,"Professor Bermudez is the best. In her class, you get one paper for each unit (3) and, you do a rough draft for each. If you want, she will conference with you and let you know what you need to change. You will receive an A in her class if you do all the work that she assigns.",5.0,1.0,Michelle Bermudez
,This man should do us all a favor and retire.  His class is hard and he rounds down instead of up for your final grade.  I should have got a 2.7 but he gave me a 2.6.  He is the type of professor that looks at teaching as only a job and takes no interest in the student.  The tax assignments were VERY time consuming and worth little points.,1.5,4.0,James Serocki
,Awesome professor. He wants us to understand and not just remember words. This course is hard! But he uses lots of pictures in explaining things. You must work for your grade.,5.0,4.0,Brian Feige
,"This was a terribly easy class. All of the exams were open book and really, that gave no incentive to actually learn any of the material. Ultimately, this class is what you make of it. If you really have the time to learn the material, go ahead! If you already have a heavy schedule, you can still very easily get an A with literally no effort.",5.0,1.0,Jody Loundsbery

,"Hes a great professor! His class was never boring and you learn a lot from him as far as theatre and life. You have to a video critique every week thats just a page long, go see 2 plays and write a critique, and do a few simple assignments here and there. There isnt a book so you have to show up & take notes by they are really simple.",5.0,2.0,Brian Scruggs
,"Marek has a very successful engineering career and he has a very wide knowledge of the industry. But when it comes to teaching, HE IS TERRIBLE.

Lack of clarification is his the biggest problem. 3/10",1.5,4.0,Marek Czekanski
,"Professor Dominguez is a great instructor. He might be a little strict and a tough grader, but if you try your best and go in there ready to learn you should be fine. Many students dont recommend him because you have to read a lot or because of the essays but how else will you learn! You should want to earn you grade rather that just receive it!",5.0,4.0,David Dominguez

I wouldn't doubt that he can fly either.",5.0,3.0,Dennis Cao
,"I took her Black Sci Fi class a year ago, and it was so incredible that she easily became my favorite English professor.

,"Dusseau is a great professor. There's a lot of homework online so don't miss it or you won't get an A. Also the class is very test heavy but don't worry because he curves.

,His tests ARE kinda tough. But if you go to lecture & take notes you can get a good grade. His papers were pretty easy & he grades them easy. He gives out SO much extra credit!! I think because he knows that the material is quite challenging. The 2 below here must be Freshman. Welcome to University! Though I admit his lectures are rather dry.,4.0,3.0,Howard Birnbaum
,"This Professor is OK, but finding out when assignments are due, what needs to be done for them, and those details, are not able to be found online, or in his syllabus.

Take this teacher and you will do well.",5.0,3.0,John Valliere

,Professor Zimmerman is not doing well in the virtual world. She doesnt post assignments when she says she will and gives feedback on assignments after they are due.

On the final she included content she never taught and posted a ppt so we could teach ourselves.,1.0,3.0,Jo Zimmerman
,Professor Nielsen was very kind and sweet every single day in class. The one thing that I would criticize is the somewhat difficult to understand criteria for submissions and projects- a lot of the directions are difficult to understand and the portfolio submission process was very confusing because of the confusing directions she gave us.,4.0,4.0,Christina Nielsen

,"Professor Bulriss was from Chandler Gilbert Community College. I dropped his OGL320 right after the first day.

,"Mrs. McGee is THE best professor I have had! She gives great lectures, and despite the fact that she may go on tangents, they're typically some way or fashion related to her lecture, and if they aren't, they're great mood lighteners.

And she definitely plays favorites.",3.0,5.0,Bridget Chalk

She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",2.5,5.0,Maureen Hawkins
,"Though her class is lecture heavy, she is very good at teaching. She draws out a bunch of diagrams to help you understand.

Thank you Dr. Yamazaki!! I learned so much!!",5.0,4.0,Katrina Yamazaki

,"Dr. Suggs was great and showed that he genuinely cared. He's super passionate about music and his lectures were engaging. He never assigned much work and it was an easy A. We had a few short quizzes straight from the lecture, an extra credit quiz, and a final paper that he was super lenient about. Overall, great professor and not a stressful class!",5.0,1.0,Samuel Suggs

Her experience outside of academia shows because she emphasizes the topics that are actually used on the job. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,5.0,3.0,Leslie-Anne Keown
,"Jamie is one of the worst professors I have ever had. She is hopelessly repetitive, completely uninformative, and vague with expectations. She is also incredibly rude and condescending.

,"The lectures are a waste of time. I went to every single one and I don't know jack about what's going on. This is an intro class and all he does is use upper level terms that make no sense to me. I like him, he seems like a cool dude, but his ability to teach needs work. On the upside, there's very few tests.",2.0,3.0,Dwight Day
,This course has a lot of info but he tries to make it as easy as can be. Multiple choice tests from the HW and from the lectures.

He tries to make it interesting.,4.0,4.0,Igor Zaitsev

Take her!",5.0,3.0,Ludivina Avila
,"So. Much. Homework. Each module had an insane amount of reading required to answer the THREE discussion posts per week. It was annoying because it wasn't worth the amount of work required, but also worth too much to skip it. On top of that, so many little assignments and huge papers. Doesn't give you a HW break on weeks of papers. No exams.",3.0,4.0,Elsa Candelario
,Thompson is hands down the best professor I have had at USC. He is extremely articulate and presents the most difficult topics in a clear and concise manner.

,"Professor Jassen is very nice and cares about her students. I have a strong science background so this class was easy for me, if you don't have one you will definitely need to study a ton!

,"Professor Benjamin really does mean well. This class is very lecture heavy and I didn't really understand them. However, the material can be learned if you put the work in.

Amazing educator and person.",5.0,3.0,David Dusseau

The only reason you really have to go to class is because there are a lot of in class activities that add up for points in the end, other than that the material is really easy if you have basic scientific/world issue knowledge.

You were not going to get that one right.",3.5,3.0,Keval Khaur Khalsa

Calls slaves ""workers.""",1.0,3.0,Jorge Cividanes

,"His reviews before the test help immensely. He tries to get the class to participate and often would wait for a response which kinda wastes class time.

Unfortunately, no phones or laptop usage in his class.",5.0,1.0,Brian Williams
,"Professor Esposito is PHENOMENAL!!! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and I adore his ""pathos"" during lectures.

She is an awful lecturer and makes the material dry, but if you show up to every lecture, take pictures of the images that she omits in her lecture notes, and have good memorization skills then you're fine.

,"Very nice man but a terrible teacher. It was a ""teach yourself class"" which is hard when its college-level physics. His lectures were all over the place and I never had any idea what was going on. He gives a one problem quiz almost every class and the tests were very tough. He curves each test average to a 75 because almost everyone fails. Bad.",4.0,4.0,Andrew Berger

Good class and good professor.",5.0,1.0,Tamika Wright

If you are interested in poetry, take this and she'll teach you how to improve as a poet, but it is also valuable for writers. In fact, on our exam, we were tested only for the poetry readings and poetry terminology; none of the fiction.",4.0,4.0,Jen Duncan
,"He had some pretty cheesy math jokes.  Also, he liked to explain the history of what we were learning.  However, that was all he explained.

She's the adorable mom type while still being young.",5.0,4.0,Elizabeth Kiesewetter
,"Cool guy and super understanding. Does not stand over everyone as they take the tests, so they don't panic he just sits and reads. I personally hate short answer questions but love him. He expects you to do your readings. Tests are 5 question short answer format. APA research report with statistics and citing your sources (huge part of your grade).",5.0,3.0,Sean Galvin

,"Definite GPA booster for me, can get 100% on online labs (MC Q's) if you compare answers with ppl. 3% survey bonus marks. Lots of recommended readings, but I barely did any of it (~5-6 pages altogether) and got 95%. Focus on online notes, learning obj, and video questions. Use textbook for reference, or when smthing is explicitly mentioned to know.",4.0,2.0,Louise Longridge
,"Scanlon isn't really that bad. He gets excited about what he teaches and it may sometimes come across as yelling. He may seem unapproachable and grouchy, but he's really not. He's willing to help anyone and everyone who has a question.",3.5,4.0,Matthew Scanlon
,"Avoid if possible. Although he's a nice guy and very funny, I found the lectures to be very unclear. I had to teach myself everything in this class and mechanics is not an easy thing to self teach. Studying hard and often is the key to doing well. He gives a quiz every class but helps in the end. Tests are hard but he curves the average to a 75.",2.5,4.0,Andrew Berger
,"Mr. Kula is my favorite teacher. He is strict and an old school teacher, but what is wrong about that?! He is funny, passionate and devoted. He wants you to study so it would benefit you in the future. It is the easiest thing to give students easy/free points, but it takes much more than that for you to succeed. He is not def easy but the best!",5.0,4.0,Walter Kula

And she bases the course schedule around the class needs",5.0,2.0,Angela Asbell
,"I took an online class with her, so there's not much to say about her lectures. However, the direction that she took the class was very engaging: problems regarding values were the center of this Comp/Rhetoric II class.

,"Took honors intro to music with him, and he is a great professor. He just writes notes on the board, but he is very clear about his expectations and what to expect on the test.

,"One of my first classes at CSN. He's a funny and smart teacher, but you really have to work to learn. These aren't easy concepts to grasp and the lectures don't make it much easier.

If you're not good enough for her, good luck!",1.0,4.0,Michelle Jimmerson

Yes the class is boring but it's an easy ""A"" if you put some effort into it.",3.0,1.0,Jo Zimmerman
,Not only does he not curve but a 90% is a B+; how messed up is that? His grading scale actually makes it harder to get an A.  All of the other science classes I have taken have either the normal grading scale or they make an A 87% and above then scale off of that. He is not interested in seeing his students do well.,1.0,5.0,Clemens Heske

,"Prof Portfleet is the easiest, most laid-back prof I have ever had. She is an extremely easy grader and is understanding if you can't get all of the assignments done on time.

Get to know her, and she will bloom into your life.",5.0,4.0,Sayuri Kubota
,I dont know why everyone makes a big deal about Professor Drake being too hard. Its probably because he is one of the few professors who is actually legit here at the university of Montana.I get A's on all his tests. The key is going to class and making distinctions behind main actors in the readings. Not a class for deadbeats who only want easyA's,4.5,3.0,Richard Drake
,"Professor Dixon is a great teacher, but she is a tough grader. She grades on a 7 pt. scale, so she expects a lot from you. Don't procrastinate on anything. Seriously. Your grades will reflect it, and don't be late to class. If you put forth the effort and do the work, you'll learn a lot.  Earning an A isn't too difficult.",4.5,4.0,Melody Dixon-Brown
,Dr. Baddar taught me more about writing & conducting research than any teacher I have ever had. She cares about students & if anybody has any problems or needs extensions due to personal issues she is more than happy to work with the student to make sure they succeed. Many of the bad reviews are from students who did not attend class or participate,4.0,3.0,Maha Baddar
,"Professor Eubanks is extremely knowledgeable in his field. This was one of the most interesting courses I've taken at NCTC. It requires a lot of reading and writing, but the majority of the material is highly fascinating. There is no textbook required as the professor provides all of the reading material, so you save some money there.",5.0,4.0,Kevin Eubanks
,No word can describe his class. You have to understand mumble and polish accent to know what hes talking about. I dont think he even knows what he's talking about. He speaks the same language as DESIIGNER except monotone and every now and than a moan.,1.0,5.0,Marek Czekanski
,"Excellent Prof for Kin150, very help full as long as you seek her help.  Written exams (short answers) are straight forward, NO trick questions, if you study, you will do good.

,"It would be a great class if she stuck to subjects like, I dont know, German. I dont pay my hard earned money to hear a language professor give her inane comments about the patriarchy and gender discrimination. Other than that the pedagogy is good. This being said, the other GERM instructors are also great so I recommend them to new students.",1.0,3.0,Heike Polster
,"Not a professor i would want to take for Math 201. Very out of it and always did things that wouldn't help someone out as a teacher. She made a lot of problems harder then what they were.

Would not recommend!!",1.0,5.0,Audra Sherwood

,"This professor is my favorite professor I've ever had. You do get homework every week but it takes maybe 10 minutes, his exams are easy as easy can get (he goes over the entire exam the class before) and there is no way you'll fall asleep because he constantly keeps your attention. I adored his class so much, I took this semester his Into to Anthro",5.0,2.0,Lonn Monroe

,"Three papers, but he is unhelpful when you ask for advice. He will grade lower on papers written on subjects he doesn't like, so write about the assigned books if you want to get an A. He is unclear with his instructions and he mumbles a lot during class. His lectures are irrelevant and unhelpful in class. Hard class/grader, not recommended.",1.5,4.0,Carlton Smith

,"I took her class for the F/W 2019 year and dropped it because she refuses to use any technology whatsoever. If you miss class even for a valid reason such as a doctor's appointment, a family loss, etc., you're screwed because she doesn't use moodle and doesn't post any content online. She often said she never uses her work email and never responds.",1.0,3.0,Jen Duncan
,"This professor is extremely difficult. Genetics is a difficult class through and through but Dr. Jone's makes it ridiculously difficult. On our past test, no one made A or B and the average was a 58. She thinks we are doing well though. Do not plan on taking this class and coming out with a good grade even if you study at least a week in advance!!",1.0,5.0,Jacqueline Jones

,Was not a fan of this class or professor. Very dry lectures that were essentially read from the textbook verbatim and not engaging whatsoever. I took this class during COVID and the entire course was just multiple choice tests... Try a different professor if you actually want to enjoy this class.,1.0,3.0,Sandra Colavecchia
,"He absolutely cares about your long-term learning, not just a grade in one class. He takes time to work with you in your real circumstances.

And he's really good at structuring assignments to actually assess whether you're learning, not just whether you can cram.",5.0,3.0,Spencer Scoville
,"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors!

I'm an older student and enjoyed him very much.",4.0,2.0,Marco Rios

,"Buhler is a basic professor who is out to prove a point. If you really want to learn the concepts, take an online Algorithms course, or just read CLRS by yourself.  You'll learn more and get your money's worth. 541T is not worth the tuition cost or time. If you do take it, be sure to cheat on HW. Everyone else does.",1.0,5.0,Jeremy Buhler

,He is an ok teacher. He gives a lot of oppertunity for extra credit. His main goal is to have everyone pass the class. There is a lot of reading to be done by yourself.

,"Pretty average professor, but if you are confused and ask a question he makes sure you understand before moving on.

Usually it is just 10-15 questions to make sure you understand the material. You get to use StatCrunch which is an online program that does calculations for you.,4.0,3.0,Jing Chang
,He is absolutely horrible. I have learned nothing from this professor. He sits in class every day and just reads off the power points and plays YouTube videos of people teaching the concepts.

Unsure if he's just new to the job or what, but he was completely inconsistent in assignments. Also regularly says inflammatory things to get discussions going. ",2.5,3.0,Timothy Barnum
,"Heather Hug Robbins was a little odd. She described herself as an award winning teacher. I did not see it. She used sexual analogies to discuss content, which was strange. She gave 100 point exams and a 200 point cumulative final. The final can ruin your grade. A 200 point final does not seem to be a good strategy for an award winning instructor.",3.0,3.0,Heather Hug
,Steve is really enthusiastic about his subject but doesn't always do a good job of explaining. He will throw problems up on the board and go through them but doesn't really go into detail enough to grasp it.

,"This class was awful, i never wanted to go and when i did i was counting down the minutes to leave. She is not helpful at all yet expects A LOT of work from you and mostly all of it comes from the books she assigns. Notes taken in class were mostly useless, very unorganized and a very hard grader. I would not recommend this class to anyone.",1.5,5.0,Carol Hart

She was the first professor that I actually enjoyed coming to English class. I highly recommend taking Elfring!!,5.0,2.0,Mary Elfring
,"I'm sure she's great for upper level classes because I can tell she's caring & intelligent. However, this was so much work for a 100 level class. & I don't think she planned her lessons.

,"Prasad is an amazing teacher, goes super in depth to make sure students understand chemistry. If you keep up with the online assignments, the class is fairly simple.

Super helpful if you don't understand things, makes chemistry fun.",5.0,3.0,Roopa Prasad

Overall high marks.",4.0,4.0,Alina Reznitskaya

,"Took this online over the summer... It was extremely difficult without lecture, because the structure of class is to just do a ton of readings and then answer questions on Skype and write an essay about the readings (at the end of each week). It may work for some people, but I feel like I didn't learn that much or get a good grade.",2.5,5.0,Norman Sullivan

Also available outside of class. Her lectures can be a little boring but her class is an easier one if you pay attention.",4.0,3.0,Zee Perry
,"One popquiz the whole semester. Tests were pretty easy in my opinion, just study from the sheet he gives you. DO THE HOMEWORK at the back of the chapter as he spontaneously checks them. Overall, he's offensive. he says inappropriate things in class, but I managed an A without trying too hard.",2.0,3.0,Malcolm Levitin
,"This Professor has a clear grading criteria. There  are 4 tests. Each test is 30% take home and 70% in class. His tests are very clear. Just go to the mathlab if you do not understand his explanations. His explanations are not the best, but you can easily get an A if you do the homework and prepare for the tests.",5.0,2.0,Benjamin Davis
,"Assigns TONS of homework (esp. readings) and expects you to do it thoroughly and come to class prepared to engage in in-depth discussions.

Great class, but tough.",3.5,4.0,Roxanne Hamilton

His exams are really hard, but if you study alot, you'll be fine.",5.0,4.0,Gary Schnittjer
,"I had an A until the last two weeks of class. Only the auto-graded things were graded and given very little weight like 10%. The term paper wasn't graded before the final exam paper was due so you have no idea how she grades.

,"Mike is my favorite prof so far at the UW. His grading is very lenient with re-submissions, which saved me in some instances. He is very helpful during office hours and on slack as well. This course content is difficult especially if you are new to coding, but with hard work a high score is possible.",5.0,4.0,Michael Freeman
,"He is nice enough and discussions can be lively. However, this class shouldn't be required for anyone 25 or older.

Too many papers to write overall, got tiresome. Also, don't buy Outliers.",2.0,2.0,Barry Foster

Exams are extremely long, 3 hours long to be exact but its for your benefit it actually gives you a better opportunity to pass because you don't need all the questions to pass the test. It would be a mistake for anyone taking Accounting 1 & 2 to not take him",5.0,1.0,David Park
,Not a good lecturer. All he does is assign youtube videos to watch at home and tests you on it. His classes consist of answering questions about the homework and correcting quiz questions you got wrong. Only reason I passed is because I took Calculus in High School.

,She goes right off her powerpoints which teaches you NOTHING: you can obviously read. she gives you chapters to read each night but does TEACH you anything. she gives reviews for exams but then SURPRISE: only a few things she went over is actually on the exam. Papers are easy. Exams are hard. POP QUIZZES!!!,1.5,4.0,Latisha Bates
,"All grades are based off of homework, and tests. Once you get your test back you can correct it and get half the points back, you missed. He is helpful if you miss a class or just need help. He doesn't email back. Calling is how you get ahold of him. You can work on projects and homework with a partner. He posts all his stuff on blackboard.",3.5,1.0,William Ruesink

,Good professor overall. I never liked math and only took the class for gen-ed requirement but the material she goes over is interesting and I did learn some useful stuff from the course. Class went fully online mid semester but she did good job in making things easily accessible. Exam problems are similar to the examples she goes over in class,5.0,2.0,Mikaela Park

,"So awesome!  I've learned so much in this class!  At first I was worried about keeping up with all the reading and work, but once you see how it helps with your essays and how the topics make you think, it got easier.  Not a coaster class, she makes you work, but so worth it.  Totally recommend!!",5.0,5.0,Angie Magallon
,"You will have homework due every day, but it is pretty easy and he usually gives most of the answers in class the day before. Goes over everything you need to know. The material is surprisingly easy if you pay attention. Tests are too long though. Most people run out of time. Too much reading and writing. Nice and funny guy though.",4.0,2.0,Daniel Schaal
,"Ian Green is a tough grader who requires a decent amount of reading. He is, however, really good at giving feedback and really good at making you become a better writer.

No surprises and no big papers to write. 10/10.",5.0,1.0,Russell Powell
,Professor Henao was an amazing professor. My first semester of Spanish my teacher never gave us exams or homework really but then took this for SPN1120 and it was very different.

,"While not easy, she does care. She is a genius, so the quality of instruction matches the rigor. Also is hilarious, making lecture fun.

,"Love his classes and personality, which is really interesting, however it's just way too difficult. I think he tries to prepare us for the real LTAM exam difficulty, but the pace is just too fast. Exams are usually a lot harder than HWs and quizzes, which can be a shock attack to lots.",4.0,5.0,Nan Zhu
,"He is a very nice person and had some fun lectures, but the tests are way different from the lectures. The first exam had an average of like 68% and that was because his quizzes, lectures, homework, and honestly even the book don't truly prepare you well enough for the exams. He scratches the surface and expects you to dive deeper. Seems flipped.",3.0,5.0,William Heyborne

,"Professor Shartin was great! It is really important that you go to all of the classes otherwise you will be so far behind you cannot catch up.

Good QR requirement!",4.0,4.0,Daniel Shartin

,So caring and kind. You can tell how much she loves what she does and it shines through her. I had been in the hospital for a while and she checked on me constantly and was there for me when I needed to get caught up. She tells you exactly what will be on her tests. If you fail this class it is completely your fault. She gives multiple chances.,4.5,2.0,Dolores Smith

ROCK AND ROLL!",4.0,1.0,Mark Pawkett
,He definitely cares and wants students to succeed. The problem was is he did not teach in a way that helped that. He mostly read off lecture slides and class was boring.

,"Very smart, arrogant. Counter intuitive point of view. Buy his book or Economics of Strategy not Kotler. Attack his theories and learn to be humiliated. Very approachable but has draconian rules about homework/presentations. Don't piss him off and don't talk about things you don't understand. Don't expect solutions to cases and enjoy the ride.",3.5,5.0,HARSHARANJ Jagpal
,"I have nothing but good things to say about David. He goes above and beyond just teaching. He legitimately wants to influence you for the better and make a difference in your life. The best teacher I've had at Iowa and maybe anywhere, I'll be hard pressed to find one that's better.",5.0,3.0,David Hensley
,Tests are easy if you do the take home test and review test (he only changes the number in class test) there are 2 easy assignments and like 3-4 homeworks and you need the textbook to do the homework. He is the best and easiest professor! Take him and get an A+,5.0,1.0,William Ruesink
,Dr. H is hilarious! I really enjoyed attending her class. The books that she assigns are actually pretty interesting. She also assigns textbook reading but the tests focus on her lectures and the assigned books. Most of the test is from lectures and in class materials so make sure you pay attention and be ready for essays on test day.,5.0,4.0,Kate Hudepohl
,"Dr. Carter has been through a lot this semester and he still came to all our classes with a smile and was always prepared to discuss the readings even when people didn't read, and he always showed understanding for what students are going through. He is such a committed teacher and kind person. The class ha a lot of reading but the papers are easy.",5.0,4.0,Jon Carter
,"Dr. Zavarin is very knowledgeable but more importantly is an effective teacher.  He is relaxed, funny and approachable, and will make himself available for questions.  He seems to want you to succeed and provides thorough practice exams and solutions and some extra credit.  Lectures are thorough and not at all boring.  Definitely take his class!",5.0,3.0,Mavrik Zavarin
,He is not a good professor if you take him for an online course. Also doesn't provide good feedback. If he has an issue with your writing instead of letting you know with the first few weeks so you can correct it and still pass the course he waits till the end so you end up failing. Worst professor I have ever had is no help what so ever.,1.0,5.0,Tony Bartl
,Dr. Tavvs is a small glistening sliver of hope in this scarlet hell that is Rutgers University. 1 in 1000 teachers gives a crap in this school and Dr. Tavvs is that one teacher.

,"this is a research writing class so prepare to write like all the time. she gives good feedback and wants your papers to be good so that helps, if you go to class and just listen to her instructions on the different sections you will understand.

,"I really dont understand all the negative reviews for Dr. Misurda. His lectures are amazing and he is passionate about the subject material. If you dont wanna learn, dont take his course.

,Took this as an online course. Only thing she ever posts is reminders on days of tests. I had difficulty and bombed the first exam so I reached out for help and she referred me to the book. The computer graded everything so basically she got paid to do nothing. I discovered on my own she uses practice problems on test.,1.0,4.0,Stephanie Rafferty
,"Could never understand what he was saying with his accent. Even if I could the lectures were boring and couldn't pay attention. I studied the material myself outside of class. Pop quizzes but he drops 3- although he ended up dropping 4 and an exam because so many people were struggling. Bought the book but never used, all powerpoints are online.",2.0,3.0,Shafiun Shimul
,He goes over the course too fast. He went over a semester worth of course within 2 months. All he did was review for the last month. so bascially skip class? you will not pass or you can just by hitting the books forever. ,1.5,3.0,Eugene Oks
,"To be honest I had no idea what to expect but Dr. Carter is genuinely a good guy and probably after he handled my personal crisis with empathy and concern I would take another course with him. There are weekly papers and two 5 pagers for midterm and final, but he will give you feedback to improve your writing and it atually helped me.",4.0,4.0,Jon Carter
,"He is really nice, but not the best professor.  He is very unorganized and doesn't really ""teach"".  He assigns HW  then just expects you to know the material for next class.

,"I took the web course during Spring.  Tests are straight out of Powerpoints.  There will be group projects to do, which is odd, since it is a web course.  It is kind of a pre-accounting course.",4.0,3.0,Femi Ayadi
,Awesome online lectures. Always responds to emails in a timely manner. Fair grader. Before every exam he gives a practice test then holds zoom meeting to go over every problem and answers any thing you are still unsure of.

,"Honestly, he's up and down. I've gone through the semester hating him and other times thinking he was okay. If he got rid of his condescension it would have been a more pleasant experience. When it comes to the work in the class, study for the lab quizzes and do your best, you will surely pass the class. ",3.0,4.0,Igor Zaitsev
,"Such an easy class!!! Wow, if you take this professor, you definitely won't regret it. No homework, you can find the answers online for the 3 quizzes he gives, and that's pretty much it! No midterm or final, only 1 group assignment which is easy too. You can sign the attendance and just leave later class. Definitely a good pick not gonna lie.",5.0,1.0,Chinnappa Jayachandran
,"Your grade is based on one exam, weekly quizzes, recitations, and homework. The professor flies through lecture slides, but lecture recordings are posted. She makes a lot of mistakes in class and can be rude to students. We had to fight for extra credit that was in the syllabus. If you have the option, you might want to choose someone else.",2.0,3.0,Liina Ladon
,"I took this class online for Spanish 101, and I highly recommend it.  The course is clearly laid out right from the start and the weekly assignments were very reasonable.  I actually enjoyed the online work.  She drops several homework and quiz grades, so it's pretty flexible.  I took another instructor for 102, and it wasn't nearly as organized.",5.0,3.0,Leslie McIver
,"Her class is project heavy so be prepared to put in a lot of hours. Her quizzes are what makes her class little challenging but she gives review slides for preparation after each lecture. Quizzes are short answers, not multiple choice. Memorize it. If you need an A, then you would have to work hard. Period. She is brilliant and knows her stuff.",5.0,5.0,Kim Sunyoung
,Professor Stevenson is amazing! Anatomy lab can be quite long but her lectures are interesting and she is very clear about what she expects you to know. Tests and quizzes are straightforward and she doesn't try to trick you. She also makes sure to give credit where credit is due. Highly recommend!!!,5.0,2.0,Maura Stevenson
,"he doesn't reply to emails often, but makes the effort if a student is in need of some attention like retaking an exam and such. His notes aren't that organized, made grand mistakes on poppers and deadlines so this is pretty much self taught. College alg is decent, not too hard not too easy either. Just study by yourself honestly.",1.0,1.0,Homayoon Shobeiri

,"Super friendly! Admitted he wasn't great at lecture timing with class being online.

Don't even need the textbook, just rewatch lectures",5.0,3.0,David Hoffman
,"I loved taking sociology with Mrs. Trent. She is funny, kind and a good professor. If you put in the work the class should be an easy A. Exams are the hardest part but there are plenty of other things that you can use to bring your grade up!",5.0,2.0,Carol Trent

,"Dr. Hansen is such an effective teacher. He requires you to read the textbook outside of class. But his lectures makes everything you read about come together and make sense. He's very caring, and you can tell he's passionate. He made soils, a class that probably would have otherwise bored me, interesting. By the end of the semester I actually care",5.0,3.0,Neil Hansen
,"If you don't put in to this class what you expect to get out of it, then you only hurt yourself. She is very helpful and tries to break it down to simple phonics. It is elementary spanish and I applaud her for trying to make it fun.",5.0,1.0,Leslie McIver

,Professor is very passionate about his subject. Gives ALL test questions before test you just have to find answers...which were still HARD to find! Will still need to put in effort to get A/B range but otherwise not hard. Takes 5 random attendance checks for 5 points each. Not as exciting of material as had expected though. More like Earth science.,4.5,3.0,Daniel Proga
,"I enjoyed the class itself, test are tough. But Professor Roe is available via email and even during her office hours (beware they were 8:30).

Really just and overall good guy.",5.0,2.0,Mark List

,"2nd time taking her and will take again if I can! She is on top of keeping the class informed of everything via email. Great, detailed feedback on grades.

Easy class to pass and very fair&nice",5.0,2.0,Patricia Ikegwuonu

No CC or slides, he writes on a chalkboard, so show up !",5.0,4.0,John McDonald
,Prof Infante is both an adorable person and a fabulous professor.  He listens to his students and makes time to meet at least once during the semester with each student in the class.

,He is possible one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is very bad at explaining topics and doesnt go over half of the clicker questions so its hard to catch up if you are behind. The only reason I go to his lectures is for clicker questions because I learn little from him. The class by itself isn't bad but do what you can to avoid having him,1.0,3.0,Loren Hough

It is necessary to read in order to understand the course thoroughly. Her organization and guidance made the course successful.",5.0,3.0,Renee Mayne
,Very funny but a horrible teacher. He does not teach just tells you what to look at in the book. Very messy on the board and jumps from one thing to another.

Just read chapters.",5.0,2.0,Yasoda Sharma

One project about your topic of choice as long as someone else doesn't pick it. Love",3.5,1.0,Robert Caruso
,"He's a nice guy, but his teaching style is super weird. No textbook, which means lots of reading of links off of BlackBoard.

This is a course you really need to teach yourself.",3.0,5.0,Brian Osoba

She's really really sweet and super easy going about everything. i would definitely recommend her",4.0,2.0,Marlene Pearson
,"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.

,"Dr. McDonald is passionate about what he's teaching, and I got the impression that he loves teaching his students and preparing them for what actually ""doing Biology"" is going to look like.

This is a hard class though and it requires effort, put final was a project not a test, which was nice. He was awesome though and he wants you to do good so take his class.",5.0,4.0,Peter Wildman
,"I'm not one to use this application, but for this class, I'm going to have to make the exception. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She is a tough grader, however she is also a very poor professor. She reads off the PowerPoint verbatim and is not good at answering questions. She has no problem teaching a chapter and testing you on it the same class. Overall, bad",1.0,4.0,Rosa Fernandes
,professer Wider is an amazing professor who's passionate about what he does. his quizzes are very easy. He gives a quiz before every chapter so make sure you do the reading.,5.0,2.0,Markese Wider
,"Although he was very intimidating at times and the majority of his test questions were a bit hard, I would absolutely take Dr. Nguyens class again. I must admit, I slacked on studying since this is a gen ed, so thats why I didnt do great on exams. BUT the class was worth it! If you genuinely take his ideas to your heart, youll be fine.",5.0,4.0,Nam Nguyen
,"I took this course during the summer semester. The exams are tough. Take notes on everything in his lectures (what's on the Powerpoint AND what he says) and you should be okay. He only has four grades, which are all exams. I can't stress how important it is to copy down EVERYTHING. He gives lots of valuable information, though. Good luck! :)",3.0,5.0,Eugene Paoline
,"Amazing person and prof. 101 has more work than you would expect, but everything was very clear. She is very understanding, even extending due dates. Would recommend for 101 to anyone. Everyone has the opportunity to earn an A",5.0,3.0,Melissa Morris
,Prof. Kim decided to make it so that the only way to view his lectures was to see them live. If you are an international student do not take this class due to time zone problems. If you are a domestic student still avoid him because his refusal to upload is a clear sign of being an egomaniac who demands your presence to pad his fragile educator ego,1.0,3.0,Richard Kim
,"Prof Ruzek is a really great teacher. She provides solid feedback for assignments, allowing students to develop and improve their writing throughout the semester. Although the textbook isn't necessary for the class, reading it will help improve your writing ability. She is also flexible with due dates. Overall 10/10 would recommend",5.0,3.0,Jessica Ruzek
,"Do not take his class. For the field class prepare for the class to end sometimes more than an hour past what is schedule. Very strict grader, heavy on the report papers every week. Boden teaches intro level classes but teaches them in a more complex way than most people understand. In other words, if you dont know a lot about geology good luck",1.0,4.0,David Boden
,"Super easy class, didn't need to buy the text book. No homework, just study for the tests. His powerpoints are on webcampus and he keeps your grade updated.",5.0,1.0,Daniel Proga
,"He's a cool dude. He calls on everyone around the room during class, so you have to pay attention.

Go to class, read the assigned papers, you'll do fine.",4.0,4.0,John McDonald
,He is an awesome professor. He makes Tech writing a lot easier than it is. If you follow his outlines and go to him for feedback you will* be successful in the class. His attendance is kind of mandatory.   ,4.5,3.0,Michael Perez
,"Ignore the negative posts! This instructor is a MUST ! The class is easy to navigate, offers repeatable homework + tons of bonus points (up to 2.5% onto final grade). She posts all of the questions + answers to the final exam and the average of the midterm + final replaces a low midterm score. If you can't pass this class, you did't try!",5.0,2.0,Melissa Logue
,Dr. Hill by far one of the best professor's ive ever had in my years at college. She is very helpful and kind,4.0,3.0,Laura Hill
,"Assigns a boat load of reading, but they're interesting books. He urges you to develop a deeper meaning and to look for symbols in every book you're given. You must contribute towards class discussing at least once every time you meet for class. Papers are 7-10 Pgs but says you can write more ore express deeper thought. He is awesome.",4.0,4.0,Ian Green
,"His lectures were based on the book but he also did many problems from outside sources that were relevant to the lecture. I had to put in a lot of work as the class was mostly proof writing and I had never done proofs before. On the plus side, he is a very easy grader. There were times I got problems wrong and he would take off maybe a point.",5.0,3.0,Arup Mukherjee
,"This was an online class and assignments were done through MindTap. We also had discussions through BlackBoard.  The MindTap assignments had 3 tries, but the questions were way harder than what was learned. Professor is easy to get in touch with. I wish there were more work graded other than the MindTap. Grades were posted very late.",3.0,4.0,Hui Huang
,"For the first two weeks of class he rambled about non sense. Then for the rest of the semester he splits you into groups and you teach the class the book.  He doesn't teach anything. Each group has to present their chapter for two weeks at a time, and once you get through all the groups, you start over.  Huge time commitment outside of class.",1.0,4.0,Reimund Koehler
,"Probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken. You get discussion assignments per chapter, along with quizzes per chapter. Quizzes are straight forward. We had 2 groups projects, 2 major exams worth 100pts each, again pretty easy and straightforward. She gives feedback on assignments which is great because it allows you to correct any mistakes.",4.0,1.0,Kathryn Wood
,His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,2.0,5.0,David Dominguez
,"Lois Gray is the sweet Grandma-type professor. She is really passionate about what she does. The lectures are long and can be tedious but sometimes she does powerpoints about neat places and topics, so they can be interesting too.

,"If you want an easy A take him!! Also, it helps if you're an attractive female. I went to about three or four classes the whole semester, failed just about every test, and somehow received an A. It's almost impossible to get a bad grade in this class. And he gives a lot of extra credit just in case you feel you may need it.",4.0,1.0,Ben Fred-Mensah
,"She is by far the best teacher I've had, she is very patient and caring. Asbell does assign a couple of group projects and essays but she is whiling to work with you on due dates. She also expects you to participate in class and turn in the assignment on the date the class decides.",5.0,2.0,Angela Asbell
,"I took him for INBS 347. He's really not a bad professor at all, he has real life experience and often shares his experiences with the class so he gives everyone an idea of what it's like in the business world. 8 case studies that are in sets of 2 (4 case studies in February and April) and one term paper which is an export plan. would take again!",5.0,4.0,J Carrino
,Micro eco is an easy class overall. But Baruch likes to take an easy class and inject it full of algebra and equations. How many times do I have to calculate the area of a triangle? They shouldn't even teach the concepts just do the math. I feel like I got no applicable knowledge from this class. Idk how students avg 55 on exams.,3.0,3.0,Laetitia Placido

Great preparation for actual employment as a legal researcher.  Wish I had more classes I could take from him.",5.0,4.0,Michael Wiley
,Easy A as long as you ready and do assignments. I took online class and it is basically self taught material,4.0,1.0,Patricia Ikegwuonu
,"Dr. Foster is fairly average professor, in my opinion. The class mostly covered French history and other cultural topics, but I found it genuinely interesting. The work might become too much and her tests were some of the most difficult I have ever taken outside of math. However she gives clear directions and if you do what's needed, you'll be fine",3.0,4.0,Tarah Foster
,"The course itself was easy and interesting, but the prof made it difficult as some of the material discussed would be completely different from the quizzes.  I enjoyed the class but not the prof who taught it.",1.0,3.0,Adelle Forth

,This instructor is excellent at explaining how papers and research projects should be formatted. He is very willing to help when you need it but he does expect you to do your part of the work. The skills you learn in this class will contribute to your success in other classes. I highly recommend this instructor. ,4.5,4.0,Chris Vineyard
,I love this professor! Programming was very tough but he made it better. I made a 75 on his midterm but improved on the final exam with a 90 because I studied better. I made an A in the class but that was with a lot of hard work. He was very good at returning e-mails and answering any questions that students didn't understand. Please take him.,5.0,4.0,Simon Baev
,Honestly the course is challenging but I love this professor. If you go to class and do most of the reading than  you should be fine. If you go to his office hours he is very helpful he will answer questions and even take the time to help u grasp the content wether it's with helping link my flash cards together with the time period and terms or just plain explaining it to me he was very helpful. Great teacher if u like a little challenge take him!,4.0,3.0,Brad Hale

,"I enjoy learning from Hansen. He clearly loves what he does, and although he can be slow at returning papers, you would be hard pressed to find an instructor more engaging or intelligent. Smartest person I know, not just in his field but in general. Easy to talk to, always willing to help his students. Highly recommended.",4.5,3.0,James Hansen
,Steve is a very understanding professor. Although he didn't always help you understand the concepts very well. But he did allow note cards for most tests and even gave a take home test. There are online quizzes for each section and book work that isn't graded but is required. Very easy to get an A in this class if you are good at math.,3.5,1.0,Steve Rosin
,don't take this class,1.0,5.0,Stephan Krasa

,"Dr. Marlow is super fun. He has a hard time getting through the material because he encourage class discussion. He knows how to explain things so student's understand. Though there was one time where I emailed him a question and his reply was ""it's in the syllabus"".  The syllabus is 13 pages long. Just sayin. Into to Linguistics is very interesting",3.5,4.0,David Marlow
,Does not let you make up missed homework everything online and she doesnt clearly go over everything such as tenses,2.0,4.0,Jeanne Castano
,"She's an awesome professor. The class is an easy A in my opinion as long as you do the work required. Theres about 12 labs, but you only have to do 8. There are 10 discussion boards, but you only have to do 8. 4 easy quizzes, but you have to do 3. 2 tests, but you can bring a note card. If you do the extra labs then you get extra credit. Easy A.",5.0,2.0,Kelly Ellis
,"Professor Trombley lays her class out clearly. She consistently took the content from that week and related it to real life through discussion topics (which have several options to choose from).

,"I was afraid of taking her class, but it was one of the best classes I have taken! Professor Wolf is extremely organized and direct on what is expected!

,"VERY strict, needs to lighten up on grading. He will not give partial credit for anything!  Even if you worked out the problem right but put it into your calculator wrong. Since he doesn?t give any homework, EACH test is worth 15-20% of your final grade with only 16-27 problems per test;  meaning those small stupid mistakes will cost you big time.",3.5,4.0,Rod Kendall
,"I am an English learner and thought that I was gonna fail this class. However, he helped me a lot, and I ended up with a good grade. Just let him know you need help with writing, he is gonna find a way to help. Also, there is no quiz or test in his class.",5.0,4.0,Alex Gonzalez

,"He assigns weekly readings, which range from 20 to 200pgs, although you don't even have to read them, because he explains all of the important material during class.

Pray he likes your writing style",4.0,3.0,Benjamin Kenzer
,"online literature set up clearly.  Assignments due every two weeks.  No tests except exam.  Had to post journals, lengthy unit discussions, 1 short research project. Good readings.
