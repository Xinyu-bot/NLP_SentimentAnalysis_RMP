1,Super clear lectures. Low difficulty but you can definitely learn things! Took his differential equations at Scripps College this semester. Really liked it!,5.0,2.0,Randall Swift
1,"Dr. Gelderloos is a wonderful lecturer and a respectable man. However, I can't recommend his class to people who are trying to maximize their courseload or who are working. He gives an outrageous amount of work, easily several times more than my other upper level classes. His classes are difficult because of this. Have free time? Yes, take him.",4.0,4.0,Orin Gelderloos
0,"1. His slide decks are awful - paragraphs c&p'd, reads directly from, few in-class examples, no excel use, no computer lab classroom 2. Projects were good, but all self-learning, easy grader 3. Final is egregious nonsense. Took full 3h for 30q, and I wasn't alone. Most material not covered, you need to self study book. Take CFA instead.",1.0,4.0,BO Ouyang
1,No Comments,5.0,3.0,Melissa Birch
1,"Amazing professor, will certainly grow your interest of the music industry.  His lectures were incredibly informative and you will feel very fortunate to be in his class because he has so much knowledge to offer and you will absorb more of it than you could ever imagine, if you put in the work. It's a hard class, but well worth it.",5.0,4.0,Paul Young
1,i took Rafferty last fall. She told you what you had to do to pass and was always willing to help in office hours. Physics can be really boring but she made it interesting. She records lecture videos every day and posts them so if you miss class or need to see an example again. The homework is hard but the program walks you through it. Take her,4.5,4.0,Stephanie Rafferty
1,"I took the hybrid class.  He kept everything up to date on D2L and sent e-mail reminders when an assignment was due.  The assignments are easy to get full credit on.  The tests are matching and multiple choice, but he grades on a curve.  Be sure to study the book and the notes for the tests.",5.0,2.0,Albert Bugaj
1,She is very nice. I love her accent!!,5.0,1.0,Regina Blue-Soloman
1,My tailoring class with Ronda has transformed my sewing hobby into a total obsession! The techniques she teaches ranges from practical to total couture. Ronda provides excellent drawings and written material to assist you outside of class (and in the long term when you've forgotten how to use a certain technique). I look forward to every class!,5.0,4.0,Ronda Chaney
1,"Though she came off as tough, she was a great teacher. A lot of people didn't like her because she made us work but it's college it's time to be an adult. All Directions were precise and clear. I was always determined by her toughness and turned in every assignment on time,  never missed class, and got an A.",5.0,1.0,Vann Rogers
1,My boyfriend and I took her class and loved it. She was recommended by a lot of past students. If you study and come to class it's pretty chill. She stays after to help you with anything. Mrs. Garrisi is a cool prof.,5.0,1.0,Sensei Garrissi
1,Inspiring,5.0,3.0,Stephen Esposito
1,Professor Endlich is amazing. You won't regret taking her class. She is accessible and very understanding. Has a few lectures and papers but she is not as strict as other professor. She makes class enjoyable and easy going.,5.0,3.0,Christine Endlich
1,"Butman is a very tough grader however, is very easy once you get the hang of the essays. Learn from mistakes !!!! First 2 essays were an F and a D. He explained mistakes not to make and once corrected i became a B student. Point is, don't let his attitude make you drop he actually does care about his students in his own way",2.5,4.0,Ray Butman
1,Business Law 2.  Took this class Fall 2014 - Peruyera is a lawyer. He lectures each chapter via power point. Goes into Spanglish mode all the time. Funny guy. Easy going. Early releases usual. You will have a presentation and paper for the final. ,5.0,1.0,J Raul Peruyera
0,"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",1.0,5.0,German Velasco
1,"Econ 2370 is a challenging class, but Professor Melendez is amazing! I am not good at math, and I had to study a lot for this class. The material is hard, and you for sure have to WORK HARD for your grade, but Melendez is more than willing to meet with students if they are struggling. He was always VERY helpful and understanding & he's so funny!!",5.0,4.0,Joel Melendez
1,"Completely disagree with other comments.  Great teacher with true concern for the students.  A study guide was given for each exam and the tests came straight from the guide.  The powerpoints were posted on her website prior to lectures.  Many animations and other aids to help in learning were provided.  She was tough, but very fair and caring.",5.0,4.0,Holley H. Langille
1,"Prof Platz is young and she relates to her students in a way where she realizes that you do not want to have a lot of work. She is really understanding and helpful if you talk to her one on one. The course material and homework is easy, just annoying. She also is not the easiest grader in the world but if you put in effort then you will get an A",3.5,2.0,Jenny Platz
1,"Professor Pangallozzi was an awesome teacher. She is extremely knowledgeable and great at her delivery. The COVID pandemic forced the class online, so things felt a little rocky to start, but she had it pretty well figured out in a few weeks. Quizzes and tests were all online and open book, so as long as you keep up with the reading it an easy A.",5.0,2.0,Laura Pangallozzi
1,"Had to attend lecture in order to be there for her pop quizzes. All notes were written on the board but she posted them on canvas so if you had to miss you could still get them. Tests were easy as they were verbatim from the quizzes and in class assignments. Also there is extra credit, even though you most likely don't need it. EASY A!!",4.0,2.0,Nicola Grissom
1,"Professors dont matter that much with organic chem II. Good or bad the class is still gonna be one of the hardest youve ever taken. Accept that. But MS is one of the best professors if not. Always has a hilarious story, makes lecture fun. Material is hard, exams are fair and professor is amazing. Take MS above all other orgo professors.",5.0,5.0,M. Montague-Smith
1,"Great professor but this class involves little more work than average. You have one paper that is reviewed by people in your class, and you are responsible for making either a Ted Ed like video, Ted talk, or podcast. You are also responsible for reviewing other classmates papers. Not hard assignments by any means but take some time. You also have a test that you will take 3 different times, and it's the same test every time. He's a little unorganized and changes the schedule as you go. Overall though very unique way of teaching, great teacher/person, and I would recommend this class. It's easy assignments and he' an easy grader but will take some time/effort so be prepared.",4.0,2.0,J. Alex Grizzell
1,"Helpful, bit quirky humor.  Has well defined powerpoint presentations for class.  Overall a great professor for intro psych.",4.5,4.0,Albert Bugaj
1,He is pretty straight forward professor online. Class was pretty easy but make sure you study for the mid-term and final as they are most of the points for the class. Would recommend him to other classmates.,4.5,1.0,Jerry Lulejian
1,"Dr. Kosnik is lovely. He is super passionate about music, and it shows in his lectures. He keeps his lectures short and engaging. He is by far my favorite professor.",5.0,1.0,James Kosnik
0,Get quizzes often (worth around 10% of final grade). He has an accent which makes it difficult to comprehend what's being taught.  If you are new to chemistry then do not take this class. He is not straight forward and he can be confusing.   Most of the learning will be done outside of class through homework!,2.5,3.0,Guatam Dhar
0,"This guy is a joke!!! Over half of the class is going to get a D or lower for their final grade and he thinks thats a good thing....will never give a student an A its one of his policies, test are impossible and admits to making them that way on purpose...worst part is he is the only teacher that teaches this class!",1.0,5.0,Danny Ervin
0,"She's not clear in grading. Seems to take points off for no logical reason, even if you have fulfilled the rubric requirements completely. Takes points off during assignments that are based on opinion... Very critical - but doesn't really give any useful feedback. No way to please her. Avoid her if you want to enjoy the subject and not resent it.",1.0,5.0,Elizabeth Ferns
0,Literally the worse teacher I have taken within my two years of being at NCC.,1.0,4.0,Mary Mathis
1,She is by far one of my favorite teachers that  i have ever had. She is so worldly and intelligent and loves to share her knowledge. She is Russian and has a russian accent but that is all it is she speaks perfect english and i would assume english is her second language and she does a great job. I just love her class so much. Def recommend her.,5.0,4.0,Maria Cochran
1,Love Dr. Chalk!! Great class that is always interesting and sparks class discussions. Can't wait to take another class with her!,5.0,2.0,Bridget Chalk
1,One of the best professors I've had. Quite understanding when it comes to assignment . Have to experience this professor for yourself. Don't listen to other students that spread false rumors about him. Once you enter the classroom you'll realize that those individuals were the problem. He provides additional teaching aids to students.,5.0,1.0,Christopher Wayne Purser
0,"Too much reading, I do not learn my reading 30 pages of information and then taking 4 different tests on it. I will NEVER take this class again. I just had a mental breakdown over this class and I'm over it.",1.0,5.0,Clovis Stacey
1,Syllabus is very clear on what is due and when. He lists what he is grading you on in each assignment. Happy to answer any questions you have. Organized and straight forward. This class was very basic and easy to pass. Just show up and do the homework on time.,4.0,1.0,Rod Kendall
1,"I liked taking his class. He is a very good professor, very friendly and never behaves rude. There were a lot of class activities, online bonus assignments and without the attendance you cannot score an A.",5.0,4.0,Scott Campbell
1,Professor Calkins is an amazing ENC professor. Wanted to take her for 1102 but couldn't get a spot unfortunately. She really cares about her students growth as writers and really helps you when you have questions about your papers. If you care about your grade she will make sure you get the best grade possible.,5.0,3.0,Vanessa Calkins
1,Such a sweet amazing professor. I truly enjoyed this class she really cares about each and every single one of her students. Lectures are great she really knows how to teach!!! Love her!,5.0,2.0,Andress Walker
0,While I won''t deny that I think my writing improved from taking this course I would never recommend a Nelson class to anyone.  He''s very pretentious and he addresses his classes with such an air of superiority as if we are simply lucky that he''s letting us in on his insights about literature and the English language.  I would avoid at all costs,2.5,5.0,Randy Nelson
1,"Easy class! A lot of homework assignments every week: mini short essays, social media, quizzes, chapter homework, and class participation assignments. There's a mid-term and final, and one major essay that requires to do presentation on it. Teacher is really nice and grades easily. Boring lectures!!",5.0,2.0,Chelsi Johnston
0,"Has a very high opinion of himself, likes to read out his own stories and talks about his life A LOT. There's never a clear definition of what he wants as a paper, and he's a tough grader. I was bored all the time.",2.5,4.0,Randy Nelson
1,"She's very sweet and knowledgable on all the topics. Sometimes she is a little disorganized in her lectures, but as long as you skim through the textbook and study the study guide before exams, you can get an A! In 230 there were 4 exams, 1 group presentation, & 5 quizzes. Homework almost every week, but it was just the definitions from the chapter",4.0,3.0,Glenora Nelson
1,"Professor Bronie is an amazing professor! She does give a lot of homework, but its really to prepare you. Before every exam she gives out study guides that are similar to the ones on the exam! She genuinely really cares about each student, and she wants everyone to pass her class. Definitely would recommend if you struggle with math.",4.0,4.0,Barbara Bronie
1,An easy A. I did learn a lot and he is sometimes hard to understand. Overall a great class to take,4.0,1.0,Mikhail Grachev
1,"Ms Mahon is the most amazing professor you could ever hope to get! She is genuine, and works to make sure everyone is on the same page. If anyone came to her with an issue or suggestion, she worked with them, never shut anyone down or had an attitude. If you can get in her class you need to take it! She changed my perspective on education. The BEST",5.0,4.0,Kirsten Mahon
1,"I was hesitant to take her class because of the poor reviews, but a friend of mine had taken the class prior and encouraged me to take it with her. She became my favorite professor! I loved her class and the discussions we had as a group. She is so funny and has so many stories from her time abroad. I definitely recommend taking her!!",5.0,3.0,Diane Wolf
1,This class pretty much followed the book exactly. It helped you understand the concepts of programming but the book basically tells you exactly what to do. The assignments are grouped into 3 deadlines so you have to make sure you can keep yourself motivated. He was amazing at returning grades quickly. I always got mine back within 24 hours.,4.0,2.0,Robert Scherbaum
1,Arguably one of my favorite professors! Participation does count towards your grade so make sure you're in class. His exams are really easy if you study the material he gives you as well as the textbook. He made ANT 2750 such a fun and exciting class. If you need to take this class- DO IT WITH HIM!!,5.0,1.0,Lonn Monroe
1,Expect to spend many hours on homework. Type of Professor to choose the hardest questions from the homework to put on the exams so be prepared. A few subjects here and there that are'nt covered in the book which is a bit annoying but overall he's a decent Professor and you will learn A LOT in this class if you put in the work. Lenient grader!,3.0,4.0,Benny Davidovitch
1,what an odd man. The class is easy. 4 5-page papers due throughout the semester. Every class was about 1.5 out of the 2.5 hrs its supposed to be. He also makes food for class.,4.0,1.0,Martin Nesvig
1,"My favorite professor ever! his class is never boring, he knows his stuff, and he's considerate towards his students. If steve martin was an agronomist this would be him. I can't tell you enough how much I love being around this guy.",5.0,3.0,Lee Burras
1,"Nice old guy, really smart. Unfortunately, he can't teach. At all.  He is very helpful on his projects. If you go to him for help don't be surprised if he basically finished it for you. He also might not help you at all (rarity, but happens). If you want a grade, take this guy. If you want to learn, avoid at all costs.",3.0,3.0,Jon Squire
1,He doesnt have a good online class system.,3.0,2.0,Lawrence Lawson
0,He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,1.0,5.0,Athar Murtuza
0,"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",1.0,5.0,Mary McDonald
1,Very good prof. Attendance mandatory if you want to do well.,4.5,2.0,Lisa Kellman
1,"Easy professor, and interesting course. I recommend attending class often. She shows a lot of videos that are helpful for essays. There was only one in-class exam for the midterm. All other grades were essays of about 3 pages submitted online. The final  was even an essay. Fun professor, and very interesting material. Take course with her!",4.5,2.0,Earline Ferguson
1,"Short story, long suffering. We maintained good relationship until the last. Surprisingly, she filed me to the conduct center on the last day of the school without informing me what made her think a work I spent hours of working was not mine. Yes, she violated the rules. She ruined my good moods for 3 months until righteousness came.",3.0,3.0,Rory Moore
1,"Super easy class. I am really bad at math but this prof really helps you out. She curves everything. There are a lot of homeworks and a few quizzes and tests, but she goes over almost exactly the qs that are gonna be on them during review. Do have to buy a code for Pearson which is $$$",5.0,2.0,Mikaela Park
1,She has high expectations for her students. She is a tough grader and tough teacher but she is a great person!,4.0,4.0,Jennifer M. O'Donnell
1,"He explains how to get a good grade in his class from the first day. Yes you have to work for it, but if you do your homework and study HARD for the quizzes you will be fine. He gives extra credit and curves almost every test and quiz. Lectures are a little boring though it gave plenty of time to work on homework while he was lecturing haha",4.0,4.0,Eric Bertram
1,"I was a little apprehensive taking an online ""communications"" class, but I am so glad I did. She kept chapters short and simple and quizzes were straightforward. Definitely recommend!",5.0,3.0,Melody Dixon-Brown

0,Lecture is long monotone and straight from the power points. everyone falls asleep everyday. I dread this class. While a very kind and friendly woman I would not recommend her for any subject or class. Everyone failed her tests only one A and 3 B's out of 50+ students in my section. No one knows where her test questions come from,1.0,4.0,Lacie Cupani
1,"More of a hybrid class. You need mymathlab. the subject is harder for me than most but hes a great teacher, funny and laid back. practicing the math concepts is a must. Hes Not a fan of extra credit so do well on all exams for good measure of your grade.",4.0,4.0,Richard Weber
0,"I took her during the fall while covid was happening and she was not helpful at all. She taught it like we had been it for 20 years like she had. I had to teach myself, not sympathetic about mistakes on her end. Argued with students.",2.0,5.0,Liina Ladon
1,"Attend class to know what is going on. Lots of reading. He put some much work on the syllabus, but we didn't do half of it only because we were behind and not enough time.",3.0,4.0,J Cabral
1,Average professor and average class. Do the homework and you will be fine for 111.,4.0,2.0,Linda Barton
1,"If you want to learn how to write a research paper for upper-level courses, I suggest you take her course. It was tough for me to say on top of my work because it was mostly online but there were clear rubrics so I got an A in the class and learned how to write a research paper. Don't slack and speak up if you're confused and you'll be fine!",4.0,4.0,Vanessa Calkins
0,"He is a very boring professor, he asks trick questions on the tests, he brags about people getting low grades on his tests, he makes study guides that have nothing to do with whats on the tests, theres little to no extra credit in this class, and he doesnt round up grades at the end of the semester",1.0,5.0,Andrew Thompson
1,"To add- We got to choose any religion in history to write about for our final paper. I chose Scientology and others chose ones like Satanism, Wicca, ancient Greece, Nordic, and Quakerism. Interesting!",5.0,3.0,Natalie Cox
0,What do you do after a political career? Teach at a college! This class will have you staring at the clock. The minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days. There are opportunities to meet members of the political community and the guest speakers are intriguing. Other than that it's an easy A without much learning. #whygottocollegeagain?,2.0,1.0,John Street
1,Be on time and do your work and you will get an A,5.0,2.0,Ron Martin
1,"Dr. Hansen is the best- he tries to get to know the students which is great for networking. I took his soil science class and I loved how much passion he has for soil! Definitely do the reading and pay attention during lecture for your own benefit, but he doesn't mind if you fall asleep during lecture lol. Class takes effort, but not impossible.",5.0,3.0,Neil Hansen
1,"These previous ratings are ridiculous. She is a great teacher, and she tries extremely hard to help you out. Yes, there are clicker quizzes, but why be in college if you're going to complain about coming to class? Most of the questions, she practically gives the answers. And the tests are easy, just study the slides.",4.5,2.0,Jo Zimmerman
1,He tries to make the lectures relatable and tries to keep everyone engaged. You HAVE to read the textbook or you won't pass. You also don't need to read each chapters 3 times to get an A. Take the first test seriously bc usually everyone bombs it because everyone tries to memorize the book rather than understand the material. Solid professor,4.0,3.0,Robert McMillen
1,"She's passionate, classy, and intelligent. Overall, she's a great professor.",4.5,3.0,Paula Wisotzki

1,"Excellent professor! If you are looking to grow in the area or look further past the textbook, he will help you find opportunity and direction.",5.0,4.0,Simon Baev
1,"Attendance is a  must for his classes, since it can drop your grade. His textbooks are easy to find and really cheap. He is very available on blackboard, you can send him a note and he always responds the same day. Very calm professor but with a vast amount of knowledge in the field. Made me more excited into being a SW.",5.0,2.0,Robert Luckett
0,"Mostly had test and group work was considered to be a grade. She also didn't offer reviews for her class and was just expected to know all of the chapters. I would say her lectures were good, but I feel as they didn't cover everything in the chapters/tests.",1.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad
0,"She is a dismal teacher- a combination of incompetence and apathy.  Never returned emails, changed requirements constantly with no warning, let the class know the criteria for grading projects AFTER submission.  I could go on and on.  BTW, she doesn't know her subject - I finally quit trying to dialogue as she just spouted her opinion as fact.",1.0,3.0,Lyndale Garner
1,"Only use one of two textbooks, attendance is mandatory but participation is not; editing days for essays are also mandatory for credit so have the work done; days that are only for working on the essay before it is due are sometimes not mandatory and can be skipped. If the class is going good sometimes food is brought in.",4.0,3.0,Denise Preston
1,Great Professor! At the end of the semester if youve missed a certain number of times your letter grade is dropped. He also gives alot of pop quizzes. If you show up to class they are easy and so are the tests. You cannot make up anything but if you know you will miss he lets you take stuff early,5.0,1.0,Ezell Allen
1,Although his jokes are lame and he tends to give facts/side notes about mathematicians he makes the class understandable. He gives plenty of time to do the hw and ask questions on the hw. Knows what he's talking about and wants you to understand too. HW assigned basically every class but not a lot of quizzes/tests and no final. Take his class :D,4.0,3.0,Arthur Guetter

1,Great,5.0,3.0,Mike McKenzie
1,Great Professor. He understands that most of the students in this course aren't science majors and the course itself isn't that hard if you give a little effort. There is so much extra credit that lots of students end up with over 100%.,5.0,2.0,Steven Kennedy
1,"Easiest class I've ever taken at BSU, show up to class and do homework for other courses to fill the void of how dreadfully boring this course is. He's a nice guy, but not a suited professor. Very lenient when it comes to homework. Minimal homework as it is, it'd be impossible to do poorly in this class. Gives exact answers to midterm/final",3.0,1.0,Bruce Walter
1,"Overall, I enjoyed this course. It was interesting and relevant to my field of focus. Dr. Gilbert was helpful for me with responding to emails fast whenever I had questions for him and was always willing to help. The only big critique I have is his lack of uploading grades on Blackboard to allow me to see my progress throughout the course.",4.0,3.0,Keon Gilbert
1,You can tell that this professor cares about her student's well being. The class is fairly straight forward and easy to pass. There are a quiz and discussion posting due every other week.

1,"Professor Israel did great at teaching online. Make sure you watch all of the lectures and take lots of notes on them. Homework is KEY in doing well in this class.

Ask questions during/after lecture if you are confused.",4.0,4.0,Arie Israel
0,"This is her response after she put up a misleading question in a quiz ""Not all facts you are given on a test (and life!) need to be asked in such a way that NO person will ever make a mistake. The onus is on the student to read the question well and think!"" (while in fact, almost everyone misunderstood the question and got wrong answer) What a joke",1.0,5.0,Cyntha Struthers
1,"She is an okay professor but, she regurgitates information from slides that are from the textbook and doesn't even bother slowing down . Also she relies too much on Sapling Learning for homework which is the worst program to learn from in my opinion. Also she scolds you for not knowing the material so read up,do your best, and pray that you pass.",3.0,4.0,Carol Jones
1,"Ronda is a wonderful teacher, very highly recomended.  Although she can come across as a bit reserved in class, and have strong opinions on the right way to do things, she is always open to listening to others ideas (and often says she learns something new),and is always willing to help with projects.  Very inspirational teacher. Highly recommended",4.5,3.0,Ronda Chaney

1,"A great teacher. If you show up, participate because he gets frustrated if the class is silent. If you are really interested in film, don't assume you'll be watching great feature films because that didn't happen. His use of syllabus is great and extremely helpful.",5.0,2.0,Trevor Kearns
1,"Professor Kanchi is a fantastic lecturer, but that means you actually need to attend the classes. Missing a single lecture will set you back significantly. Shes a difficult grader, but Kettering has high standards anyway. Loads of these reviews are just mad at her because the material is tough and they didn't do well.

1,"Never a boring class, you do get a lot of work but everything you do is helpful and essential to getting a good grade on the essays.

0,"I had this professor for my calc I and calc II class, I ended up failing both, but not for the lack of trying.

1,He's a really cool teacher. I highly recommend. He is funny and goes step by step with instructions in class which makes the work super easy. There is barely any work outside of class because he gives enough time in class to finish.,4.0,1.0,Thomas Collins
0,"She assigns work daily to turn in the next class. She does not accept late work, nor does she grade on time. If you want to go the semester not knowing your grade by her or BB she's the one.

1,"omg, this class is a lot of work. We had to do Pearson activities (Short Quizzes, Chapter Quiz, etc.) and then either write a 2-page single-spaced journal or a discussion post.

1,"Don't be scared off. She is harsh in her marking but if you ask for her help, she will be more than willing.

She listens to student feedback, don't be afraid.",4.0,4.0,Celia Young
1,"Professor Nelson was nothing special. She was nice and helpful, but not interested in her students outside of class. I took the 6-week summer course so lectures were 3+ hours at a time.

1,"I didn't think he was that bad. He's a genuinely nice guy who will help you if you need it. His lectures aren't thrilling and he says ""uh"" a lot (he also gets mixed up because of dyslexia at times), but he puts a ton of notes on the board that help somewhat. The exams were fairly difficult, the quizzes were easy but were made up by the TA.",3.0,4.0,William Menasco
1,"She takes a little while to grade exams but that's because she wants to give you the most amount of points she can.

Overall, really liked her!",4.0,2.0,Michelle Dubois

1,Rick's a great professor here at DePaul. He clearly knows his stuff though can be hard on some students. Never skip class (news quizzes every session) and do what is expected and you should be fine. Expect your homework to be covering stories around campus or the city and it being time-consuming. He's very professional and offers some great advice.,5.0,4.0,Rick Brown

1,"I loved her!  She really makes people comfortable, high energy, and you do improve.  I hated giving speeches prior to this, but by the end I was a lot more comfortable.  Some people don't like her much cause she can be a little hippy, but its really not enough to become annoying.  She's very easy to talk to, and one of my favorite teachers!",5.0,2.0,Connie Anderson
1,I enjoyed the content of the class and I feel like she presented it in a way that was understandable. I liked the online format where I could print out the slides and take notes on them.

1,"I have taken two courses with Professor Meyers, and although I like her character,  I did not enjoy her courses/teaching method.

Regarding a previous comment, he said that we should drop the class as in take a lower level to develop our understanding. I would recommend Marks any day",3.0,4.0,Jeff Marks
0,TAs did all of the work on grading. Class was pretty basic and only discussed problem issues in forensic science. Timed exam (60 mins) on over a thousand plus pages of material and articles.

0,"I am not sure why so many students like this teacher. Calling her nice is like calling a rabid dog friendly. She grades at a post graduate level, and is not very approachable.

Study 8 hours a week or take a C",2.0,4.0,Stephanie Slocum-Schaffer
1,"Im really surprised at how low her rates are. Out of all the professors I've had she was one of the most inspiring. Unconventional, yes, but I learned a lot from her.

If you let her, she'll change the way see the world.",5.0,3.0,Mary Layoun
0,"He's great to take for an animation class, but when you suck at drawing, you better drop the class. He is absolutely impossible to talk to outside of class, and his classroom wasn't the greatest focus environment for me, so I only attended if there was something important. He doesn't really tell you what he grades on either. Just gives you a grade.",2.0,5.0,Michael Coppieters
1,"Dr. Hollis is a very chill professor. But, his class is very hard. Extremely hard. His tests cover very minute detail from the lectures and they are plentiful.

1,"Great professor. I learned a lot from him. He cares for his students and does a great job presenting the notes. If you study the notes and do well on all HW's, it should be an easy BA. 3 midterms and 1 final. Yes he has an accent, but he's more than willing to help if you ask. Take him if he's an option for you. ",5.0,1.0,Kaz Okada
1,"I have always struggled with math, but I ended up with an A in this class because she was easy to understand and gave many examples. She was very kind and worked with me.

WebAssigns teach you more than his lectures do.",3.5,3.0,David Trubatch

I had to drop because I was putting off my other 4 classes just to get Ds on his exams.",2.0,5.0,Nam Nguyen

He does have a couple of exams and a take home final, but you CAN do VERY well on the exams if you read the books he assigns for the class, which are VERY interesting and easily to read and memorize the main points of! I will warn you, he DOES use a bit of ""language"" in his lectures though!",5.0,3.0,Martin Nesvig
1,The sweetest English teacher ever. Gives the best lectures and she's hilarious. If you fail that class it's because you don't want to do anything. She gives snacks in every class.

The best things u can do for urself in this class is take notes via computer &RECORD THE LECTURES so u can go back to them if u can't keep up with notetaking. + he gives hints on what's on tests AND explains what he wants to see. Don't wanna miss that.",4.5,2.0,Brian Norris

Unorganized & very disapointing class.,1.0,1.0,Kay Mizell
1,"Exams are very tough but his curve is awesome! Notes help you understand where formulas come from. However, for exams, make sure you write down the final form of the formulas in your cheat sheet.

He grades most harshly on grammar and spelling.",5.0,3.0,Michael Dowding

1,"Though there's a lot of homework in this class it's all very easy. Since it was an online class, the homework was done through a program called Inquizitve and it basically lets you answer questions till you got 100%. There're a few writing assignments and unit tests but those are pretty easy. If you do the work you'll definitely get an A!",4.0,2.0,Peter Knapp

1,"Prof. Robbins is amazing; she loves her job and it is easy for students to see that. She is willing to put in the effort to see all her students succeed, and does a great job of effectively communicating the material, which is by no means easy. Get ready to study hard before exams, but if you show up and participate she gives some extra credit",5.0,2.0,Heather Hug
1,"The way the professor set up the discussion boards. Rather than just asking us to regurgitate the information back to her, she asked for our perspectives about each subject we were learning.

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and still wish I had taken more humanities courses. Avoid if your main worry is grades and tests. Curiosity/thinking req.",3.5,4.0,Lisa Wolverton
1,"Susan is a charm. She does have strong opinions often that you might disagree with, especially in regard to her attitude toward male students sometimes, but you can get tons from her. Like all people in this industry, she has strong philosophies on various topics that other people in the industry disagree with e.g. story titles (hers are bad).",4.0,4.0,Susan Kelly
1,"Thad is a fantastic person.  Unfortunately he has a very time consuming day job, therefore it takes forever to get your tests/quizzes/labs graded and back to you.

1,"She is kind of uptight, but I think she just didn't like our class because everyone was so disrespectful. Kind of boring, I once fell asleep on total accident!

I would take her again in a heartbeat.,4.5,2.0,Brooke Ghiorso-Kennedy

Would take again. -NL",5.0,3.0,Sean Maher
