0,"Tests and quizzes were only about quotes--not anything you actually learned. Quotes matter, yeah, but they don't tell you about anything you learned. So basically, you're memorizing nothing. Lots of reading and the textbook was hard and terrible. Long, old English, boring even for Philosophy majors. It was also an 8:30, two hour lecture. THE WORST.",2.0,4.0,Brian Stratton

2,Worst teacher at Alma I have had. Boring! How did he get a doctorate in anything unless it was a subject for the stupidest people in college? Tests and quizzes are either too easy or too hard. He is here for the money not for students.,1.0,5.0,Brian Stratton
3,The most unlikeable person I have ever met. No one in the class could stand him. His wife is nice but he has no good qualities. Maybe the college could give him some kind of job where he never has to be around people. Avoid his classes.,1.0,5.0,Brian Stratton
4,"This guy is sort of full of himself. I think he tries to play it off like he is this really humble guy, but then he turns around and subtly talks about all the great things he's done. As for the class, we never stuck to the syllabus, and he loved trying to be controversial, only problem was nobody in our class ever took the bait. Wouldn't recommend",1.5,3.0,Brian Stratton

6,"Literally THE ONLY class I didnt get an A in my first semester!! Heinrich is a little intimidating and often runs off on a lot of tangents. You never completely finish a lesson and youre expected to read two 30+ page chapters every week. The online quizzes are easy, but they dont help much if you do not do well on the midterm and final. WORST",2.0,5.0,Thomas Heinrich
7,The class is pretty light except for the midterms and finals. He treats the class like a 4000 level course. BARUCH IS A BUSINESS SCHOOL he treats it like we are history majors.

8,"took the midterm did not get results until 4 weeks after, he doesn't grade the test. We take online quizzes which are easy at the time of the test he picks 20 out 100 questions from online quiz plus you have to write a 6 page in class essay for midterm/final he gives us 10 questions to prepare for but only 3 show up don't take unless u like history",1.0,5.0,Thomas Heinrich

15,"I'll start by saying I got an A in algebra & precalc so Im good at math.

19,I would give this teacher a 0 if I could. The most disrespectful person I've ever come across. Literally dropped me from the class when I told her my computer broke and would take ONE day to fix. And on top of that she disrespected me earlier because I said Hey instead of hello. Wanted to write this so ya'll don't have to deal with her.,1.0,4.0,Karen Edwards
20,She is a terrible teacher. She says to do one thing in particular in the classroom and then says do the exact opposite the very next day.  Lesson plans/all written work will never be correct.

21,"She is a terrible teacher.  Her mood is explosive and she will frequently humiliate a student in class.

30,"She goes through material very quickly, without giving many examples. She basically expects her students to already understand what she hasn't taught.

32,I personally work very hard academically but have never never been very comfortable with math skills. I worked extremely hard in this course inly to  play catch up. Mainly because her lectures are next to impossible to learn from and the textbook wasnt much better. She grades with extreme scrutiny not just your answer but all of your work.,1.0,5.0,Dorothy Fujimura
33,I would drop this class if you plan to take it. Dorothy makes you feel like an idiot if you ask any questions in class. She is a hard grader and puts questions on the tests that she does not cover in class. She cancels office hours almost every week so you cannot talk to her after class.,1.0,5.0,Dorothy Fujimura
34,She isn't super engaging. . She skips a lot of steps and doesn't really seem to understand where people are in the class. Doesn't go over basic concepts. Requires a lot of homework but doesn't count to grade. I wish I could have taken another teacher. But i was stuck because I was a transfer student so not a lot of classes were open.,1.0,5.0,Dorothy Fujimura
35,"The meanest teacher, she goes things really fast and doesn't explain it. At one point she even said ""if you don't know how I got this answer I don't know why you're in my class."" She reads the numbers of the homework super fast and won't repeat herself.",1.0,5.0,Dorothy Fujimura

49,"Dr. Allen is so nice and he's intelligent. But he does not know how to teach. He literally reads and repeats the chapter headings and that's it.

50,"His in class teaching method is reading the headlines of things in the chapters and mildly explaining them.

Most if not all of the answers on tests are correct. You have to pick the ""most correct""",1.0,5.0,William Allen
51,"His teaching style is ""read the book and take the test"". Sometimes what he says in class is actually wrong and it ends up hurting you on the tests.

Avoid at all costs.",1.0,4.0,William Allen
52,"He is honesty the worst professor I have ever had. I'm not kidding, ever person in his class failed. He should realize that he needs to change something about his teaching style.

558,"Awful professor. Nice, funny guy, but I left with less knowledge of music theory than I came in with.  Has a great understanding of the material he is teaching but can't convey it to students.

559,I don't know how he's gotten so many good reviews. Hands down one of the worst professors I've ever had.  Completely misled that it could be done with no previous knowledge. Embarrasses you if you dont know the material yet he'll only show you how things should be without backing it up with why. Only likes or helps those who already know A LOT,1.0,4.0,John McCann

The problem is her handwriting is hard to read & depending on the lecture hall if you have a bad seat in class - you won't be able to read what's on the screen. Because of that you have to be listening carefully to her voice, which is very shrill.",2.0,3.0,Jeannie Gillmore
564,"Heard good reviews about her in previous years. However, felt subpar to me this year. Very good attitude but a good attitude has no correlation with being able to present course material.
