1,The professor was okayish. He is not a harsh grader or rude. The only problem with this course is how he gives out the projects. The projects are difficult to understand and very hard to accomplish. He talks a long time giving feedback to people who need papers to get signed.,3.0,2.0,Muhilan Ramamoorthy

1,"Had Prof Triplett for both MGF 1106 and 1107. Hands down one of the best professors I've had. He wants you to learn the material but also understands that formulas and processes can be awkward to memorize and will let you use notes. Be prepared for a lot of homework, especially if you take a condensed summer class. Great Prof all around.",5.0,2.0,Howard Triplett
1,"Maria has been my favorite teacher so far at DMACC.  I took her online Humor in Lit class and it was phenomenal...a nice segue into actual schoolwork the following semester.  She assigns great books, sometimes even movies, and is up front if they will be dryboring.  Plus I didn't have to buy pricey textbooks, most titles were free online!",4.5,2.0,Maria Cochran
0,"She was always very vague about what she wanted. She expected you to use canvas a lot and from what I could remember would never give you a heads up with something was coming up, I understand that it's our responsibility, but Eng101 is one of the 1st classes you take in college and I didn't know how to use it right away.

1,"Prof. Pave was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he taught. Always able to answer questions and give amazing stories about religions. A lot of quizzes & writing assignments, but they're not difficult at all if you just read the textbook. We had to read 2 additional books which were very interesting, and his feedback is great & detailed",5.0,4.0,Adam Pave
1,Awesome professor! Helped me actually understand the concepts of cal 1 and I'm now taking him for cal 2,5.0,3.0,Charles Webb
1,"Cindy was a great teacher but because she doesn't believe in giving exams the homework is lengthy, but not hard. She requires you to read 2 books for the class as well as writing essays on both books, and one last essay at the end of the semester. She also requires 3 projects. None of the assignments were too challenging to complete. An easy A .",4.0,3.0,Cindy O'Toole
1,"She's a nice teacher, but does get mad/annoyed when questions are asked or if you don't know the answers during class. She is always available during office hours. She can be very condescending when going over problems in class.",4.0,4.0,Hope Menzel
0,"Terrible professor. Only professor that offers the management specific courses, and they're all online. I wanted to take in person. I know what you're thinking, online is easier right? Absolutely not. He makes them so hard in that he grades everything so tough. TONS OF WORK. Then he gives exams that are so hard and cover 4 chapters at once.",1.0,4.0,Brennan Carr
0,"Marek is a very courteous and professional individual but he has many flaws in regards to his job as a professor. First of all, he does not tell you what he expect. No rubrics or guidelines are given for projects, so you have to do your best and accept the bad grade that comes with it. He also is very inconsistent with his marking. ",2.0,5.0,Marek Czekanski
1,"One of the best professors at Rutgers that actually teaches. He is there to help his students through email, office hours, etc. He sends many emails. Make sure you read them because they are VERY helpful. His notes and practice problems are very detailed. Do his practice problems and you'll be guaranteed to pass chem.",5.0,4.0,Ed Tavss
1,"Professor Looney is the BOMB.  He is a truly good teacher, and really explains material thoroughly.  He is also absolutely hilarious and makes me laugh every class.

0,"Ignores student perspective. It's her way or the wrong way. Quizzes are confusing. The class topic is so easy to understand but somehow this professor mixes in her own ideas and it turns into a completely, hectic and confusing class. Despite receiving an A, I know that this class is a ""GPA Killer"". I wouldn't recommend this class, 3/10",1.0,5.0,Diane Wolf
1,"David, overall is a pretty nice professor. However, his teaching style is VERY outdated. You take tons of notes everyday and expects you to know the information based on the textbook&homework. Homework isn't graded but DO THEM, EVERYTHING YOU WILL LEARN WILL BE BASED OFF THE TEXTBOOK. He makes mistakes so please POINT IT OUT to him. Also DONT SKIP.",3.0,4.0,Repanich David
1,"He definitely wants to see his students succeed in the class.  The material is pretty tedious and is loaded with different rules and code sections, but he lets you know which ones to focus on.  It seems he worked hard to become a better instructor, and I believe he did a great job.",4.5,3.0,James Serocki
1,Quizzes every class. 50 multiple choice question tests,4.0,4.0,Edward Crawley
0,Do not take his class. Avoid it at all costs. The MLSC actually has their own sections just for students in his class because of how hard he is. He's different from every other professor at OSU in terms of homework and tests. Homework is very tough and grades it hard. Also tons of pop quizzes and a quiz in the first week worth 9% of the class.,1.0,4.0,Alekzander Malcom
1,Theres a lot of writing in this class that it can be overwhelming. You have about 2 days or so to complete a draft. Mandatory office hours. Expect to spend hours on this class. Lots of reading. Nothing impossible but tiring. Easy grade as long as you put in work. Hes chill and cares about his students. Most assignments will be marked complete.,4.0,4.0,Bradley Queen
1,"Professor Jassen's class was one of my favorite courses to take over this past semester. Although I did not do as well as I would have liked as I am taking the course over again next semester, she is an amazing professor and will stop and explain something if someone does not understand it. Remember to pay attention & study for weekly quizzes!",5.0,4.0,Alison Jassen

1,"His class is pretty easy, but you could tell he's been told to lower the marks because their too high. So you have to be careful. Labs are pretty good too, alot of easy ones just sitting around waiting, so you'll enjoy that, just be careful with his tests now",5.0,2.0,Edward Lai
0,"Attendance is not mandatory, but he will use the fact that you are not in class against you. Along with this, he gives quizzes every week. He does not actually teach you how to do problems, just throws a bunch of equations at you and expects you to know how to use them to solve a problem when he has not shown you.",1.0,4.0,Arup Mukherjee
0,"Doesnt use cuLearn to release grades & requires students to hand in hard copies of all assignments which wastes time & is outdated. There is only 1 knowledgeable TA & the others are basically useless.

1,"Her teaching style is kind of weird and I think she struggled teaching a class that had never been offered before, so I can't speak to her efficacy in other courses. You absolutely need to read the assigned text, because she doesn't go very in-depth during her lectures. More like an overview. Overall, she isn't terrible and is pretty easy.",3.5,2.0,Linda Knapp
1,"Ms. Carr is a wonderful CPR instructor and not only works with the students, but helps them with the test, and isn't difficult at all.  She's very friendly with a laid-back demeanor.  Serious, but not demanding.  Great teacher!",5.0,1.0,Amy Carr
0,"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",1.0,4.0,James Schubert
1,"Great professor and you think the class will be easy, but you HAVE to study. His tests are very very intense and you have to study the study guide and have it practically memorized to get an A on the exams. I took him for human sexuality and I learned so many things for the real world. Very smart man and writes his own textbooks. You need the books",5.0,5.0,David Knox

1,Prof Malekan was a gem. I took her for ELM 112 Fingerspelling class and she helped me succeed. She teaches formal ASL which I love but is challenging.  Attendance and participation are important. Work hard and do well. Recommended for anyone interested in pursuing ASL seriously or even professionally. Take her!,5.0,4.0,Azadeh Malekan
0,"You should only expect an A in this class if you show up to every single class and are incredibly engaged. Don't be deceived by the .5 credit: there are many writing assignments and ""Engagement activities"" over the course of the semester (standard for all dance at duke?). This class was more of an extra academic burden than a dance class for me.",2.0,3.0,Keval Khaur Khalsa

1,"Has weekly quizzes but they're fairly straight forward if you pay attention in class. Lectures had a lot of content, but exams were easier than expected.

0,"Dr. Cheers is one of the most difficult prof. i've had to deal with. He's rude and there are days where you want to punch him in the face.

I'd recommend this class for those who need a reality check.",2.5,5.0,Michael Cheers
0,"Miranda is disorganized and showed up to the class late or right at start time. she enjoys rambling about unrelated things which also wastes time, tests are fairly easy if you go to class. she likes to ask questions about examples and side stories she mentions so pay attention to those! the only reason people went to class was for clicker quizzes",1.0,2.0,Miranda Hart

1,"I took him 3 times throughout my college career and he was also an advisor for a bit that I went to. Very helpful, caring, and a person to be looked up to.

Lab work with him is fulfilling and he is great to work with, and will give you the criticism needed to ensure success",5.0,4.0,Nathan Lanning
1,"Birkett is not very clear in her lectures and is kind of annoying to deal with. She's sweet but she's also a neurologist, so there's that. She is very helpful, going above and beyond to answer your questions, but make sure you study for exams, especially if they're make up exams. Clicker question days are random, also. Good luck.",4.0,5.0,Melissa Birkett

1,Papa George will change your life. He is by far the best teacher I have ever had in my whole life.  I have never been good at math until I had him as teacher.

You will have no regrets!,5.0,2.0,. Papageorgiu
1,I took this class over summer semester and had a really good experience. Prof Spears always replied in a timely manner and has every assignment and due date set up at the beginning of the semester so there are no surprises. She lets you turn things in late too if you give her a heads up which was really helpful! I would take another class w her!,4.5,2.0,Lisa Spears
1,"Before coming to college, I heard horror stories about crazy professors who didn't care if you got an A or an F. Dr. Hauck proved those stories wrong. He set time outside of class to help me understand all of the material I didn't understand. His tests were straightforward if you paid attention during lecture, and he was super fun in lab. Take him!",5.0,2.0,Nathanael Hauck
0,"Never take this class as an elective. Forget about the online component, It's way too much work (readings, assignments). You are supposed to read the whole, 300 page textbook, as well as watch hours of lectures. Every now and then you are supposed to buy the newest version of the textbook (which she was an author of) that costs $100+. Ridiculous.",1.0,4.0,Adelle Forth

At the start I was doing fine, but I missed handing in a quiz and got a bad score on a test and it didn't look like I was going to pass.

0,She is not an easy grader. Her test ask random questions about half in her powerpoints half from the book.

0,I absolutely do not recommend her! Online class is terrible! Gave tons of assignments at beginning of semester without any kind of discussion/lecture. Never replied to emails. Kept saying her computer was broken when the students went to her in person. It's midway through the semester and still no contact? Please! Try using other excuses!,1.0,5.0,Raina Dobson
1,She is one of the best teachers I have encountered at UT. She is willing to reteach things that are unclear and relates material to everyday life.

If you pick another teacher over her you are making a huge mistake.,5.0,2.0,Heather Hug

1,Young professor so he's really excited about teaching.  He tries to make it easy by having homework from connect online and the rest of your grade is tests.  Yu have to study for the test unless you know the material really well.  He's a very generous grader when it comes to essay questions but the tests are 90% made up of multiple choice.,4.0,2.0,Otto Lenhart
1,I learned a lot from this class. She was a very tough grader but gives good feedback for you to improve. I really did not like her at first but she's very intelligent and knows what she's talking about.

0,He is a nice guy but the lectures are extremely boring and don't pertain to the material covered. He will get sidetracked and talk about something irrelevant for a half hour.

You just have to memorize the answers,2.5,2.0,Stephen Podewell

0,"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected.

IT.",2.0,4.0,Andrea Schultz

1,"Gail is amazing. After the experiences I had with her in lab, if I were sick and scared in the hospital, I would want her as my nurse.

If you answer all the questions on a test, it's almost not possible to make below a 50 because he gives half credit on missed multiple choice questions.

1,I love professor walker!! I took intro to business with her and it was an easy A for sure but only if you do the work which takes about 10-15 minutes. She allows 2 pages of notes and tells you EXACTLY whats on the test. She takes the time to learn everyone's names and personal life which most professors don't do. TAKE THIS CLASS!,5.0,2.0,Andress Walker
1,"Overall a kind professor. Every week there is a reading response due for the readings assigned for the week, and for the film watched that week. Honestly learned a lot from this class.

1,"Beato is a nice guy but also never seems prepared for lectures. He is equally as surprised with what is on the next slide as you will be.

1,Susott is a great professor. You can tell that he is really passionate about history and wants his students to pass.

I definitely recommend him for  this class.,4.0,3.0,Marvin Susott
1,"It would be very helpful if there were reviews prior to each test, such as worksheets or crossword puzzles throughout the course.

0,This was the WORST and I repeat WORST professor I have ever taken. It might be better to delay your graduation than to take this man and hurt your GPA.

He expects you to memorize formulas that are just extremely unnecessary and removes points for foolishness.,1.0,5.0,Howard Triplett
0,"Max has not handled the situation well, did not give us guidelines or dates of graded material (quizzes).

I've learned the most from his class. His experiences teach us just as much as the book does.,5.0,2.0,Steven Stovall
0,"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers.

Interesting class and I would take it again. ",4.5,3.0,Diane Wolf
1,"Mrs. Waddel was a wonderful professor! I'm not ""mathy"" but managed to get an A and not have to take the final.

1,"Sam is THE BEST professor I've ever had. He's hilarious and insanely smart--literally a leader in the field of linguistics, so much of the relevant literature is written by him. This class teaches you so much but the exams are super easy -- no studying required.",5.0,1.0,Samuel Epstein
1,"At first I thought she was mean and honestly kind of scary, but after awhile you warm up to her. She is a hard teacher, but one of the better ones I have had.

1,"This guy blew my mind. The class was extremely difficult for me, so I had to work really hard for a C+, but he loves economics and if you go to his office hours then you're definitely on his good side and get more XC opportunities.

1,"Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor. His teaching style is refreshing, as he always makes us think thoughtfully about why history is taught in a certain way. His lectures are interesting and his jokes were always funny. Take good notes, listen during lecture, use his study guides, read all of the books. It's not as bad as it sounds. He's the best!",5.0,3.0,David Sheridan
0,His assignments & lectures (monologues) provided little groundwork for success in the class & his teaching (telling) was far from thorough. Pretty much nobody had a clear idea of what aspects of his teaching to digest & remained hopeful that a miracle would occur on an exam. It was hard to prepare for class/exams... I would consider other options.,1.0,5.0,Neil Hansen

1,This class felt very long. Its interesting but the Professor does not make things very clear. He takes forever and I do mean forever to input grades. When you try and get a clear understanding of something he is very short with you and may just move on.

Never used the book. He reuses old test problems.",4.0,5.0,M. Montague-Smith

I hear he curves generously though.",3.0,2.0,Jon Squire

1,Ferguson shows documentaries almost every class and writes notes on the board that are important for you to take down (they will show up on exams).

1,Professor Guttmann is by far the best professor I've had. He used to be the chair of the department and is so passionate about economics.

1,"Falk is an amazing mathematician and a fantastic professor. If you want to pursue a math degree, I suggest taking him. His class is difficult but you will learn a lot. It will be demanding but you will be better for it. I think he realizes that he is difficult and therefore grades accordingly. Be sure to utilize office hours if you can.",5.0,4.0,Michael Falk
0,"He is seriously the most unfair grader I've had in college.  His exams test reading comprehension and whether or not you know WHAT he's asking, not whether or not you know the answers and have covered the materials.

1,"His exams are HARD! There were 4 - 85 questions each. There is a ""map quiz"" every week and 2-3 projects. it was a little more challenging of a class,  but he grades on a curve. if you put in effort you'll get a good grade. I will take Sobie again for geog!",3.0,4.0,Frank Sobie
1,Angie has the most entertaining lectures I've ever been to. If you're a frosh in HK you have to take her for the intro class and it is the best.

1,She is all over the place. She loves talking about myths and wants the class to love it to. There are 4 essays. She grades them with an open mind. She is easily impressed.

1,"I took English 101, 102, and British Lit with Tucker. She is really sweet and is extremely clear on what she wants. She will get angry if no one shows up though, ALWAYS go to class.

He doesn't give ex credit.,4.0,3.0,Thad Winzenz

0,Tbh his teaching is not that good. He can't explain concepts well and it is confusing even to me as a student who have taken calculus before.

Wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't already know the materials.,2.0,3.0,James Schubert

0,In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing.

1,I was unsure about her at first but she was an ok teacher and she is nice. I didn't learn much in the class but there weren't many assignments and she is an easy grader.

1,"Ms. Pajer is a very kind lady. Only 5 essays in the semester and one is basically an annotated bib. She has a tough time with technology and Zoom. Sometimes class was boring and pointless, but in-person class had a fun dynamic. Uses peer review, rough drafts, and editing before each paper is due. Very flexible and helpful in office hours to clarify",4.0,2.0,Michele Pajer
1,"I Had Jon for a Calc 2 TA and felt obligated to write this when I saw a bad review. Jon has been the best TA I have ever had at UConn. Very clear, very knowledgeable, and very fair.

1,"Cesar is fun! You'll like him. =)  The class is only somewhat difficult, but he keeps it fun. You'll need to participate a LOT in class to earn an 'A' for that requirement. It will make a difference on your overall grade, so don't be afraid to speak or make mistakes....just talk!",4.0,3.0,Cesar Reyes

1,"Whole class based on readings! You will discuss what you thought about the readings assigned and how certain ideas are applied in teaching so you get a reading response every week, 150 words max but 2 are graded. They're easy, just use quotes to make connections. Interesting lectures and there is one fun group project that you will work a lot on.",4.0,3.0,Alina Reznitskaya
1,"Loves assigning weekly APA papers. Need to read every chapter if you want even a chance to succeed in discussion forums. Learning is really up to you, he will posts material (took online). Does give very clear grading criteria which is helpful, but takes forever to grade papers and to respond to emails. Smart guy and keeps the class interesting.",3.0,4.0,Paul Richardson
1,"He's very flamboyant, but his 12 step process is severely underrated. I pretty much finished my paper while other 221 professors' classes were just getting started with the rough draft (it was due right around finals week), which was great because one less class to worry about. I thought his grading was a bit arbitrary though.",3.5,4.0,Michael Perez

1,"She is kind and very smart, but demands a lot from her students and is a hard marker.

1,"This was an 8am class, but she was one of those teachers who reads the powerpoints to you. The material seems common sense, but when you get the exams, they are tricky and ask random statistical questions. The first exam average was a D that had to be curved 20 points. The worst part of the class is that you are required to take ""clicker quizzes.""",3.0,3.0,Jo Zimmerman

1,"She is truely one of teh best professors at WCCC she is eager to help all her students succeed in all that they do, if they are willing to let her help.

0,"This class was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken in my entire life, but the material was ridiculous.

Take him for the easiest A of your life, but don't expect to learn much.",2.0,1.0,David Boyles
1,"Kevin relies a lot on videos, and his lectures are pretty easy to follow.  I skipped probably a quarter of the class periods, and I still got an A.

Remember your quizzes because they will be on your exams. Take advantage of the extra credit he offers.",5.0,3.0,John Ball
0,Respect him he will respct you on a one to one - very angry with mood swings - He will talk about everything and anything not b/c he is SO intelligent but because the man likes to listen to himself speak and tries to make himself look good.

1,"Easily the best professor I've had so far. He's extremely understanding of students having lives outside of his class and school, has an incredible talent for remembering student names, and he's great at splitting up lengthy lectures to keep us engaged.

1,"She is great! She doesn't believe in paying for class material so she uses articles for the readings(so no expensive textbooks).

Class discussions are key/fun/helpful for tests.",5.0,1.0,Gina Spitz
1,"Really great professor. Cares a lot  about students and sociology. Only two papers all year, a midterm and final. No homework ever. Lectures are kind of boring but always lets us out 30 mins early. Strict about no cell phones other than that so amazing.",4.0,1.0,John Morra
1,Probably the most undeserving B+ I've ever received. He's aware that he's a difficult grader and blames the students for how boring the class is when the material he provides is extremely uninteresting. He has a monotone voice and a very awkward and quirky sense of humor. Could appeal to some but not worth it.,3.0,4.0,Steve Pokornowski

1,"Dr. Miller is a great professor! This class in particular was hard because I'm an undergraduate student who has spent minimal time studying the Civil War, but he made it interesting. The biggest assignment is a multimedia project about the Causes of the Civil War, but it's open ended and you can do what you want with it. I recommend him!",5.0,2.0,Burke Miller
1,"Interesting Course with progressive finish The first 4 weeks of this 8 weeks class were very hard and revealed itself to be a blessing as i was eager to study this interesting course.

1,"Even though she's strict and a tough grader, she was always very encouraging, and gave thourough feedback.

She also encourages (and grades) participation by putting people with similar topics in discussion groups.",4.0,4.0,Rebecca Burman
1,"I had him for only lab. He seemed to be a little more chill about labs than lecture (from what ive heard). The only thing is that he NEVER responds to his emails--ive prob sent him 5 email since march and still havent heard anything back... so we'll see what i got in his class. Do the work, be prepared, and be smart and he'll like you",4.0,4.0,Joseph Bushey

If you have a chance to take a class with him, do it!",5.0,2.0,Steven Northrup

Save your money and time; avoid this prof like the plague.",1.0,4.0,Mary McDonald

1,"Fantastic teacher. REALLY engaged. The material was interesting. So sad I won't get to take more classes from her--she's not at SF anymore and that's too bad for all other Comm students.

1,"I was expecting a lot more from this class. Serpell was a brilliant prof. but her lectures were usually too broad thematically while at the same time incorp. theory & a TON of new terms that we're responsible for on the final.

1,"Bronie is so sweet and she is always so jovial. She is great at lecturing and her tests are challenging but not impossible.

There is multiple extra credit possibilities, so do take advantage of that!",5.0,3.0,Barbara Bronie

1,Dr. Konen is a real inspiration to environmental science nerds like me. He teaches you so much information simply through his power points.

Minimal homework.,5.0,2.0,Mike Konen

1,She can be over-the-top w/her echo &choral responses(vocab words I learned from her) She was the only teacher to EVER push me to work hard &do more than expected.

1,Great teacher! Will help answer questions and will help you get a good grade if you try hard.

He typically comes to class early which is nice if you have any questions and gives occasional extra credit assignments,5.0,5.0,Ben Trower
1,"Great teacher! Cares about his students and makes his lectures relatable and funny. Does not post notes so be ready to write every class start to finish.

1,"Dr. Cooper is a new and young professor. He is normally a physics guy so he probably wasn't too happy to have to teach calc. There are two 20 point tests with 6 questions each. 2 easy, 2 medium, 2 hard (usually). If you worked hard in calc in HS you should be fine. I did no work and got a B. Big curve bc of low averages and extra credit at the end.",3.0,4.0,Patrick Cooper

Take this class at own risk.",1.5,5.0,Dionissios (Dennis) Karvelas
1,"Professor Swift assigns a LOT of homework, but only collects a portion of it using Gradescope. I did terrible on the first exam because I only did what was collected.

0,Professor Gray loves what she does but in my opinion she is not the best professor even though a lot of people love her.  She just lectures and has power points that have endless slides.

0,"Wasn't a big fan of Fetter.  His class consists of asking questions and watching Panoptos out of class, not the way I like to learn.  Quizzes and tests are lengthy and hard.  Likes students who ask questions and seem interested.  Doesn't really go off grading scale and curves, but class is difficult.  Go to review sessions and go to class.",2.5,3.0,Richard Fetter
1,"He was not very receptive to opinions other than his own.

1,The only qualm about this professor is grades seldom get posted on Canvas. Do the essays and journal and thats 50% of the class. Group project and quiz's are another 35% and the final and talking during class are the last 15% Grade faster PH! :P,5.0,2.0,Patrick Humphrey

Easy A tho",3.0,2.0,Christopher Asakiewicz

The books she assigns are great in terms of history of humor seen through literature. She also adds a few video assignments as well! Tons of reading but it is to be expected for a literature course.,5.0,3.0,Maria Cochran

0,"This class is supposed to be an easy A because no one cares about classics, we only do it for requirements. Lectures are like watching paint dry, some of the TFs are hardos and dont let you go on your phone, youll get points docked on your assignments for arbitrary reasons.

1,Very caring and enthusiastic teacher that gives some easy points in assignments. Labs are manageable to get A's if you put in a little effort. There are two tests throughout the entire semester that make up a good portion of your grade and they are pretty hard if you don't study (and even if you do). Study is needed as there is a lot of material.,4.0,3.0,Jo Zimmerman
1,Mrs. Dodson has been the best math professor I have ever had. I am not very good at math but this online class was not bad at all.

You are the best !,5.0,1.0,Beth Dodson

0,"she doesn't like your ideas unless it is within her genre of writing. And it isn't real if it's comedy.  She is the worst teacher, there is no support or guidance. It's her way or a failing grade. She is not fit to teach because she doesn't know how to share knowledge or accept others ideas. It's a terrible learning environment.",1.0,5.0,Judith Thompson
1,"Not a fantastic lecturer. Most of it is dry and unengaging and feels like a waste of time.

1,"10-week course! There are a total of 5 exams but the last one is optional (will drop the lowest exam score if the 5th exam is taken and it covers chapter 1-17).

1,"You definitely have to put the work in to get a good grade. Quizzes every week, two midterms and a final, but he's not a harsh grader.

He's always got something interesting to say.",4.5,2.0,Paul Young
0,She really isn't the nicest lady. Pretty rude as well. Leaves class mid lecture to take phone calls for what? I don't know. There are days where she's pleasant and then days where she's so nasty you can cut the tension with a knife. If you just go to class and do your best you'll be fine.

Study thoroughly for this essay.",3.0,4.0,Burke Miller
1,"Very good lecturer. Has a very expansive understanding of the real world application of the lecture material which made lectures more entertaining.

1,"Not a hard class when it came to subject matter, but the semester-long group project she assigned was ridiculous.

Have a job or taking other classes? AVOID.",3.0,4.0,Sara La Belle

1,Ms. Crowley was the best professor I've ever had. That's not an exaggeration. She will sacrifice her time to help you until you know it.

And he gives extra credit!,5.0,1.0,Ezell Allen
1,"She's very young which means two things: one, she likes to have fun in her classes and frequently opens the floor for class discussion or personal stories. Two, she's a hard grader.

0,"The class content is not difficult.  The professor makes it difficult by setting her own criteria for grading that is not part of the assignment.  Elizabeth does not follow the rubric, does not answer questions, and makes up erroneous grading criteria.  She doesn't even understand the course she is teaching. Worst excuse for an instructor.",1.0,5.0,Elizabeth Ferns

1,"Easiest math professor I've ever had. He explains the material very thoroughly. The review is almost identical to the tests. The sample tests are take-home and in class for the real test, you're able to use your review and take home test. He always lets out early for night class and won't make you stick around, unless you need help. Very helpful.",5.0,1.0,William Ruesink
1,"What a gem of a professor! The kindest and funniest man alive, and extremely open-minded!!

After that, he constantly brought it up.",1.0,5.0,David Weiner
1,"Mr. Goodman knows his voice is monotone, but if you can look past that he is a great professor. All of his notes were on D2L and he would tell you what was important.

Also the book is super cheap $30?!? AND NO FINAL EXAM!",5.0,2.0,Alicia Lozeron

1,"Great Professor!! Compared to the calculus classes at a UCF this class is cake. I love the way he explains problems!

Obviously with the more practice you have the better you get.",5.0,3.0,Mike Malone
0,"Arevalo is a sweet person but shes not great at teaching. She runs through the slides and crams things in at the last second. Her thick accent makes it hard to understand her too.

0,He has such a monotone voice and i tired to stay interest in the subject but listening to him puts me to sleep. He does crack jokes on a occasions. Gives you a chance to do extra credit. if you miss more then 7 classes your grade drops to by 12%. i wouldn't recommend taking him,2.5,3.0,David Coleman
0,Not my favourite prof for a course that requires clear explanations. His slides are very detailed and he tries to engage the class but he's not an interesting lecturer. His assignments seem straight forward until he tries to explain how to complete them; very vague and confusing instructions which makes them harder than they should be.,1.5,4.0,Andre Turcotte
1,"Once you learn Dr. Royce's quirks, he's the best professor you'll have. He puts a lot of effort into his lectures and his classes are useful. I took 3 classes with him.

Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)",2.5,5.0,Ray Butman
0,"Not the worst teacher in the world, at least compared to what I've heard about last semesters.

0,"I'm a good student & receive good grades. Even though I was interested in the material and ready to learn he made this class unbearable.

0,Literally the worst class I've taken at WCSU. Her grading system is a bust. She is a hard grader & makes you redo your work over & over again.

This class will end up giving you endless stress.,1.0,5.0,Rosa Fernandes

0,"Most pointless lectures ever. He ranted once that it is our fault for failing if we have jobs/kids. We were graded by 3 tests, meaning the final could be worth 70%. He kept delaying material because he thought it was too much for one test, and yet saved ALL reactions for the LAST WEEK and that made up 100% of the final. I have nightmares.",1.0,5.0,Phil Brown

Moves to quick and seems bothered my questions.",2.0,5.0,Arup Mukherjee

0,Professor Trubatch is a nice enough guy but his class is the hardest I have ever taken. My entire class is failing due to a horrible textbook and unclear lectures.

She loves her sports too.",5.0,1.0,Susan Cashin

But you get unlimited number of tries, and the highest score is taken",4.0,2.0,Leslie Looney

Pretty standard.",3.0,3.0,Talya Meyers

1,"Looney is a super funny guy and this class was really interesting. It wasn't a complete blow off, but it wasn't too bad.

There was no text book and no final.",5.0,2.0,Leslie Looney

0,"The class is really easy, but you kind of have to teach yourself.  He is confusing in lecture and he even confuses himself most times.  If you ask for help on a question he either does it without much explanation, or he gets it wrong and another student has to complete it for him.  I think he is very smart, but isn't the best teacher.  ",2.5,1.0,Clinton Hines
1,"This is a flipped classroom, so if that isn't helpful for you then don't take this class.

I personally enjoyed this because working on problems w others in class led me to learn material better.",4.0,3.0,Jennifer Gonzalez-Zugasti
1,"Fair class. Professor is friendly, but goes off on tangents occasionally. The unbearable part of the course is the material. Sometimes it's not very interesting and he will acknowledge this. No textbook use. 5 random attendances. 3 tests, drops lowest score. Final exam. Do the study guides! Questions are verbatim, you just have to find the answers.",3.5,2.0,Daniel Proga

1,Rebecca helped open both my mind and body to the world of dance. One thing I would like is for her to integrate more of her writing into this class.

1,"Great class. He's a former mayor of Philadelphia and City Council President, so he knows a lot about local government. He doesn't assign much homework, and what he does assign is just a certification that you read something. He does tend to go off on tangents, but they're interesting. Budget simulation at the end of the semester is fun, but hectic.",5.0,1.0,John Street
1,"Professor Sanchez is a sweet and caring abuela who lets the class go in the direction the students want.

1,"She has a very big pet peeve regarding students talking during class, but as long as you do well on papers and quizzes and stay on her good side, she's a good professor.

1,"Ok class but being Philosophy you'd think it'd be more serious than just how you 'feel'.  I would prefer if his quizzes and tests actually had to with concepts rather than just to see if you read the book. E.g. ""what was the gender of the protagonist's friend?"" Instead of the actual point of the story. That's what makes this class hard. ",3.5,4.0,Mike McKenzie
0,DON'T TAKE ALYCE HUNTER. She has made it clear that she doesn't care about anyone's situation during this pandemic.

Not a huge amount of reading for an ENG class",3.0,3.0,Talya Meyers

Highly recommend to NOT take a course she lectures.",1.0,3.0,Wei Xing

1,Great teacher and a great person. Cuts away the B.S. in the material to teach you what you really need to know. Tough class with a lot to learn and do but a great teacher.

Take her class if you have the chance",5.0,4.0,Raven Maragh-Lloyd

1,I hated this class when I first started it. The class isnt structured and he's all over the place. I realized later that he really just wants us to become interested in the subject. He is very knowledgeable and I appreciated the class after it ended. I would take another class with him.,3.5,4.0,Michael Zank
1,Terri was one of the best profs I've had at Westfield. She really cares about the students and is very available to talk outside of class. Her grading is very fair if you do the work and Terri is very understanding if something comes up. Would recommend and would take again!,5.0,3.0,Terri Griffin
0,"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever had, however, I would not recommend taking him.

Each week has a pre-lecture quiz and in class quiz based on the weekly textbook reading.",5.0,3.0,Matt Anderson
1,She is a fantastic teacher and it is very evident that she cares about students success and loves the field she works in. The group projects are easy A's.

Good for non science majors.,5.0,3.0,Lisa Oakley
0,"Nice guy, replies to emails, and is pretty lenient with assignments. He practically gives you the answers for the midterm and final, and if you do the assignments it's an easy A.

1,"He's a great teacher.  Very laid back and easy going.  He gives pop quizzes every now and then, but they aren't really a surprise because if he gives you a reading the class before you can count on maybe taking a pop quiz. Even then there's a 50% chance you want have to take it because he makes you roll a die to see.",4.0,2.0,David Marlow
0,"Don't recommend his class what so ever unless you have time. If you have a busy schedule DO NOT take his class but if you think you are capable go right on ahead. Just know he doesn't give direct answers to your question and he advises that you memorize his syllabus. In class he has really long lectures, pretty big reading and writing assignments.",2.0,4.0,David Weiner
1,I liked Dr. Prasad for chemistry. She is really good at lecturing and helps students to understand difficult concepts. She loves participation and likes when students work problems on the board.

0,"This is a prime example of a professor meant to only teach to math majors. He has the pace and brisk attitude of a prof bored of teaching lower level math.

1,"Professor Malone was pretty organized and helped make this class pleasant. He lets us drop one test and five quizzes at the end of the semester, this helped my grade a lot.

1,I would recommend her! Very helpful. Explains things very well. In class assignments and homeworks are pretty straight forward. Three exams.

0,"The most boring class I have ever taken. He lectures every class. You look around and 90% of the people are either asleep or watching Netflix. This class is nothing but abstract, liberal ideology that makes no sense. But its an easy A honestly.",2.0,1.0,Brian Williams
1,"Class was ok. Had an option to complete a certain # out of total assignments. Was always pushing deadlines back. He did tell me it was ok to take on a topic that has yet to be researched, went thru ideas for the paper, told me i needed to find research on it on graded last edit? that was a bit annoying.

1,Conta was an amazing professor when I attended class with him back in 2011-2013. Great to see an actual police officer become a professor and have such vast work knowledge/experience but also incorporate it into a lecture format and be able to teach students. I took pretty much all the courses he offered and left LACC with an AA in Criminal Justice,5.0,3.0,Mark Conta
1,"The only bad thing is he didnt follow the syllabus really, so I was confused most of the time about what homework was due and when. However, he really is a great teacher, he likes to joke around with students and ensure that everyone knows the content. Pay attention/participate in class, dont have your phone out and youll be fine.",4.0,3.0,Matt Peisen

1,"Matt Anderson is by far one of the most caring professors at NAU, he is so sweet. If you have him for a lab instructor, you are very lucky. He makes sure all of his students are understanding the material and gives out inspirational tips throughout the whole semester. Keep in mind since it is a lab, you have to go to class to get a good grade.",5.0,3.0,Matt Anderson
1,"The usual honestly. Not the best, not the worst. He definitely knows what he is talking about, and I enjoyed the one personal response we had (huge mark booster worth 10%), however, if you're someone who doesn't learn well from a textbook, or won't memorize things 100% as they're written, don't take his class.",4.0,3.0,Russell Powell
1,"He can be disorganized at times, but he's great at providing practical examples that correlate to the topics at hand. Most assignments are interesting and end up having extra credit opportunities built into them. If you take the time to study the concepts and visit office hours, its pretty easy considering 300+ level courses. 10/10 would take again",5.0,3.0,Justin Selgrad
1,Dr. Thompson is a fantastic professor. His lectures are very clear. He has individual meetings with students after exams so you always have an idea of where you stand grade-wise which is rare for science courses. The material is incredibly hard. He makes his own problem sets and that's the most useful study material.,5.0,5.0,Barry Thompson

1,Dr. Hansen is great guy and this was a very interesting class. Attendance is non mandatory but you should go. There are reading quizzes but they are easy.

0,Professor Neva knott has time and time again has shown her inability to teach by not supporting her student when they excelled in something they previously struggled with.

1,"This class was a lot more in depth than I expected. If you plan on going to law school, you should probably take this class. If you are not, then probably avoid this class. 90% of grade comes from two moderately difficult tests. Smith himself is a nice and funny guy.",4.0,4.0,Glenn Smith
0,English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand.

1,"Professor Leikind is a nice guy, who is really passionate about science. He knows his subject very well, but let me describe why I would not take him again if I had to.

If youre not really interested in physics, its not for you.",3.0,4.0,Bernard Leikind
1,"Andor is one of the most caring, kindest professors I have ever had. He is incredibly educated and passionate about what he teaches.

1,Great professor...not the most exciting class due to material. Got an A by going to class and taking notes bc he tests on a lot of what he says/draws. He uses a clicker system but not often. Tests on concepts and not memorization. Drops your lowest test. Textbook is not necessary. Little curve (2%) so don't depend on it. Not a bad class!,5.0,3.0,William Self

0,I wouldn't recommend Coop for anyone who has never seen calc before. His explanations are unclear and the examples he gave in class were beyond easy compared to the problems on his exams.

1,THIS CLASS IS EASY! As long as you show up and complete the modules in class you will never have homework.

He will work with you until you can understand the topics.,5.0,2.0,Matt Anderson

0,"Just say no, and stay away or youll be sorry. I dont even know where to begin on how bad this course is.

If youre trying to get into a limited access program then definitely stay far away Because this course could ruin it",1.0,3.0,Andrew Thompson
1,"Professor Osoba is one of my favorite professors I've ever had. He makes it a point to learn everyone's names and get to know his students.

1,"If you want an easy A, take this class. There are 3 tests and the final all of which are online. He takes attendance randomly 5 times during the semester.

1,Edward J Tavss is perhaps the best chemistry professor in the country... The universe? Maybe...

1,Professor Draper is extremely organized and insightful. She always meets with students and tries to understand any situation they might have going on. The lectures are amazing and she lets students incorporate their thoughts and opinions. The people who gave her a low rating did not do the homework and missed class.,5.0,3.0,Elaine Draper
1,As an anthropology major I was waiting for this class and it did not disappoint. There is a lot of theory but I felt like Carter made it intersting and easy to grasp. One exam and a final project.

I had surgery over spring break and missed a few classes for appointments and she was very rude and unwilling to help me when I was asking to receive homework prior to classes so they weren't late.,2.5,3.0,Margaret Hanratty
0,He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,1.0,5.0,Manuel Hercules-Menjivar

0,Calculus II is a very hard class as it is and he makes it harder when he doesn't completely finishes examples and doesn't go over complicated examples which are seen in the very long hw.

Hes a great and funny teacher.",5.0,2.0,Mike Malone

His teaching style prioritizes reinforcement.",4.0,4.0,Gary Howell
1,Graded attendance but passing means do the online work. Lots of quizzes and discussions about course material but will comment interesting feedback.

She grades kind of hard, but gives great feedback. 10/10 would recommend!",5.0,3.0,Apryl Prentiss
0,"Ive taken a few of her classes, if you do the work you pass but she is a very frustrating professor. Since she is an abstract artist, she wants every piece to be abstract (regardless of the prompt) and will change your idea herself to suit what she thinks is good. She also plays favorites and can be rude at times. Worst art teacher Ive ever had.",1.0,2.0,Linda Besemer
1,"Prof Hoffman was a great biochemistry professor! He's incredibly smart, but is kind and receptive to questions . I enjoyed going to class, and learned a lot every lecture.

He taught me a lot even though I'm not gonna be a PE teacher.",4.5,2.0,David Goodman

Lectures can be dry, but you'll def get use to it.",5.0,2.0,James Hazell
1,"Dr. Simms will make Geology very exciting. You will enjoy his lab projects, especially if you team up with motivated students, and you must be motivated.

Overall, I really enjoyed his class, but the exams were certainly difficult.",4.0,4.0,Nam Nguyen

1,"Absolutely the best professor. Dr Cleveland's passion for marketing is infectious, and he sprinkles fun anecdotes from his life experiences into the material to help explain difficult concepts. His exams are difficult, as he requires you to recount both textbook & lecture material quicker than a Catholic reciting a Hail Mary. Work hard  good grade",5.0,4.0,Mark Cleveland
1,"I thought she was an excellent professor and a genuinely nice person. She really cares about the individual students and wants you to improve. The only way you won't learn is if you skip class often. It's a speaking class, so expect to participate and you will learn.",5.0,2.0,Karen Sanchez
0,"After reading the other reviews here, I think we can all agree on the fact that she's absolutely horrible at answering Piazza posts.

The one perk is that she does provide study guides and 3% extra credit for your total grade. No homework and group projects will balance out failing on tests.,3.0,4.0,Lisa Oakley
0,"Went completely off the course schedule and scheduled tests and assignments so they were only available on weekends. While her courses were well scripted, she could or would not answer questions. Classes quickly dissolved into tech issues (zoom era, I hope this is over when you're reading this) and into arguments with students.",1.0,3.0,Wei Xing
1,"Don't buy the books, rent them just get copies of the Leopold articles it will save you some $$. Attendance is not mandatory but you will miss some important notes. The group activitis, the bus tour and the game are fun. I learned a lot. Exams are hard. Lots of reading and must be organized for this class.",4.5,3.0,Orin Gelderloos
1,"The bad first: Harsh, not very approachable. Waited till the night before a quiz to post slides though hes been saying he's post them for weeks before.

1,"His lectures are confusing. No examples shown. He might ask you to try to carry out a titration or two with specific conditions, but he won't go step by step to show you how it's done.

If the opportunity arises, do it.",5.0,4.0,Heike Polster

1,This is a great class. As long as you call in for the weekly conference calls he pretty much gives you the answers. Very flexible & will work with you if you need an extension on an assignment.

1,"Arevalo can sometimes come off badly to students that do not put forward the work in her class. She expects a fair amount but gives you plenty of time to work on projects.

Her lectures are sometimes rushed but she does genuinely care about students.",4.0,3.0,Elizabeth Arevalo
1,He is pretty easy grader and most projects aren't technically due until the end of the semester (I do not recommend starting them so late since you have 5 projects to do). His lecturers are a little boring and he uses a lot of old code that he sometimes needs to look at again to figure out what they do. His exams are pretty easy.,4.0,2.0,Jon Squire
1,"I agree with another student on this page: THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY A. It was nearly my first B of my MBA career due to how insanely hard he grades the discussions. Yes, discussions of all things! I've never struggled so hard to get an A on discussion work, as he admittedly RARELY gives full credit in this area. Strange approach to grading.",3.0,4.0,Darwin Davis
1,"He is the best professor so far, he really cares about his students. The lectures are fun.  He is really clear about the topics. There are 2quizzes 1 Midterm and 1 Final.

1,"She is prepared for class, but she is pretty hard to approach.

Very possible to make an A in the class if you don't slack off.",3.0,4.0,Christine Mark
1,"This course was set up well during the pandemic, with a module due every 2 weeks. The modules contained 1-2 quizzes and a discussion plus the occasional case study.

1,I chose this upper level Forensics class because I have a certificate in it from community college. I was hoping to expand on what I learned but that really wasn't the case.

1,I have a music background so I was able to breeze through the first half of the work book with ease. It's an online course so time management is key. Clear criteria for how the class works.

1,"Very easy class. Easy quizzes. Attendance was taken everyday but it didn't really have an affect on grade. Fun class. Not hard at all.

0,Turning in essays she would mark out things I would say and add in something that is much longer and unnecessary. So when you take this class be prepared for your essay to be heavily nit picked.

Seems he doesn't want students to be lazy with his course, but yet his leading example is just that, unless you ask for help you will fail, unless you know the material at his level the tests are impossible to pass",1.0,4.0,Andrew Thompson
0,"Worst professor I've ever taken ever in my history of math professors. She is an introvert, which I did take into factor, but she cannot teach the subject whatsoever. Skims through the guided notes, if she doesn't like a part of the notes she skips it and her tests are worded so you cant understand them. Don't take unless you want to teach urself.",1.0,5.0,Kun Niu
1,"A Wonderful teacher! I could not have asked for a more patient and enthusiastic professor. I recommend that anyone interested in a foreign language, take her course!",5.0,3.0,Patrizia Miller
1,"Caflisch is one of the best professors I have ever had. Her study guides are very similar to what you need to know on the exam or quiz, if you are feeling like you did terrible on an assignment or exam, she will meet with you personally and hype you up and give you pointers and she is an absolute gem. Highly recommend her!! Absolutely love her!",5.0,3.0,Annette Caflisch
0,She''s rude. You have to beg for assistance which she will cut you off for asking. She is scatterbrained and never organized. I dread this class every day because she is just not a good teacher and she drives me insane. ,1.5,2.0,Dana Nevil
1,Great Teacher who enjoys his job. Doesn't pressure anyone to attend but holds you responsible for the assigned work. Quizzes & Labs help get your needed points. Four exams per semester.,4.5,3.0,Mike Crittenden
1,Take her. You'll thank me later.,5.0,1.0,Charisse Marshall
1,"Perkins is an awesome professor. I thought theology was going to SUCK, but I loved most of the readings. We watched movies and played video games as part of the class. Discussion-based class - there were only a couple of times we had lectures with notes. Very tough grader, but the class and his chill personality made it worth it.",5.0,4.0,Alexander Perkins

1,"He really knows his stuff and his lectures are very clear. He assigns classwork that really helps prepare you for the tests. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's very approachable and willing to help. For whatever reason, his teaching methods really clicked with me. I highly recommend his classes.",5.0,3.0,Richard Weber
0,This professor is impossible to please. I have never had a professor at ASU grade papers the way he does. He is a stickler for EVERYTHING. I am an A student on the deans list and have written A+ papers for over 3 years at ASU and never have had a professor treat me like I know nothing. Do not take him if you can avoid it.,1.0,4.0,Randy Bulriss

1,"Great professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to be successful, but you have to put in the work as well. The tests were somewhat difficult but if you study the study guide and homework (he gives a short hw assignment a week before you have a test), then you should do well on the tests.",5.0,3.0,Kole Camaj
1,Mr. Emshwiller is a caring and respected vocal instructor.  I will continue to take lessons with him.,5.0,3.0,Michael Emshwiller
1,"She is a great professor. She does not give out tests and there is no final exam. She gives out homework quizzes every week that contain 30 questions. There are only 2 papers she assigns, they both have the same question and it's easy. I enjoyed her class. She is always making jokes during lectures. I highly recommend this professor, easy grade.",5.0,3.0,Monika Bachmann
0,She is probably the most disorganized professor I have ever had. Grades from the very beginning of the semester was not entered until last days of the course. I wonder what she does with those 5 months.... It's aggravating because you won't know what grade you have. Email replies have so many typos. Late replies or no replies most of the time.,2.5,4.0,Janice Hartgrove-Freile
1,"I wasn't sure about taking an online class, I never have before.  And I was also pretty nervous about taking a philosophy class, it seemed pretty hard to me.  But Matt made it SO interesting!  I looked forward to his lectures every week and have expanded my mind so much.  And as long as you keep up with the work, easy A. Best teacher at Oakton.",5.0,2.0,Matthew MacKellar
1,"When you think of Ethics it sounds boring at first, but Nuneville does her best and succeeds at keeping students interested and engaged! I loved her and as she is someone working in this field it was nice to learn more about her experiences. You should expect a group project (easy) and 2 tests (yes, study) Tip for enjoying this class: Participate",5.0,3.0,Michelle Nuneville

1,Dr. Carter is such an engaging speaker. He is inspiring & thought provoking as he leads people in thought very effectively. Dr. Carter was very aware of his students' mental spaces; he managed a classroom with expectations & goals but at the same time he took time to lead us in meditation when we got burned out a bit. I see life differently now.,5.0,4.0,Jon Carter
0,"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. First of all he abbreviates so much to the point of no understanding. It takes longer to understand his abbreviations then what he is trying to teach. Basically you end up teaching yourself. He allows you to bring an outline for the final but it doesn't help much. Overall, its worth taking someone else",1.0,3.0,Robert Bush
0,Sandy is a nice person but a bad professor. She simplifies everything to a level that makes you feel like a child. She takes points off for not showing intermediate steps that are already implied within the formulas that are used. She also gets mad and takes points off of test and quizzes if you use different methods even if the answer is right,2.0,4.0,Sandra Wood

0,"Stay FAR away from this teacher/class unless you are 200% dedicated. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video & discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and ended up having to drop it. May have been easier if this was the ONLY class I was taking that semester.",2.5,5.0,Keith Brooks
1,"I really liked Prasad but I gave her a 3 because she doesn't explain directions, the tests and reviews are nothing alike, and before tests, she has students teach the test materials. The problem with that is half of the students don't care about teaching the materials so you don't effectively learn them. She's pretty good, but maybe not the best",3.0,4.0,Roopa Prasad

1,"Professor Hanratty is very clear about her expectations on assignments and communicates ideas effectively. She is available for questions and assistance when asked and may not be known to be an ""easy grader"" but is fair in her grading and communicates what you could improve. For this reason, I took both English 121 and 122 from her.",4.0,4.0,Margaret Hanratty
1,"Had him for 153 and 181. Really good guy and professor. Hes very clear when lecturing and always asks if hes alright to move on. Gives lots of study tools and exam study guides.

1,He gives a study guide for every test. Just listen to directions and use the resources and you will do fine. He cares about teaching and is is accessible to all students.,4.0,1.0,Nicholas Eisenberg
1,"Absolutely loved his class. He was well informed on what he covered during lectures, as well as anything that may have popped up spontaneously during class discussion. Not a difficult class, but I would advise reading your material and participate in class. Exams were straight forward. This was easily my favorite class since I've been at CCP.",5.0,3.0,Marvin Lovell

1,Super nice man and clearly very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Very reasonable about deadlines and assignments but strict on grammar and formatting. Lots of extra credit opportunities if you attend class regularly. Quizzes and tests are easy but learnsmart activities take time. Group project not too difficult. All in all I recommend him.,4.0,2.0,John Fergurson

1,"Good teacher. Knowledgeable in the subject, but uses outdated materials, (really old VHS videos, hard to read images in course packet and black&white copied overhead projector images). Tests can have surprising questions never covered in class. Otherwise, an interesting class, with opportunities for extra credit work.",3.5,5.0,Christine Ott-Hopkins

Pros(2): Rouhly speaking, 65-70% of the sample question answers can be found in the handouts he gives you",3.5,3.0,Jon Sperling
1,"He's not a bad teacher by any means, but he's also not a PHENOMENAL teacher which is disappointing because the subject matter was fascinating. He loaded all sorts of baloney projects on us throughout the quarter (after week 5) and they were all group related, so if you have trust issues like I do, steer clear from Newsom Kerr and this class.",3.0,4.0,Matthew Newsom Kerr
