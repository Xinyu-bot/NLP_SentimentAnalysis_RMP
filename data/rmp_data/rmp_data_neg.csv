0,Didn't have a great experience with Prof Watts. He grades pretty tough as I would try my best but never could get anything over a B. The compositions and oral exams were graded in a way that you cannot make mistakes if you want an A. Nothing we did furthered my learning in the class. Waits months to put grades into BB & isn't good at emails.,2.0,4.0,Keith Watts
1,Hes a VERY nice man. However hes unclear about his expectations and was very unorganized during class. Being a Spanish major who will be studying in Spain for a semester I am looking for a class that will challenge my Spanish skills and this class did not do so at all. I feel as if I learned very little from this class. I will NOT take him again.,1.5,2.0,Keith Watts
2,"He is very unclear with assignments and homework and not always organized, the homework rarely went along with the class. He is VERY picky with grading and expects your essays to be perfect. He knows the language extremely well but gets easily distracted and its hard to learn much in this class",2.0,3.0,Keith Watts
3,Tough grader and is unclear on weekly assignments for what is due and when its due. Can take 24+ hours for a response. Shes sent up to 5+ emails at a time for changing assignments around. Can be very sarcastic and not very forgiving on homework. You need to be in contact with her often through email and in class if you want to do well.,2.0,5.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
4,"Really disorganized, and really hard to understand what her expectations are in lab. She makes no sense. Basically winged her whole class because no one knew what we were expected. She's funny though, she has very dry humor so unless you don't like that then probably don't take her. I'm surprised I passed.",1.0,5.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
5,"So, this professor is the worst professor I have ever had! Unclear expectations, horrible grader, unprofessional, and never responds to emails. I have an A in organic chemistry lab and a A- in an upper level physics lab, but I almost get a B- in her lab? She is an extremely poor professor, change class if you can!",1.0,5.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
6,"So, I find myself to be a good student, and I did get an A in this class, but barely. I would email her about an assignment a week before it was due and wouldn't hear back until the day before or even the day of. She also didn't explain things at all and just expected us to know it. Definitely find a study group!",2.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
7,"Char could be pretty vague on what she wanted, not good with technology either. Make sure you completely follow the graph rules posted on her syllabus. You can turn a lab in early and make corrections before its due which is nice. Some prelab quizzes were annoying but manageable. I think ppl reported her bc she was suddenly nice at the end.",2.0,2.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
8,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She would tell me there was no need to do certain parts of a lab and I would ask two or three times to make sure I did not have to do them, then after I turned it in, she marked me down for that very thing. She is extremely rude and called out students in front of everyone if they were doing the lab wrong.",1.0,5.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
9,"I went to her office hours, asked a valid question, and then laughed at me in front of my classmates. The class itself isn't hard, the issue is her. I can't tell you how many times I've woken up on a Sunday morning to an email saying we have a pre-lab quiz due that night. I would call myself a very capable person, but Vanderhoning makes 0 sense.",1.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
10,"She gives zero directions and everyone was completely lost throughout the semester, hardest grader ever, she will tell you she wants something down a particular way, but when you give her what she wants, there is always something wrong with it.",1.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
11,This professor is very unclear when it comes to questions that are being asked. She never sticks to the same answer and is super hard to get a hold of outside of class. She never answers your emails and if she does it is with 2 words or less. I would not take her again and if you take her for lab prepare for it to be completely independent.,1.0,3.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
12,"I am in in her Biology 120 lab. This professor is unreliable and uncommunicative. She also does not answer your question when you email her, and if she does its 2 word answers. I would not take her class if possible.",1.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
13,"DO NOT TAKE. Explanations for labs/assignments are very poor. VERY rude when you ask for help or clarification. Did an assignment w/ her, had her check, said it was 100%, turned it in the next class, got half the credit. Doesn't know what she is doing! Lost the entire class's graphs and we all got 0's for a lab. Keep track of your own grade!!",1.0,3.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
14,"You don't want Char for BIO lab. She's constantly unclear in her communication, difficult to get ahold of, and assignments are confusing. She's snarky and will call you out and be directly rude to you with no rationale. If you sit in the front of her class and laugh at her dry humor, you can get on her side a little. Overall do not recommend.",1.0,2.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
15,"avoid at all costs. char is a nice person but she is never available outside of class, NEVER emails you back(if she does its a one word response, 3 days later), and doesn't really know what she's doing it seems. when you ask for help she acts like youre dumb for even asking and she is not very clear on directions or homework criteria. AVOID AVOID!!",1.0,3.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
16,"Worst professor ever. Avoid at all costs. She is soooo unclear with grading criteria and graded very tough. Our lab group asked a ton of questions so that we would get things right, but she always changes her mind about what she wants from you so asking questions doesn't help. Makes a ton of mistakes and thinks it's cute or funny. Extremely unclear",1.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
17,Char has a very dry sense of humor and sometimes is frustrating to work with but if you just keep asking her a question she will eventually answer it. Lab is easy and just do your work. Most work is done is groups too.,2.0,2.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
18,awful.,1.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
19,"I would not recommend Char to any BIO 120 student. She does not explain the labs well and you are left to figure it out amongst yourselves. Not approachable. SUPER tough grader on graphs and reports. She does not respond to emails, if she does, they are confusing and/or one-worded. Search for another lab professor!",2.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
20,"I had her for lab. She is overly difficult. Her grading is INSANE. She is sometimes a bit rude to students; she is definitely not a professor who would say ""There's no such thing as a stupid question."" She at least has a good sense of humor. I would avoid taking her if possible.",2.0,4.0,Charlotte Vanderhoning
21,"She is the most unorganized teacher. Unclear. Unspecific. Late. Does not give a flock about students. She doesn't know that we are in a pandemic. She goes off tangent on her lecture which is fun and all, but it does not help you with your exams. Midterms are 2 hours long and overlaps other classes. It's a 4 page essay with citations.",1.0,5.0,Linda McCroskey
22,Im not one to come on here and give reviews but this class was an exception. Mccroskey is not clear with her instructions on her final paper and her tests are ridiculous. Our exam grade average is horrible and it seemed near impossible to do well on her tests. Im not a fan of the way she teaches and all she ever does is show 40 slides each class.,2.0,4.0,Linda McCroskey
23,"If there is any way, you can avoid taking her class, do yourself a favor, and do so. She is a great person, but she needs to improve her teaching style because online teaching is not working at all. She is very unorganized, and you will be wondering when are the due dates for assignments and test all semester.",2.0,4.0,Linda McCroskey
24,"REGRET taking this class. Yes, she gives EC but that is because she knows a large chunk of her class will fail without it. The quizzes and tests are worded tricky and even if you study, do the review and read, her test questions aren't clear.",2.0,5.0,Linda McCroskey
25,"Dr. Brower is ok in class, lectures are somewhat solid. HOWEVER, and a BIG HOWEVER is his grading system and his tests. They are both incompetent. He writes a disclaimer in the syllabus in which he decides to change anything when he wants to. DO NOT TAKE HIM, GPA KILLER. HE SAYS HE TRIES TO HELP STUDENTS, BUT HE ONLY HURTS THEM...",1.0,5.0,Shane Brower
26,Tests are impossible...he tells you to review homework problems but the questions on the exams are much harder and never relate.  I studied for weeks for a test and failed miserably.  And then there's lecture...  He's unable to teach the topic to students who only take his class because it's required for their major.  Avoid his class at all costs.,2.0,5.0,Shane Brower
27,His tests are aweful. He likes to screw people over. There is no need for a premed physics to be that hard. He will make your life suck. Switch to straight bio or biochem and take another physics. SERIOUSLY. Atleast 5 pre med kids drop out every year and they are good students.,1.0,5.0,Shane Brower
28,"He seems like a nice guy but he was not willing to work with me and offer me extra credit, he grades the critique way too harshly & took off several points for things that were irrelevant. he never gave a clear structure for the critique. this class is an easy A BUT if you ever have anything going on in your personal life dont expect him to care.",1.0,2.0,Morris Nelms
29,dont take!!,1.0,5.0,Sheila Hancock

35,"Sucked at teaching physics. Lectures only covered conceptual material, tests contained at max 1-2 conceptual problems. Final was really hard for 6B, like unreasonably hard. Had him for the entire physics series-- would not do again if I could",2.0,4.0,Robert Geller
36,Terrible Lecturer. Grading was fair. From 1-10 in difficulty examples given in class are a 1 and test questions are a 10,1.0,5.0,Robert Geller
37,We had 12 Quizzes and 7 Mid-Terms in the class. His lectures are him doing 1/2 of a problem and then your homework is to finish the problem and then another 10-11 problems. No way to study for quizzes. If you like teaching yourself on a subject that can't be found on youtube? This class is for you!,1.0,5.0,William Feldman
38,"This guy can't teach worth crap. If I learned anything in this class it was from the TA, because Dr. Feldman managed to make the most simple concepts extremely difficult to understand. He also has some sort of anxiety disorder. He was always on-edge and his mannerisms were super distracting. If you struggle with math, do not take this professor.",1.0,5.0,William Feldman
39,"I learned more from my classmates and my TA than Feldman. Very sporadic with his work, did problems wrong on the white board and had to erase it all and start over. I had a 100 on homework assignment, an 82% for quizzes, and didnt do well on the tests. Very test heavy. Didnt respond to emails within a day, sometimes never responded at all.",1.0,4.0,William Feldman
40,"Funny guy, but very hard to follow. A lot of homework, quizzes and 4 exams.. Have not learned anything from him, had to find everything on my own.",1.0,4.0,William Feldman
41,Dr. Feldman makes more mistakes in a single lecture than I do on an entire homework assignment,2.0,4.0,William Feldman
42,"I never took this dude, but he wrote our class final. He gave us his old tests to ""prepare"" for it (without solutions) and there was only one or two questions that were similar.  The stuff on our final was NEVER covered in our class, MLP, or on our quizzes/tests. Kind of an D-head move to make someone else's final impossible to prepare for...",2.0,5.0,William Feldman
43,"I liked Dr. Feldman's humble personality and jokes, but his notes on the whiteboard were mixed up and sloppy. He threatened to grade the whole test if I wanted the point. After emailing him about Greens/Stokes/Divergence Theorems/normal vectors on last day, he said only said he discussed it in class. I never skipped class; He could have answered it",2.0,2.0,William Feldman
44,"Dr. Feldman obviously knows a lot about calculus, but is maybe the worst teacher i've had at the university. He screws up a lot on basic algebra to the point where he'll write the wrong stuff on the board and not notice, acting like it's calculus gospel. This messed a lot of people up for finals because we had different notes over the same stuff.",2.0,3.0,William Feldman
45,He dives straight into talking when the lecture start which wouldn't be a bad thing if he was what he was talking about before be started. It was hard to follow along or take him seriously because he used an umbrella and a pumpkin to explain things in 3-D. If you are fine with basically teaching yourself he is a good professor for you.,2.0,3.0,William Feldman
46,"The word I'd choose to describe this professor is 'rough.' I had such a hard time learning from him in class and in office hours. He doesn't connect to people well and doesn't try to teach things in different ways. If you have him, read the book and good luck.",1.0,4.0,David Anderson
47,Worst teacher ever. does not teach or help you. highly recommend a different teacher,1.0,5.0,David Anderson
48,"Good person, nice, accessible, a man of intelligence and ehthusiasm. However, Intro to economy is really not suitable for him to teach. so many reading without any specific instruction. Always looking for your visit during office hour, which is good, but often I don't have questions because I do not really understand what we are learning.",2.0,4.0,David Anderson
49,"He's knowledgeable, but doesn't communicate what he wants in the class effectively. I felt as if I was spending more time trying to figure out what he expected rather than actually learning the material. Only employs lectures, homework, and two exams. If you mess up one aspect, it'll be hard to catch up",1.0,3.0,David Anderson
50,He is not a good teacher of econ 110 . im sure his higher level courses are more interesting but he tries to get people to decide against being an econ major so that so many people are not in the econ program. department chair. wants to route out people who are not great at econ,1.5,5.0,David Anderson
51,"His expectations are not clear. Comments on papers suggest he didn't bother to read them, when he gives feedback. His spelling and grammar is horrible, yet he expects perfection from his students. Disappointing. I learned a lot, but not thanks to him- I did the work and did extra research, which ended up being rewarding anyway.",1.5,5.0,Paul Majkut
52,"Topic was very interesting but all his lecture notes were directly cut from wikipedia - for a grad level course??  Seemed lenient with weekly grades but never received any feedback on final paper.  Very cryptic in his emails.  My grade dropped severely and with no explanation in the last week, when he finally got around to grading.  Be wary.",1.0,4.0,Paul Majkut
53,"This was the hardest class I've had - 9 plays and the sonnets in 4 weeks, with lots of postings required. Life stopped for this class.  His method of Socratic questioning in the discussions was fantastic-learned so much. His grading of the final paper seemed arbitrary and the response was esoteric and incomprehensible.

63,"This professor definitely plays favorites. He's primarily interested in hearing his own ideas. His goal is not to teach you how to think, but what to think.

64,"I took his online Econ class, and it was the worst class I've taken. Unless you are an excellent test taker and like to teach yourself the class, steer clear. He posts zero lectures or any other original material, grades everything on 2 proctored exams, and tells you to buy an extra textbook--that he wrote. Save your money; take the CLEP instead.",1.0,4.0,Larry Ross
65,"I took his online class and it was BRUTAL. I took econ because I like econ and understand econ, and this class made me feel like I understood NOTHING.

I would NOT take a class from Ross ever again.",1.0,5.0,Larry Ross

They WILL save your butt on the tests (which compose your entire grade btw).",2.0,2.0,Larry Ross

I earned an A but I had to work really hard and I recommend you do not take this class.,1.0,5.0,Doug Thiel

1277,This class is frustrating beyond belief. Doug makes the already confusing subject of philosophy much more difficult than necessary.

1278,Professor Teng was not a good professor for fundamentals of programming. You are better off using stack overflow and watching youtube videos than going to class.

1584,"I asked the professor to extend some assignments due to me getting sick with the virus, and he did not extend all assignments which cost me my grade. The exams were not multiple choice at all and the class average for most was 50%-60%",1.0,3.0,Ed Smith
1585,"If you want a teacher who is willing to help you to pass their class, DON'T even think about this one. I passed only due to the heavy work I did for my homework, participation, and quizzes.

1586,"Avoid this teacher if you struggle with math. If good at math you will be fine. I could see other students struggle in discussion boards. Teachers responses very vague.

1589,Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY from this teacher. He is awful. He is useless when it comes to getting help. On discussion posts he will give responses that don't go with what was asked.

1590,Ed has been one of the most difficult professors I have ever experienced. Throughout class I found myself extremely lost. Even after going to office hours I was still lost.

1591,The worst teacher I have had. He didn't show up on the first day of class and yet gave us an in-class graded quiz.

2499,I have never spent so much time for one class in my life. She treats her class like it's the only course you are taking.

2590,Consistently made mistakes while lecturing and would easily become frustrated with any student who asked for help. She would literally laugh out loud when students made mistakes and loudly speak with the in class tutor about how terrible she felt students were doing. Online assignments consistently marked correct answers wrong - very frustrating!,2.0,3.0,Judy Petkovsek

2592,"A nice guy, very smart. Too smart to be teaching a class with no specific pre-req's. Bergstrom & Zandberg are passionate about this topic. But with no background, you WILL STRUGGLE. Lacking in rubrics. Group presenting, research paper, quizzes are messy. His slides lack text, so if you aren't present for the lecture, bad news.",2.0,4.0,Wesley Zandberg
2593,"Took this class over a year ago. Got As & never gave him cause to question my work ethic. Before finals, I had a very close family member die. I asked for a 2 day extension on a paper due to travel. He was cold - suggested I was lazy and procrastinating. I will never forget how he made me feel. Why be cruel to a student going through a tough time?",1.0,1.0,Timothy Holland
2594,It was hard to get the important points from his lectures that were often boring. His grading was unnecessarily harsh for an introductory level course. The average for every assignment was lower than for any class. I would not recommend to anyone taking the class for fun. Made me feel uncomfortable and incompetent when I tried to get help.,1.0,4.0,Timothy Holland
2595,"He is enthusiastic about the topics in class; heavy readings and the slides for the class are not that helpful (he has his own logic but I don't really understand), participation policy is strict, hard grader for papers and the exam is extremely difficult. He is a humorous and intelligent lecture, not very concerned with students outside the class.",2.0,5.0,Timothy Holland

Take someone else!",1.0,5.0,Jin Lee
2598,"Dr. Lee was mediocre. With COVID19 disrupting the semester, he made the class harder and increased the weight of the tests to a higher percentage which was unfair.

Tophat.",2.0,4.0,Jin Lee

2600,"Do not take this professor he is the worst teacher at UGA. He never help you, you can not understand anything he says, and he very mean to students especially when you ask him questions.

2601,"Jin is a nice professor, but NOT one you will want to take. Strong accent makes lectures rather ineffective, you will not learn in class if you don't already know the material.

2602,If there is any other professor for you to take. TAKE THE OTHER OPTION! Biochemistry is an complex subject that requires a lot of explanation and he doesn't go a good job at explaining. His lectures are boring and it's like he's just talking to himself. He puts material on the test that don't match his teaching. I had to teach myself everything.,2.0,4.0,Jin Lee
2603,"She's really nice and the class was interesting but seemed as though she didn't know what she was talking about, considering that the majority of lectures she read off of a script.

2605,"WORST PROFESSOR EVER. This teacher uses many unnecessary vocabulary words to throw her students off during exams. Her tests make absolutely NO sense, but make up the bulk of the grade.

2606,"Dr Meglich was a terrible grader. She laughs with you in class and acts all friendly seeing you outside class but when it comes to grading she is just too terrible.

NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!",1.0,5.0,Patricia Meglich
2607,"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!! Such a mean professor i have ever had. Her tests are VERY HARD. She gives you questions from all-over places.

2611,I wouldn't recommend him if you aren't naturally good at math. Nobody attends class because going isn't very beneficial (I also had him at 8 am).

2612,He is bilingual and often very hard to understand. He gets himself confused a lot. Must show up every Friday for a quiz or a mandatory activity.

You get a cheat sheet for every quiz and two for the final.,2.0,2.0,Shaokang Ren
2613,"I want to say that Shaokang knows two languages better than I ever will.

There's also no textbook so good luck trying to teach yourself.",1.0,4.0,Shaokang Ren
2614,"He assigns 5 papers, each about 3-5 pages, a final project (5 pages max), and 4 exams. The papers were alright and I'm sure he didn't even read them, just automatic 100, so I don't know why he makes us do the work. The exams are multiple choice but you have to read the book, even if you do they're really specific and only gave us 1:20 for 50 questi",1.0,5.0,Justin Munoz

2619,"Course went online after the pandemic. He was basically just reading off from slides for three hours and it was hard to keep focused.

2627,I was sick for two weeks and he never emailed me back. I asked him so many times for extra help because I wasnt doing well and it wasnt until I was dropping because I was Failing that he did.
