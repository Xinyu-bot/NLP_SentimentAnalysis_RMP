0,"the professor doesn't put much effort into her pedagogy and did not organize her class very well. the whole syllabus didn't make sense. she's not incredibly helpful and doesn't provide students with much evaluation. did not engage students but talked at us in long monologues and then expected a good discussion. overall, not a good teacher.",1.0,5.0,Sonia Alvarez

1,"Great professor! You have to read and go to class to get a solid grade. Very fair, group project can be tough but totally worth it you learn a lot from the class. Professor Carr was completely engaged and office hours were great resource. Last note the quizzes are the hardest part, recommend flash cards and Read in class notes.",5.0,3.0,Brennan Carr
0,"DO NOT TAKE with her. Does absolutely nothing but sit on the computer while in class. Doesn't know how to answer questions on material or tests she gives! Never teaches or lectures about  new material nor reviews for exams. if you want learn nothing and waste your time then you should take her. She probably has tenure, the only reason she has a job",1.0,3.0,Faith Lamprey
0,"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",2.0,4.0,Cesar Reyes
0,The course goals outlined in the syllabus weren't achieved. He went on an unprofessional rant against his colleagues and can be rude to students. I wouldn't have taken this class if it weren't required for my degree. I'd avoid his classes at all costs. Required to buy a textbook that wasn't even used.,1.0,3.0,Robert Anemone
1,If you have to take a composition class PLEASE choose Dr. Zbeida! She is very kind and gives great feedback! I am awful at writing and I passed the class with an A. Although she is forgiving you still need to do your work.,5.0,3.0,Jessica Zbeida

0,"I was NOT fond of her instructional approach. She seemed to rush through the material. When I asked for assistance or guidance she was not very optimistic or supportive. She's arrogant, not very approachable, judgmental, and called people out when they make a mistake speaking Spanish.  I've never had any issues with any professors, until this lady.",2.0,5.0,Eugenia Ruiz
1,"Super fun and engaging class. Discussions and participation count toward the grade, but they are casual chats/thoughts. Funny, caring, and engaging teacher, but specific when it comes to listening and participating. Take notes based on the material he talks about because it is needed for the two-three tests given. Easy A kind of class.",5.0,1.0,Robert Caruso
1,Dr. Hunter's class and work was reasonable. You had to read the textbook and some times articles BUT the modules were doable. Group work online was interesting but definitely made us connect as students. Received full credit on many assignments. Big tip: outline the chapters before the semester begins. Really helps!,5.0,3.0,Alyce Hunter
1,It is crucial to do the webassigns for this class since all his quizzes and tests come from it. Trubatch isnt the best lecturer but he is very helpful if you ask for help one on one. Just work for the grade you want and you'll do fine :),4.0,4.0,David Trubatch
1,Dr Foster is great! He cares about his students and their success in college. He is very helpful if you are having any issues. I recommend him to anyone.

1,"Shes a very nice person, However as a full timer living at my moms with no job, Its alot for me! I have other courses and it seems all I have is math.

The first test is on history of the English language, the second is mainly sentence diagramming, and the third is vocabulary and correcting a paragraph. Very useful class. I learned a lot. Study hard and take it seriously and you'll pass.",5.0,5.0,Michelle Jimmerson
1,"He definitely keeps your intrest during class. I liked him. You have to pay attention though, and his tests are a little difficult to study for, but nothing major. Just make sure to do the homework which takes at most 20 min. I'd recommend him",3.5,2.0,Steve Holt
1,"He is a great professor, dont miss class, pay attention, listen and participate. He wants to prepare you for nursing school. His class is demanding but you can do well if you put in the effort.

1,"Test have no multiple choice and consist of an essay and all writing. There are 2 exams, and one essay. A VERY hard grader, but note taking is a life saver; don't take notes, don't pass. Before each class, you had a reading of about 20-30 pages followed by a quiz with very specific questions. Super fun, but hard class! Very caring person too!",4.0,4.0,Kevin Eubanks
1,Easy to talk to. If you like to question things and have your mind mess with then his class is for you. He challenges me with questions after I ask him questions. Don't have to go to class if you are sick or he will kick you out.,5.0,1.0,Mike McKenzie
1,"Dr. Hollis is very enthusiastic about Biology, which makes his lectures engaging. His class is a lot of work with 3 assignments per week, but that helps to cushion your grade. His class requires you to be on top of your work, but he is very helpful  and seems to genuinely care about students and his class. DON'T SKIP CLASS. You will miss quizzes.",4.5,4.0,David Hollis

Take her, loved the way she carries herself and her puns.",5.0,3.0,Terry Lopez
1,"Shes the best anthropology professor at WKU. Incredibly interesting, witty, and hilarious. Shes a bit scatterbrained but if you pay attention, youll be fine. Tests are usually a few vocab words, followed by a few short answer, followed by a choice of essay. Theres usually two or three class discussions, too.",5.0,5.0,Kate Hudepohl
0,"He is a terrible prof.  He may know the subject well but portraying it to students with very little mathematical background in the manor he did was horrible.  He has no control over the class, his accent is very thick, his exams are very hard which are multiple choice with no feedback.  The hw is online which makes it difficult to learn.",2.0,5.0,Benny Davidovitch
1,"This class was pretty basic wasnt to hard, but I actually learned. Says you need a text book but you really dont theres like 2 read which we never discussed in class so dont waste your money. Also no test just all papers which are not bad",5.0,3.0,Apryl Prentiss
1,"She's a really good teacher, but she makes you work for test grades. She wants in depth essays. One or more field trip and summary of the trip is required. There's several group presentations, nothing on your own. Conservation biology is pretty depressing, but it's very educational, transfers as a 300 or 400 level course to a lot of SUNY schools.",4.0,4.0,Jan Bowman
1,"The class was very easy if you show up. He tends to go on and on about random things, but it'll mostly tie in with what he's teaching. He is an amazing teacher who only wants to help you understand the lessons and achieve not only in his class, but outside. He is very welcoming, always asking how you are doing, or how your outside hobbies are going",4.0,1.0,Joe Alvarez
1,"best professor at elac. all you need for this class is a printer. provides printable notes. Exam are based of hwk, lecture notes, and study guide. Use a proctor for exams. Caring professor. Makes you work for you grade. HIghly recommended.",5.0,3.0,Na Choi Baek

DO NOT TAKE HER, i took math 125 the next semester and got an A.",1.5,5.0,Linda Barton
1,Mr. Brown is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He came to be a teacher from the job world so he has first hand experience with a lot of the material and has valuable stories about it. He assigns work frequently but it isn't constant. He gives plenty of time to finish harder assignments and is open to extensions (when appropriate).,5.0,4.0,Shawn Brown
1,"Great professor, very caring and eager to help. Content is clear, direct, and simple. Would for sure take another class with her again. Very reasonable and manageable class.

1,I dont know what the other kids are talkin about. Yes it was an 8am but if your in college stop complaining. Her clicker quizes are pretty easy and you can use everyone around you to help out.

0,"This professor is by far the worst human I have come across in my 19 years on this planet. She has no teaching ability and I am fairly certain I learn more in my sleep than I do in her lectures. She docks marks for memorizing the information because she wants you to ""think deeper."" Justifies giving marks like 5.332. Please UBC, find a new professor",1.0,5.0,Miranda Hart

1,"Professor Bailey is a very nice person and very understanding and an easy grader you get all the points by just doing the work.

1,He keeps this fairly interesting. Not a challenging class by any means. He is big on textbook reading and the book is definitely not small.,4.0,2.0,Mark Cleveland
1,I was worried that this class will be strict with style and content like the CSE classes but this wasn't too bad. Mike does a good job at lecturing but I felt rushed with some of the topics (probably because the snow canceled a couple of classes). I didn't like the group project though because my group didn't do work but overall the class is good,5.0,3.0,Michael Freeman

1,Matthew has been one of my favorite professors by far. He is so nice and gives you ample opportunity to do well in his class. If anything ever comes up then you can just go talk to him about it and work something out. Very understanding and willing to work with you. You do talk about some heavy things in his class so be prepared for that.,5.0,2.0,Matthew Thomas-Reid
1,"He seemed a little bit strict, but he was funny sometimes. We had 5 2-pg papers that were really easy. He said we were going to have pop quizzes but never got any and the 4 tests were easy if you finished and studied the study guides. I also like his way of grading. The thing that I didn't like was that he never posted the powerpoints on blackboard",3.5,2.0,Timothy Barnum

1,"He's a pretty good professor.  MAke sure you do the reading, because he doesn't cover everything on the tests in the lectures.  He keeps your interest with films and CD's, but doesn't really involve you in the class.  It is more like he is talking at you, and not with you.  The material itself is interesting, but the class is 3 hours.",4.5,3.0,Paul Guzzone
1,"I had her for calc 1 in the fall. She takes attendance and has quizzes almost every day, but they are to prove to her that you understand the material.

The exams were very straight-forwards.",2.0,3.0,David Boden
1,"Very, very tough grader. Her tests always seem tougher than the actual homework. I would not take her again. She is a nice lady though.

I strongly recommend finishing essays ahead of time for his feedback.",4.0,3.0,Greg November

1,Emily is an awesome professor! She cares a lot about her students and if you are struggling in the class she is willing to work with you in her office hours.

0,She should be teaching an introductory class. Her lectures are quite dry. She reads straight from the powerpoint. A lot of modules are online.

1,"It's always nice when you get a teacher who is obviously experienced in their field outside of teaching, and professor Dudley is that. The only negative that I've experienced in class is that labs usually have a long block of explanation that is only done because not everyone in the class reads the directions beforehand. The dissections are smelly!",4.0,3.0,Virginia Dudley
1,"Professor Dudrick is absolutely amazing. You can see that he is so passionate about the topics he teaches. He always comes to class energized and ready-to-go.

Take Professor Bermudez for any class!",5.0,1.0,Michelle Bermudez

1,"When you write compositions, make sure to have a clear intro, body, and conclusion. She likes transition words (D'abord, Ensuite, Puis etc.) The lectures were just going through the homework.

Only problem I had with her classes is that the book was more or less unused beyond its glossary.",5.0,2.0,Jeri Robinson-Lawrence
1,"Your gonna notice that mosts reviews are either 4 and 5 or 1. There's a reason for that. His class is easy to do bad in, it's only 4 exams and the exams are hard.

Cool guy.",5.0,4.0,Nam Nguyen
1,"Dr. H is very funny and relaxed professor. She really knows her stuff and presents the information in a captivating manner. It is because of her that I am adding Anthropology as a 2nd major.

Exam grading is fair and she lets you know what you need to do to improve.",4.0,3.0,Camille Kaszubowski
0,"Sadly the lack of reviews on this guy led me to take his class due to this class being set in the morning.

Overall, take someone else.",1.0,4.0,Gary Howell
1,"It's a hard class by nature of the material, not the professor. She's a working professional in the field so she definitely knows what she's talking about.

This is not a easy class, he will make you work for it. 5 Books to read, 2 Papers, 2 Quizzes and 2 Exams with multiple group discussions via smaller readings.

0,Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,1.0,2.0,Alex Gonzalez
1,"Very funny and caring teacher. Enjoyed having her as a professor and was very clear on what was expected in class. Very lecture heavy and are not given notes outside of class, so you need to attend class in order to pass.

0,Dreaded this class everyday that i had it. Couldn't wait to be done. This teacher takes alot of pleasure out of insulting kids on thier work and pointing out thier mistakes.

You have a fill in the blank exercise as well and a 1-2 page reflection for each chapter!,2.0,4.0,Russell Powell

He does know history really well tho!!",3.0,4.0,David Schlortt

I would recommend.,4.0,4.0,Andrew Thompson

I recommend taking him.",5.0,3.0,Thomas Workman
1,Attendance isn't graded but encouraged. His slides are online but he includes info on tests within each lecture. Never actually used the book.

TAKE HIM :)",5.0,2.0,Linell Wisner

1,"Extremely knowledgable, amazing at lecturing, is very patient/kind and helpful during office hours, and clearly just wants you to succeed (unlike many ECON profs).

1,"he can seem like he is kinda of jerk at first, but really a fair guy when it comes down to it. i missed 3 or 4 assignments just because i was lazy and he let me turn them in on the last day(even though he doesnt allow late work) and it raised my grade an entire letter. also extremely intellegent in his field.",4.0,2.0,Gary May

0,He refuses to use Canvas or email so contacting him outside of class is a hassle. He rarely takes time to explain the lessons so he almost expects you to know what he's doing.

0,"One of the worst profs Ive had. She rushes through her slides, and does not give nearly enough time for students to write down what shes saying - let alone understand it.

The class is super easy, do homework every week, and show up to class.",5.0,1.0,Lonn Monroe

1,Took her Spring 2020. She's a sweet and nice person. She made tons of retake exams which are great. Her teaching isn't phenomenal considering her 10+ years of experience. Just okay.

Take a class with him.",5.0,5.0,Paul Young
1,The instructor was great. The only thing I can say is that she hides extra credit in the lectures so pay attention. If you don't do the study guides you will fail the class. One thing I didn't like was the questions on the study guide weren't worded the same as they were on the quiz. I found myself hunting for the answers a lot.,3.0,2.0,Courtney Kelley

1,"One of the best professors I have had a MSU. As long as you show up and take notes you will do fine. He gives credit on the tests for just labeling graphs.

He drops one test (or your quiz total), and all his exams are well within the homework territory. As long as you do your homework yourself you should be fine.",3.0,3.0,Adam Sikora
0,I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know.

Also he takes attendance.,2.0,4.0,Joel Melendez
1,"Shimul definitely cares about his students' success in the class. He cuts out the lowest tests, quizzes, and homeworks, making it easier to get an A.

Her exams are pretty easy, plus she brings her dog to class sometimes.",5.0,2.0,Earline Ferguson
1,"He likes to extend class periods as much as possible. He is a very tough grader on homeworks and quizzes. His grading is not very clear and is entirely graded on his judgement.

0,"I took his class based off of the reviews... wouldn't do it again. You can easily get a C if you dont do anything and you just want to pass.

0,Dr. Kelley is a overall good person but as a Professor she stern and the quizzes can be confusing and hard to pass. She grades her discussion boards thoroughly and harsh. Extra credit is hard to get as well. I cant recommend her for a 1010 class.,1.0,4.0,Courtney Kelley
1,Dr. Mizell was the best professor I have had in a long time. She was great. I enjoyed her class each and every time I walked into her class room. She was so nice and caring with all of us.

0,"In order to do the assignments, you need to first buy the text book. I didn't buy the text book in the beginning so I wasn't able to do any assignment and received bunch of 0s.

She responds late and doesn't fully answer your question.",3.0,3.0,Urbi Ghosh

If that's all she's riding on, it isn't much.",1.0,5.0,Judith Thompson

He is an easy grader as long as you do the work according to the rubric.",3.0,4.0,Michael Wiley
1,"The way she speaks in her lectures is really really monotone and boring which makes you (at least me) really disinterested in what she has to say.

Attendance mandatory on lab days",3.0,2.0,Laura Pangallozzi

1,"He takes a minute to post grades but is easily accessible thru email if you have any questions. One quiz per week except when you have your linear project. Participation is one homework assignment per week, literally one problem. Textbook was online. You can do extra homework problems for extra credit.",4.0,3.0,Farshad Foroozan
1,Her notes in class aren't really too helpful but you have to go for attendance points. Read the textbook and her tests are really fair (i'm talking easy 90's if you read the textbook)!!! Just put in the time and do the HW. I am by no means a chem person and still did very well.,3.0,3.0,Kelly Roe
1,"TAKE DR. ROSS! Seriously, people put off enrolling in courses until they can have him as their professor. Pretty easy grader, but the material is hard. Do the work, work hard at it, you'll get an A. Likes to give take home tests, but mind you these are not at all easy. Absolutely willing to help during office hours, and pretty much anytime else.",5.0,3.0,Ajani Ross
0,Don't take orgo II with him if you actually want to learn anything. He forces you to memorize things and his exams don't test your understanding of the material.

Montague-Smith
0,"His lectures don't line up with anything that will be turned in for a grade. He does do lectures based on the upcoming lab assignment, but that's just him reading the posted document(s) to the class. He posts most material online and usually will just read off of those during lecture. It's an intro course but background knowledge is required.",2.0,3.0,Dwight Day
0,This was one of the worst classes I have taken in my entire undergraduate career. She is not respectful (makes backhanded comments). For at least a month of this course we basically taught ourselves and her group projects were ridiculous.

I would advise taking this class with a different teacher. he ruined my experience of forensics :(",1.0,4.0,Howard Birnbaum
1,He teaches in a way that is easy to understand and will answer any question you have. He always has exams and quizzes graded by the next class day.

He never has anything in the exam that he didn't focus on.,5.0,3.0,Micheal Graham

1,What can I say?. This is one of the best people I have ever know.  I published a Physical Reviews Letters and another paper under his advisement.

1,"Mr. S is, beyond a doubt, the best philosophy professor I have ever had. He is passionate and excited about his subject, and he wants to instill this excitement into his students.

1,"This professor tries to make sure that you understand the material. However, the homework is harder than it is on the quizzes and he gives either 2 or 1 chances on the homework.

1,Her elegance and poise is only matched by her classy style. She's really nice and well organized. Hands down the fastest marker i've had. she's tough and doesn't tolerate nonsense but if you're on the ball and know your stuff she is a joy to have as a teacher.,5.0,4.0,Shauna Pemberton
1,"Hensley is one of the best professors I've had at Iowa. It's not the easiest class, but he is a great person and cares a lot about the success of his students.

You must have old material in order to stand a chance.  Teaches mainly via powerpoint slides, and therefore goes too fast. HW is worth only 10%, he takes off points based on ""effort""",3.0,5.0,Ping-Pei Ho

Overall a great class and great prof!",5.0,3.0,Mariano Baez

1,Formula sheets can be used on tests which is a great bonus. He provides reviews and the tests are very similar. He gets kind of angry with students who don't put in 100% and you needs to be present in class or a lot will be missed and you could get lost. He also provides bonus points but it can be revoked if you miss 2 classes. Overall pretty good.,3.0,3.0,Andrew Rohan

1,"This is a good class to take if you have others you want to focus on during a semester. She just gives you the answers the class before the test and you write an open book paper every other day. However, if you desire to learn anything your better off with someone else.",4.0,1.0,Linda Bowlin

1,"major grades are the midterm, final, a 12 page paper and an 8 page paper. Papers are not fun to write but he gives you ample time to complete them, and grades fairly.

1,She might not be the best instructor but she really cares for her students & very understanding. She is still new & getting used to teaching; there is not much to teach in crit think & philosophy!

If I hadn't just graduated, I wouldndefinitely take more classes with her in the future. ",5.0,3.0,Sara Chambers

1,Dr. Baddar is one of the few professors that actually cares about students and education. She is a well-rounded educator that wants to see students succeed.

1,I took his class 171 for elementary teachers and im taking 172 next quarter.

1,"Mike is so nice and he really cares about his students! For the remote course, there are 4 mini projects and then a final group project that you work on throughout the quarter.

1,"Well lets put it this way. I got an A in the class. I didnt buy the book. I listened to her lectures and took some notes and thats about it. Just do the projects and put some effort into it.

0,I am not one to complain about a professor but this guy is AWFUL. Not only did I teach myself everything he is a nasty disrespectful guy. He would choose certain students and pick on them.

1,"2-3 Exams (Midterm and Final usually). Depends on timing. Quiz every class, but you can easily get by if you study the material (Drops the lowest 3). Gives a good sample exam that is about 80% of the main exam and genuinely loves Ornithology. It's a field course so you go out and identify birds (not in the rain). Highly recommend for Ornithology.",4.0,4.0,Jon Sperling
1,"Her class is extremely well organized, she definitely knows what she's talking about and explains all the concepts in a way that is easy to understand.

1,Jason has become one of my favorite professors ever. I switched into his class last minute and I'm so glad I did.

He truly cares about statistics and his students.,5.0,2.0,Jason Rarick
1,"Easy class if you pay attention and take notes in class, as well as read the textbook. She posts the powerpoints online, so writing supplementary things she says is helpful.

There are a lot of assignments, quizzes, and exams that are crammed together- it can be difficult due to the overlapping. Lab is easy, you learn as you go. There are only two lab exams and they are easy A's. The book was used once for hw on a chapter",3.0,4.0,Tong Cheng
1,"Marketing 190 is basically like MKT 230 except for Marketing majors only. This class was a hybrid so half online half in class. Very easy to pass.

1,"Ah Dr. Rolle.. Probably the funniest professor I've ever had. Tells great stories throughout class. The only time I fell asleep was when he didn't get side tracked. Tests aren't too bad, generous partial credit is given and extra credit quizzes add straight on top of your test grade. Don't expect to learn much in his classes.",3.0,3.0,Kurt Rolle
1,"Dr. Cutler is one of the most caring people you will ever meet. The content of her class is hard, and sometimes I needed to look up YouTube videos to find another way of explaining a topic. She is a good teacher who will slow down if you ask her to. However, she does not baby you. In order to get an A in her class you need to be self-motivated.",4.0,4.0,Ann Cutler

I highly recommend her.",5.0,1.0,Ashley McGee

If you care about music, take this class.",5.0,3.0,Paul Young

0,Your best bet is to use Khan Academy or some other online resources and just use those over relying on the book or lecture too heavily. He says the book isnt student friendly then proceeds to read directly from the text.

1,"Dr. Mike is the best! Everything was clear, his exam reviews are very comprehensive, and he's actually pretty funny.

Highly recommend him for physics!",4.5,4.0,Mike Melnichuk
0,"Very rude sense of humor, if you're sensitive don't take him. Not straight forward at all, assignments, if any that are given are confusing. Attend class or you will be completely lost!

1,"She's a very nice and easy teacher. Just do all the assignments on time and participate in the class group discussions, I bet you will get an A for sure.

I recommend take her class if you are an ESL student.",5.0,1.0,Pamela O'Klock-Stein

0,"Don't really like the way he teaches -- in fact I don't think I would call it teaching.  He's not clear and he doesn't teach you the stuff he tests you on; he expects you to learn it by reading it on the web.  If I wanted to do distance learning, I wouldn't be going to class every week.",2.0,3.0,Rick Bevis
1,"Awesome- immense amount of insight, his classes are very entertaining- his study sessions are extremely helpful, his tests are reasonably easy (he gives you a full study guide on everything) He does not speak with a monotone- i have my own opinions about the person who said that previously- take him... he will give you an infatuation w/ sociology",2.5,4.0,Arthur Goldiner

1,The easiest class I have ever taken. We were supposed to take 6 small quizzes from the book throughout the semester and we only did 1 because she forgot to post them. Very forgetful and kind of an airhead. She has put many of my assignments in as 0's and it takes her a while to put them in. Super easy but annoying because of how she is.,4.0,1.0,Kathy Backus
0,Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,1.0,2.0,Alecia Anderton-Brown
1,Kopp's a cool dude. Laid back and open to all ideas. The textbook (online) is needed as there are short quizzes every Sunday. Speeches are fairly easy and you will do will if you follow the rubric and maintain good eye contact. Attendance does matter. He will mark 5 points per unexcused absence which got me a B.

Unfortunately, CCNY makes this course very hard to pass no matter which professor you take.",1.0,5.0,Ping-Pei Ho
0,There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure.

1,"Easy to take notes with the way he teaches, hes very clear. Just graded on homework, (and you can easily get 100% on each homework assignment) we only had 4 tests, and multiple opportunities for extra credit! The only thing I wish I could change is being able to use notes for the tests but otherwise overall good experience with this professor!",4.0,3.0,Glen McNabb
0,"Absolutely terrible. She's off topic most of the time, because she's got nothing to teach, since she's got nothing in her brain. It's sad, but it's the truth. If you want a good grade, might as well stay home and read your textbook. ",1.0,5.0,Susan Knoop
0,"I took Professor Thompson's summer course of Micro and it was easily the hardest class that I have ever taken. Does NOT give out extra credit, claimed that he did and at the end of course, never gave it out. Tests were timed 1 minute per question. Lectures were unrelated to the material. I was unemployed during Thompson's class and still got a B.",2.0,5.0,Andrew Thompson
1,This is the easiest class i have ever taken at KSU. I literally made a 100 in the class. Class is mandatory and the lecture is very long but this is an easy A. Dr. G always extended dates and helped everyone. There are very few asssignments so make sure you do them all. I didnt learn a lot it was basically like a review of math 2008 & 3316. No HW.,5.0,1.0,Paula Guerra
1,"Professor Wolverton's History 436: Top Charlemagne course was profoundly engaging, deep on content and heavy with lectures and participation.

1,"He talks at you, his questions to the class are 99% rhetorical.Gives take home multiple choice tests with multiple right answers per question, but he decides what the ""most right"" answer is.

1,"Awesome guy, very different than a lot of professors at Franciscan. He worked as counselor for at-risk youth for 10 years, so he's a little rough around the edges, and he brings a lot of his experiences into lectures that make for good examples. His tests are easy if you study, and he loves it when you go to his office hours. Take him.",3.0,3.0,Thomas Workman
1,"Prof. Osoba is extremely knowledgeable about the field of Economics, and cares about each of his students. Your grade is the sum of 3 open-ended exams (and 6 optional Problem Sets).

1,Take her!!! She is amazing! I am so glad I took her for Sociology! Would take her again! She has discussion and quiz every week. She grades them soon after you complete and she is not a hard grader at all as long as you complete correctly. You get three attempts on the quiz for best grade. It just generates different questions each time.,5.0,2.0,Valerie Robertson
1,"She worked with me.  This was my busiest semester, with 16 hours and 30+ at work, and I was holding a retreat in November.  She worked with me and helped me out big time with assignments.

0,"Personable professor but the way she teaches is awful. Did not have a course outline, made up assignments along the way and did not stay on course topic enough.

I will miss this class.",5.0,1.0,Arthur Goldiner
1,"Took him at Scripps. Swift is so kind and caring about his students. He really wants you to learn math.

1,"Easy A for science students, arts students? Not so much. You HAVE to go to class, you MUST study the material. Arts students aren't used to this, I've heard them complain in lecture.

0,"Norris was so distant from his students. He didn't even know the SI's name for this course. Exams were curve balls.

Wouldn't take him again.",1.0,4.0,Brian Norris

1,"Faith Lamprey was a great choice for this class, very easy and straightforward. Online assignments are not rocket science, she says it herself.

Business problems are only hard if you can't follow directions.",4.0,2.0,Faith Lamprey

1,Excellent instructor! Very clear in his presentation and very organized in his class structure. Regarding the subject matter - thoroughly covers all the bases. You will leave learning so much. Nice guy too.,5.0,2.0,Richard Costanza
1,"Very young, naive. Has yet to have his spirit broken but he's damn near close. Needs to embrace apathy in order to survive. Felt sorry for him. Pretty good guy, just has unrealistic expectations.",3.0,3.0,Brett Goldsmith
1,LOVED this class!! AWESOME!!!,5.0,1.0,Brian Scruggs
0,First day of class stated that she rarely gives an A grade. Doesn't feel that students can write on that level. Don't expect her to put grades into the computer until the last day of the semester. Quizzes for the first half of the semester on homework reading. I would attempt to avoid her class if possible. Formal writing for an informal world.,2.5,5.0,Catherine Jewell
1,Interesting lectures. Makes you interested in mental health.,5.0,4.0,Deborah Matthias-Anderson
0,"DO NOT TAKE HER! You don't know what to expect on the exams because her study guides are too specific. And she does not explain the diagrams from the ppts very well which caused so much confusion. She talks too fast. Oh, and she does not attempt to adjust her teaching style in order to make the class easier to understand (even if you ask her to).",1.5,4.0,Roli Prasad
1,"For me, the class was there to help broaden and sharpen my skills as a sound designer and with any class I take from Josh or when I get to work with him, I can leave learning something new and I can go to him if I'm every confused on what I'm doing (projects, life, etc.). Great teacher and if you put the time into the assignments, you're golden.",4.5,1.0,Josh Loar
0,She clearly cares about her students but unfortunately does not meet the mark as a professor. She assigns readings and documentaries that are very long and complicated and blatantly boring. She puts thought into her lectures but unfortunately does not capture interest. She is also very set in her opinion and does not make room for other ones.,2.0,3.0,Sonia Alvarez
0,"Do not take this class until you have taken physics! That's all it is! The people who were lost were the ones who never took it. 3 exams with an optional final. Exams were HEAVILY curved.

1,The class is almost 100% lecture based. Most of your grade is based on a few short essays and tests. Professor Goldman has extremely interesting lectures and is willing to go above and beyond to answer student questions. The non-textbooks are necessary for test questions and the essay. Foner is really only needed if you have issues with concepts.,4.0,2.0,Joanne Goldmanm
0,DO NOT TAKE. There are 2 quizzes every class on the reading which was homework and the lecture he gave to make sure you were paying attention. Both quizzes and all of the exams are online tho with is a plus. I had a C all semester but the class did so bad he had to scale everyones grades at the end so I finished with an A.,1.0,5.0,Bernard Leikind
0,"Im taking this class now and I hate that she takes so long to grade your essays , you cant apply the feedback to your next paper! She grades the papers pretty tough too.

1,"Perkins is a really nice guy and super down to earth. There is an above average amount of reading and writing for homework, but every single class is just a discussion on what we read at home (very low stress). Honestly, the most challenging part of the class is the fact he grades an A as a 95+ rather than 93, so its harder to get an A.",4.0,3.0,Alexander Perkins

1,"He is genuine and very passionate about his field. He is one of those professors that can keep the class interesting by relating topics to relevant issues. He is a tough grader, ask him if you have any questions but always answers his email. His main goal is to teach you the information but he does look out for your best interest. Would take again.",4.0,4.0,Erik Riverson
1,I'm taking her this semester and so far she's amazing. She goes a little too fast sometimes. It that's ok because she's more than willing to meet with you anytime if you have any questions. She also tries to give you as much points as she can even if you get a zero you,4.0,3.0,Rachel Krueger
1,Too many mistakes. Makes circles around himself,3.0,2.0,Clinton Hines
0,"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",1.0,5.0,Jessica Longworth
0,"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",1.0,4.0,Bernard Leikind
1,"Pretty easy class but there is a good amount of writing between discussion board posts, text study question submissions, case studies and exams. The textbook required is very useful and easy to read. Prof. Hoang was traveling during our class so he was behind in grading but he tried to check in whenever he could.",4.0,3.0,David Hoang
0,She is very rude and reads directly from power points. She will force people to make friend with the others . The class is very boring and is very hard to remain focus,1.0,5.0,Melissa Hudson
1,"Pretty solid choice. ECO165 is not an easy class, but he does his best to make it better. There is a lot of in class quizzes, but he tells you in advance. Also, the homework uses Inquizative, and its a very odd homework platform. Very nice guy, and makes the class interesting.",5.0,3.0,Timothy Flannery
1,"Literally the most I have ever learned in a class. It is a lot of work, lots of readings and quizzes every week, but it pays off. He made me such an effective writer and he just makes you really diligent in your coursework. If you put in the work, you will be able to succeed!",5.0,5.0,Michael Dowding

Cool guy, and Jon from skoolers is the BEST.",4.0,4.0,Gary Bliss
0,"If you want an instructor that will communicate with you, don't take her classes. I e-mailed her a few times and never heard back from her.

No response.",2.0,3.0,Terri Fields

1,"Professor Birbaum is  laid back & easy going. He gives a ton of extra credit. Lectures are mostly done by guest speakers, which are interesting.

Easy A, would take again.",3.5,2.0,Howard Birnbaum

For this class you could probably get by without the book, but I used it.",5.0,2.0,Nicholas Bahr

1,"Lanning is SO great. He's such a good lecturer. If you don't go to class (and I mean every class), your grade will suffer. There is a LOT of content to memorize AND understand.

He won't give you an easy A and makes you work for your grade but he has a really good handle on the material, explains clearly and thoroughly, and is more than willing to meet after class. I wish I could take him again for Calc 4.",4.0,4.0,Micheal Graham

1,"He talks in a monotone voice, but he knows his stuff, and has a lot of ideas. You have to dress out sometimes but it is fun to play the games he has, one project which broken into parts, and only 3tests the whole semester including the final. GOOD GOOD TEACHER!!!!",5.0,1.0,David Goodman
1,"This textbook was written by him, so he always makes reference to it in class. Quizzes every week based entirely on the textbook chapter with 5 written questions you're given beforehand (which you answer 3 of in the quiz) and 14-15 multiple choice. Super easy if you do the work. 1 midterm, 1 reflection assignment. Superb prof.",5.0,3.0,Russell Powell
0,"His English is beyond broken, so lectures are totally useless.  Overemphasizes pop quizzes (50% of your grade!) and I feel he enjoys to hand out extremely low grades.  His grading criteria is based on fluff - he wont be able to explain to you why he took off x points on a HW.  Overall a truly awful experience and you will suffer all semester long.

1,"Professor O'Hanlon was tough and strict with grammar rules but that's how you learn! It definitely helped my writing and enhanced my communication skills. All projects except 2 are group projects (you can pick your teammates). Take home midterm (2 short essays) and final (business plan, don't wait to do it!) She works with you to get a better grade",3.5,4.0,Joan O'Hanlon
0,"She is the worst professor i had in my life the worst in UBC so far. Unorganized the explanations are totally unclear. The grading criteria and feedback on midterms is confuse as hell.

1,"One of the best professors I've had, especially since we transitioned online because of the pandemic. Very accessible by email and office hours.

However, if you put in the effort, it's a very rewarding class.",5.0,4.0,Barry Thompson

1,He is a great professor and i would recommend him to everybody that i know! As long as you dont miss the deadlines his class is an easy A. He is very clear as to when the dead lines are and the Projects and Tests are easy as long as you listen.,5.0,2.0,Joe Alvarez

1,"Awesome, caring, funny professor. Gives great feedback on papers that will help you pass, and he truly wants all students to succeed.

1,"He's really laid back and the class is almost entirely participation based, other than a few presentations and 2 or 3 6-8 page papers. Not at all a difficult class, but  unorganized. Doesn't give rubrics, and he doesn't grade anything. Out of the 3 papers I turned in, I got one back. You won't have a grade until he puts in your final grade.",3.0,1.0,Glenn Gentry
1,"This class was easy and I recommend taking her. I made a 98 in the class. She extends deadlines and is flexible if you have any problems in your field experience.

1,I recommend taking her Global Women in Leadership freshman seminar. You read 3 books (very easy). No tests or quizzes. No homework assignments. One group project. She is very sweet and friendly.

0,He creates a very unwelcoming environment. There's two professors who teach this class and both do a terrible job explaining the material. Hough doesn't even teach the class yet he's considered a professor. During office hours he comes off as very rude and makes you feel dumb for asking certain questions. He does not care about his students,1.0,5.0,Loren Hough
1,"He's a good professor, be ready to learn. If you don't know java, then you didn't pay attention in the 3 other classes, so that your problem. If you don't cheat and put in the effort you will learn a lot in this class. He knows what he's talking about, and can answer any of your questions. +1 for python, but CSULA teaches only java which sucks",5.0,3.0,Albert Cervantes
1,"This Prof. is very funny and nice. You will need to take a lot of notes, which he will grade. He gives out a lot of quizzes after like 2 chapters. However, they are NOT hard at all.

0,"He is a nice guy.. but professor wise, I would never recommend him. His class is passable. But, you will learn nothing.

I wish he was that helpful in daily lectures.",2.0,4.0,Jonathan Conway
1,"Professor Humphrey is awesome! He is so funny & very helpful! You must actually put in the work if you want a good grade, but hey that's life.

1,"Dr. K. is one of the best professors I've had at FGCU. I had her for a graduate class which is less formal than undergrad.

She is very helpful outside the class as well.",4.5,4.0,Sandra Kauanui
0,I don't recommend this professor at all. In her class all she does is scan the book and read directly from it. I can do that in my room on my own time. I have learned nothing from her class. Now I have to find someone else to help me on my work. ,1.0,5.0,Melissa Hudson

1,Gentry is a good teacher..I took her online Flex2 class so of course there was a lot of homework but it was easy to me. This course has lots of material that is common sense. The only bad thing I have to say was she only gave one chance to get extra credit you have to put together a First Aid Kit & needed like 40 items to expensive for a student!,4.0,3.0,Mary Gentry
0,"Completely missed entire units we were supposed to cover. I had her for ENG2 and wrote TWO papers. In ENG1, I wrote 6 papers, that says something.

Lab attendance necessary.",5.0,2.0,Dana Leonard

0,Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm.

You cant be even one minute late.",3.0,4.0,Rebecca Burman

If you're not careful you might learn a thing or two.",5.0,3.0,Christina Gregor
0,"I dreaded going to her classes every week. She is very intimidating and demanding. The only good thing is attendance isn't being marked, but she will know if you skip class and calls you out on it. Readings were just long and boring academic articles. She seems to think she's better than she really is.",1.5,5.0,Antonella Valeo
1,"Honestly, I would take this class again. And, I'm not a math sort of person. Mr. Wildman is eccentric and a little weird at first, but he uses that to his advantage. His quirky analogies and activities help you understand the course material. I would say that one quarter with him beat four years of high school. Don't pass up this opportunity.",4.0,3.0,Peter Wildman
1,"She is an amazing instructor, doing amazing things. She heads the Chemical Dependency Program at ELAC, which is a great program that allows for a Substance Abuse Counselor certification, if passed.

1,Take this class for your GenEd! It is super easy but also a lot of fun. He makes the class interesting and throws in relevant artists like Beyonce.

0,"Seemed nice but this class is for the few that can teach themselves an entire 600 pages of material without any help or direction. Mostly he seemed uncommitted to the class, not giving us study guides (just old tests that might be relevant to what we were studying) wouldn't post grades, and took weeks to hand back short papers. Just a bad class.",1.5,3.0,Stephen Podewell
1,"He starts off as a great prof because of his sense of humor, but his lectures mostly consist of him reading off his power point slides, which is also posted online.

1,Took Prof. Cygan for Music 101. TBH as a previous piano player I thought I would do good in this class because I know a little about music but this class was not all that easy.

Overall, great prof!",4.0,2.0,Carlos Filipe
0,"Dr. Feige is more of a comedian than a professor. He spends majority of the lecture cracking jokes and ranting about non-class related subjects and there's tons of work.

1,This class really is NOT hard. There is a lot of homework and a lot of reading. The chapters for homework assignments were to be turned in before we learned about that chapter. This meant that you needed to read before class. The tests were easy as long as you went to class and did the review slides online! Don't miss class bc lectures matter more!,4.5,3.0,Mark List

1,Taking this class with Professor Goldman is something I would absolutely recommend to everyone. Everything she tests over is in her lectures. She lectures slowly enough for her students to catch everything she says. She offers so much extra credit and has such an unnecessary curve that earning 35% of the offered points would get someone to pass.,5.0,1.0,Joanne Goldmanm

0,His online hw is so annoying! There are 40 questions and a lot of them have more questions within the question. His voice is very low and monotone so you can't really understand.

1,"Also had him for higher plants and wetlands. Lower plants too. Excellent professor. Take his classes and getting out of the classroom is guaranteed.

The questions are very broad and easy to go way over the 12 page mark because you have to relate it back to your family and self. He will only keep you for an hour tops in a 3 hour night class. TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,1.0,John Morra
1,"Sñr. Newall is nice and takes time to go over grammar in class. He's really straightforward about what to expect on exams. His class was my first Spanish class in college- I feel like I got more out of a high school class than I did this past semester, but he's new to USC and he did what he could with the SPAN 210 curriculum. I'd take him again.",4.0,3.0,Gregory Newall
1,LA is what most professors should learn to be like. She is caring of her students and genuine. Her method of grading made it very easy to pass the class with weekly quizzes as opposed to a midterm. One short case analysis and final exam. Love her and her method of evaluation. Would take her class again!,5.0,3.0,Leslie-Anne Keown
1,"Class is HARD, but Dr. Dave certainly knows how to make learning English interesting and does do through comic strips and modern world examples. There's barely any homework. Just a small paper for each chapter (like 500 words), five quizzes, and the final paper. Final paper is difficult, but I would take his class again in a heartbeat. Also works with you during personal emergencies. Thanks Dr. Marlow!",4.5,4.0,David Marlow
1,He made Econ bearable and always offers help. Extra credit given after exams and he curves. Group project was not that difficult. Come to class to earn participation. Study guides helps exams. Overall Professor is super understanding if you show effort and he gives a lot of help and is lenient if he sees you trying! Recommend,4.0,3.0,Mariano Baez

1,"Dr. Bliss is a GREAT professor! For QMB, make sure to do all the homework on time (easy points), and study at least a week in advance for his exams. The homework and tests are similar, but there are some questions on exams that dig a little deeper. Make sure to attend his webinars before exams, and I highly suggest Skoolers exam review packets!",5.0,3.0,Gary Bliss
1,He is the best professor I have had in a while. He really cares if you pass and gives you plenty of opportunities to do so.

0,"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",1.0,5.0,Max Anikovskiy
1,"I took the Honors course and it was fairly easy. There are quizzes every Sunday, but the questions come right out of the textbook so they are never difficult. There are 5 speeches you have to give and the major ones are weighted pretty heavily, however, they aren't that difficult to get an A on. Downsides: hard tests and drags out the class talking",4.0,4.0,Ty Kopp
1,"Everything she said during this class was something to take to heart. She's a wonderful teacher and this was my favorite class, the best I think I've ever taken. It's incredibly personal though so if you're not open to sharing some secrets then it might not be for you. Class was understanding as a whole though and felt like a safe place",5.0,3.0,Michelle Jackson

1,"Don't get me wrong -- Scott is a good guy. I just don't understand his class half of the time. I have to go hunting in the book to understand what exactly is going on. Penalizes you for group mates' mistakes in group projects. I do my homework the night before and he gives me more credit than it was worth to begin with, though, so that's nice.",3.0,3.0,Scott De Francesco

0,He takes a a long time to understand the abilities of the students he teaches.

Not much feedback initially but was decent by the end of the course.,2.0,4.0,Benny Davidovitch
1,"Nancy is very knowledgeable - she definitely knows her facts and has had a lot of hands on anthropology experience. The class is pretty easy as long as you take good notes.

1,Professor Allen is super enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he teaches! He works hard to engage with all of his students and the lectures are always well-structured and never dull. A great class to take!,5.0,2.0,Richard Allen
0,This subject could be decent if taught by the right person. She's not it. Lectures didn't correlate with anything and we all seldom scored above C-range on tests. She cancelled our final the day before without explanation  which shattered my chances at bringing my grade up. She then refused to let me do anything else to help my grade. Steer clear.,2.0,4.0,Rosa Fernandes

1,"He is my favorite math professor. He stops if there is a question, it makes covering the material go a little slower but is well worth it to help everyone understand the material. He offers his lecture notes online so you can print them out and write on them in class, this was VERY helpful to me.",5.0,3.0,Scott Brown

0,"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",1.0,5.0,Bill Demchuk
1,"amazing teacher, really passionate about the subject and makes you think way past the text. sometimes reading could get boring but it wasn't always necessary to read. discussions were usually really interesting. not as hard of a grader as i thought he would be. definitely take this class if you're even remotely interested!",5.0,4.0,David Dudrick
1,"Professor Goldman was pretty dull and her class seemed to go on forever. She was relatively easy, but does not offer extra credit anymore, besides on the tests. You have to read four books, which are not worth your time, but you have to write papers over them.

1,"Engaging, corny guy. Occasionally he'll bring in live demonstrations in class. His lectures though, IMO, are not as straightforward to me. It's really important to attend class and pay close attention. You won't pass just by reading his PPT notes. Focus, read prior to class, and attend study sessions if given. You will make it.",3.0,3.0,Mark Nelson
1,"She is very stern and means business, but she is willing to help you in anyway possible.  She really wants you to do well and if you put in the effort you will.  I would love to take another class by her again!!!!",5.0,2.0,Christina McClung
1,I took her class she is helpful but the thing is I dont penfit from her alot i had to study har to undertand every thing i most of the time understand from the book more from her. it's maybe because she speak alot fast and she is like reading the materials not make me love the subject as i excepect. but i think overall she is a nice teacher .,3.5,4.0,Holley H. Langille
1,"Ms. Moody is hands down on of the kindest professors I've ever had. She wants nothing more than to see you succeed.

1,"Dr. Tops has taken over EGRE 206 and its an improvement from previous professors. Hes very interesting, you wont be bored. But time can be spent more so going over concepts than doing practice problems when in a class like this practice problems help the most. TAs can grade harsh and somewhat unfair, but will give points back. Good class overall",4.0,4.0,Erdem Topsakal

1,She kinda became the permanent sub for Murphy's ENC1101 in 2017 so I didn't really get a look into the way she would organize the class. She wants you to succeed and gives you many resources to do so but is a tough grader. If you enjoy English than you could thrive under her expectations but if you're looking to just get by take Eileen Murphy.,3.0,4.0,Catherine Jewell

1,"While Dave was fun and amusing, he failed to live up to what I wanted in a business professor. The tests were completely based off of what we read in the books. The lectures only went over a choice few topics ( book too)and he went through the slides so quickly it was hard to take notes. He seemed to be really knowledgable though so that's a plus.",3.0,3.0,David Dusseau
0,"Awful PHD instructor. This class is all about organization and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. Funny how that works, right?

If you want to take an interesting class and an awesome teacher, take any of Dr. Monroe's courses, I guarentee if you show up for class, you won't be disappointed! Do the work and study for the exams and you'll get an A. His lectures are amazing too, they keep you interested and entertained.",5.0,2.0,Lonn Monroe
1,"This class was challenging but well worth it. Definitely an upper-level anthro course I would recommend to anyone, especially with Dr. Prussing teaching it. Quite a bit of reading but nothing is busywork. ",4.5,4.0,Erica Prussing
1,"Professor Garrisi was super helpful before quizzes and tests.  All the material is from the textbook and homework sheets. Save the homework. Start working on the hiragana and katakana right away coz KANJI comes  mid-term. The writing practices on-line helped the most, just keep practicing. She is very sweet and  is excited about teaching.",5.0,2.0,Sensei Garrissi

0,Make sure you attend every lecture and discussion! I had 90+ in both midterm and final. But only got B+ overall because I missed a few lectures. His one page essay is really restricted in terms of his requirement. His lecture is always useless and you better off read books on your own. Participation grade is so subjective and unfair. Avoid him.,1.0,3.0,Stephen Esposito
1,Just an over all great teacher. Didnt make the class drag and made it interesting to be there,4.0,2.0,Thomas Collins
0,Hard class but not necessarily a bad teacher.. you just need to do your part. The tests are very hard but his curve is awesome. He also gives a quiz almost every class worth 10 points to keep you on your feet. I would say it's not the end of the world if you sign up for him but he's probably the hardest teacher for 120/121.,2.5,5.0,Andrew Berger

1,Took her Honor's class online. Professor Hartgrove is extremely helpful and accessible through her office hours. The class work is fun and if you put in the work you will learn a lot about psychology. She gives good lectures and was very sympathetic to students during the pandemic.,5.0,3.0,Janice Hartgrove-Freile
0,"I honestly hope you don't get this professor. She's very unclear with her instructions and will assume you're not ready for this class if you're not a strong writer. She grades very harshly, and won't grade your work if she thinks it looks incomplete. If you get her spend time at the writing center and do what ever you can to be on her good side:)",1.0,5.0,Neva Knott

1,"This professor is the first I have ever rated. She is the most helpful, kind, and understanding professor. I took this class as fast track (3hr long classes) but she made the time go by really fast.  Really easy projects and she lets you use whatever version of the textbook you find so you don't spend a lot.  Highly recommend her.",4.5,1.0,Cynthia Poole
1,"Her classes are always interesting and she obviously cares about the topics a lot.  Go to class and participate, this is what she is looking for, but for a 4th year class, that shouldn't be too hard, should it?",5.0,4.0,Margo Matwychuk
1,"Great class, pretty fun.  This is not a difficult class, but there is a lot of work.  The work is not hard, it's just the amount of it.  There are 2-3 semester long projects, not including a group project towards the end of the semester that is a 20 minute presentation.  There are canvas discussion posts every night needing 1-2 paragraphs as well.",4.0,3.0,Leigh Bennett
1,"Prof. Asbell was such a pleasure to have, she is very passionate about her work and give different perspectives on everyday life. She goes off on rants about 70% of the time and the other 30% asks for class input. She's an open book and allows the class to be very independent.",4.0,1.0,Angela Asbell
1,"Don't be scared by pervious reviews of this professor. She was also readily available to help, quickly answered emails and quickly graded assignments. She gave clear instructions on what she was looking for and truly wants to see students succeed. She can give intense feedback during presentations, but it is only to help you achieve a better grade!",5.0,2.0,Alina Reznitskaya
1,"Dr. Purser is very helpful and highly intelligent.  Although he is extremely smart he does his best to help people understand the material.

0,"Marna is a recent grad student. She says the same words always: ""Thinking of this idea of."" you'll get tired of it quick. And if you ask her a question she'll say ""ok so what we're gonna do"" and literally give you no answer. However, she is a very nice grader and a nice person. Sometimes passive aggressive but overall not bad. would recommend.",2.0,1.0,Marna Shopoff

1,I took this class online for public speaking. I hate making speeches but was able to make it through with it for this class. The amount of work given was normal. She also gives opportunities for extra credit. They are a bit time consuming but worth it! I never had a problem with receiving a response when needed.,4.0,3.0,Evie D'Amico
1,"Amazing professor, if I could take one of his classes a third time I would! Very helpful and funny, makes sure you know the information and very helpful when it comes to being confused on things. He takes the time to help you and is willing to work with you on anything!!",5.0,2.0,Bryan Reese
0,"Three hour class that can be done in 15 mins. The professor skips over the slides, which I could be doing at home. Papers are simple but he is a tough grader for no reason. Does not provide constructive criticism for you to do better on the next paper. Asks questions about your opinion, however if it is against his opinion then you are wrong.",1.0,1.0,Erik Riverson
0,"First off, he's a nice guy with a big heart. However, Vallee is very unclear about his expectations. He is a very poor marker; no constant b/w projects/reports. If course material was presented differently, it would make for a much more enjoyable term.",1.5,4.0,Michel Vallee
0,"Literally every single lecture was a prerecorded video from another semester. I could have learned the same stuff from youtube, why did I pay Oakland thousands of dollars to watch videos. I have never witness a professor care less then Jonathan Maisonneuve. I'm struggling to find words to describe this sorry excuse of a professor. Just don't.",1.0,3.0,Jonathan Maisonneuve

1,"A genuinely nicer guy, willing to help anyone so long as you send him an e-mail. I have taken a few of his classes and come out with A's and B's. His teaching method makes complex ideas seem elementary. If you have to choose, choose Whigham.",5.0,3.0,Matthew Whigham
0,He is a nice guy but the class is hard and the only way to do well is listening to his lecture,2.0,5.0,Robert McMillen
1,One of the most inspiring professors Ive ever had. He LOVES chemistry. Seriously. But hes tough. He wants you to know chemistry and hell test you on it to make sure. You have to know it. I personally think its too much but hes really a great teacher.,4.0,4.0,Steven Kennedy
1,"Nina is an absolute sweetheart and such a kind approachable human being, but she has this 'crazy lefty' side of her that I didn't like. She literally gave us an article that claimed New Caledonians are smarter than Europeans (idk who she's trolling with that one). She also sometimes spews political comments here and there, but overall, she's sweet.",3.0,3.0,Nina Belmonte
1,"Also, pay attention to her previous semester's tests as she will base her exams on them, wink wink, nudge nudge ;) No way you can't get an A in her class ^__^",5.0,2.0,Stephanie Rafferty
1,Do all the readings and show up to class. Being in class to take part in the discussion and get the notes is imperative. You will need to know the information for the midterm and final. She is very understanding of time constraints. She cut some readings when we didn't have time and modified our papers to make it easier for us. Very interesting too,4.0,4.0,Heather Zuber
1,"There are a lot of reading but they come into play during the lecture. New to teaching so he can be rough around the edges. He also wants all students to engage in class. Also a very nice guy, easy to have conversations with.",4.0,4.0,Elijah Bender
1,"Great teacher that loves what he does, but tests are pretty hard!!!He doesn't like the use of our textbook as our first resource, instead he pushes students to fully understand his powerpoints, which are from the textbook for the most part. if you don't understand something go to SI and/or office hours he helped me many times when i didn't get it.",4.5,4.0,Cesar Fuentes
0,"Worst professor/class experience I have had at UCSC thus far. Unnecessarily mean and an absolute B. Horrendous experience, wouldn't recommend her to anyone. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. Takes her frustrations out on her students and not one person I've talked to who has had her had anything good to say. Pretty much a 100%  ""hated it"" consensus.",1.0,5.0,Roxanne Hamilton
1,"She was one of the best BIO professors I have had online. She has a easy to follow online course, gives two tries, and provides lots of feedback on the papers. Read the syllabus and know it . Just make sure you do your work on time. I think the other students who complain is because they are late with the assignments (she does not like that).",5.0,2.0,Urbi Ghosh
1,"One of the best professors I've ever had.  Unlike most college instructors, Dr. Thana provides students with challenging assignments so that they will actually learn something (if they care to).  I am grateful for all of his classes.",5.0,4.0,Paramsothy Thananjeyan
0,"Like the last comment said, take a SL class that is five units so that you will not have to take another upper division GE requirement. This class is a waste of time. Only her political view matters and that is what you will be graded on. Another student argued with her and she had the audacity to email us calling us complainers. Good luck.",2.0,3.0,Bude Su
1,"The amount of work for the class is kinda excessive for a 1 credit, but that's not her fault. She took the time to give feedback on almost all the assignments (like: ""this is great"" or ""you should include that in...""). I wouldn't say she was a tough grader, but she did expect the work done in full which is reasonable. Easy A if you just do the work",5.0,2.0,Juliet Laughlin
1,"Honestly, I would recommend him, he's a nice guy and a lenient grader. I failed this class last semester and he made the subject so much easier to understand. He will always answer your questions and is easy to reach. HW is like example problems in the lectures. Really helpful review before the midterm (3 of them+noncumulative final).",4.0,3.0,Kaz Okada
0,Not too inspirational. Very by the book. Could stand to liven class up a bit since it's math and math is not that great to begin with! All in all he's a nice guy just not very riveting.,2.0,2.0,J. Kirk Higham
1,"Tidwell really knows her stuff but she has some trouble teaching it. She stands at the front and reads from the PPs for class. You have to have a quick hand for she doesnt put anything on Canvas because she wants to make sure everyone shows up. She grades attendance every single day, too. This info is really interesting but she made it boring.",3.0,4.0,Taylor Tidwell
1,"Good lectures, You have to work for your grade in BIO 108 he give packets of lectures and you're supposed to memorize it for the exam 4 exams the lowest is dropped but not the final. For Bio 109 you do the lab and every time you go back to class you have a quiz on the previous lab and he only drops 2 lab. You have to do a lot of studying for an A.",4.0,3.0,Igor Zaitsev
1,"Susan is pretty good. My problem is that she has no problem publicly calling students out when they do something wrong which does not foster a good learning environment. She needs to be better about responding to emails & getting off task. Overall, she's okay. If you like spastic, energetic teachers take her. She does chose favorites though.",4.0,5.0,Susan Kelly
1,"This professor doesn't really care about this class and is a very easy grader. As long as I submitted something, I received full points which is bad for learning but is good for a class which is just an extended version of CIT 356. I suggest taking this class with him but don't expect to hear back from him when you email him.",3.0,1.0,Ryan Birk
1,"Professor Bachmann was really good. She is really corny but hilarious. No tests or hard worksheets. There are 2 essays but fairly easy. Attendance is mandatory, but you'll pass if you miss 2-3 lectures. Just pay attention and take notes. Overall, an easy A.",4.0,2.0,Monika Bachmann
0,"Boring speaker, monotone, with no passion. I have Aspergers and have difficulty with social situations. He did not accommodate my disability, just scoffed. Group projects would have been much better if there was a discussion board, forum, or chatsomething to get to know classmates and discuss problems. If I could ask for a refund I would",1.0,3.0,Jonathan Misurda
1,"A mediocre course. Exams are tricky and entirely based on the textbook. Lectures simply regurgitate textbook material. 40% of your grade is based on 2 group projects. Coordinating a 15 page group research paper is no fun. Somewhat interesting subject matter but not presented in the most engaging manner. Nothing special, but > most MOS courses",3.0,3.0,Mark Cleveland
1,"He is a nice professor, very helpful,his exams are hard but his purpose is to make students think and feel challenged so they could learn. he gives H.w and pop quizzes and they r easy since they r after the homework due date.

1,"Of the four teachers I had this past semester when all my classes went online, she was easily the best at using zoom and canvas to put class stuff online so students could still access it and her. Def not an easy A but not unreasonable either. She was super flexible about deadlines and stuff because of the coronavirus outbreak which helped.",5.0,3.0,Genevieve Zuidervaart
1,"Dr. Marlow's class is engaging and challenging. He loves to draw from his students' experiences and welcomes feedback and opinions. The textbook is your best friend, but he chose one valuable enough that I still reference it in future classes. Truly one of the best professors I've had",5.0,4.0,David Marlow

0,"Take his class and you will wish you dead several times throughout the semester.

1,"Professor Bowles knew what he was talking about and accepted any and all questions with great answers in class.

1,"Dr. Wolf is very knowledgeable and overall cares about student success. I respect her as a professor. That being said, she does rub you the wrong way.

She does reward effort as reflected in grades, though.",3.0,4.0,Diane Wolf
1,Best ENC professor at BC!,5.0,1.0,Susan Zabowski
1,Dr. Capper is a phenomenal professor! He takes an enormous amount of material and condenses it into a single semester. The keys to success in this class are 1. Come to Class 2. Do your reading and 3. take the time to know your study guide. Nothing will ever be on the test that isn't on the study guide. Easy A if you are willing to try.,5.0,1.0,Daniel Capper
1,"She seemed a little overwhelmed at times. Mostly timely feedback was provided on scores, a few exceptions. Very participation heavy with lots of reading and study questions.

Shall I go on...? Avoid taking, will ruin GPA. Unhappiness :(",1.0,5.0,Cherine M. Trombley

1,"Dr. Hollis is absolutely hilarious, fun to talk to, and has the best stories. However, he makes an already-difficult class (animal physiology) infinitely more difficult. His test questions are very specific to tiny details, not the whole picture. He is unsympathetic to any difficulties and unhelpful outside of class. Dense lectures, and READING.",3.0,5.0,David Hollis
1,He loves to curse which is not good if you dont like curse words. Get ready to talk he will make you. Turn in your papers he will tell you if you have them in front of the class but wont read them unless you got a perfect score on a assignment later on in the course. He sometimes speaks some words that shouldnt be said. And reads mc papers.,3.0,4.0,David Weiner
0,"Honestly Professor Schap is actually really enjoyable and can be funny in lecture. However, his material is very challenging and he grades tough. Every class will go 5 minutes over so be prepared for that if you have a class after.

1,"2nd time taking him and still one of my favorite professors. He's a hysterical guy so even though he has the most monotone voice ever he still keeps class interesting. Exams aren't too different from slides and in-class exercises, but his projects are the absolute worst. He also doesn't give back all your grades so I don't know why I got what I got",5.0,3.0,Darwin Davis

1,"Grading contract, so if you do the work, you will get an A+. The class has tons of group discussions to help you towards writing papers, and he will always give feedback to improve.

1,"Anne is a great professor and I enjoyed taking Geophysics with her a lot. She is down to earth, explains the material well, and is more than willing to help you out.

You have to do some ""self educating""",2.5,4.0,Ningsheng Huang

1,"I literally had no idea what I was doing in this class, and he didn't really teach much about it.

1,Professor Kroll is great! His lectures are very easy to follow and as long as you take the notes and study you should pass.

It's the only reason I did so well.,2.0,3.0,Ben Helford
1,Professor Liao is good but he goes a little too quick. Expects you to know your Math125 when you come in. Does not explain step by step but if you ask he'll come up to you and explain until you understand. Homework is due on the day of the test. Test questions are easier than homework ones. Drops one test. Will provide formulas in exams.,3.0,4.0,Guo Jiao Liao

0,Mr. Burt is the worst professor that I have ever taken. His tests are hard but would be doable if he actually taught in class.

1,Most of the bad reviews are either outdated or just REALLY inaccurate. You have 3 exams that are easy if you study from the powerpoint the night before. One of the test are take-home by the way. You have a case study that is tedious but not bad. Honestly Don't listen to bad comments. Take him!!! and its really easy to finesse during the tests:),5.0,1.0,Chinnappa Jayachandran
0,"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test.

I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",1.0,1.0,David Knox
1,"Somewhat easy English 101 class.  Very sweet lady, very flexible, and willing to help you outside of class.  Lots of time to work on papers and not super difficult.

1,She was one of my best professors I have ever had!! She was very kind and caring! If you show up and pay attention to her lectures it'd be hard to not get an A (you don't need to take notes bc she posts her Powerpoints on bb). I highly recommend her!!,5.0,1.0,Lois Gray
1,"I love Lisa, she's my adviser and she has done everything possible to help me through college. She talks to me on a personal level instead being treated like a underling.

1,"She is a great professor, but assignments take a lot of time. Lots of writing for each discussion bored and expects citations and APA format for everything! Test arent easy.

1,Jeff is a great guy! He offers alot of help and I had him for PPS so the class was insanely easy to begin with.

The only thing I didn't like was it was at 8am,4.5,1.0,Jeff Allen
1,"Schaal takes tricky concepts and makes them a lot easier to understand. He does an amazing job of finding ways to explain complicated concepts with real life examples.

0,"Absoultely hated this teacher. She does nothing for her students, all she talks about is her dog. She does not care if you pass or fail her class. She does not give any points for anything besides quizzes and tests. DO NOT take this teacher if you want to succeed.",1.5,5.0,Terri Fields
0,This professor was absolutely horrible. All she did during lecture was read her power point slides word for word. As if I can't read them myself. When test time came the answers to the questions could not be found anywhere in the slides or book. She expected you to have a deep understanding of the subject material without teaching it to you.,1.0,5.0,Alison Jassen
1,"This was the hardest class I have ever taken, but I have learned so much. Tom is a wonderful teacher and really pushed me to be a great student.

Love him!!",5.0,4.0,Tom Gerschick

1,"He was a really easy teacher because as long as you did the readings (which typically weren't long) and the weekly online (very easy) quizzes, you would get a good grade.

He is also really understanding so if you did poorly on the exam, go to him!!!! and he will help!!",4.5,3.0,Yook-Kong Yong
1,"She is a fantastic professor. During my freshman year her class was the only one that kept me sane. For the exam, study the notes and then read about the notes.

I would suggest him, just be prepared for his monotoned voice. Easy A",4.0,3.0,Sean Maher
1,"Professor De Francesco is a really great guyhe has interesting lessons and his class is easy as long as you pay attention.

1,I've had this professor for two different classes and loved both. Go to class and you will easily get an A. There is built in extra credit in every aspect of the class.

Take notes when he goes over the quizzes and you are golden.,5.0,2.0,Matt Ostermeyer
0,"This is a course where you have to interact with the Professor often, it is difficult because the Proffesor can sometimes be very rude/condescending.

1,Dr. Gray is so sweet and funny! Really cares about what she is teaching. I took her Environmental Conservation class and it was very chill.

She likes current events and telling you where she has been so just pay attention because that could be a question on a test!,5.0,2.0,Lois Gray
1,"Professor Brown is a very genuine teacher.  He provides power points which makes note taking significantly easier.

The textbook for this course was a bit hefty (some chapters were 50+ pages)",4.0,2.0,Matthew Brown
1,"A very good professor. Anyone who can't hack-it in her class is a joke. Easy class if do your part. Just show up on time, be respectful, and do your work.

1,"Great professor, very kind and understanding. I enjoyed his lectures and that some weeks there was class and some days it was just recorded (to give a break from zoom).

Also very responsive to emails",3.0,1.0,Jo Zimmerman
0,Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class?

1,Ok.. He is a nice guy..good musician..easy class..funny and younger so its easy to get along with him.. BUT he totally favors his type of music over anything else And gives more opportunities and chances and is more helpful to bands who play his kind of music which i dont think is fair. He also apparantly has something against people who just sing.,4.5,1.0,Mark Pawkett

If I were a soc major I would take all of Lisa's classes",5.0,2.0,Lisa Barnett
1,"I love writing but based on grading criteria, I always followed the guidelines and have always aced English courses prior.

HUGE paper for a final grade- mine was 40",5.0,3.0,Vanessa Calkins
1,"Very good professor, he is the ECE department chair, and for good reason. Genuinely cares about students, puts effort into both classroom and research, not always personally available for office hours (because of his other duties as department head), but has excellent TAs to make up for it.

0,Absolutely AWFUL professor. I have no idea how she still has a job. All she does is put her students down because we're not experts in microbiology. Lecture is pointless because you have to read the book if you wanna pass her exams which are extremely difficult. She is very condescending and no help at all. Do well in lab and you'll pass,1.5,5.0,A Bricker
1,"Tests are multiple choice pulled straight from quest with a few added questions thrown in, so lecture is actually insignificant because he often covers material that is not on the homeworks or tests.

1,Dr. Rolls is a great Music Theory teacher. He works to make sure each student understands and passes. He is more than willing to meet outside of class to help you and work individually with you.

1,Lectures twice a week that were recordings. quiz once a week. I miss the majority of them because there was no actual class. She gave a poll todo class via recordings or zoom (videos won) if It were via zoom would have done better in the class.

0,Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,1.0,5.0,Christopher Wayne Purser
0,"Super nice, funny guy, but not good at lecturing. Examples given in class and in Sapling are WAY easier than exams. However, study the practice exams for a good idea of what to expect. WARNING! A lot of unseen problems pop up in every exam so there's a limit-unless you're really smart.",2.0,4.0,Dean Atkinson
0,"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",1.0,5.0,Howard Triplett
1,"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant professor. He is very down to earth, and is willing to help if you come by his office. He's a tough essay grader. However, if you take good notes and participate, an A isn't impossible.",3.5,2.0,Chester Fontenot

1,"He's a very strict grader and deducts any points as possible from the test and homework. He talks very low so make sure to sit in the front, if you have any questions he's willing to help. Besides that the class isn't as hard if you know what you learn in MATH 125.",3.0,4.0,Guo Jiao Liao

1,"He is on ANOTHER LEVEL, an enlightened way of thinking (big picture). Has his own way of teaching, but his exact words REALLY make sense. LISTEN to him!

Case law won't help.",4.0,3.0,Robert Bush
0,"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS.

1,"Rafferty is awesome!! Physics sucks but she makes it easy! Do the work and you'll do fine. She provides all the resources and practice you need and there's lots of practice problems in class.

1,There were a lot of test which is good but they were a lot of questions and people were often rushed. His grading policy is really harsh and the quizzes are due at weird times. Hes really funny but gets upset when people ask questions. Not very helpful if you dont understand the information,3.0,4.0,Ezell Allen
1,"Professor Leonard made the class as straight forward as you will find. Show up, read, and do the study guides and the tests should be a breeze. There are a lot of notes to write down but they are so helpful on the test. 90% of test questions are word for word on study guide.  As for lab, just show up and put in some effort and again you'll be fine.",5.0,3.0,Dana Leonard
1,"A kind, knowledgeable, phenomenal teacher.  I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious, engaging, and intelligent.  This class was so far from my major, and yet I enjoyed class everyday.  Study, its astronomy.  But Looney is fantastic.",4.0,4.0,Leslie Looney
0,"I like Coop as a person, but his lectures leave a lot to be desired. As an engineering student, I don't really care about the theory behind the math, I want to know how to do the problem and he wasn't very effective for that. Overall, wouldn't take him again.",2.0,4.0,Patrick Cooper

0,Talks about how much he cares for his students and wants to see you succeed... But in the same breath will disrespect you and make you feel dumb for asking a question. I've had him 3 times as a prof since I came to Humber and he's never changed. Good luck if you have him.,1.0,4.0,Shawn Richards
1,"One of my favorite professors here, she really cares about you being able to pass with a high grade, you have to show up though as she takes attendance and it will affect your grade if you don't show. lots of group work and makes you do ice breakers which actually helped in having the class speak instead of sitting there quietly. great teacher!",5.0,1.0,Leigh Bennett
1,"Hes not a bad professor, if you pay attention youll pass. If you participate youll get an A. My problem was with his lectures hes very encryptive.

0,"she set me up for failure, did not give grades back until the drop date, if you have a different opinion than her she will fail you, my whole class is basically failing now, have to meet outside of class and graded on it, have to come up with your own exam questions and even those are not good enough for her. exams have too much for the time period",1.0,5.0,Maureen Hawkins
1,Really knows what he's talking about but much better professor for a higher level class. Tests are really hard and require you memorize the content. Lectures are pretty standard. Knows a lot about research. Definitely stop by his office because it can clarify things that were hard to understand in lecture.,3.0,5.0,David Hollis
0,"The worst professor I've ever taken. Talks about herself, and is kind of rude to students. Forgets everything, sends assignment instructions out late, but still expects them to be due on their normal due dates. Doesn't teach anything. Don't take a class with her, ever.",1.0,1.0,Miranda Olzman

0,Not very good ,1.5,4.0,Martin Argerami
1,"Bertram is the most fast-paced a&p professor I've ever had. I've taken an a&p series before and this is one class you do NOT want to rush through. He barely goes into depth about anything so be prepared to study. He does give some EC though, but his tests are TOUGH and NOT what he lectures on - VERY detailed. He's pretty much all over the place.",3.0,4.0,Eric Bertram

1,Dr. Hargett is great! Expect 2 tests and a research paper that she gives you plenty of time to do. Interesting course and the reading is very life applicable. Quite a bit of discussions each week but it is engaging and relies on your perspective more than text. Great class!,5.0,2.0,Brenda Schildknecht-Hargett
1,"You will learn in this class, not just regurgitate historical facts from a textbook. But, this means it requires hard work. Hale has students read primary sources, examine artwork, listen to music, and discuss the time period being taught. His essay exams require you to think critically about historical events, forming and supporting an argument.",5.0,4.0,Brad Hale

0,A nice guy overall. He is easier to pass than most other NCSU profs bc he curves everything heavily. Grading is 95% from 5 exams. He does not indicate what will actually be important so you have to study everything and then might have several questions on info from one slide while entire chapter is ignored. Use outside resources and you'll be fine.,2.0,4.0,Phil Brown
1,"Professor Harvey was amazing. Due to the pandemic during the semester, we had to switch to the online class (both lab and lecture), but she tried to make everything easier for us (recording lectures, great workshops, and etc).she is very kind and caring. chem 102 is not an easy class, get ready to study, but Dr. Harvey helps you a lot.

Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,2.0,2.0,Kaz Okada
1,"He's a really interesting person and gives really interesting lectures. Makes good jokes, but its up to you whether that is worth the immense amount of reading you'll be doing. You have weekly readings and quizzes and you won't be able to make up one you missed. Make sure you take notes and don't be on your phone. He will call you out.",5.0,4.0,Falcon Milazzo
1,"Edward gives interesting and detailed lectures that I found entertaining and educational. He enjoys discussion, which represents a decent chunk of class time.

Asking how many pounds of meat/fish Fredrick Douglass was rationed is silly.",4.0,3.0,Edward Noel Smyth
1,"DON'T BUY THE TXTBOOK! he will talk to u about it on day 1. his lectures were fun and engaging, and it's an environment that supports participating and learning. only 3 tests (non-cumulative final) + project where you visit a school. it's not difficult if you study, reading/attending lectures will help. his study guides  the questions on the test",5.0,2.0,German Velasco
0,"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",2.0,2.0,George Konstantinos Kostopoulos
0,Professor Thompson will stand in the front of the class and brag that students averages 66 on his tests.

Except no one is laughing. Very sad to witness and pay for.,1.0,4.0,Andrew Thompson
0,"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all.

I would not take another of her classes again.",2.0,3.0,Erika Lytle
1,"I loved his class! From the beginning, he had the entire semester planned out start to finish. He was always sure to give great feedback, and was always nice to talk to as well.

Only a few papers and group discussion on one movie.,5.0,3.0,Iker Arranz

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",5.0,1.0,Temim Nusraty

1,"Prof Harding is like a ham and cheese sandwich. Very average. His lectures aren't the best ever, he does allow a bit of discussion to hold your attention. Most of your grade comes from two papers, two tests, and a big project. He grades decently easy, and may allow a chance to look at notes during the test. I would be willing to take him again.",3.0,3.0,Douglas Harding
1,"Professor Perez was one of my favorite professors yet. He is very passionate about teaching and does a good job at teaching. Only gives 1 midterm which is an essay, but he allows one notecard. The final is also an essay but does not allow a notecard. However, he gives prompts ahead of time. If you have a chance to take his Native American class!",5.0,3.0,Robert Perez
1,Dr. Norris is a super smart person. The exams are 13 questions but worth a lot and the study guide is all you need and they are mentioned throughout the lectures. It was a good class during covid too. Theres a lot of information to cover but the study guide narrows it down. Study the study guide and start early!!!,4.0,3.0,Brian Norris
1,"I'd recommend everyone who's going into medical or Biology field to take her class. Don't take it if you just need a science elective. I took 3 classes with her and I loved it!

1,"Tavss works at a faster pace than the other professors, but personally, I like  that he does that.

Just pay attention and go to office hours, they help!!",4.5,4.0,Ed Tavss
0,"I don't know if it was because we had to be online, but there was always tons of confusion in this class.

He didn't show up for class upwards of 5 times with no warning too.",1.0,5.0,Rachick Virabyan
1,"Man, his class was disappointing. He engaged the class pretty well at the beginning but lost it half way through.

Not the easiest way to learn, but definitely extremely rewarding.",5.0,3.0,Peter Gildenhuys
1,"This professor was an overall great professor. My only complaint was that this class was a flipped classroom style class.

1,"I want to love her, I really do. I can tell she cares about what she does , I appreciate that. However, the lectures are SO boring and she is the most disorganized professor I have ever had.

1,He's not as bad as some people say. Just get used to his style. Find his video-lectures on iTunesU - they were very helpful. Answering questions is not his strong suit - can't answer to the point.  But I like the way he structured his course although I had to either read the book or find some other learning materials and read after each lecture,3.0,4.0,Dionissios (Dennis) Karvelas
1,"Jana is amazing. If you are passionate about SW, you will love her. She is kind, attentive, personable, and helpful! She really knows what she is doing. She has been an adviser, teacher, and professional. Lots to learn from this woman and she will help you succeed if you work with her.",5.0,4.0,Jana Meinhold
1,"Microbiology is pretty easy to understand if you've done well in anatomy and keep up with the reading. The tests are pretty hard, but she allows notecards so she doesn't emphasis memorizing little details. She repeats the major concepts alot to make sure you get it.",4.0,3.0,A Bricker
1,"He was a great teacher. He is always willing to help students on homework problems before class. He does not have a deadline for homework, but I suggest to do homework every night in order to ask questions the next day before he begins a new lesson.",4.5,1.0,Travis Buck
1,"He gives assignments but they aren't graded. Instead, if you did all of the required problems, he counts the assignment as a number of extra credit points which are awarded to you on the unit test. Lectures are awesome! Tests are not over complicated and are a fair judge of your understanding of the material.",5.0,4.0,John Diamontopolous

1,"Prof Perez is one of the best professors I have taken in my college career. There are a total of One manual, One Tech Report, One Lab Report and a Group Project. He gives clear instructions on what he wants and if you dont understand he will explain it to you. If you ever get to take him for a class do it, you wont regret it.",5.0,1.0,Michael Perez
1,He makes frequent mistakes when teaching and often made it more confusing than it needed to be. The material wasn't extremely clear the first time he taught it but he always answers questions the students had. Once it was clear what to do then it was easy. He's pretty funny and I had a good time in the classes.,3.0,2.0,Clinton Hines

1,He's funny as hell and a real class act. Exams are really easy and his lectures are bearable. Go out of your way and get to know the guy if you have him online. He's great,5.0,3.0,Gary Bliss

0,"Took it online, the most work I (and the rest of the class) have ever done. Weekly, about 150 pages to read and an average 7 pages SINGLE-SPACED responses, on top of 4 projects. HORRIBLE grader. Completely not worth your time, effort, or GPA. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!",2.0,5.0,Carol Hart
1,He is a good professor but it is impossible to do all homework if you have a full time job and is a full time student. It is too much reading and home every single week. I would not take him again because I am a full time student and also work full time. Plus my major is in business and I dont need all this work for my future.,4.0,4.0,Linell Wisner
1,"Good at explaining things and teaching. But can be extremely difficult to deal with. She can be rude and unnecessarily sarcastic and negative. She gives fair grades, not too tough, but while her comments can be good, some are unnecessarily harsh and given in a un kind way.",3.0,3.0,Celia Young
1,"I struggled w/ Math my entire life until I took Prof. Ball. He's accessible & cares that you understand - allows you to ask all the questions you need answered. Absolutely the BEST math teacher I've taken in my life! He breaks it down until you comprehend the material & is patient with you but most importantly, will not judge you for not knowing.",5.0,4.0,Jonathan Ball

1,"This is the best teacher you could ask for. Yeah her exams were difficult, but everything was right in the notes. This professor really cares about the success of her students.",5.0,2.0,Heather Hug
1,At first I was super annoyed with her lectures it was super difficult to sit through 3 hours of lecture then be expected to practice what you were just shown-wore me out! But I stuck in there and if you put in the work and support what you don't understand with tutorials then you can get through it! In the end I learned a lot!,3.0,4.0,Clover Leary

1,"Le cours de Mme Promtep est très intéressant, j'avais toujours envie d'en apprendre plus. Elle m'a fortement inspirée à m'inscrire à la maîtrise en commerce électronique. De plus, elle est toujours disponible pour répondre à nos questions. Le projet final de son cours est pertinent, car il nous permet d'aider une entreprise de façon concrète.",5.0,2.0,Sandrine Promtep

0,"Laura seems like a nice person, but she is a horrible teacher. She thinks she's explaining things, but leaves the class confused on what's expected in homework or exams. She said it's not her fault (teaching style), but our learning style. She never releases the homework on time on Canvas, leaving students confused. I get As but not in this class.",1.0,5.0,Laura Ridenour
1,MacEwan is extremely lucky to have Claudine as she is simply the kindest and most caring instructor I have seen! She knows mental health incredibly well and you will certainly learn lots from her. She is very encouraging and helps ease the nervousness which is natural at the start. She will make sure you are safe and advocate for you!,5.0,3.0,Claudine Drefs

1,I really liked her class . I could tell she likes to teach. She sends out weekly announcements. The course is straightforward with about 12 quizzes and 1 tests online and 4 discussion papers. There is only one project to do which a lot of work,5.0,2.0,Urbi Ghosh
1,"Ms. Mahon is nothing but amazing. She is the instructor we all need to get through this difficult course. Shes knowledgeable, caring, strict, and still able to demonstrates empathy. Ms Mahon genuinely wants to see her students pass and she gives you everything you need to do so. She my top recommendation",5.0,3.0,Kirsten Mahon
