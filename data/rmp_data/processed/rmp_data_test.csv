I almost fail this class even I read whole textbook. very difficult. Not recommend,0
"Patrick Cooper's lectures are extremely hard to understand. He spends the majority of the time standing in from of the board blocking his work. He lost three of my quizzes, and our average was very, very low. I have spent the entirety of the semester teaching myself the material.  STAY AWAY.",0
"Mary, while clearly a kind and smart person, assembles her courses from a collection of half-baked ideas for projects. If you want a rigorous geology class where you learn more than you could from reading a few Wikipedia pages, Mary is not for you.",0
My man. Best math prof.,1
"LOVE PROFESSOR OAKLEY OMG. Literally the nicest professor at UD, she's just like a mom. She understands most students who take her class are not GEO majors. She has power points which she explains well & also puts online. Her exams are online but the essays are written. There's no homework besides these models u can do for extra credit. TAKE HER!",1
"May seem nice at first and then you realize that she only wants you to agree with her when she poses a in class discussion question, and can in fact be quite rude to students! I felt like she was a bit bias and unprofessional at times. Don't really recommend this class or prof if you don't like how profs are vague when they give a lecture.",0
"Great professor, make sure to pay attention and participate. No nonsense type of person. Textbooks are a must have. Do the homework  and be very respectful. If he feels disrespected he will retaliate in a cunning way. If you're a ""good student"" he might bump you up from a B+ to an A.",1
"Prof Gutteridge is 'old school', believing university's purpose is the exchange of ideas, not a commodity to help you get a job. He re-ignited my faith in education and interest in literature. Not afraid to set high standards for attendance, note-taking, and original thinking. UFV is lucky to have him on their faculty.",1
"As much as taking this class sucked in the moment, I'm so glad I took her class! I'm now in math 20 and for once in my life math is making sense because she gave me a solid foundation for math. She makes you work hard, but it's so worth it. Do her extra credit if you can, participate, ask questions, go to office hours. The hard work is worth it!",1
"He was an incredible teacher to have my freshman year. I go to his office hours and he has helped me write different applications. He is a great rescource to have and is passionate about his students. W103 is mostly with graduate students, but his lectures were always entertaining!",1
Prof. Ochs runs a fairly simple class. You have a reading assigned for every class and she gives you notes on the reading during class. Actually doing the readings is not all that mandatory. Showing up to class also isn't mandatory but the class becomes a lot harder if you don't because you really need the notes to do all the writing assignments.,1
Worst prof ever.,0
"Stay away from this ""instructor"". Make yourself a favor.",0
"Dr. Mahlingappa is my favorite professor. She is really kind, she always listens to students, and is ready to help. Her classes were really engaging and interesting. She is also an amazing advisor!",1
One of the most confusing classes i've ever had. all the students would email him asking what the requirements were on an assignment - and instead of making a public announcement to EVERYONE - he individually replies only if you ask him? I wish i had chosen a different prof to take online because this was confusing and POORLY ORGANIZED,0
Hali was by far the best professor I've ever had. She cares about her students and you can tell she really enjoys what she's teaching! If you ever have a chance to take a class of hers I would highly recommend,1
"If you're interested in astronomy, this is a wonderful class. While some weeks do have a lot of assignments (I'd warn against taking this as an accelerated course), the professor is always available to help with questions and is very forgiving on assignments so long as you put in the work. If you need a science class, definitely take this one!",1
"Dr. Prasad is the best! If you work hard, she wants you to succeed in the class! Would definitely recommend her",1
long and boring course,0
"Knoop was difficult at best.  If you have a difficult time getting long with her it will be reflected in your grades.  She will even admit if she doesn't like you she's harder on you.  Following along in class is difficult, expect to run off topic at least three times a class. Her knowledge of the industry is dated at best.",0
I took this class as one of my English program requirements and I want to take the rest of my classes with him. We only had two papers for the quarter and a small midterm paper. It is easy to get by doing just the reading for your essay and he is very helpful in giving you feedback before you turn in your paper.,1
"I do not reccomend taking her, she never knows where you are at in the class / grades, test are at a doctors level since she use to be a doctor  she expects you know everything right away. Does not go in order, make sense, and like no extra credit. Your grade is pretty much on your tests & our class averages were never over a 60%! Good luck",0
"You will pass easily if you attend and do the work on time. Grading was fair. She gave good feedback, and had a couple of model papers posted which gave me a good idea of what to do. Don't forget things and make sure to turn in things on time. You do have to take the time to understand the course organization.",1
Arnold is an enthusiastic lecturer and by far the most interesting. I learned so much about teaching Science and feel more prepared than before. She was great and funny but was a hard grader on random errors and often had extensive assignments. If she recognizes this flaw our grades could be more reflective of who we are as competent candidates.,1
"LOVE HIM! Is passionate about the material, and the weekly quizzes were a great way to boost marks. His lectures are easy to understand and he is very accessible if you have questions and concerns. I would recommend this class to anyone even if you are just taking it to fulfil a core.",1
"Excellent teacher. Very organized, funny and interesting. You will learn in this class, but your grade will not be handed to you. If you attend class and apply yourself you will enjoy this class.",1
"Gets off topic too much, rarely discusses the book, no test review. Hard to pass when we do zero book discussion and watch videos. Cool person but not a quality teacher",0
"Bar none the worst professor I've ever had.  He repeats the same stories over and over again and his exams don't reflect anything that hes taught in class.  Be prepared to teach yourself anything that you need to know from his classes, because he sure as heck isn't gonna teach it.",0
Takes weeks to go over one chapter then when its time from an exam he crams things and tells your read the textbook. dont take his class,0
Postmodern Film and Literature is in my top three classes and Dr. Curry is in a Tie for my favoirte professor of all time. She is extremely intelligent and inspires intelligent thought.,1
"Worst prof I've ever had.  Made our entire class redo an assignment because he said none of us did it correctly, failing to realize he clearly is not good at communicating what he wants.  Quite harsh as well in his criticisms and expects you to do a LOT of work per assignment.  Tough marker as well.  Avoid this class if possible!",0
"Howell expects a lot of work for a one unit course. He isn't very helpful and gets fairly hostile when irritated. Most of your grade is from lab reports, which are quite long (expect to spend several hours per week writing these up) and minor mistakes will lose you a lot of points. The tests are easy but don't make up much of your grade.",0
Dana is on of the greatest teachers ever. She makes the class so much fun and she is very supportive with everything you do. She takes time to help you with no matter what your question is or what you're having trouble with. She's very funny and just an overall kind hearted person. As long as you show up and do your homework you'll love it!,1
"Since this is an online class, the large amount of reading and discussion posts were expected, however, I did not expect to receive low marks on every discussion post. On every post she comments for me to ""watch my grammar"" but fails to give clear examples. Her expectations seem so high that they are unreachable. 0/10",0
"Condescending, stammering, not interested in discussion or alternative viewpoints...kind of a jerk sometimes. Says the word ""uh"" about five times in every sentence, making him difficult to listen to for more than a few minutes. I will avoid taking any other class with him.",0
"Wow. Where do I start? This is the best Professor I have ever had in the history of my college career. He is sweet, caring, passionate, engaging, accessible, adaptable, and overall awesome!!!!!! I 10000000% recommend you to take ANY course given by this professor. He genuinely cares about you and your success in his class. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!",1
"Lab quizzes every week, have to know your stuff. Got to his office hours before quizzes also two lab reports, go to him for him to go over what he wants and go through your paper before its due. there are short presentations you do with your lab partner for extra credit",1
1. You can't understand him 2. He is picky on how you write your essay questions on the test 3. Will turn your paper down if it isn't a full 2 pages 4. You cant read his hand writing 5. We will let you retake your test but he huffs and puffs about it This is a 5 step warning you that if you take this class you will be miserable. MISERABLE!,0
His exam reviews are not helpful at all.  Yes there are only three test but there are so much information on those test they will drive you nuts. you expects you to know a lot of the stuff he is suppose to teach you.  If you need this class and there are other teachers teaching it I would try one of them.,0
You are supposed to be in class and if you miss too much she will report it but your camera doesnt need to be on and you dont need to talk so you can just mute her if you want. Lectures make NO SENSE! But you can find everything you need on Quizlet. Shes nice but is not a good teacher. I do not recommend!,0
"Qaiser Imam is the complete opposite of a good professor. Throughout the entirety of the semester, I was struggling with staying up through his boring lectures. His teaching style was very bland and when I tried to access him outside of class, he wasn't much help to me. I had to use the textbook to learn the material and only then did I do good.",0
Sweet guy,1
"Dr. Cote's the worst professor I've ever had. She's arrogant, rude, and a horrible teacher. She just reads off her slides and does NOT engage with the class. She gives problem sets as homework but never goes over them. Be prepared to spend hours teaching yourself EVERYTHING. WPUNJ should fire her, as she puts the school down in every lecture.",0
Nice guy but an awful teacher. Going to class is a huge waste of time considering he doesn't take attendance and all he does is read from the powerpoints. Half the time it seems like he hardly even knows what he himself is talking about. Very unclear when explaining concepts. Practice problems are rare which makes the tests even harder.,0
"Highly recommend for STAT 305. Weekly homework that isn't too bad. Gives out example quizzes that are very similar to the actual quiz. I really enjoy his voice during lecture, very clear and he always seems like he's in a good mood.",1
"Funny as all get out and even gives personal testimony to help you remember things. However, Extremely tough and strict.",0
"The way homework is setup is awful, if you get a question right then try another one for practice it take's away from your hw grade. The hw also is graded week of unlike better professors that let it all be open till the end of the course. Instead of using the regular software for test he make's you use zoom so he can watch you which is odd.",0
"He is a smart man he just needs to stop speaking down to his students, this is not elementary school we will be fine with it being said once not three times the same thing at once.",0
"A very nice man but a terrible teacher. I made an A and was exempt from the final in another span1411, in his span 1412 he expected us to already know past tense and other verbs we hadn't learned in 1411. He was very disorganized and unclear with assignments. I ended up dropping the class and suggest that if you don't know Spanish to do the same.",0
"This professor is very emotionally driven, thus unapproachable. She assigns readings for every class of about 20-35 pages; two readings on the days after a weekend (because ""you have more time to read""). Lectures are useless and not posted online. She flies by them, so type fast. Quizzes are the bulk your grade. Avoid at all costs.",0
"He is very confusing and talks way too fast. When you ask him a question about the material, he laughs at you and won't explain it. His tests were pretty easy if you understand the material. He's not very friendly either, I felt like I couldn't go talk to him during his office hours. ",0
"She might be a good therapist , but a horrible educator . One of my worst professor forever",0
Does not answer emails. Late grader. Not a good professor.,0
"She is a caring person, but communication on projects and assignments were not clearly stated. CIS 280 is more of a independent learning class than teacher led so get ready to do all the excels by yourself and only a few walkthrough tutorials with her. I do still recommend her for this course, but make sure to stay on top of classwork.",1
"I do appreciate how he has great experience in international business, and it shows, but that's all he talks about. Himself. The stories are real world applications and that's great, but when it comes to midterm and final time, you have to teach yourself everything he did not have time to cover as he talked about himself all class.",0
Don't take his online class. He takes forever to put in grades. The only grades you have are journals and exams which are both worth 5o points each. He grades really hard and he gives no feedback about how you can do better the next time.,0
"Very lenient professor & Caring. She is an EASY A Literally! There is no way anyone can fail her class, she makes it too easy for everyone. There are only 5 assignments, no textbooks, no PowerPoint, just a lecture and some articles or videos and then answering the questions for each assignment in an essay. But not as quick to respond to emails.",1
"Unless you are familiar with complicated high level mathematics, do not take financial economics. Math skills aquired solely from economics courses will not be helpful at all in this course.",0
"Loved watching his lectures, it's easy to see he enjoys the subject. Be careful not to fall behind on lectures because there's a lot of material to cover. He does curve the lectures, which is really helpful. The discussion material is always interesting, real life applications of the current topic which was nice. Loved the class, great prof.",1
"Daily class work worth points (also her attendance) and a few ""labs"" outside of class that is just homework. Only need the course reader textbook, we NEVER used the straightforward statistics textbook. You can use a cheat cheat on the final BUT the final is worth 50% of your grade. But all you need on final is basically just the SPSS instructions",1
"She was fun, tried to relate to the students a lot which can be annoying but it made the class less intense. Homework wasn't excessive or overwhelming. Good teacher overall. Worked with the student well.",1
"Thought having an online class the professor wouldn't matter b/c you teach yourself, but I have never had a more unclear, rude, demeaning professor in my life. Unclear grading along with the worst feedback and no room to do better unless you harass her with emails asking what you did wrong and how to improve and she replies so nasty 5 days later.",0
"Anyone who likes this guy has actual Stockholm syndrome. He doesnt teach a single thing in class and then expects PHD level work. His formula is simple: show up, make some jokes, give a vague, disorganized, unhelpful lecture and then basically ask you to build Google. He is also incredibly rude and lacks basic social skills and manners. Worst prof",0
"The professor doesn't respond in a timely manner. She doesn't check the answers on her exams, there were 5 wrong answers on our midterm (unable to determine if there were any wrong answers on the final). She is laid back in class but a tough grader. You must read the book and come to class if you want to pass. Shows up late often",0
"I would highly recommend you not take this course if youre an undergrad student because its essentially a graduate course, and you will be graded as such. There are no exact instructions, and I was confused about most of the system. It isnt easy and I expected this to be a course that I would enjoy",0
Dr. Kennedy is a chemistry nerd more so than a teacher. He sometimes expects you to understand things as easily as he does or thinks you should. He is a really nice guy and fair grader.,1
You need an 87% average on the three tests to be able to skip the final; he boasts that he'll show you the final beforehand and you'll still fail. There is a financial analysis project done over the course of the semester and he is very unclear in his expectations. He also goes over the material incredibly quickly so get ready to frantically write.,0
"Boring teacher, likes to fail students.",0
"Professor Gibson is incredible ! a few homework assignments , a bibliography and a research paper. She wants her students to pass and enjoy writing papers. She is very passionate about writing. Always keeps her students engaged. I loved her class please take her !!!",1
"Clear and concise on what is expected. Easy to get help if needed; if you show that you care then he will do everything he can to help you. I took him for OS theory and decided to take him again for Software Engineering since I knew what to expect. If you come to class and participate from time to time, there's no reason you won't get a B or higher",1
Amazing teacher and class! Attendance is not taken but her lectures are very interesting and useful for test. Three online exams that were fairly easy if you attended classes and took notes. She cares so much about the material and makes it an enjoyable and easy class. Would strongly recommend!,1
"I'm telling you now, never write about abortion and race. Dr. Kelly is very opinionated. You know how most teacher are paid to grade you on content, well she doesn't do that. If you write about something she doesn't like, don't be surprised if she argues with you in a conference and gives you a C because you dont feel the same way. DONT TAKE HER",0
Great guy and prof. Macro is hard but he makes it come to life. Offers extra credit where up to 4% of your final overall grade can be boosted. Get ready for more coffee analogies than you thought were possible. Would highly recommend,1
"His lectures are interesting and easy to follow, he's very clear about the material that will be on the tests, and offers extra credit for the final.  As long as you do all the homeworks and study the stuff he tells you for the tests you should be fine, but the class itself is not an easy A",1
"When you take Honors 210 do yourself a favor and do not take White's & Ritzenhoff's section. Before, this class was only taught by Ritzenhoff, which everyone said was fun. This was the first year with White & she was awful. Gives no assignment guidelines, not available for help with assignments, and then has audacity to tell you not to worry Awful",0
"This is an online students worst nightmare. Avoid this professor if you can. The GEOL 100 is more difficult than the 300 level courses Im currently taking. Concepts from the book dont match whats on the test, the lab made me feel like a 2nd grader, everything is locked until the week its due, and if you use the Calendar, you will miss some things.",0
This guy talkes in circles! If you're used to a teahcer who spells it out- he doesn't. Class is actually about sex in bible and other works. VERY boring-most ppl sleep or don't show up. Option to do papers or midterm & final. Mini translation quizes in mid eng. Don't know how you're doing- hands back everything weeks later than when you did it.,0
"This teacher can, and most likely will, drive you up a wall if you actually want to learn. He goes WAY off topic when lecturing (his stories are either funny, weird, or just annoying). His grading is fine and the essays are basic, time consuming assignments. It's simple to pass his class especially if you do his many extra credit assignments.",0
"Georgi isn't as bad as everyone says, however he's not that great. His exams really test your knowledge and he is prone to making mistakes in the answer keys and in grading. If you have any questions, however, he will do his best to answer them High grades in his classes are very attainable.",0
"Prof. Yelleswarapu is amongst the best professors at UMB. He's brilliant, inquisitive, genuine, and personable as hell. He is an accomplished researcher, yet he does not brush off education; his ethic dictates that the most important part of teaching is to actually help students learn. He's quick to respond, tough as nails, and beyond approachable.",1
"You have no idea what your grade is the entire semester. The class is pretty fast paced and gets a little bit difficult.    Dr. Matera is extremely nice, but make sure you attend class everyday! There are pop quizzes.",1
No for this professor.,0
"Make sure not to turn in assignments late, he's very tranquil, just do the work and you'll pass with an A - C (depending on your writing skills).",1
"This guy is great. He is kind and willing to help. His accent is pretty strong, but it's okay because it's funny when he says ""disks."" The class is really easy but it's also interesting. Lenient with lab work and homework is online.",1
"This professor is horrendous. I emailed him and messaged him through canvas multiple times and did not receive a single response throughout the entire quarter. Course load was ridiculous, spent at least 4 hours a day on this class to keep a 4.0. He would 100% be unemployed if his wife was not head of the Psychology department. Avoid at all costs.",0
I usually try not to judge professors because I know they have other classes but I couldnt let this one go. Shes very unorganized and does not give back your work until the very last minute. Our class didnt find out our grades until the week before the final and it was too late to drop. Do not take.,0
"The difficulty level in this class skyrockets after the first midterm. You will be quickly overwhelmed if you start to slack off in this class when you start getting into the semester project. Midterm was easy, final was extremely difficult.",1
"Before this class I was always an A&B student. This class I received a C!!! If the average grade for the exams are 60-70, then its definitely not the student it is the teacher! He is a passionate professor and I get where he is coming from, but a little understanding goes a long way.",0
"He is obviously a very intelligent man and very into what he is teaching. But he is very unclear with his writing assignments. His final was ridiculous. He gives you A LOT of reading assignments and lecture is very extensive--almost a ramble some days. I feel like this class was a big game to him. Seriously, just sit home and play uno instead.",0
Professor Fultz's class was exceptionally great! I recommend taking his class.,1
"If you want to keep a healthy state of mind, stay away from him. he expect you to know everything. in class very easy examples to solve, on the test, nothing similar to the lecture.",0
"One of the best professors Ive had. I had her at Epcc and loved every class. Shes compassionate and caring, willing to work with you. Not a stressful class. She knows how to laugh, isnt tough like a lot of other professors.",1
I'm currently in this class and it was a big mistake. Teacher goes off topic the whole time. At first its funny but it gets uncomfortable. Have no idea how the exam is going to go and i find learning in this class is difficult to grasp because there is not much emphasis on it. Please do not take this class. Learn elsewhere.,0
She is very uptight and does not know how to talk and understand students. She knows the material but ends up giving only lectures. Never leaves room for interpretation and is very rude with her answers.,0
"Mr. Rusch is an awesome instructor, and cares very deeply about giving quality instruction to all students.  His advice and technical expertise is top notch and relevant to design and engineering fields.  Also very humorous!",1
"He's a cool guy, I'll give him that much, but he just isn't the best teacher. He gets distracted a lot. He also doesn't explain the criteria for assignments very well or clearly. He didn't seem to be that concerned with helping out his students, you had to hunt him down if you really needed help. Overall not a horrible prof, but not great either.",0
I learned some helpful information in this class but I could have googled how to be a director and received the same level of education.,0
"Really great professor, one of my favourites. You print out his notes from the D2L page, and you write answers and notes on them in class. Amazingly simple format, I do wonder why I haven't seen other profs do it. Go to class. You actually do stuff, and it helps a lot. He also gave old midterms to study with. Would take again in a second",1
Professor Martin is amazing! He is easy going and also easy to come to with issues. There is group work and he is always willing to help you ask answer questions. He is all about learning and growing in his class. Definitely buy and read the textbook,1
literally never went to this class and i got a B+. she's very nice,1
"Mr. Fu makes every effort to ensure his students are understanding the material being taught, even circling the room to answer questions.  He is very knowledgeable and shares his experience.  A bit old school though, so if your going to think outside of the box do it in someone else's class, it will not be appreciated here.",1
"TAKE EVERY CLASS YOU CAN WITH DR. HAUCK! He made genetics so fun and interesting. You cannot go wrong with him. You definitely still have to work for his class, it is not an easy A, but still very attainable. He tells you up front everything that you need to get a good grade, and if you do just that you cannot do bad.",1
"Absolutely loved her!! I highly recommend her classes! I took the six week summer course which is a lot of work at once, but once it's over, it's over.  Quizzes every day, but they are very helpful for the tests, and not all are counted.",1
"Professor Caldwell is a brilliant guy but a really poor teacher. Does not give prompts for essays (briefly describes them in class) then proceeds to dock you despite never giving you any direction. He also interrupts students all the time, so there is no reason to participate in class. Avoid this guy if you want an A.",0
"Andrew was one of my favourite profs. While he makes you work for your mark and is a tough grader, he made me a better English student and writer. He was very easy to get ahold of, he gives the class his cellphone number and is willing to answer questions at anytime.",1
Matthew Vitz made class pass in no time he's great lecturer. He has key terms as his lecture outline and the notes that follow are at the students' discretion to write. This is important as his exams are on such key terms that will need to be explained through readings. He gives a study guide and it is easy to manage the work. Overall pay attention,1
"Emari is the BEST professor. Her assignments are challenging at times, but they always proved to be rewarding. She makes the classroom a fun place to be and she really loves what she does. She has a strong connection with her students and is always there for them no matter what.",1
"I made a mistake an skipped two sessions of his lectures and had such a hard time with an assignment. That was when I found out such an amazing teacher, Professor Hasheminia is. In order to do good in his class, YOU MUST attend all lectures. DS412 is a hard class and Prof. Hasheminia makes it simple. I'll definitely take more classes with him.",1
"Disregard your textbook.  Bailey tests purely from his notes and what was said (or what he thinks he said) in class.  If you study from his notes, your test scores should be adequate.  He prides himself on his small pass rate.  My class started with approx. 24 students.  We ended with 9 students.",0
"He is NOT a hard professor. Every test comes directly from the notes. If you look over your notes at least once, you are going to get an A. He also is more than willing to repeat himself or further explain a slide if it is unclear to you. I highly recommend him.",1
"He makes it difficult for a general ed course. He gives random pop quizzes a midterm and 4 to 5 speeches I believe. If you want to major in Coms take his course, if you just need the class as a requirement or transfer, look else where. Im doing fantastic in Organic Chemistry and was struggling in his class if that provides any sort of refrence",1
"Worst professor I've ever taken. You have to know the material before signing up for his class. He is super rude and confrontational. Never explains clearly, and gets upset when questions are asked. Makes mistakes on board. There is no consistency in his class with how he wants problems worked. He is just overall unorganized and plain rude.",0
"You do not learn much in her class. She is a bad teacher. She lectures very little and the class structure is very disorganized. She knows the info but does not transmitted well to students. She does not know how to teach. This is a self-taught class. At least, she is very easy and her tests are very short. Most of the class is just busy work.",0
So nice and friendly. I hope she teaches other classes I need.,1
Talks about how much he cares for his students and wants to see you succeed... But in the same breath will disrespect you and make you feel dumb for asking a question. I've had him 3 times as a prof since I came to Humber and he's never changed. Good luck if you have him.,0
Seriously one of the best teachers I've had so far. Keeps everyone engaged in the class by calling random people to answer questions. Only 3 exams.,1
Great professor but the exams were not easy. You have to study and he does not accept late homework.,1
"This is a case of a guy that thinks he is good and that he knows stuff. Yet, once you finish your degree you realize that he was one of these profs that have done very little in their academic life and they just put up a big act. Pathetic!",0
Not clear on grading and basically impossible to get an A. You can follow feedback after feedback and never be given higher than a B unless she likes you. For our final project she didn't have any feedback and nobody got more than a low A no matter what. Seems impossible to please.,0
She gets off topic a lot which causes class to be behind frequently and you must catch yourself up. Easy to follow but tests do get harder as class goes on. No homework besides a group assignment at end of semester. Easily accessible outside of class by email or office hours. Very friendly and understanding.,1
"This class is intellectually demeaning and should not be required. I have learned absolutely nothing that I did not already learn in high school or in my other intro-level SPEA classes. The course is only challenging in the sense there are so many small, petty assignments that are easy to forget and honestly taking them is offensive as a student.",0
"I LOVE k. moss...I hope I can take her again for..anything! Easily my favorite teacher. She is very crystal clear, has a phd, but doesnt make you bring the dictionary, like Holling. Speaks to you as if you are an actual intelligent person, not to mention her classes are fun! Take her for a refreshing, fun, A class!",1
"She is a great professor, very helpful and you will do great in her class, I had A in my NP4.I love Ms Viszt",1
"McMahon is hilarious and is very caring. He made the most out of online class by making it easy and straightforward for students. Be prepared to participate in class! His quizzes are fairly easy. There is one group presentation, a final, and an individual paper. He is probably the best psychology teacher there is at La Verne!",1
"A very bad professor. Slides, examples and explanations are ripped from the book and is incredibly rude to students in her class. Does not follow schedule, no syllabus given and exams/quizzes are not like the homework. Be prepared to the course coordinator or student advocate",0
"Denise Preston is a really nice and caring person. She kinda goes over the basics in class that I knew in high school and builds upon them. If you thought you were a good writer, think again. Denise Preston will take the time to look at your paper and give good feedback on how to revive it.",1
He is a nice professor who cares for his students. I would take more classes with him if i have the chance to.,1
"Garrigans class was heavily a lecture class. There are only 3 exams (that are each worth 25% of your grade) and 3 writing assignment (each 5%). So basically if you dont do well on one of the exams youre screwed. I find his grading system to be unfair, considering not all students test well. Bottom line, I wouldnt recommend taking his class.",0
"He doesn't give any time in class for lab, even though there states that there is a time designated for lab. He just breezes through the lecture and expects you to be good with the coding. Doesn't teach coding at all, and expects you to do the labs on your own. There are 4 labs, and one final exam and no homework.",0
"Denise is very passive-aggressive. When she doesn't like something, instead of talking to you about it, she gets serious and rude. She gives a lot of criticism but never any praise. She expects you to be perfect at all that you do, and she says she's willing to help if you need it, but she never replies to her emails or texts. Contradictive :-/",0
"Great Professor, he stays engaged with the weekly conferences and replies to emails timely.",1
"This is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is a great teacher and really makes you understand the topic. Didn't read a single chapter of the book and passed the class easily. Take her,she is awesome!",1
"Her tests are WAY hard.  I have her for 132 and I believe it is her first year teaching this.  Very nice teacher but I feel unprepared for her tests.  Lots of notes are given, but tests are more application then anything.  BRING A RECORDER. Notes overlap alot, and she hardly brings discussions down to student level.  Very technical.",0
"I've been out of the program of years, but have found many useful gems from Arnold's class",1
"He told me that ""since I was not a chemistry major, I don't need to pass his class"" and was not very helpful during lecture or office hours. You can tell he knows what he's talking abt but has a hard time relaying it, MAYBE would have been good if I had a strong chem background. But not very ""user friendly"" for an INTRO TO CHEM prof :(",0
"Pros, Easy class with little academic rigor, Say the right things with bare minimum deliverables will result in an A unless you openly disagree with her. Cons, Little academic rigor, Slow to respond to email, Can be extremely rude to paying students.",0
"He moved very slowly through the material and it could be dull at times. Going to class is optional however, half way through the semester, all students who were in class got a 2% bonus in their final grade.",0
i was scared to approach her in the class ... the course work was very heavy shes a nice professor but that class was not for me,0
"This professor actually believes you would be paid ""the big bucks"" to do complex calculations by hand. He assigns much more homework than other professors teaching the same class, however, he doesn't cover the material or work examples. Your only resource is the book and the lecture notes he posts. He provides a pdf book which saves money. Avoid",0
Gives homework on stuff he was not able to cover in class. Expects you to get 100% of homework done or he'll give you F on your midterm.  Dropped class & fighting to get my money back which is a pain with Delta.,0
What do you do after a political career? Teach at a college! This class will have you staring at the clock. The minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days. There are opportunities to meet members of the political community and the guest speakers are intriguing. Other than that it's an easy A without much learning. #whygottocollegeagain?,0
"Professor Sankara grades fairly.  He looks for improvement from the beginning of the class to the end.  I really found myself knowing the tenses we learned, and being able to apply them to my writing.  Professor Sankara is very passionate about the stories read in class, and goes through a lot to make sure you understand what happened in them.",1
"Dr Fitzpatrick goes over the material for way longer than he needs to, which can make his class boring sometimes. He is a good professor overall, and is very helpful outside of class. Don't buy the second book, you can easily find all the papers online. His grading is pretty fair; he gives the topics for the midterm and the final in advance.",1
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
"I really liked Steve personality wise, funny dude, pretty easy to get along with, total nerd, definitely likable. As far as the math goes, it was college level algebra, which is not a basic class, but it's not a really hard class, and I feel its a bit beneath him to teach it, so he teaches it that way and its not always easy to follow for some.",1
"Dr Chang teaches Probability Theory in a way that is plug chug. Does not go over the meaning of the topics in this course. Only shows how to compute Problems. The book chosen is a great book (Degroot), however, it can be hard to read at times. Due to Chang's teaching style, the proper book was not chosen. I will not be taking any courses with Chang",0
"Professor Lipson is the most disorganized professor I've had to date. He takes multiple weeks to get our exams back to us, and doesn't give us adequate time to study for the exams (ex: posted our study guide 2 days before the exam). He's a really sweet man and obviously cares, but is just flat out not a good professor.  He goes on and on in class.",1
"She has been by far my favorite professor since I've been in college. She made learning enjoyable and fun. Her exams were straight forward and came right from the notes. You have to attend class to be able to fill in the notes, however, she does not take attendance. Overall she's a wonderful professor!!",1
"He made the class simple and easy, he put out step by step videos for how to do the assignments and explained the material very well. Theres one group paper that you have to put together, and he gives specific feedback on all the drafts.",1
"Really great professor! Very passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject he teaches. A ton of reading, very important to come to class prepared & ready to participate. Participation is a huge % of grade. Great guy though, thought provoking lectures",1
"Kirby is a gentle old man who wants you to pass. Take MIS with him and not Angeles if you can. If you think you deserve a better grade on something, go see him and you will probably get extra marks. Pretty boring class and material, but he's a super easy marker and it's an easy A. Don't bother getting the textbook.",1
Great professor. He is very knowledgeable and fair grader.  I would recommend this course.,1
"Favorite Marketing professor-- clear expectations, and the information we take in is actually interesting and relevant. I usually have issues with professors that don't require books, but I don't in this case being that his lectures are factual and he also provides informative articles. Would definitely take again.",1
"I'm currently taking his class so I will update this later but, so far I hate this class! He uses the excuse of ""hating remote teaching"" to make his class asynchronous like if we don't hate it too. I submitted my work on time and he gave me a zero while I made sure I responded to all the questions he asked. Please Do Not Take This Class!",0
"Mr. Ortiz is a decent guy, his corny jokes will eventually start to grow on you but avoid at all cost! He expects you to know the information and goes very fast.  He doesn't explain this information in a helpful way. No curved grades and no answer sheet for the review. I wish I would've listened to these reviews.",0
"He is more than clear, giving insight from real world situations and examples. If you pass the class, you will definitely have a solid understanding of the material. The tests cover the basics and you better practice plenty of problems or you will stumble. Overall, one of the best professors Ive had so far.",1
"This was the hardest class I have ever taken! But taking it with Professor Crumpler made it slightly easier. His teaching isn't the best (needs to give more examples). That forced me to look for outside resources. It was insanely crazy, watching tons of youtube videos to teach myself. It was a good learning experience though. Workshop required/wk.",1
She is very nice and makes you work hard on project but helps you a lot. Overall she is very good grader.,1
"I had Maril for modern social problems and enjoyed the class. Class is lecture based but as long as you take notes on what he says you will be fine. Tests are pretty common sense. You also watch a couple movies in there as well.I would not miss class if possible because the notes from each day are important. Heavy reading,pretty interesting class.",1
"Ms Mahon is the most amazing professor you could ever hope to get! She is genuine, and works to make sure everyone is on the same page. If anyone came to her with an issue or suggestion, she worked with them, never shut anyone down or had an attitude. If you can get in her class you need to take it! She changed my perspective on education. The BEST",1
Took her 6 week course online & do not recommend for business majors. A lot of work and sometimes would test you on things that werent explain on lectures! Lectures are also long & often gives unnecessary assignments that pile on hw. She does put a lot of time and effort into her lectures but would only recommend this class if you are a Econ major,1
"I hate biology, but I really enjoyed this course! Maher is a great professor, and you can tell he's passionate about what he is teaching. Will go out of his way to explain things further during class to make sure you understand the concept. Very nice. Gives extra credit in the form of a question during class, so make sure you always go!",1
"This man is a real gem, one of the few professors I've had who truly cares about his students and their education. His lectures are great, but he really shines when you visit him outside of class, which there really isn't an excuse NOT to do since he has walk-in office hours pretty much all day during the week and even occasionally on the weekends!",1
He has an interesting character. Very friendly but double faced. Likes nice chicks too and his face gets brighter when nice girl is in the class. He has a 10 point question aka chopping machine where he violates your grades. He doesn't have idea or computer skills. Not able to communicate on D2L and has an arrogant- smart attitude. Do not take him,0
"Wastes 20min each class begging students to speak. Makes you feel like an incompetent idiot when you ask him any questions, so unapproachable. Wants YOU to teach HIM ??? Final exam 100 MC, worth 25% covering things he NEVER discussed. Doesn't use Sakai and grades on ABC scale not in % so you don't know your grade all semester. Take someone else!!!!",0
She doesn't try to work with you. She has extremely high expectations of her students. I almost feel like she's setting us up for failure. Teaches pretty quickly and hates when you have a question. She also hates repeating herself. I highly suggest you not take her class.,0
Nice teacher,1
"She's such a cool teacher. I have her this semester, and her class is my favorite out of all my classes. You definitely learn a lot and it's interesting. Also, I find her SO attractive. Her intelligence and beauty can be pretty mind blowing. YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST TAKE HER CLASS!",1
"Lynn was my favorite teacher, she is wonderful, caring, supper helpful and always willing to help out no matter how long it takes. She does mess up once in a while, she has her reasons but she deserves such respect, as should all professors. Her class is simple and I enjoyed going to her class everyday. She is now a close friend of mine. (:",1
"I took the 8-week online course and wow. If you don't pick up concepts quickly or if math does not come easy for you, I suggest taking the full semester or another professor. There were no lectures, just textbook and videos from the textbook/WebAssign. The amount of homework was almost comical, totaling close to 1000 math problems for 8 weeks.",0
"Not good. Doesnt explain material very well, gets confused by the information himself. Doesnt do enough examples and usually stands there and points at the power point. Only uses mymathlab ppts. to teach. Tests are the majority of the grade, there's only 3. MyMathLab assignments barely count toward your grade, so if youre a bad test taker, beware.",0
"Dr. Currier takes a difficult and intimidating-sounding class and makes it into something fun. I had absolutely zero interest in Microbiology prior to her class and am now planning on pursuing a Bachelors in the same subject. Also, I would take her for lab too, the best Micro teacher you will find.",1
"He is really nice and loves his subject. He tries to make class fun and is always making jokes. He is tough when it comes to grading papers but you only have to write two. His tests are pretty easy, you get a cheat sheet, but they are all short answer.",1
Gives you quizzes on things you didn't learn and grades them really hard. She's terrible please don't take her this is the biggest waste of a class i've ever taken. The class is 3 hours long and she barely gives you a 5 minute break and gets off topic onto the worst tangents then blames students for not knowing material. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!,0
"Professor Eda Persampieri cares about her students. It is an easy A if you show up, complete your homework, and her two projects. There is a individual project, and a group project which is 60% of your grade combined. Her lectures are easy to understand, and she offers extra credit and her homework is mostly based on a textbook chapter.",1
Only he does is reading reading off powerpoint and play youtube videos,0
"I recommend this for your CGS teacher. He is really chill and a kind-hearted teacher, who lets you do your own work at your pace. plus he gives lots of extra credit and lets you use your notes on the five exams. P.S whenever you take the practice exam, use the questions and answers as notes because those are always on the exam.",1
"The online class is very reasonable and interesting, you read the chapter take the test (short answer essay style) and the final is a paper. Very maintainable but its not a piece of cake, this is college so you want to think critically and apply your knowledge to the papers. Great, caring professor, I strongly recommend even if youre not art major!",1
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
"I took Prof Ryan for a 7 AM 4 day Winter Physio class and it was a lot eaiser than I expected. The lectures were long, but informative, and everything he tested on was from his lectures and some from the free textbook's chapter review questions. He's a super chill guy and has an upbeat voice to keep you awake. Take him and do your work, youll pass!",1
"Absolutely love Ryburn, she is super sweet and cares for everyone. She is super easy to reach and provides amazing resources to help you succeed. Take her! Thought I was gonna end up with a B and pulled an A towards the end.",1
Very hard teacher with tests that are much harder.,0
"Loses temper easily. Even if you have an excused absence, he will get annoyed and will not let you make up work. My friend told him weeks prior that she had a surgery and he said that was too early to tell THEN later told her if she doesn't take it on the day she was planning on leaving that she will get a letter grade off. Nice guy, rude prof.",0
"Easy (A) class, but he singles people out and attacks them in personal ways, about inappropiate subjects. Not sure if he trying to be funny, or if he is on some sort of power trip? Take at your own risk!!!",0
"Super funny and interesting lecturer, went above and beyond conventional Shakespearean analysis and did really interests analysis through visual and political commentary lenses.",1
"The class wasn't organized at all. Discussions were largely unrewarding and boring. Few, if any, students knew when assignments were due because the syllabus had no relevant information. He made us travel to Orem by 8 am for the final, despite some of us working until 730 am and having no means of transportation. Orem's a 1.5 hour walk.",0
Professor Zweir is really nice and helpful but his exam are very hard. You will be expected to learn most thing on your own. You must be able to learn how to apply the knowledge on problem you have never seen before. But he does have easy problem on his exam as well,0
This teacher isn't the best teacher to take a class with. He has a very thick accent that you can't understand what he's saying at all. He does however doesn't give you a lot of homework but you won't understand how he grades. You have to purchase his book that he made because there's a code in the book to access your homework and it's hard to read,0
"Amy is a great instructor, and the class is very easy. Weekly reading is required, and a small response. Open dialog in class, and lots of group discussion. If you don’t support liberal views on society this class is not for you. I have many conservative values, and most of the time did not enjoy the curriculum in class.",1
"Often gets off track with her lectures. Has course info in multiple different places that are not always aligned/updated. Moves WAY too fast on a minute-to-minute level, even for a review course - she'll sometimes wait two seconds (not an exaggeration) between an asking a question and asking if anyone has solved it. Take someone else's class.",0
Loved the professor and loved the class. He's always willing to offer help to his students throughout the class time and during office hours. Just a heads up that reading will exponentially help you get a good grade on exams so don't get behind! I went to all his office hours and got lots of help from him which really helped me excel in the class!,1
Literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Only grades exams. Doesn't speak the best English and you'll need a translator to understand him. I would not recommend him to anyone.,0
"In 4 years of undergrad and 2 years of grad school this was the worst class and worst professor I ever had. There is a text book, but he literally only uses the inside covers. Dropped the class, but it was mandatory and he was the only one to teach it.",0
"I took him last semester and although Micro was fairly tough for me, he makes it impossible to fail if you actually do the work. The slides are directly from the book and so boring, the tests are tough but he lets us take home and make up each exam for the extra points! He has a very dry sense of humor but I would totally take the class again!",1
My OG,1
"Dr. Johansen is the epitome of a caring, and charismatic professor. She makes a Monday evening class something to look forward to. She truly demonstrates what true passion for teaching is. I am grateful and honored to have been in her class.",1
"He is one of the best teachers that has ever lived. He is extremely smart and makes you ""live"" his class with tons of simple daily examples to very hard concepts. He is a moving encycopedia. I, as a medical doctor now, will like to be like him one day. He is one of my professors that I will never forget. He taught me in 2004-2006.",1
"  Jade is very lost in her own little world. She expects you to understand her but has a huge communication problem. If you ask her questions she shoots them down and tries to make you look dumb. I've never had a worse professor and I hope the school does something about her. Most of my class mates had the same complaints, and most failed. ",0
"Professor Miller is a great professor for CHM 146. I really do not recommend Dr. Biegen because his lectures are boring but Professor Miller is an O.G. His labs are interesting and fun and he is one helpful dude! Even though I changed my major, I still loved taking this basic chemistry class with professor Miller",1
"Redding is an easy grader and gives lots of wiggle room for attendance and assignments. Tests are extremely easy, if you show up to lecture and do your homework youll pass. Redding is always reminding us to come to his office hours and is ready to help whenever we have problems. Great prof, easy class.",1
"Boring, difficult to listen to lectures. You have to write exactly what he wants for papers, or you miss massive points. Avoid if possible.",0
"Gray is like that grandma that you kinda avoid because she pinches your cheeks. If you don't show up to class (attendance stated not mandatory), you will miss the in class assignments and cant make them up. Her tests are easy if you glance at the power point, book, and highschool biology, Mid term is a take home test during spring break. Forum too.",0
"Love her! She made our extremely long classes fly by with her sense of humor, she had so many catch phrases that I still remember! Lot of tedious Cengage homework, but its an easy A towards your grade. Her slides are good, tests are manageable and she gives EC. Final is easy, and she even drops your lowest exam score. Would take her again 100%!",1
"He was not very receptive to opinions other than his own. He regularly talked over students when they expressed differing opinions and would devote entire class times to attempting to convince the class to agree with his opinion. Given this was an ethics class, which is inherently controversial, this was not ideal. Easy, though.",1
He will prepair u 4 the industry he knows his stuff,1
"Her micro class was the most frustrating college experience I've had so far. Her teaching style was just reading off of a power point, I didn't learn a thing during lectures, or in lab. The only way to survive this class is to memorize the textbook word for word. The tests were ridiculous as well. ",0
"I've never written one of these but Moss has inspired. She is the worst yet easiest teacher I have ever have. The entire semester she sat by her desk on her phone while her students argued amongst themselves about a project, just show up or not and you'll pass. She's very unorganized and assigned a paper worth 40% 3-5 pages 3 days before due",0
"Hey John Carroll, don't make a sociology professor teach a psychology class unless you want all the students to fail. Horrible teacher. Would not recommend. Tests are hard and so are the worksheets. Attendance not mandatory. Grade based on 4 tests. ",0
"If you enjoy reading, take this course. It is a book a week plus projects.",1
very unhelpful very rough grader dont take his class,0
pretty hard class if you don't study the powerpoint. Must do the homework and its due every week. Gets into world news a lot instead of actually talking about the subject. No extra credit and mandatory attendance. only 3 tests as well.,0
"I found her very unhelpful and unapproachable. The few times I interacted with her she was very unpleasant to deal with, and never fully answered my questions. She is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, but lacking the teaching skills. Would not recommend taking this class.",0
Hes a great professor to have. He listens to students needs. Hes flexible in working with you. Great feedback and conversationalist. When he teaches with passion upon the subject. He conveys the reading materials immensely well. He grades tough but also gives you a chance to better yourself and your grade with the extra credits he give.,1
"I would  NOT recommend this class to anyone. As a chemistry major I took  this as a general education social science. He does not post the power points online and expects reading between every class outside the textbook. Less than 10% of people get As on the exams, which is outrageous for a 100 level class. You are much better off taking Psych 101",0
Useless class full of busy work. Late grading.,0
"Prof Ball is a fun guy to listen to, but the structure of our class was very confusing. We had to email him nearly every week to clarify what was due and what his expectations were for the week because he released lots of conflicting information. He also made several assignments group work that would have been far simpler to complete individually.",0
"there are only 4 tests thats it. long sections for reading. i think that he might be a good teacher for higher level philosophy class, but for a GEP class he is horrible",0
He's really funny and interesting. He truly knows what he is talking about and he is organized in his lectures and topics. I didn't even sign up for this class willingly but I'm glad I took it because I learned a lot and he is a great professor.,1
The worst teacher I have ever had. I went to her on several occasions and she was rude and never helped,0
She is by far one of the worst teachers I have ever had. Not helpful and doesnt seem to care that students have other classes than hers. I work part time and do school full time and I worked so hard in her class but she leaves her students out to dry. She seemed more interested in seeing her students repeat her classes than seing them be succesful.,0
"Do not plan on getting any help because it won't happen. DO NOT Communicate through email because it's a disaster. And he is very rude, super confusing, and cant hold a conversation. Save yourself the time and do not take him.",0
"Get ready to spend HOURS watching lectures that you can't understand. Seems to me that he cares more about the way he sounds in lectures than actually teaching material. Discussions make no difference in your grade, while tests are 100-200 points. Don't bother asking him a question as he will make you feel stupid for even asking in the first place.",0
Logic 1 - Really nice & funny guy but class was awful. He isn't very good at teaching but he tries his best to explain things to you BUT ALWAYS digresses. No quizzes. Exams have no study guides or sheets. The book is ancient and the language makes it impossible to understand. Not an easy class so unless it's ur major don't take it.,1
"Really nice guy. Sometimes isn't great at explaining things, but he is good enough. Homework is easy and the tests are based off of it. One group project. Pretty straight forward. If you want a class to enjoy, this is the one.",1
Absolutely AWFUL professor. I have no idea how she still has a job. All she does is put her students down because we're not experts in microbiology. Lecture is pointless because you have to read the book if you wanna pass her exams which are extremely difficult. She is very condescending and no help at all. Do well in lab and you'll pass,0
She was very funny and kept class interesting and easy to follow. There was a group project and some pop quizzes. But overall if you show up to class and follow the lectures you should pass this class with an A.,1
"Terrible feedback. Tough grader. Choices in reading are okay, but she tries to make you think HER way, not critically. It's only HER interpretation & you have to guess. Makes a class that could be great miserable. Contradicts herself; is all over the place with the syllabus. Take this class with another professor! Not worth the aggravation.",0
"I didn't love her. With COVID especially she didn't have grace for students, was pretty unmoving, hard to get a hold of. She's nice. She's very intelligent and knowledgeable. She focused on weird subjects that didn't really get covered by other course content from GCU. She was fine in person, but I didn't enjoy her with blended learning.",0
"Wonderful instructor, great feedback, very concise and forward, not confusing on any of the homework/instructions for homework or projects.",1
The professor really knows his stuff,1
"Took online sociology marriage and families. Avoid this professor for online classes, his syllabus is in broken English, he is not responsive to messages, and he does not have anywhere regarding the assignments throughout the semester, just sends weekly messages of what is due. Maybe a good professor in person, but awwful for online material.",0
Confusing/inconsistent grading. Easy class but not for passionate criminal justice majors. The bare minimum is accepted and received well by the professor. Easy class requires little to no effort. Expect to do a LARGE amount of research. Most of the information needed for discussions and projects are not in the weekly course content.,1
"He is a wonderful, understanding professor that truly cares about his students, and he always checks in with his students to make sure he's teaching them in an effective way to their learning abilities. He is also available in his office whenever you need him.",1
"She is an excellent teacher and an overall very kind person. The students who have problems in this class are the ones who do not put forth effort. She doesn't do the work for you, but knows her stuff and will help you until you understand.",1
"I had Kim for lecture and lab. She's amazing in lab, but dismal in lecture. She would go off on tangents, then speed through the remaining slides expecting you to understand everything. Her final was filled with mechanisms she told us about last minute. If you try to get points back, don't expect her to be nice. Hard HW. Very unprepared for 3020:/",0
"He is very personable and excited about math. However, in class, he elaborates on tangents that do not exactly assist in understanding, and by the time you have lost focus, he brings the lecture back to his point. I am good with math, but could not follow his information at all. He grades very hard on his tests. I got more information from the net.",0
Took this teacher for MTH112 (which is not hard at all) but this prof makes it sooo hard. Takes off points for dumb reasons that do not even affect the final answer. Always in a rush. Expects you to remember and know all the formulas like you're some kind of Math Wiz.,0
His class requires discipline and being consistent. You will really have to work for your A. That's why I like his class. It's challenging and makes you think. He cares about his students and wants them to learn as much as they can.,1
"Took her course because I thought it would be easy. Easy content, but literally the most UNFAIR and DIFFICULT marking. Also will not answer your emails until months later, if she even answers at all. So if you have questions about anything, good luck on that!",0
"Awful teacher. I can honestly say this is the worst teacher I have had in college. She speaks of critical inquiry and the importance of it, yet she can not give you an answer as to what it is. Her analogies are very poor and irrelevant to whats going on in class. She answers question with a question and often times doesn't answer yours. DO NOT TAKE",0
"I took phys 2 with Mr. Burt over the summer. He would get numerous example problems wrong daily and refused to demonstrate the correct way of doing them. He wasnt capable of setting up the labs or answering questions. It was as if he did not even know the subject matter himself. Started out funny, but wasting 4 hrs daily is no laughing matter.",0
"Terrible professor. Isn't clear with the topics she's discussing; she starts talking about something then completely changes the subject or moves on to say something else. I passed with a B+, however, I would never take her again. I dreaded going to her class and listening to her lectures. She was all over the place.",0
Dr. Solano is a super nice funny teacher. The class is a little tough if you have no excel experience but he tries his hardest to make sure you understand whats being taught.,1
"Very nice lady, always willing to help. Accent is a bit tough. What I do not like is it seems as though she does not want to teach material. She assumes you know everything already or if it is easy to her then it's supposed to be easy for you. Rushes because she is too worried about time.",1
"Great class to take over the summer. In just 4 weeks professor Bryant was able to narrow down a large amount of textbook readings in slideshows to help with understanding. Tests and quizzes are straight from the lectures, and the one essay assignment was straight forward and the professor answered an questions I had before submitting.",1
"She was a great teacher and an even better friend.  I will remember her for a lifetime. Plus, she very pretty, hmhm.",1
Best prof at BMCC.,1
"bryan is my favoritest-favoritest!!  he is a great teacher, his lectures are fun and interesting and his tests are challenging but not unreasonable.  great prof for abnormal psych!!",1
I loved taking this class. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.,1
"Dr. Curry is one of the best professors in the HCOM department. Funny, knowledgable, approachable, and extremely enthusiastic, she genuinely cares about her students. She is an extremely tough grader (though fair) and definitely makes you work for your grade. Essays are worth 60% of the final grade, so don't slack off when it comes to those. ",1
"Take him!!! Awesome professor who is super passionate about what he teaches. Tests are easy as long as you do all of the readings and look at powerpoints. He uploads all of the readings and ppts, so you don't have a textbook for the class. Lots of class discussions with lectures.",1
"Professor Sanborn actually very approachable; doesnt mind questions. She is willing to provide additional help. Honestly, the best accounting professor at wayne county community college. I took the class online & i was still able to get extra help in person to review the material along with other students from her accounting classes",1
Amazing teacher.,1
"Amazing teacher! Muvhill is funny and crazy. He brings his own life experiences to class making the material fun and easy. There is never a dull moment. We take quizzes for every chapter online, one paper and a final which is a combo of all the quizzes. Just pay attention review your notes and you'll pass.",1
"So many unnecessary online quizzes that she does not mention in class, but expects u to know as they are on the syllabus. Toughest grader ion essay and if you expect to get an A in this class, best of luck to you as I don't know a single person in my class that has gotten an A. Super boring lectures as well, almost fell asleep in every single one.",0
"I can write a novel about this class. Study guides are just outlines of 12 chapters. He never answers a question directly. Memorize the taxonomy for everything!!  He doesn't cover everything in his lecture, skips a lot of slides, and refuses to slow down if asked. Doesn't round grades when the highest grade was a C- (failing) on the practicum. ",0
"For an interesting lecturer, she's great. For a good grade, AVOID. SOC202 (a proposed bird course) is my lowest mark because of Tobin's inability to teach the same content present on her exams. She's passionate, but is unorganized (didn't print midterms), hard to reach, and structures her exams poorly(M/C where multiple answers could be correct)",0
"If you want to improve at English, Andrew is a must-take prof. Take him often and early in your career, he will teach you invaluable skills. No outside sources are allowed simply because hes smarter than them, and often will spend class time pointing out why they are wrong. Profs like this are rare. Take advantage.",1
She is the worst teacher ever. She literally stands there with a microphone and talks. No one paid attention and literally the whole class failed every test. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE HER. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.,0
"I took him when online started because of Covid. He was rude to our whole class, took days to respond and didnt even answer the question multiple times. Glad I ended up passing so I never have to take any of his classes ever again.",0
Super clear syllabus! The discussions and term paper really made you think and wanted you to go into details. Midterm and final were open ended questions as well. Completely doable!!! Take him for sure!,1
"BEST PROFESSOR AT SUNY OW. VERY EASY ON GRADING AND LABS ARE A BREEZE! such a little cutie very respectful and cares about her students.... I LEARNED MORE FROM HER LAB CLASS THAN I DID IN LECTURE THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING!!!!! Amazing professor take her for an easy A just make sure to do all the pre lab, post lab, and lab reports.",1
"Polanco made this class more difficult than it should have been.  I had to spend way too much time for her class.  It was a disproportionate amount of time compared to my other classes.   We had to do group work which I did not really mind. The last project was actually kinda fun, and helped end the class with not such a sour taste in your mouth.",1
this professor is ridiculously hard! class it self is pretty easy you don't consider spending too much to study but you should! lecture notes are so important. his grades are not fair. he grades by name.so u better go ask him question and attend the classes.he doesn't take attendance but from his mind he knows who is attending or not.good luck!,0
"I had to take this class for one of my cores, and I hated it. Random pop quizzes on content, we barley covered the final and midterm is a joke, and his lectures are lackluster, and he is passive aggressive. This class would be remotely interesting if it was not from this professor. He also sucks at answering emails and is not the most understanding",0
Good class,1
The class is so dry that its impossible to pay attention. However she is a super knowledgeable woman who knows her stuff. Do exactly what she wants and you'll get an A. A quiz after each module. She gives out a study guide with the questions on the quizzes that she goes over in class . Also some other assignments and a final project that are easy.,1
"One of my favorite teachers! His extra credit questions on tests are always entertaining. He tells you exactly what is on the tests and goes over everything well in class. He gives u an outline of the content that is going to be on the test. If you study for tests, go to class, and do the online hw then it's an easy A!!",1
"What a windbag.  Loves his opinions, and you better be careful if you don't think the Bushies are sent from heaven",0
"loved this professor! Took it as  core class, but ended up neing one of my favorite classes. Lectures are really interesting, but the  isnt an easy A, if you take good notes, come to close and study you will do fine.",1
"Super nice guy and very understanding. The only reason you really have to go to class is because there are a lot of in class activities that add up for points in the end, other than that the material is really easy if you have basic scientific/world issue knowledge. The only thing is that he's very specific with what he wants you to write for tests",1
"Deb is my favorite teacher I've had at Duke so far. Her French is fluent and crystal clear. She is very nice and she puts all her effort into making class a fascinating an educational time. As long as you participate and do all the readings, her class is fairly straightforward. After this semester, my French is a lot better.",1
"Taking Physics 132 with professor Tewari was one of the worst choices in my UMass career. Every other professor in this course allows a cheat sheet during tests, she does not. She requires discussion attendance at strange times like 5:30 or 7:30pm when it could just be on opposite weeks of the lab she requires. Her accent makes it hard to focus.",0
"Don't take her awful class.  It's easy, but not worth it at all. I would explain but moderators would rather me not,just,.keep looking for another prof. Rebecca Mugford, if she's still teaching is amazing. Had a friend take her course while I took this, so much more interesting of a lecturer and can actually say learned more from her than Adelle.",0
Ok if you don't come to class your double done he is super harsh and can come off as an a hole but once you get what he wants his class is attainable he grades very harsh and is BIG on correct MLA and citation,0
Confusing professor who is never available during her posted office hours. Will belittle you when you ask for help outside of class. Out of 24 students she sent emails to 19 suggesting they see the calculus tutor instead of asking her for help. Very confusing way of grading exams with no partial credit. Do yourself a favor and skip this professor!,0
Plant Evolution and Diversity. I have nothing good to say about this class or the professor. Grading is almost arbitrary. Impossible to get full credit on ANYTHING besides online quizzes unless he loses your assignment. Took points off a lab I completed for not having a parallel line pointing to 1 plant structure. This class will test your resolve.,0
He's great! Lots of homework in Math XL but clear grading criteria. He responds within 24 hours to emails and gives good feedback. He works with you to help you understand material if needed. He's overall just a really cool guy.,1
"Professor Hegbloom cares a lot about her students. She will learn your name and teach you a lot. However she is rather unorganized, takes a long time to grade papers, and assigns several long projects. She cares about her students, but be prepared to work hard for a good grade.",1
Professor Hopkins is one of the best professors I have came into contact with at PBSC. She is so caring and passionate about what she does. She truly cares about her students and she makes art history fun to listen to. I 100% recommend her class. You will not regret it!! Lover her!!!,1
"Took an online class psych 105 with her. Absolutely HORRIBLE. Use you own words and cite- most likely you will still have her saying you plagiarized and will get a zero. Only had 3 tests including the final, 5 assignments, and 3-4 discussion board. Every thing needs to be cited in APA format and she is a very tough grader.",0
Nice Prof. Simulation sucks!!!! Test were easy. Don't take notes they are online. Have to do a Presentation of Wall Street Journal Article.,0
"I really hope CP24 knows about this. WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS?!! I never knew a professor can be this bad. I got an A 100% because of my own hard work. What is learned in class is ""The course is called ITM 100"" PERIOD!. And whats with the rat tail?",0
Tancredi is super chill and honestly a great teacher. He seriously knows his stuff and has a contagious passion for music that's highly contagious and makes the class fun and easy (if you're paying attention). He uses most the time given sometimes letting you go 10-20 minutes early too. Definitely a cool guy in general and is hard not to like,1
Aggravating to follow but everything is in the book! Study for test and the class is a piece of cake,1
"Class was alright, but Brandt repeats his weird anecdotes such as buying butter at the grocery store too much. Gets old fast.  Claims attendance is mandatory but only took attendance once. 14 quizzes, lowest 2 get dropped. NOT ALL QUIZ ANSWERS ARE ONLINE. 3 tests - provides 1 makeup during finals, but only if you missed an exam. No extra credit.",0
Rosenburg is hilarious. Easily the funniest professor I've ever had. Lots of home quizzes but they're all easy. Speeches are graded kindly.,1
"Dr. Heilman totally influenced my view on drugs in this course. I took this course because I was interested in drug politics and why drugs are so bad, but by the end, I realized that drugs aren't the villain -- rather politicians. Her lectures have been so interesting and engaging and I feel so much more open-minded. You're in for a good time.",1
"There was so much busy work for such a stupid class. We had two major assignments for the semester, one she only gave us a week to complete it in. Her instructions were unclear and if you didn't give her exactly what she wanted, she'd give you an awful grade. Also - Don't buy the book. I haven't used it once. Waste of $80. Waste of a class.",0
"He is a nice guy.. but professor wise, I would never recommend him. His class is passable. But, you will learn nothing. He just reads off the powerpoints and seems disinterested in any comments from others. However, his exams are easy if you study. His exam reviews are very helpful. I wish he was that helpful in daily lectures.",0
"Classes were alright for the most part. However, she expects too much work out of students, especially for pretty unclear, uninteresting ""projects"" in class. You won't know your grade until you get it. ",0
"While the class itself was a bit difficult and required a lot of studying, I truly enjoyed having her as a teacher. Very funny and is always willing to help outside of class if you're behind. Expect to be studying at least 1-2 hours a day. Learned quite a bit.",1
"One of the worst profs I've ever had. She doesn't look at the students when she lectures or acknowledge your existence. Seems like she's reading off her slides but all she says about the artworks is that they are ""important"" because they ""changed things."" Pointless. The TA marked everything and I did really well in the course but she was awful.",0
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
"Prof. Miracle is a great guy but a poor lecturer, and his textbook is worse. You'll have to memorize many useless theorems you'll never use again, and prepare for tests which are far more interested in how you're doing the problem than whether you understand the material. Not a heavy homework load, but watch out for the tests.",0
"Good prof, obviously knows her stuff. This class was pretty difficult though...mostly because I am not a science person. She's also a tough grader (1/2 points, etc.)",1
"Laid-back guy. Doesn't seem to take teaching very seriously - he canceled class twice to stay home with his son and took a whole week (3 classes) off to complain about the election. He also canceled the final since he ""doesn't believe in exams"". Class is mostly discussion.  Will single out anyone w/ a different opinion, and offers trigger warnings.",0
"Dr. Hammer is the best of the best. She changed my life by teaching me to write, to think, and to be better.",1
Not very intresting. Reads off powerpoint. Often gets things wrong. Exams are difficult.,0
"She's completely unorganized. Too much work for no grade. She has cancelled class 3 weeks in a row for personal reasons or to go to festivities. We have written up to 4 drafts so far, NONE have been graded only critiqued. Also, has insulted many students including myself claiming "" it is clear English is my second language"". Overall terrible prof. ",0
"don't take the class with this teacher he will not help you, he don't care about you and also he will irritate u with his mocking face. and to many others reason why u should not take the class with him",0
"He keeps adding to the Syllabus three weeks after the class has started. I am three weeks in and already have 3/4 of the work done because I am trying to finish early. But, he added discussion questions that I HAVE to post a thread, AND respond to two other people. The worst part about it is he only posts them every week. Choose Mr. White instead.",0
"Doesn't like to absorb new viewpoints. Takes three weeks to grade one paper. Spends most of the class talking about how many poetry degrees he has and how much he knows, rather than talking to his students about the material. Wouldn't take a class from him again.",0
"Really great professor! He makes physics sound interesting. His lectures are super clear and he always goes over each problem patiently, even if most people get it right. He cares about students. Im really sad he wont be teaching 123 next quarter, I wish I could take it with him",1
Great course,1
"Swingley talks a lot about feminism in her classes. Even though it's an editing class, many times we talk about other things besides editing during the class period. I thought I was going to learn about commas, semi-colons, etc., but we only talked about how to address each gender in writing.",0
"Be careful when taking her online class. She is very hard to understand and has a tendency of making the material more difficult than it is. She has also sent out numerous emails threatening students that if there are power outages during testing they will fail the test, no exception. Totally unprofessional and harrasing!",0
"I am happy that I took Chem 102 with Professor Harvey. She really tries to help all of her students. Her tests come directly from her lectures, homework, and sample tests. The only complain that I have is that she does not follow the order of her lecture notes and she teaches half of the material in workshops and labs. I really recommend taking her",1
"Dr. Fiege is a great choice for BIOL 152. He answers questions and replies to emails in a timely manner. This course requires a lot of work (which is not graded) in order to prepare for the many, many tests. His live lectures are difficult to understand, but you can access recorded lectures on blackboard. He likes to change things as he goes.",1
Mr. Huff is one of the best professors on this planet. His extraordinary knowledge and outstanding good looks makes me want to go to class every day.,1
"Mike Jurmu is a very nice guy. I can not say that about his classes. Worst grader I have ever had. If you're looking for a class that you just want credit for with an average grade, take his classes. Does not reward smarter students for their hard work, and everyone is within the grade average pretty much. EXTREMELY terrible grading. TERRIBLE!!",0
"EOSC 310 used to be an easy science requirement course, but not any more. Now you have to use a poorly written, unclear book with difficult, confusing weekly quizzes. Longridge was not helpful in answering questions or clarifying anything.",0
"Lectures are fast paced, Chooljian goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the course. She expects you to already know what is on her lecture slides. The time given in the lab exams are so inconsiderate of everyone's learning abilities. You literally get 30 seconds per question. This class will cause anxiety & jeopardize your mental health.",0
"This class was one of the most challenging classes that I've had to take so far. However, it was also extremely rewarding. She expects you to be passionate about this course and put in the effort for the quizzes . I'd recommend taking extensive notes in her class. She IS picky about answers in exams, but also specifies what she expects in class",1
"Paul is the best.  Hes funny, smart, hard when needs to be and extremely helpful when you need it the most.  Hes there for the students unlike many professors ive had.  If you dont like him its probably because he didnt like your art and you didnt like that.  And if you dont laugh at his jokes your probably not as smart as he is.",1
"Not only was he hard to understand and the homework/Accounting CD thing useless, according to his grading scale I should have gotten and A but he gave me a B. I tried emailing him/calling him MULTIPLE times (I'm a transfer), but he never responded. The material is easy but the professor is useless.",0
These other comments shock me. He is repetitive but nothing wrong with having the materials reinforced. It was helpful. Weve done 2 of the 3 essays so far and I received decent grades on them. Its a participation class but he didnt call on anyone. The essays were done over a month but with working on them weekly so not scrambling last minute.,1
Lectures are boring and it is a waste of time to take this class. Very boring and he teaches us concepts that are beyond introductory course levels. Do not take this class if you want to save your GPA.,0
"I had math 123 with Marie, and I found her to be a VERY great teacher. Shes very concerned with how you do in the class and will try and push you.  She usually doesnt like it when your late. But overall I found her to be a wonderful teacher and I really enjoyed her class. I defeinetly siggest taking Mrs. Larsen,",1
"I took his PSY101 class online and it was it very frustrating. He was very unorganized and for it being an online class, it was pertinent to be well organized. He was consistently late getting his recorded lectures out to us and had to keep pushing back due dates that all piled up at the end of the quarter by his doing, not mine.",0
"I think Prof Arnold on here trolling. There is no way this many people in the class enjoyed the couse. I thought it was a bit of a waste of time. Did I learn a lot? Meh. I certainly wont remember this course in 5 years. The workload is a little much, but its not like anyone really teaches science anymore. If you take her take it during MLB season.",0
"Won't tell you your final grades. Makes you do impossible math equation to figure it out. Tough grader. Says out loud ""4 people are failing"" won't tell you directly. Causally said 7 in last class failed. 5 people I know changed majors after her. Art isn't creative, it's a chore in her class. Homework given like you don't 5 other classes. Avoid her.",0
"Didn't feel like I got enough out of the teacher. The class was great and I learned a lot, but I wish the teacher would have helped more. Constantly had to ask for additional instructions. I was extremely ill and he gave me a redo on an assignment, but only for a couple more hours. I wrote him when I was super sick.",0
Professor Sinha is a decent professor. Her lecture slides can sometimes be disorganized but she seems to be knowledgable about the topic. She explains the concepts in an okay manner. You need to take detailed notes because she asks you little details on the test. She is also funny sometimes.,1
She prefers women over men. She is very moody. I bet all these good comments were made by women in her class.,0
"She is an outstanding and understanding professor, especially during difficult times.",1
I took his online course in the summer in TWO weeks rather than 3 due to personal reasons. He's flexible & respectful towards my studies. You need the book (he loans book out if needed due to finances) the semester work includes: 4 quizzes/50 Q's to be completed in 60 min and the final (4 questions - paragraph answers). Extra credit is offered.,1
do the work and you will pass the class,1
She doesn't know how to teach. She is a tough grader. She doesn't know anything about cybercrime except anything from the book. She claims she is a lawyer but doesn't know anything about cyber laws and such. Her exams are very heavy and tough grader. She expect a group presentation and final paper,0
"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all. I had a difficult time getting in contact with her, calculating my class grade was literally impossible until the end of the semester, and she definitely graded quite harshly for a freshman level class. I would not take another of her classes again.",0
"There were 30 students in the beginning of the class and two weeks later there's only 7 students. Most students dropped because of the workload and it was so bad that the department head noticed and made her talk with us on how to fix the class. If you want to read a lot of useless text and fail a class, then you should take this class. Don't do it",0
"50 years ago Miracle may have been a great professor. Now, not so much. Lectures are incredibly dull and sometimes hard to follow. He frequently makes mistakes in his work. Good news is that the tests are exactly like the worksheets and homework, if you've do those, you're golden. It would take a miracle for me to sign up for his class again.",0
"Dr. Weston is a nice and fair professor who understands students and goes out of her way to ensure student success. She is a great lecturer, and extremely accessible. She is also pleasant. However, the workload and pace is horrendous for this class. I would suggest taking it by itself. It is the hardest class that I have had at ASU, so far.",1
worst prof at ucsb I've ever had. also most monotone. tricky tests. full questions on his tests emphasize concepts that he tells you aren't important during lecture. take mcdb 110 or chem 142 if you can,0
"Very delightful teacher, I really recommend his class. He makes you view things in very different perspectives. I learned very much from this class.",1
"So long as you attend each class and participate by answering one or two of her questions or reading some of a passage from the textbook you'll do good. The class itself was easy to follow, just complete your homework and show her that you did and you'll get an A.",1
"Professor Perez is a wonderful instructor. He is easy, good grader and takes his class seriously. Very helpful and you won't regret taking his class. Easy, great and fun assignments in his class.",1
"Dr. Nguyen was my favorite professor I've ever had! He's really the only professor in philosophy who made me read the texts, which is pretty rare in the philosophy department. He will make you work hard, but in the end, you'll know so much more than when you first walked into his class. If you truly want to learn philosophy, he's the one for you.",1
"doesn't teach, doesn't even hear when you ask questions, and on the chance he does hear get ready for a long lecture instead of a brief response. grading is extremely unclear, doesn't follow typical format and he doesn't post your grades anywhere. extremely confused by technology. disrespects native speakers and young students. please save yourself",0
"There're 3 quizzes, 5 in lab practices, 5 assignments, and a group project. If you apply yourself, you will succeed the course. Prof Song is knowledgeable and really cares about her students. She gave off many opportunities for extra points. Personally I really enjoyed her office hours -- helped me a ton.",1
he is a great professor who is great with lectures and knows what he is doing.,1
"I took his class over 20 years ago.  It was a Pre-Calc class, so everything in it was what we should have learned before.  That didn't stop him from going over our heads, though.  He even berated the whole class after an exam by saying ""Maybe you are just stupid.""  I really thought it was me but reading all these reviews makes me feel vindicated.",0
"Online class was interesting. There are quizzes each week and there is a final project that is due, which is 40% of the class. It is done with a partner so it is not to difficult. Overall, this class was good.",1
"GREAT. CHILL. LAID BACK. Paula is cool. She helps you embrace yourself. Helps you get throw stage anxiety. Yea she has 3 exams but theyre easy she lets you know what is on them. The speeches are not hard at all, so dont complain. She gives good feedback and reasonable when it comes to grading. If you dont pass her class youre wack",1
"worst teacher I have ever taken his feedback on my papers is the thing that made me drop out of journalism forever, one paper he literally said ""this is the worst thing i have ever read I gave up half way through I could not finish it"".When looked over by another journalism teacher I was given praise for my writing and use of metaphors. he hated me",0
Took his Gangs class and it was a breeze! I sware anyone could pass this class with flying colors.  This is the most easiest class EVER!! He does pwrpoint but gives u a handout of the pwrpoint so u dont even have to take notes just highlight things.  He has u do current gang articals that are ur opinion on the artical. U can use ur notes for tests,1
"This was a logic class and I took it online. WOW. The course material gradually got more difficult. The last Chapter was brutal!!! Make the best effort you can in the first chapters. Dr. Childs makes it as painless as possible but with this subject, one can only do so much!",1
"This class ran off of connect with 3 assignments plus a quiz each but ALSO a ""project"" (busy work) to go along with each week. The directions for these project were never clear and you basically had to guess on the internet and hope and pray you received a decent grade from the TA and even then the professor may come and change it !",0
She is a great professor,1
"Although i can't stand to listen to him s-l-o-w-l-y p-r-o-n-o-u-n-c-e e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d, he is very nice, and practically throws the marks at you.  A little dedication is all you need to get an A (Practically no chemistry knowledge required!).",0
Wouldnt recommend.,0
"Some teachers lose enthusiasm teaching the same subject year over year; even though he's relatively new, I have confidence that will never be Noel. He is one of the most passionate people I've ever met, and a truly gifted educator. You may struggle if writing intimidates you, but listen to his feedback and do the work. You'l be glad you did.",1
"The work load for this class is very heavy including forum posts, quizzes, listening quizzes, and tests for it to be an elective class. Play close attention to due dates. He is a fair grader. If you stay on top of your assignments and due dates, you will be fine. He is going to make you work for an A!",0
"I've taken quite a few of his classes and even gone out of my way to take his classes. He barely gives out work, the work is super easy, and sometimes he'll do ""pop quizzes"" which are really just you writing down your name and getting 10 points for being in class that day. Great professor!",1
Uses same material for Perception & Cognition Classes.  Completely full of it.,0
"She is a great teacher and extremely helpful. Also, Czech is really interesting.",1
"lectures were very clear. He only tests on what was covered in class, but you must understand everything to do well.",1
"Took him for film and lit.  This guy is the greatest professor at nassau.  I would take any of his classes.  Truly passionate, understanding, helpful, and inspiring. If you think I'm overduing it, then you haven't had a hellish experience with a professor yet.  This guy is the man. Pronounce his name ""Dongello"" and he will love you for it.",1
I had Natalie for Anthro and she made it super fun! Shes a little quirky and sometimes it can be a little boring but take notes anyway. You can use those for your open book tests (multiple choice)! Take advantage of all the extra credit opps (there are enough) and attend all classes to get in class group work credit. Shes amazing!,1
"On the first day of class I thought what the heck did I get myself into. He comes off as being very intense because he is a very passionate professor. He is actually very cool and understanding, just pay attention and interact dont get on his bad side!4 tests total, and two map quizzes, each test has two short essays that go along with it.",1
"By far the best and most life changing professor I've had. In the week class of PHI2604 that was given in the summer, we all connected on such a deep level as a class and this man has to be one of the most knowledgeable out there! He is amazing at explaining some of the most boring topics and really truly made it stick in my head. Great prof.",1
"I agree with all the postings here.  On a related front, my room mate is a history major and the majors are NOT permitted to take her (I guess this is something of an unwritten rule).  Translation: she is not solid enough for majors, so the general population has to tolerate her.  Do NOT take her if you care about your education.",0
"this woman is out of her mind, during lecture she'll go on for an hour about her granddaughter and teach us NOTHING, come exam time, she pulls questions out of her ass about stuff she never ever taught, THANK GOD SHES RETIRING no one deserves such torture",0
"Professor Tanoukhi, although intimidating at first, is extremely caring of her students. As the semester went by, I really started to appreciate her teaching style. The class was small and tightly knit. I truly feel that I grew as a writer due to her class. Keep up with readings, put effort into the essays, and I guarantee you'll love her classes!",1
"Mrs. Johnson is very religious and conservative. Shes not afraid to make that known. The whole semester was her showing us documentaries against abortion, homosexuality, and basically any other hot button topic that should be left out of the classroom. I was in high school at the time and looking back, I realized how inappropriate she truly acted.",0
"AMAZING teacher. Had him as a highschool dual-enrollment professor though, so I got to experience his teaching in person in a classroom environment rather than an online class (which the other reviews were.) I don't know how he is as an online professor, but I know that he was the most interesting, informative, and fun teacher I've ever had!",1
The professor is definitely educated when it comes to philosophy but tried way too hard to make the class difficult. I took him for summer b term this year. There is a timed reading quiz for every single reading assigned. He assigns multiple readings every week. About 8-11 assignments due every week. All quizzes and exams have original questions.,0
"Dr. Teekell is extremely passive aggressive. She sounds really nice but her comments are quite rude in class. If you are sensitive I would not take her class. She assigns lots of reading and says that she realizes her students are overwhelmed and burdened by the amount of reading, then assigns more. It feels very insensitive when she wants grace.",0
Amazing OB instructor! Attendance is not mandatory but highly suggested. Do the work and you'll earn the grade you want!,1
"He is one of those teachers that makes you go home and watch videos on the topics and learn yourself. Then after you do that he reviews it during class. I personally would rather have my teacher teach the criteria and then I will review it with the homework they give us. He is kind and can help with some homework, but wasnt the teacher for me.",0
Labs are extremely confusing but he really tries to help.,1
"Funny, but lazy and class was an insane waste of time after the first test. If he didn't feel like teaching he'd just pop in a movie. Sounds easy but his tests were intentionally tricky to make it seem like his class was harder than it really was. Wouldn't take again.",0
"Professor Nelson is seriously the best chemistry teacher I have EVER had! He is just amazing! He is very organized,very helpful, and does anything he can for his students. He actually cares! I am so lucky to have had him as a professor. I learned and actually retained the information! I would recommend him to everyone!Take his Lab as well very fun!",1
"DOES NOT TAKE FEEDBACK WELL, IS NOT CLEAR ABOUT EXPECTATIONS, MAKES UP HER OWN ""CLASS STANDARDS"" AND TRIES TO PASS THEM OFF AS STANDARDS FOR THE PROGRAM, TESTS ARE POORLY WRITTEN AND HAVE MULTIPLE ERRORS ON THEM, DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILTIY FOR HER MISTAKES ie WILL TEACH ONE THING (CLEARLY LISTED IN POWER POINTS) AND WILL MARK IT WROONG ON TEST.",0
Prof.Parker is very sweet. I was sick the first 3 weeks of this on line class and was unable to do a lot of work. She was very understanding and willing to help in any way possible. She always took my calls or answered my emails. Her husband even helped me one night with math questions as well. I thought for sure I was going to fail but I passed.,1
I absolutely loved her. She truly does want her kids to succeed. Her midterm exams are fairly easy and it's possible to get over 100% if you study and do the practice exam she gives you. This class wasn't too bad as long as you did all the work required. Alex tries to be very flexible with her office hours so she's always available to help.,1
"The material in this class is extremely boring. But she is very eccentric, so it makes you pay attention. Her review IS the test, so make sure you pay attention on review day. And she gives TONS of bonus. So I definitely recommend her.",1
This is one teacher who is SERIOUS about her music. Easy class just make sure you pay attention to instructions for the her test. I made an A on every single one them. Sometimes you have to write a short paragraph so its not too bad.,0
He tends to grad differently for each student. He is very loose on what he actually wants. He will also allow some students to turn in late work but not others.,0
Highly recommend this professor. He makes the class very engaging and fun and you get to learn a lot.,1
"He does not realize that we are not in the 1970s anymore and is absolutely a terrible professor. All he does is rant about how ""handheld devices"" have changed our society. Class is a complete waste of time.",0
"She was okay in the beginning, but overtime was last minute on things. It took forever to get any grades back. Our project was started later than it needed to be. I enjoyed the group project where you work with a real company and do their marketing. My group members were great. Also Karani did not like me bc of where I live and I found that rude.",0
only took this cause I needed the units. I was interested in chicano studies but she made the class dull. she doesn't post her lectures online so attendance is mandatory but she's such a bad & boring lecturer. readings are long. she expects too much and tends to be rude and forgets that we're in a pandemic!! not very empathetic which is ironic.,0
I took 2 Real Estate classes with Professor Lawson. Weekly discussions were interesting and helped to learn the material. I highly recommend his classes.,1
"Failed to stick to syllabus, changed due dates frequently, posted quizzes and tests late.  Dropped some assignments. Even after final grades were due to be turned in, no final grade was listed on Bb.  Blamed me when I told her I was confused by the due dates she changed several times.  Found her inflexible despite her own lack of consistency.",0
"Miranda is disorganized and showed up to the class late or right at start time. she enjoys rambling about unrelated things which also wastes time, tests are fairly easy if you go to class. she likes to ask questions about examples and side stories she mentions so pay attention to those! the only reason people went to class was for clicker quizzes",0
"His class was challenging, but it really taught me so much. If you don't understand something, go to his office hours. He is always there to help and will definitely be one of my fav. profs. ",1
"Hot, ness! This class was more interesting than I expected. If you cant get an A in this class, its because you made no effort. Very reasonable. Don't be rude in class.",1
This class was way too difficult. I have taken many psych courses here and this is one of the hardest. I'm a straight A student and I will be lucky to pass this class with a c+,0
"With Mme Emond, it's mostly about stats: what are the % for this, for that...  important concepts in sexuality (gender identity, homosexuality...) are not explained with details they deserve and based on psychological processus of the human mind. It's basically memorizing things and throwing them up on your exam. Still, very difficult to get A.",0
Great  teacher every understanding an if you need any help or do know about something than he will you. One of the best teacher that I have ever had an out of all the history teacher I have had he has show me more about history than all of the combined.,1
Wonderful class! MP3 recordings are available so you can listen to every lecture like it was an in-person class (I took the online class). Helpful when questions are asked and participated in online lectures.,1
The only reason lecture is mandatory is because of participation points. Otherwise you could do it all from home. She posts all assignments online. There was only one in class assignment worth 50 points. Lecture is very scattered and hard to follow. She just gives a little outline of the reading assigned. She assigns weekly online quizzes,0
Best prof ive had so far at nyit. I took him last year spring && enjoyed him very much. I wish he taught every subject. Hes hilarious and a great teacher. He can make a caveman understand tmat lol,1
"Oh man, where do I start? Thibaud Tallemfumier is without a doubt the worst teacher/professor I have ever had in a math-related subject. His lectures are bland, useless, and often extremely confusing. Homework assignments are unnecessarily long and do not accurately represent content tested on exams. Seriously, don't take him.",0
DON'T TAKE HERE SHE WILL GIVE YOU A F FOR EVERYTHING DON'T HELP YOU AT ALL DON'T TAKE HER RUN NOW,0
He is a good professor and does care about students since he allows notes on tests and offers 40 extra credit points which is a lot so take him.,1
"I just finished up astronomy with prof Benito. I ended up getting an A in the course.  The material is very interesting and you get to see the planetarium as well as go to Jones Beach at night with the telescopes,  I learned a lot about astronomy which was a lot more interesting than taking bio again.",1
"Overall this was an easy course. She made HIST 2112 online fun and rather simple. The tests are the exact same as the study guide so memorize those and you will pass with flying colors. The essays are time consuming but her feedback is solid. The project is time consuming as well but again, pay attention to her feedback and you're good. She's a gem",1
"Extremely caring, goes out of his way to make sure you get a good grade.",1
"very unorganized course. the only hope you have is the final that tests your true understanding. The quizzes, even if you know all the material you cant do well. This is because the professor thinks because it is open book it needs to be more difficult. That too, with an extremely limited time limit per quiz. One of the worst classes I have taken.",0
"While Sra. Graetzer is a lovely person, her class is completely unorganized and she does not give clear directions for class assignments. Her class has not followed any kind of syllabus, and there were little-to-no clear instructions as to how anything in her class was going to follow. Kind lady, not a great professor.",0
"Half-way through the semester Meryl tossed out the lesson plans and threw caution to the wind. She left everyone in the dark about the grading for several projects and piled on papers, exams and presentations for the last week of class. She is a wreck organizationally, emotionally, and professionally. Unable to use the computer or moodle. ",0
Amazing professor takes the time to answer question and lectures are very interesting. Would recommend highly !!Tests are fair .,1
Books chosen for the class were very interesting and insightful but can be a large work-load for some.,1
"Nice researcher but never knows how to teach. Only his notes are useful, you'll never know what's going on with his lectures",0
"Sweet lady! Easy online course, quizes every week and either a journal or forum post every other week. Yes you have work to do, and there's a time consuming final essay, but I enjoyed it.  ",1
"She was one of the best teachers I've ever had.  She is very knowledgable in her filed and was very accesible to her students.  Her classes are fun and insightful, especially the family psychology class.  I didn't meet very many students who after taking one class with her didn't end up taking all of the classes she taught.",1
Looks for specific answers while the questions that she asks are very broad,0
Great professor! Very easy going.,1
"Least helpful professor i have ever had to deal with. Serious manner issues. Dont bother showing up 5 min late, he locks the door. Whole class is scared to ask/answer a question, because he will ridicule you if not up to his standards. Does not give fair warnings about tests, never reviews for tests.",0
"Very nice man but a terrible teacher. It was a ""teach yourself class"" which is hard when its college-level physics. His lectures were all over the place and I never had any idea what was going on. He gives a one problem quiz almost every class and the tests were very tough. He curves each test average to a 75 because almost everyone fails. Bad.",1
"Seems like a good guy, but one of the WORST classes I've ever had to endure. I just came here to get transfer credit back to my college. The class is easy to get an A IMO, but the quality of lectures/education is god awful. The lectures videos are extremely low quality so you can't see what he's writing and his accent makes it impossible to hear.",0
His voice is super boring.  He does not teach you anything and reads off PowerPoints you could read yourself. The real grades in the class are based on SAM (online program for computer class).  Just do the trainings and do well on the quizzes and exams then you're get an A. Also contribute to your group project. ATTENDANCE MANDATORY! ,0
"Easy class. She is super sweet and caring. Took her online & she was always accessible. Only 3 assignments & 2 tests all semester. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS. They are a bit intimidating af first, but once you start it's a piece of cake. I made A's on all assignments and failed both tests and still passed. She gives a couple of chances for e.c. as well.",1
"Super awesome professor, wish there were more like her! She cares about everyone and is amazingly helpful!",1
She is very nice and caring. She will always remind you of the due dates for her assignment. It is a fairly easy class.,1
"He seems to be a good guy, but he needs to slow down when he's teaching. He goes too fast and often messes up when teaching. Beware of the probability section of this class! It's very difficult. If the class scores below average he'll give EC on the exams.",0
"Amazing instructor!! I took so much from this class! I looked forward to his class every week, HIGHLY recommend! Great lectures, very interesting all around.",1
"Nice Guy, bad jokes. Doesnt return HomeWork soon enough for students to know if they are doing their work correctly. Puts questions on quizzes from sections he hasn't gone over. He doesn't go through the process of solving problems, he just plugs it into Mathematica and students have to figure it out for themselves.",0
"This has been the easiest professor I've ever had. We never took notes we just discussed pieces of literature in depth and wrote multiple papers. She gives you tons of time to do anything, which is always a plus. 10/10 would take her over anyone else again.",1
"Not a good lecturer whatsoever, but an extremely easy class.",0
"The class wasn't difficult, it was hard to understand what was expected at times. She gives either an A or a 70. The lack of feedback doesn't allow you to improve your work. She doesn't respond to emails. I did learn how to use the writing lab at Pima. That was the only way to get feedback and learn anything.",0
I hated having him as a teacher. Math is hard but having a teacher who doesn't teach you makes things ten times harder. He didn't teach us anything we had to teach ourselves. He sometimes he didn't even know what he was doing himself. He had a great personality just is a terrible teacher. He needs to retire.,0
thinks hes the smartest person in the world and perhaps he is. he just isnt that great of a teacher and doesnt seem so interested in students opinions. grading very arbitrary,0
"Total Recommend anyone take this class with the Professor. She is understanding and helpful to those who do not understand the material. To those who are retaking the class like myself, this is definitely the professor to take it with.",1
You're better off taking this class with a different professor. Expect her to tell you that you should focus on her class and ignore your other classes.,0
"If you strive for good grades, make sure to do homework and write your papers carefully. The instructions he gives for each paper are directional, in which you have to dig in a little bit to work on, which he demands a lot in class. Be prepared to read a lot.",1
"Arrogant. His theory of dropping you in the deep end does teach you a lot, but then you don't know the basics",0
Tests are extremely hard and unfair to the students. If you have had no prior chemistry classes you will struggle. He keeps his office open for students to ask questions but he always seems annoyed. Rushes through subjects in class thus resulting in you becoming lost. You learn more than you would from Davis but it's much much harder.,0
You'd better be prepared to regurgitate conservative viewpoints and hold Scalia in the same air as Moses and Gerber himself.,0
"Margo is an horrifying prof. I've never been so incredibly bored in an anthropology class before. Literally reads off the slides, no new information is given, speaks ONLY about Brazil- in fact my class mate and I have taken to rolling our eyes every time she mentions Brazil, which means our eyes are CONSTANTLY ROLLING. AVOID THIS PROF.",0
"Dr. Maragh Lloyd is fantastic! She makes you actually want to do the reading, and makes you see why it matters. Tough grader-follow the rubrics and prompts. But I literally want to be her friend",1
"Dr. Nixons class was set up pretty confusing. I had to email her a lot and check with other classmates so often just to understand the exact point of each assignment. Weekly checklist states A LOT of reading assignments, but to be honest theyre not necessary at all. Class is mostly just 4 big papers, if you choose a good topic it isnt too hard.",1
"Bad professor, bad man",0
"This was a 1 credit course that was super interesting. Nic knows the city of Rome like the back of his hand - extremely knowledgeable and well respected. Take a class with him, and go talk to him in office hours. He's a pretty cool dude!",1
"He Grades hard, Boring class",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIM! He grades based on his thinking at that particular moment. If you don't have quality participation he'll probably fail you. Also gives way too much homework, for a 1000 level course.",0
"I felt that I should leave a comment to redeem Harp here. He is not useless. He gives you outlines and reviews. Use them, you'll do fine! Every question I asked was responded to quickly. I think Harp just has a low bs tolerance. Do the work on time, read his rules, and use the stuff he gives you.",1
Loved him! He gets your attention with his lectures! He tells you exactly what's on the midterm and final and it's all from lectures and the textbooks. He's also a fair grader. If you deserve a 90 he gives you one.,1
"She is just great. Nothing else, Her practice problems are always related to the actual tests.",1
"Put simply, CAPT Felker is the most realistic instructor I have ever had. He is tough on essays and papers but he gives open notes and book essay assessments with plenty of time and information to prepare. CAPT Felker hammers the fact he cares more about ProDev than he does grading and he will make sure his class has fair realistic expectations.",1
"Balistreri is caring, and tries very hard to be a successful instructor, but unfortunately is not. Balistreri simply does not teach; she makes a powerpoint by copying and pasting from other sources, her powerpoints often contradict the textbooks, and reads us the powerpoints in a room for 3 hours. No interactivity. Lots of talk about nothing.",0
"Professor Sedwick is not the greatest lecturer, he mostly just does examples on the board that don't make too much sense. But some of the things stick with me and I actively think about them when working on a test or homework. Quizzes every week, they're quite easy, but tests are very difficult. That may just be thermodynamics, though.",1
I loved the style of lectures which were more of a group discussion. It was easy to get involved with the material and give your opinion without judgement. Course was 8 weeks and included a heavy workload but it was doable. Definitely love her teaching style.,1
"Lots of reading. No test review at all. 3 case asmts which you have to put time and efforts into it and 1 optional case to boost your grade. Take this class for credit, didn't really enjoy much! Not Easy A  unless you work really hard to earn it! ",1
"Falk is a very sweet man. His class was the hardest class I have ever taken. He knows his class is hard so he curves the class but even then I still struggled to get a C. He is extremely smart but I think he struggled to teach the material to undergrads. If you take his class, be ready to devote most of your time to it.",1
"He is a nice guy who loves to joke around. He's not a strict grader, or strict about anything really. Not good for super serious students.",1
Terrible Professor,0
She is a very picky one and you definately know you earn your grade. She a nice ladie too.,1
"I don't usually give bad reviews but avoid this guy. The group projects were a nightmare. He wanted the class to feel ""real world"" by assigning you to a random group. At one point he thought about making each group ""fire"" a person and then he was going to make another group of the rejects. Lucky that didn't happen. Again don't take him.",0
I picked her because all of the good reviews but that must be for those who had her in person. HORRIBLE for online!! Doesnt get back to you and doesnt care to give a good feedback even if you ask. Extremely hard grader and doesnt care to help you out. Would never take her class again.,0
"I took math 115 in the summer with him and let me tell you, he should NOT be teaching.  He may be a good tutor but he is NOT A GOOD TEACHER.  He does expect you to just know the stuff and he doesn't teach anything.  I ended up having to drop the class and waste the $400 I paid for it... Not a happy camper!",0
the subject in general is super boring but so is the professor so it doesnt make it easier. Also class is not mandatory which is great but if you have zero self discipline you will never show up again and fail. the tests are all that matter especially the final you could fail everything then get an A on the final and that will be your final grade,1
"Absent and worthless if you have an issue. I had an issue with getting locked out of a test using the lockdown software she required and she refused to do anything about it, making passing very difficult for me. So lazy that she didnt even bother to post announcements weekly either. Do not recommend her.",0
"I am not done yet. He might have passed his exams and managed to be smart once, but he ain't any more. This guy can't even answer a questions without saying things like: uh emmm uhh what does the boo say. or, eh umm i don't,, uhh what do you think? I have my own opinions about discrimination but since i don't have fact i'm not going to talk about",0
"Professor McGrath is funny and laidback. Not only that but he is also a professional writer so he knows what he's talking about. My writing has definitely improved over the semester. Only problem I had was him not updating grades onto Canvas, had to ask him directly. Also textbook is VERY hard to obtain and only used for homework assignments.",1
Don't take her... she is horrible!!!,0
I WISH HE WAS TEACHING FOR THE SUMMER TERM BEACUSE I LOVE HIM!! I AM IN HIS CLASS NOW AND IT WENT BY QUICK!! WE USED OUR TESTBOOKS MAYBE 3 TIMES THE WHOLE SEMESTER!! HE TEACHES FROM SLIDE SHOWS AND IS VERY NICE ABOUT MAKE UPS AND TURNING IN ALL WORK..HE MAKES STUDY GUIDES AND WHATS ON THERE IS ON THE TEST(HELLO!!)..I RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE!!,1
The best math professor that Ferris has to offer for pre-calc. I have struggled with math as long as I can remember. I retook this class cuz I failed with a different professor. He taught me so much that pre-calc became easy for me he is a real gem if you can get him then do it! Even though he offers 8 am classes it's worth it!!!!,1
"When I first met Ms. Dendy, she seemed like a great prof. However, I soon figured out that she doesn't give nearly enough time to write papers, and she does not give much feedback. She seems to be looking for a particular writing style, because most things I write seem to not be what she wants, even though I follow directions and write pretty well",0
Shes only given out one A in her entire career of teaching is her story on syllabus day. I don't know why I stayed enrolled but wish I wouldn't of. The classes are boring and a lot of reading. She has no enthusiasm as a teacher and drills you with homework and papers.,0
"This was the most challenging online class I've ever taken! Notes- don't have much info Tests- Not easy to understand (75 Qs, 15 Point), most of the time the notes didn't even have the answer Exercises- long and really confusing (3-5 pgs, 1 point) Discussion Qs- 5-6 Qs asked, you answer 2, long and time consuming! 1 point Save yourself #Honest",0
Took his online class and he was incredibly invasive with Lockdown browser for all test and exams. Lots of tests and two final exams. VERY heavy on lecture and horrible youtube version to watch his lecture. I would never take his class ever again. And during Zoom reviews he cuts off individuals when they try to talk as well as speaks over any input,0
Just don't take him.  Im trying to warn you!!!,0
I loved her!! best math teacher i ever had!,1
Mrs. Elizondo has by far been my favorite professor! I took her last semester for Anatomy and am currently in her class for MIcrobiology. She makes the information enjoyable to learn and is extremely reasonable. Wish she taught physio! Incredible woman,1
"Good guy. Really passionate about his ecology. Tests are tough, and he grades tough, but if you know the material you can do well on them. One downside is he hasnt responded to any of the 5 emails i've sent him this semester.",1
Great professor. Attendance is mandatory and a part of your grade. Test are not hard if you do the practice exams and study them.,1
Bad instructor. Did not teach anything. Says one thing then expects the other. Such a shame he is the only Social Work professor at South Campus. More than 3/4 of my class dropped him.,0
"His lectures are clear and organized which is nice. Sometimes he can go off on random tangents though, especially if you ask a question. Then we get behind in the notes and he will either just skip it and expect you to learn it or rush through it. The homeworks are long and hard.",1
"This was definitely a hard class...but physics isn't easy.  Dr. Nicastro didn't have time for bull crap.  If you didn't do the work, he could tell.  When you did the work, he would definitely cut you slack, but you had to show it and earn it.",1
I am generally a very competent student; I have done well with my classes up till now. Ams just does a terrible job explaining things in class. He makes frequent mistakes in lectures. He is very unsympathetic to students who struggle and made me feel like an idiot at office hours. My classmates tell me that he is very unavailable for them.,0
"hate this class! had tutor, read book, did online stuff and no help from her. learned more from outside group. Horrible teacher!",0
"He Cannot teach, he undoubtedly knows the material but is incapable of explaining it in a way that is understandable. He has horrible hand writing and jumps all over the board making it impossible to follow his teaching. He doesnt offer help to students who ask and he supplies test review and then test you on material that wasnt on the review.",0
A great teacher with sometimes boring lectures. It can be a fun interesting class too.,1
"has a grading contract that guarantees an A as long as you do the assignments and show up to class. it's a really fun class and you talk about real-life, modern issues and then write about it. 2 papers and lots of discussion board posts and a final project. you can get an A+ if you go to 3 asu events as well.",1
"Nice lady, easy class. I took it online. You must work for your grade.",1
"Liebman is an artless teacher that imparts ZERO knowledge to her students. Only with this woman could the topic teeter from Cicero to Oprah, and stay at Oprah. For taking her you will have lost your money, time, and in the world some measure of faith.",0
"First totally online classes, and still learned a lot. This professor is very chill and realistic about homework and quizzes. pay attention and do the quizzes you will pass.",1
"Goes over nothing in lecture all the quizzes are based strictly on reading from the book.  Nice guy, he's pretty funny and didn't have a final exam but was a terrible teacher.  Class time was pointless the only reason I went was because he would give us journal questions we had to answer and the only way to get them was in class.",0
I had him first semester freshman year and I'm still talking about him. Great professor.,1
"She cares a lot about math and that future students will actually enjoy math so that is super good to know she cares. The assignments this semester have been changed/cancelled a few times due to confusion with requirements. Other than that, she is knowledgeable and definitely wants participation. Very understanding!",1
"Very nice professor, but there was some stuff that he wasn't knowledgeable about regarding the class he was teaching. I guess it's cause it was his first time teaching CIS100. The class was an easy A, I feel like I didn't learn much. Gives a test on Word, Excel, Access, and a PowerPoint project.",1
I liked Dr. Prasad for chemistry. She is really good at lecturing and helps students to understand difficult concepts. She loves participation and likes when students work problems on the board. She does not give out test reviews and rarely reviews for the test so your notes have to be clear and accurate to study.,1
"Took this class as a fast track online class and it was super easy. Assignments every week but you can do them with ease. The quiz website that he uses lets you take the quiz as many times as you want till you get 100 which is super easy to boost your grade. Although online, it seems like he really cares about his students and subject",1
"He literally just reads off the slides. If you want to pass, ditch the book and just pay attention to his lecture slides. He gives study guides, which are useless, because they're very vague. THERE IS A LOT OF MATERIAL. He's the only professor that teaches this class so there is no way of avoiding him. ",0
She is a very fast pace teacher. Her tests are MUCH harder than what she teaches in class. She provides no grading curve or extra credit. During drop/add more than half of my class left. I would not advise taking her class.,0
"This class is surprisingly a little  difficult for a drama class. There were way to many things to do. Midterm was horrible and gave no type of review. I was confused half of the time the whole semester. Almost everyone failed badly. Attendance is mandatory. Overall, she was a good professor.",1
"Super nice and understanding. Take good notes and study the night before the test and you'll be good. 10/10 would recommend her, easiest class ever.",1
Do NOT take this Professor!!! He is passionless and does NOT teach well. You will sit for literally 2 hours in a ZOOM class and listen to the MOST boring lectures... on top of that he does NOT follow logic and is a VERY tough grader... he approaches religious teaching in a bizarre scientific or philosophical way and not how it actually is...,0
"If you have, a mother who has given birth within the past year of starting the class, a toddler, two children, a teenager, a middle-aged adult, and finally an elderly person all ready to be assessed or interview readily than this class is for you! She's extremely disorganized, and teaches her unproven, controversial political beliefs as fact",0
One of the worst teachers I have had in my life. He doesn't explain the topics thoroughly at all and he expects students to know the answers. I've never even took the time before to rate a professor but this professor is so bad I need to let other future students aware to stay away. Teaching is not for him and he is setting students up for failure,0
"He is nice enough and discussions can be lively. However, this class shouldn't be required for anyone 25 or older.  Assignments and due dates are not clearly defined (they don't match the syllabus). ""Do a writing on metacognition"". Ok, what about it? Specifics would be nice. Too many papers to write overall, got tiresome. Also, don't buy Outliers.",0
"Notes/lectures on the website. HW and projects get progressively harder. HW eventually strays away from the notes, so it gets frustrating to find answers. Can be rude on random days. Exams are multiple choice. Just study off the past exams he gives. Curve is dependent on how smart the top 1/3 are as 1/3 gets A. No guidance on Proj after part 1.",0
"Professor Zimmerman is the worst teacher that I have had at UMD so far. She reads straight from the power point lectures, and makes what could be potentially interesting information, boring. She is also unorganized and completely useless when it comes to using any online tools for her class. Avoid if possible.",0
"Ning is difficult, nigh impossible to learn from.  He outright lacks the ability to communicate ideas clearly,  does not set clear expectations or plans for his course, jump from topic to topic while teaching, repeats himself over and over again (and not in a helpful way) and just appears to be doing the absolute minimum required as a teacher.  ",0
"This professor is unnecessarily critical. If you don't submit assignments exactly the way he tells you he will not give you a grade, even if you turn it in on time. On exam day my grandmother had her funeral and even after showing him proof of her obituary he wouldn't let me take the exam. This guy makes no exceptions. withdraw if life gets tough",0
Excellent professor. Lectures are always fun and interesting. Attending lecture is not enough to do well in the class; you must read the textbook too. Also he is very reasonable when it comes to grading papers.,1
worst professor ive ever had. definitely dont take her unless you want to hate your life. i regret taking her class and wish i took either a different professor with it or just a different class overall,0
Most classes were a lecture presentation format. Weekly quizzes and discussions plus 3 out of class experiences were required. She is pretty flexible if you ask about deadlines and we played jeopardy a few times.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAMP! If he is the only professor available, wait until next semester. He seems great and wonderful until after the last day of dropping the class before having to pay. On one writing I decided to try and be a good student and find the entire book of the section the reading came out of and he counted off, DONT TAKE HIM!!",0
I honestly don't know where these reviews are coming from. She is one of the worst teachers here at SUNY Geneseo and wouldn't be surprised if she got fired. Her lectures are VERY boring and she doesn't teach you a single thing. Be prepared for living hell...,0
"I took Professor Lockharts class online as a Summer class. He has deadlines on every assignment but if you do not turn it in, he is very understanding. Will let you turn in late. Easy class if you keep up with it. Dont get behind. Recommend.",1
Professor Bazil was a ghost. He never responded to anybody's emails. The assignments weren't too difficult but then again he ended up cutting our class short because of COVID. I wasn't mad at it since I had a good grade but I can't imagine being someone who had a bad grade b/c all the other assignments had been cancelled. I would've been upset.,0
"Honestly, he is amazing for a TWU prof. He manages to integrate gen z humor and not make you cringe which is extremely rare. If you took history in high school you will do extremely well since this course scrapes the surface of western history. He is very clear in what he wants and wants you to succeed. However, there is quite a bit of reading.",1
She is Amazing. Very encouraging and helpful. I wish I could have her for my next math class.,1
"Would give the weeks assignments halfway through the week, it's December 24th and the most recent assignment entered is from September. Kept on pushing back deadlines and essentially made the class last until December 23rd. Easy class. Pretty funny but posts some kind cringe anime memes but if that's your thing then go for it.",0
"If you are not already EXTREMELY proficient in math, then expect to be failing this class. His reviews are NOTHING like the tests and the difficulty for the tests are upped tenfold. The only reason I ever got anything done in the class is because my boyfriend knows math. I did not learn a thing from this class other than how to fail miserably.",0
"He's not the best at teaching, and he doesn't take into account that students typically are able to use PHIL 140 as a mark-booster. The way he has formatted this class isn't representative of how most 140 classes are, as there is a term paper (worth 30%), discussion posts and the final has an essay portion as well. Taking this class was a mistake.",0
"The quarter is very lopsided, all your points are earned in the last few weeks when she assigns a ton. She is very vague about what you should do on assignments.",0
"Wildlife Management is a fun and engaging course. Professor Donahue is kind and understanding. She supports all her ""kids"" to their greatest potential. If you show up and participate, you will find this class enjoyable and valuable. You will enjoy field trips for labs and learn so much about the wildlife in our area and around the country.",1
"Absolutely horrible professor. Her tests literally have incorrect law. Asked multiple attorneys her test questions after, and they confirmed. Avoid her if possible.",0
"He is terrible. Tests are your entire grade and the tests are nothing like what he teaches. One mistake and you're screwed. Poor english, poor teacher overall. Avoid this teacher.",0
"Good prof, funny, but tends to favor the males more. Hard to approach at times, but will usually help.",1
Hawkins will be late for almost all the classes. Will bully students by calling them out infant of the class. Half of the class got a F- on midterm. Started the class with 25ish students probably 12 by the end of the semester. Avoid her class unless you like regurgitating her thoughts and being swimming in homework and readings.,0
"Hes honestly very rude, he will spend at least 15 minutes out of every lecture complaining about the everyone in the class. Final exam is 40% of the final grade, better read the book because his lectures make no sense.",0
I took Eng. 101 and 102 with Dr. Ferriera and she is the BEST! She is very caring and wants you to succeed. She's easy going and funny. She is not tough at all but you should participate in class and do the work she assigns. You also do group work which is great. Amazing lectures!. I got an A in both classes. EASY CLASS!,1
"Professor Paquette's online class has clear grading criteria and doable assignments on interesting topics. To get an A, you should post two paragraph discussion posts and reply to 2 people once a week and read the assigned articles. Also, make use of saddleback's online paper center, they give good feedback on essays.",1
AMAZING TEACHER!!!! As a transfer student Ive had a lot of exposure to many teaching styles and Prof Schore is by far the most incredible teacher Ive had thus far. Yes it is ochem so youre going to have to try! But he teaches so well and Thoroughly that the material will be enjoyable to you (he helped write the book AKA READ THE B O O K),1
I found that Doug was very difficult to deal with as he does not listen to his students.  He is too easy on the slackers by giving them lots of breaks but for those who do their work on time it's very frustrating.,0
"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Makes you buy his textbook that he wrote, cash only, and it's FULL of errors . Always late to class, disorganized, and wastes most lectures. He can't solve many of his own examples during class--totally incompetent! Doesn't know what he's doing and utterly atrocious at teaching. Gets angry/yells in class if you ask questions.",0
She gives an unnecessary amount of homework and takes forever to grade it. I always dreaded going to her class but she did cancel quite often.,0
I thought he was a great professor. He had a lot of knowledge and was really excited about what he was teaching. Kept it interesting. A little strict but kept us in line,1
Forces students to talk even if you don't want to. Kind of rude for no reason and is seen on her phone via the reflection of her glasses when students are presenting on Zoom. She doesn't seem interested whatsoever. This is a completely student-taught class so don't take it if you wanna hear boring students present work they could care less about.,0
"She does not give any feedback after homework and tests. This is an online class and without feedbacks, you cannot easily do corrections and prepare for exams. She does not care about what situation you are in (COVID) and she will gladly give you an F and when you ask for corrections she wouldn't give them to you because she is too lazy to do them.",0
"I would totally recommend taking this class. I took it only to fulfill my art requirement, but I really enjoyed the class. She is a really easy grader, and she barely gives any work. There's a discussion post and a quiz every week, and there are 3-4 really easy projects in the whole class. Taking this class has made me interested in photography.",1
"The class itself was very boring and not enjoyable in very many aspects.  I learned more by reading the material than I did by discussing the ideas with both the professor and the class.  For English majors, a class with her is inevitable.  She may not be the most personable person around, but if you focus on academics, you should be fine.",0
"Dr. Simerka is fabulous. Her class certainly requires a bit of reading. However, 53H is an honors level course so this should come as no real surprise. She is super passionate about the class and genuinely cares about her students.",1
"Really a great professor, always super prepared. Exams were easy as long as you went to lecture, nobody really ever did the assigned reading. Very accessible outside class and very invested in all of her students. Definitely going to try to take another class with her at some point.",1
"If you want to fall asleep in class you should really take him for english. He talks waaay too much, but nothing he says makes sense. He leaves too much work and theres alot of reading, talks more about history than anything else. Does not know how to teach I dropped his class and if you are smart you will too!",0
"Her class is a lot of work, be prepared to study for a few hours every day. She writes all her notes on the board, everything she writes is on the quizzes and test. There are 10 quizzes each week that equal to one test grade. There are 4 test and 3 lab practicals. She drops the lowest grade. Has open lab and will go over anything you need help with",1
He seems to love his job and is more then willing to help you be successful.,1
"Her tests are very poorly done, are often very confusing and seem that every answer could be right. The material is not hard, but the tests are not clear and becomes problematic.  Bring snacks and coffee to stay awake in class. she gets very off topic very easily and talks a lot about her self. no powerpoint or anything just her talking for 3 hours",0
"She is very knowledgeable about pediatric material and her power points are very clear.  She expects you to read the book but only the parts that she discusses in the power points and she gives you hints throughout the class on what might show up on the test.  Very fair tests!  Great professor, I wish all the nursing profs were like her!",1
"It is a challenging class considering I have not taken chemistry in years , but he's willing to help you out if you show effort. The lectures are long , but make sure you pay attention in class and stay on top of your work.",1
"Unclear instructions given for projects. She is unwilling to help if you are having difficulty understanding. She taught a color theory class without using color, she would only verbally describe projects. She did not enforce any deadlines, so most students did not have their work done for critiques and she would critique unfinished projects.",0
"Did not teach us, let the textbook teach us (30 pages each chapter). Weekly homework assignments were like Quizlet. All exams were about super specific info inside the textbook. Easy A for the most part, but damn, I did not learn anything.",0
Gerard is awesome. Take her!,1
"Intro to programming and problem solving. Midterm: 30% and final: 35%. Probably the toughest class to take. Assignments 20% but there's no help. There's no tutorial or anything, and book doesn't help. He expects you to figure out java coding by yourself. Lets just say if you have no idea about programming then you will fail.",0
"If you are thoughtful with your responses, you will do good in this class. There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. He replies to emails quickly.",1
I took the online version over 4 weeks during the summer. He divides the class up into learning modules so it is pretty easy. You have to watch 5 hours of videos and write a paper on what you observed and then you have to observe a classes on your own for five hours. It is not that hard. He's a good teacher take him.,1
"I don't understand how he grades the tests, but it is so confusing every time I received my grade. Never told you the formate of term tests and exams. Although marks assigned on each question (multiple choice) are equally weighted, the level of difficulty has not matched the marks.",0
I definitely do NOT reccomend this professor. his quizzes had nothing to do with the material learned in class and his loud teaching style makes it hard to comprehend,0
Dr. Henton is probably one of my favorite teachers. She wants you to do well and is always available to help. She offers extra credit and other opportunities to get a good grade. You have to work hard but its a good class!,1
I did not really understand her explanations during the lectures. Better off studying on your own.,0
"The way the professor set up the discussion boards. Rather than just asking us to regurgitate the information back to her, she asked for our perspectives about each subject we were learning. It created some great discussions between classmates.  It was on line, but I loved this class.",1
"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",0
"Very sweet and helpful. Seems like a professional in her field. But she says one thing and then later says and does the opposite. Unreasonably tough grader. The class had some of the most interesting topics for me ever, and the most annoying teacher ever.",0
"I had her as a on campus class before COVID. We transitioned to online and she still managed to make the class easy. She was easy to access outside of class and made the course load very simple. Completely recommend!!!! Also, really adorable personality",1
I have this class for three hours and I never get bored!,1
Matt's lectures were really interesting and he was really helpful outside of class.,1
One of the best i've had. Love this guy he's great to talk to and always helpful. Loved the projects and activities. Can't wait for next class with him.,1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this teacher. I wish he taught Calculus as well!,1
Most stressful course ever.,0
Great teacher. She is super helpful and really cares about her students. It is a flipped classroom so you learn at home and do exercises in class.,1
I would not recommend taking this class online. It is a HUGE time commitment. It will not be the kind of class that you can just blow through.,0
Profesor Nesvig was such a great teacher. It was such an amazing experience to go to his class. He always explained his subjects with details and you can tell that he put many years and time into perfecting his lesson plan. It was not a hard class at all; the quizzes were super easy just a few short-answer questions. Awesome class.,1
"If you want to be bored out of your mind every class then definatly take Mr. Wisla. He's so nice and means well but it is incredibally hard to pay attentiion in class and he constantly calls on people so if you dont pay attention (which no one ever does) get ready to feel like you do after your mom says ""im not mad, im just disappointed.""",0
"He does a good job, is helpful, and easy to get along with.  He expects the students to carry their own wieght.  I guess that must make him bad.",1
"The reading material this professor requires is outrageous. There was no textbook for my course by he posted 10 or more articles a day that he expected the students to read. Some articles were as little as 5-10 pages but many were 20 pages+. If you have the option to take another professor, I encourage it!",1
pretty easy teacher but man boring. I couldn't help sleeping. I would have to leave to buy chocolate just to stay awake in that class. If he made the class more interesting maybe I would have taken the time to actually go to it. He is a very lenient teacher and I did learn alot but only when I was awake.,1
Florencia is one of the nicest teachers you will ever have.  She makes the class interesting and engaging.  Even if you are not very good at spanish she will help you learn.  Very fair grader.,1
"Dr. Weston is a very kind person and responds quickly. Most of the assignments were graded by CA's, but they were more lenient. The amount of reading is insane! If you work full-time this class can be a lot, but it is doable. The final is multiple choice and then a project which I think she should've left out. She does give a study guide so study.",1
"His lectures are funny, but no need to attend. Graded on 4 main projects. Group projects graded more leniently, but the two projects done alone are really harsh. Tries to be Cool Guy, occasionally succeeds. Makes weirdly sexist remarks, tried to convince class that female brains are physically different, which makes them good at feminine stuff.",1
"Mrs. Fountain is a super nice teacher.  Although you have to work for your grades in there, she doesn't give unfair grades.  She is very good at keeping you interested during lectures, and she will help you with your speeches if you just ask for help.  She wants you to make a good grade, but she won't give it to you if you don't deserve it.  ",1
"Many love his classes, but I find his credulous assent to every Marian apparition, save for the most obviously bogus, to be very burdensome. It's one thing to have devotion to Mary, but he borderlines on a kind of blind fanaticism. Also some of the texts you read are highly dubious and are not at all rigorously reasoned. He hates to be questioned.",0
"Not very well prepared for class.  We spent most of the class time waiting on him to get his stuff ready and the rest of it talking about things that didn't apply to anything remotely related to the course material.  Tests somewhat difficult, but not too bad.",0
Prof. Lane had one of the most straight-forward classes I've had. She makes sure to walk you through/thoroughly explain every assignment before making you do it on your own. She also gives unlimited tries on quizzes and assessments so there is no excuse for bad grades. Do your work and you are guaranteed a good grade.,1
The best professor I have every had. Absolutely amazing.,1
great person but awful professor. she never lets you out a second early and be ready for a huge homework load.  she seems to think that her class is the only one students take.  if you don't want to be stressed out and annoyed all semester DONT take her,0
"I took Professor Ferrero for Biology and she was amazing. She lectures every class and there's a presentation due at the end of the semester. She's really nice and understanding and she always explains to you if you need help. Tests are okay, not too bad, I usually got a B. Study the review!",1
Garrisi Sensei  inspired me to push myself and gave me lots of tips for memorizing  kanji and vocab. We communicated through email and she always answered my questions the same day it seems. I thought she was very generous with her time when she stayed after to help me and  a couple of other students. I better get  her next semester she's awesome!,1
"Old school... in the sense that class is confusing and there is very little structure or elaboration if you are struggling with something. Really terrific guy, but his class just went right over my head despite great effort.",0
"Although personally I liked him, and I thought that he was super passionate about science, a lot of times I felt like he couldn't properly explain concepts to us. Nice guy, but I'm not sure I'd take him again unless I have to. ",0
"The final was ridiculously hard for this class. None of the type of problems on the exam were ever given to the students as homework, practice, or web problems. It's almost like he needed to lower the average grade of the class.",0
"CLASS WAS AMAZING MUST SHARE WITH YOU ALL! You feel like getting educated & being open-minded then this class will be fun! Every class will be eye-opening & full of interesting facts. She is very sweet, cool & knowledgeable! The class itself: No homework, Midterm & Final, Hands On Classwork, Team Work. Tip: Study Presentations & Notes often",1
He was good at the beginning. Then began losing control and getting mad whenever you asked questions.,0
"She barely teaches the material that is on tests and she barely gives any feedback on exams, homework and labs.",0
"Very boring and long lectures, gives homework that is not interesting at all and makes you not want to draw. doesnt ever give As on homework",0
Horrible experience. Bad overall. You'll be better off avoiding this missile if you can. Good luck if you do take her.,0
I have yet to get below a B in any college course or online course I have taken. Yet this class makes absolute no sense and doesn't give clear instructions at all. All I have to say if you take this class is GOOD LUCK,0
"Easy teacher, just make sure you do all the class work and study for test. She even gives you a study guide.",1
She manages to turn an interesting subject into an arduous journey through monotony. Her accent cuts right through you and trying to take notes is beyond frustrating. Ridiculous amounts of reading that really doesn't provide a relevant look at current culture.,0
"Great professor; you have to listen and you have to work to do well, but he's passionate about his field and it really flows over into his lectures. Recommend all the way.",1
"Like someone else said, show-up and try, and you'll pass. You also learn some pretty cool ninja skillz.",1
"Don't take this class, especially online. Can't learn anything, I've gone to the resource center and still get none of it. I've spent at least 50 hours on homework and have spent more than that trying to learn the material with no success. Homework only accounts for 25 percent of grades rest are on his impossible tests.",0
Just so very very bad. Absolutely no pride or respect put into the course it will destroy your college career take somebody else stay away from Professor Thompson. So boring Not very informative pretty much one of the worst slapped together courses Ive ever seen. Just so awful its beyond words.,0
"If you enjoy taking 3 hour tests online that requires u to memorize 3-4 chapters of the book plus his power points and theeen an in class quiz the day after the online test which you know ur gonna fail because its so hard he even knows it himself, take him :) Other than that he is a very knowledgable man and you will learn a lot about business lol",0
he is the worse teacher i had never seen in my student life. i was so unlucky to take his class.,0
Class was hard and teacher went off on random talks about her views. I wish I could say something good about the teacher but it was the worst experience in my college career.  If you want less stress and more time in your life than please dont take this teacher.,0
"This professor is honestly one of the most chill professors I've ever had. He made the class extremely interesting and applicable to the real world. Show up to class because the reflections are only 5 points but impact your grade because the class is only out of 100 points, all of the reflections are super easy",1
"I am not an English person and just took this class because I had too. Dr. Orser was very kind and helpful. She is tough but fair marker. I also highly suggest participating when you can I think helped my mark for sure. Her midterm and exam were easier than expected, I would study specifics from stories.",1
"Wade is really easy going and good about giving feedback! We often talk while practicing guitar and he is really fun to talk with! If you dont know a lot about music it will be harder as he isnt that great at teaching how to sight read, however still is a really great teacher!",1
Terrible attitude toward students. Unprofessional. Severely unorganized. I would avoid this professor completely.,0
"Doesnt use cuLearn to release grades & requires students to hand in hard copies of all assignments which wastes time & is outdated. There is only 1 knowledgeable TA & the others are basically useless. The prof doesnt answer emails professionally, nor is he helpful in office hours or explaining concepts during lecture.",0
"He was a great professor, when going to class if you had difficulty he further explained it. A easy A ,just do the work if have any question ask him and he has no problem explaining what he wants done for the assignment. I would definitely take him again for another class.",1
She is a sweet woman but a terrible professor she expects you to remember every word she says in lecture or you will get points taken off of the quizzes. There is 4 papers one is in class and she expects it to be just as good as the ones you do at home. She also is all over the place in lecture. Again she is a sweet woman but not understanding!,0
Nominally bad at giving feedback on papers and pop quizzes do not focus on the message the story is trying to convey. Grading is also inconsistent and does not give much in the way of feedback.,0
"Professor taught nothing, just assigned textbook readings and you have to purchase the outdated textbook. Quizzes are based on some outdated incorrect information. Learned a lot from the course but not because of the professor. Did not answer emails on time, if he answered them at all. Unclear guidelines for assignments. Would never take again.",0
"Kubota sensei is on top of it!  She keeps us engaged as well well as stimulated!  She reviews and repeats, which some people complain about.. but that is what learning a language is all about!  She is very funny and very nice.. and totemo genki desu!",1
Textbook is good study/practice aid but not mandatory. Grade consists of 4 unit exams only. Beware!!! Needed class for major but difficult. one mistake can ruin your chances.,1
Tough grader!,1
"Wayyyyy to easy, didn't learn a thing, teacher barely teaches. Do the random assignments he gives, get an A, you won't learn a thing, and youll be confused for most of the class. Really nice guy, dont get me wrong, but not very good at teaching.",0
"patty patty patty, what a woman! she's incredibly smart and i love her lectures. you can tell she really loves what she does. she's super hard, like, over the top hard, but she's just trying to give you the necessary tools to proceed with your degree.",1
"Honestly, it went from DOWN to UGLY. It started weak and could have ended pretty bad. I didn't think college teachers would go on every single class talking about their family, their weekends, their nephews and how they're queen of a subject when they can't even help you right and can't answer their own quizzes. Just read the BOOK and take NOTES!",0
"Kander is hands down the best professor i've had at eastern thus far. Not only is her class ridiculously easy, but fascinating as well. She will open your mind. She is intelligent, accepting, caring, funny, and one of the sweetest teachers i've ever met.",1
soso =(,0
He is excellent..He knows his stuff. He is very caring and understanding of his students. He makes the time fly!! If you want a really good teacher for Psychology Please take him..He is really the best.,1
Super nice! Take him if you want an easy pass. Homework is there for practice but not mandatory. Offers extra credit on almost every quiz. PRINT OUT THE CHEAT SHEETS ASAP!,1
"She rocks. Really cares about her students. Had high expectations but is very fair. Super helpful, just enrolled in my 3rd class with her.",1
Professor Aizura's class structure is pointless and makes it so that you can get a really bad grade by missing classes where he has an in class assignment (20%) and discussion posts (also 20%). It's counterintuitive and he will ignore your emails when you need his answer the most. Class content is interested but the readings are soooo long.,0
"Hes a nice man, but this was the worst class Ive ever taken. The first 1/4 of the semester was a waste because he quizzed the class on the different edition of the book. Class average was a mid/low C at the time of the final. Syllabus is inaccurate and the final exam was cumulative without a study guide. Do not take this class.",0
"Excellent teacher, and well, probably cannot describe him any better than others have. The final grade is based on a midterm and a final, with the final being worth more than the midterm. There are no homework assignments. You just need to know your stuff. THE 305 with him is worth taking, whether for a free elective or for a core requirement.",1
"He is easy to understand, and if you bring a question to him during his office hours he will go in depth and you will completely understand it. His biggest con is that he doesn't go over the basics of each section enough and jumps into example problems immediately. Overall a good teacher and as long as you put in the work you should you'll be fine.",1
"You can't avoid taking him, but be ready to self-teach. Lectures are confusing and meandering. Go to office hours with questions to do well. No curve so hard to get a good grade. Very old-fashioned type teacher.",0
"too much assignments and too much quiz, she gave a unclear grading criteria to judge your paper, I promise, she is the worst English professor.",0
"WORST CLASS EVER!!! On top of being extremely condescending and constantly embarrassing students in the class, we have no mark going into our exam. Our exam is tomorrow and we just got an email that she hasnt finished marking our FIRST ESSAY (which was due in FEBRUARY). As well as 2 or 3am emails with assignments to have completed for the next day",0
Willing to help if you ask for it but very tough grader. Class was not enjoyable because of the slow pace and boring content.,0
"Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor. His teaching style is refreshing, as he always makes us think thoughtfully about why history is taught in a certain way. His lectures are interesting and his jokes were always funny. Take good notes, listen during lecture, use his study guides, read all of the books. It's not as bad as it sounds. He's the best!",1
She arbitrarily takes points off for small things that don't even affect the final answer. Very confusing and rude when students ask her questions she thinks they should know. It's tough material but she flies through it and doesn't help that much. She was also gone for a month and we had a sub and she didn't review what we all basically failed. ,0
"If you care about just passing this course, try to get a hold of old exams and keep re-doing them over and over again. If you actually want to learn the content, the lectures are very heavy and he moves very fast. So try to spend 1 hr everyday studying the lectures and understanding everything. The homework is very difficult, so most people cheat",0
Mrs. Noland is very merciful when it comes to grading and getting assignments done. One thing that I like about her is that shell nod and mouth to you Good Job when youre finished saying a speech. Shes pretty encouraging and honest when it comes to the end of speeches. She also does a few class games that really benefits public speaking.,1
"She is the WORST PROFESSOR I have ever had! If you wanted to go to a class where the teacher bullies you then take her if not find a way out of it. I hated going to her class. The content was not hard, but you need to make sure you do the work her way or she will take points off. Be sure to read her questions multiple times!!!",0
He is pretty tough but if you show up and seem like you are trying he will give you a decent grade. I did horrible on the labs but the sign in sheet got me a B- in the class.,0
"Professor. Lopez is an awesome Professor. He conveys the very dry and boring information of the course into more understandable and entertaining terms. Tests come straight from the slides in class, they aren't just straight memorization, you do have to apply what you learn, but it's still a pretty easy class",1
"Best professor Ive ever had. This was the 2nd time she was my professor and for the 2 courses that Ive had her in, shes been nothing more than supportive and understanding. Her lectures may not always be engaging but shes a very easy marker and shes willing to give out extensions if needed.",1
"She will hate your scripts, I tried to make the one that she would like, but I failed.  I took it with another teacher, I got an A.",0
Dr. K is great. He was always willing to stick around and answer questions or just talk about anything to do microbiology. He was more then willing to look up answers to questions  we asked in class if he didn't know a particular fact.   There is alot of info just keep up on the reading and take advantage of easy points when they are offered.,1
"Rossi is my department head and is the most unorganized human being I've ever seen.  His lectures revolve only around social mobility, and he  emails readings sometimes an hour before they're due.  I read more for this than my 400 level courses, and I walk away with so much less from this stupid course.  A waste of a History major's time.",0
"Prof. Elliott is super.  She has interesting and engaging discussions and keeps them moving, mostly (occasionally they drag but rarely).  She is a hard grader, but you will have ample opportunities to discuss your paper with her.  Her office always seems to be open.  She's great.  Take a class from her!",1
She was by far the best math teacher Ive ever had. Is attentive to everyones questions and will answer them fully and make sure you understand the topic before moving on. Sad that she is moving away but incredible experience to have. Makes learning math fun.,1
"While it is a tough class for most, he takes his time and explains everything multiple times. Exams aren't hard if you study and he does grade on a curve. I recommend this professor.",1
Dr. Galan is super easy. I hate history and I have made all a's. We have done 2 book and 2 film reviews. Write something decent and you'll be fine. Pretty much impossible to fail his class.,1
I learned a lot about the world of corrections. You have 4 papers and 1 power point presentation to do in this class. All of them are not that hard as long as you do the research. Professor Valltos is their if you need any help or clarification on the projects. I recommend taking any of his classes if you get a chance.,1
"I had her for calc 1 in the fall. She takes attendance and has quizzes almost every day, but they are to prove to her that you understand the material. I didn't learn anything though because I had calc in high school and learned it a there. She's really a nice lady and makes a huge effort to help you pass.",1
"3 exams, and a map quiz. Theres an app you have to purchase about $25 where you do you're homework and where she takes attendance on she also does mini quizzes during lecture so don't miss class. Her lectures are heavy and will put you to sleep. She does seem passionate about history though and theres extra credit.",0
He is the best professor I have ever had. I enjoy his lectures and he gives you all of the material you need for exams. Study for the exams because there are only four and there are no other grades for this class.,1
"students do more teaching then teacher.  even if the student is wrong the teacher doesn't even correct the students. class average for midterm is 68%, most people are failing. I have two As and a B in my other classes and I am barley passing with a C.  takes forever to grade. only half way though semester and not liking it.",0
no a good idea!,0
By far the hardest class I have ever taken. Never have liked his attitude. Don't be fooled by his niceness on day one. He belittles students in class for asking questions. LOTS of papers due that take tons of time. Be prepared. Worst teacher I've ever had. You won't feel confident in your work. Does not encourage you and makes you hate  the subject,0
"Data and File Structures, req for Computer Science majors. Much independent work in this class; sink or swim on how diligently you pursue understanding. In class, Dr. Kaminski covers material quickly. If you don't understand, ask during class or office hrs. Dr. Kaminski can provide you with her famous diagrams and pseudocode.",1
"One of the more entertainIng classes I've had. 2 essay tests straight from the readings (which are dry), two 3 page papers, and a conference review. He's unapologetically himself, which tends towards the self-congratulating, unhelpful side of things. I don't think anything else could be said but that I would definitely without a doubt take it again",0
"Freshmans, be aware. Her class is more designed for grad students. Her lecture are very particular and can be so so so hard to follow. I had her for my freshman Inquiry and I did not learn anything from this class. We talked about so much subject, none of them had to do with the class subject. EXTREMLY nice woman though. Tries her best to help.",1
"It's very rare to find a professor with this degree of personability and expertise. Professor Walling has a range tools to offer his students; from academic advising, to a robust understanding of the coursework, to a deep well of field experience. I took 2 of the courses he offered, and would jump at the chance to take another.",1
"It's a shame that such an interesting topic can be ruined by such a monotone and unenthusiastic professor, never mind the fact that his class is disorganized and often crammed. He gives zero feedback on graded assignments and it is hard to take a professor seriously who constantly makes grammatical errors in his lecture materials. He is very nice.",0
"Nice lady, very helpful, and very easy to work with. Course consists of a midterm letter, a presentation, and a 20 page final(double spaced with pics and sources). She really likes to see ALOT of research, but doesnt expect you to write a novel(writing for engineers). Id definately take her again.",1
"Totally awful semester, we had two exams back to back one last exam and the final not to mention that the final itself was 124 questions. Thats total burnout, dont recommend this professor at all save yourself from a headache.",0
"She is a awesome professor! Only have to write one big paper, but you write it through the whole semester. Test and pretty easy and straight forward, and if you attend the study session before the exam she will give you everything to study for. She is easy to get a hold of and has lots of office hours.",1
"WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD! IF YOU HAVE TO DELAY GRADUATION TO AVOID HIM, ITS WORTH IT BECAUSE YOU WILL STRUGGLE & FAIL ANYWAY! doesn't show you how to work out a problem, just scribbles all over the board and mumbles/trails off, no structure to his lectures, gives problems on tests that you've never seen before. 90% of my class failed or go D's",0
Great Professor! At the end of the semester if youve missed a certain number of times your letter grade is dropped. He also gives alot of pop quizzes. If you show up to class they are easy and so are the tests. You cannot make up anything but if you know you will miss he lets you take stuff early,1
"Great teacher, super helpful and really nice. There were a lot of projects but if you followed the rubric then he was a pretty easy grader.",1
"Professor was very intelligent about her subject, however, her teaching style was not fit for such a small class. Also, textbook reading was not only a requirement, we would be required to read in depth and analyze information, almost always requiring a second or third read to answer quizzes correctly. Homework was also extremely difficult.",0
"Unrealistic expectations for intermediate German. Does not teach, just assigns an obscene amount of weekly homework that does not help on tests (or learning for that matter). Class focuses on diagramming sentences instead of learning to speak and read German. She is out to get everyone. Hated it. Withdrew. Choose a different language.",0
Awesome Professor! Helpful and knowledgeable.,1
One of the best choices I made was choosing her as a teacher. She is not a hard teacher. She gives good feedback and is clear on the assignments she wants. With the class being online she also allowed a good chunk of time for each assignment to be due.,1
"His a good teacher. He grades test very fast. Test are not too hard, but it'z smart to study some.",1
"Is confusing when he speaks. Seems to speak in code. Teaches the language like a science, he really likes to break apart every part of the sentence and ask questions about it. He calls on you to answer his questions even if you dont want to. I would avoid him if you have the choice. Kind of ruined my interest in the french language.",0
Enjoyed the class!,1
"Here's the deal. If you enjoy astronomy, this class is great. Its a lot of stuff you've learned in HS and before. In my case, I always went to class but did other work. He givea you all the questions word for word on the test in the guides. Google questions, get answers, memorize and get A.  5 mandatory, random attendance. Drops lowest test. ",1
"Great Professor, So sweet. Really cares about the world, and the humans in it. Lots of reading: 3 readings a week & DB due for each reading. She is very accommodating. If u need extra time, just email her. She wants everyone to succeed. Easy going. Easy work, just very time consuming. Open discussions during class.",1
It is truly amazing how this professor receives a paycheck. She chooses to meet via zoom with her students once a month and expects her students to read chapter after chapter in preparation for her exams. Her meetings are completely worthless and is very rude. I can't believe I spent my own money taking this course. Worthless.,0
"Prof Epstein is a nice guy and clearly smart, but has NO idea how to teach in a concise manner. His lectures were all over the place, he didn't hold office hours and was hard to get ahold of, and the material on the exams wasn't made clear beforehand. DO NOT take this class if you're just looking for distribution credit/not interested in ling",0
"I would recommend this class, however it is boring  but theres only 1 assignment and 2 tests (midterm and final). As long as you study the review sheet he gives, you should be good. ",1
"idk what to say theres 0 connection between her and students everything is done by the tas, she will stop by tutorials and is easy to set up meetings with but she will tell u 1 thing and that ta will say another, the course is disorganized but at least u don't even gotta pay attention to the lectures cus no final exam or midterm",0
"Overbearing, pompous, and shortsighted. That's to say the least. I work twenty five hours a week off campus and was unlucky enough to have two bouts with MRSA, and she still gave me a bad attendance grade, regardless of my ER papers from the hospital. She's abrasive, very hard grader, and unrelenting. Do not take her unless you are a masochist.",1
"Took her for the first online art course.  I thought she was very organized.  She is an artist but does not expect her students to be artists so her critiques are gentle,hlepful and kind.  If you didn't get an A, you just didn't do anything.  I highly recommend online course.  You only put in about 2 hours per week.",1
"The class is not hard but requires some effort due to the public speaking specifics. She is helpful, nice and tries hard to make it easier for you. I would recommend her, even though this is not the best communications class I've taken.",1
Professor Mark was an extremely hard professor. He would always give us busy work and then walk out of the class. He is not very helpful. I am a B student and I am really struggling to pass this course. I would advise taking another professor if you can.,0
"The professor is very compassionate and resourceful. If you're stuck on an assignment, he provides a lot of good feedback and is willing to devote his time to assist his students. There are 5 quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam.",1
Not the best. So- so,0
"expects you to know a lot of material. should expect to do even more research outside of what him and the textbook give you if you hope to do well. his exam questions are worded like puzzles that make it difficult to accurately answer the question. going to the lectures isn't required, but if you hope to do well in the class, you should go. ",0
"DONT TAKE HER. VERY UNPREPARED, ALL OVER THE PLACE. DOESNT TEACH. EXPECTS YOU TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN. THIS SHOULD BE AN ONLINE CLASS. SERIOUSLY.",0
"omph! what a difficult class. I'm so glad it's over! But also glad I took from HIM. comprehensive. willing to start from where other teachers left off to make sure you truly understand what you need to know before you graduate. would highly recommend, but pull up your bootstraps and expect to earn the grade you receive.",1
"The test are worth 70% of our grade and dont follow his lectures. He promised a large curve and didnt follow through, which was annoying since this class is lecture heavy and moved to be remote. A 1% curve is probably the stupidest thing ive ever seen especially when the average for each of the exam was below a C.",0
"He get's side tracked often and doesn't ""teach"" much Half of the class dropped before the drop date because he never gave told us our grades and was never available outside the class Homework heavy but don't except him to tell you when it is due or even how to work the website because he doesn't know how to use the website at all although it is req",0
"Not the best. Great guy with interesting life stories, but not the best teacher. Classes are unorganized, tests are awful and hard and make up most of your grade. Attendance is mandatory and he has no sympathy for outside circumstances. 5 question quizzes on every chapter. Do the reading and then some. Don't take him, he killed my GPA :(",0
"Though Dan has a tendency to critique harshly as a project progresses, he is often considerate of effort put forth and reception of suggestions when grading. Overall he is extremely kind hearted and just wants to see you improve. He does tend to be a bit old fashioned in some design aspects.",1
He is rude and put you down.,0
"I came in HATING math but after taking the class with Prof Wells I understood the material very well. Show up to class, do the work, and Id recommend visitng the tutoring center if you dont have the time to visit her during her office hours. Class is easy as long as you put in your time and effort. Prof Wells is amazing 10/10 recommended.",1
"Tom is on of the many reasons why I love learning about sociology. His class was hands down the most challenging class that I have taken at ISU and he requires an immense amount of work from his students but you just have to trust him and his ways of teaching. He's a professor who encourages and cares for his students, definitely worth taking!",1
"Some material is difficult but he doesn't teach things that he doesn't think you need to learn. I forgot to do a written homework and he let me turn it in by the end of the day for what he said was partial credit, however I got a 90% on it so I think he just gave me a break. His tests usually have a bonus question.",1
"the class isn't over yet, so far I think she's there for the money, she is nice but not very nice. nor clear too- a couple of times told us something important right AFTER the quiz. She really emphasize the timing on tests too 5 or 7 minutes means 5 or 7 minutes and maybe 1 second! She is cool but can be nicer!",1
Antoinetti is the man. Explains all the material very clearly. Nothing is online so you have to go to class. Quizzes and exams are straight from the notes. Don't buy the book. It is not needed one bit. Likes to crack jokes in class. Sometimes picks on kids but means no harm. Great professor to take economics with.,1
"This Professor gave us no essay requirements for our final essay. The requirements that were given out previously were vague, and the Professor proceeds to grade us hard on these essays. The work load is excessive as well, and even if you do it all on time it doesn't matter because those who were tardy get to remake the assignments scott-free.",0
"Took her for sociology and gender sociology. Amazing professor, her classes are very interesting! She has a unique grading policy,  you do have homework and short online reading/quizzes/surveys which help your grade A LOT!  Even if you are bad test taker, other things can fix your grade! Very approachable. Not an easy A though, effort needed!",1
"I took her for summer 2013. She's super chill and laid back but her TEACHING ISNT GOOD!! She doesn't explain nor go into detail. She doesn't hold her ground! Instead of telling her students to quit talking, she try talking over her loud students,  in her little itty bitty voice.",0
"Straightforward and super caring. Keep up with lectures so you understand the next one, and take good notes! Obviously problem sets are essential. The extra credit sucked (hours for a couple points) but helped in the end.",1
Dr Avila is a very awesome professor! She teaches the subject very well in a slow pace. Take advantage of the extra credit given to you. You have a quiz every time you meet. The questions from the quizzes show up on the exams. Study! Very hilarious professor!,1
"Professor Stockton is a great guy. He just wants his donuts, and honestly he deserves him. Took this class because I was looking for something fun, easy, and interesting and got exactly that. He has a no electronics policy, just so you know.",1
Dr. lyall is amazing and very funny! class is easy because he gives u things that's gonna b on tests I had fun in this class and loved counseling I learned a lot and I would love to take him again you must take him,1
"Dr. Taylor is just not good at teaching. Very monotone and boring. He's nice enough but not passionate. And he doesn't seem to care about the student's success. I don't plan on taking another class with him, in fact I plan on taking the classes he teaches at a different school as a transient just to avoid his classes. It's that bad.",0
This class was easier than any class I have taken ever. Super easy credits and Caitlyn is great. The tests are legit the practice jeopardy games.,1
"He is next to impossible to reach outside of class and does not offer office hours. There is no homework besides studying for weekly tests, and he does not accommodate you at all for missing a class. He does not give out any material outside of class so if you missed something he said or missed a paper handed out then too bad.",0
This class is just plain hard. I'm not sure a different teacher would have made much of a difference. Work hard and you will do well. Don't work hard and you will likely have to drop.,0
"AMAZING! I look forward to coming to class even though attendance isn't mandatory. He knows his stuff without a doubt and is very passionate on the subject. As a history major, I was very interested in what he was talking about. Minimal work was done: couple quizzes, a midterm and final, 2 papers. Undoubtedly my favorite prof at EIU.",1
"I loved her!  She really makes people comfortable, high energy, and you do improve.  I hated giving speeches prior to this, but by the end I was a lot more comfortable.  Some people don't like her much cause she can be a little hippy, but its really not enough to become annoying.  She's very easy to talk to, and one of my favorite teachers!",1
"The focus of the class is music but there are other things that should be takeaways from Ray's class. Great guy, great teacher, and great class.",1
"Connie Anderson is so nice, and makes giving speeches FUN and not intimidating. I highly recommend her.",1
She gives a lot of hw and grades VERY hard. Her tests are also very difficult. She cant teach very well in my opinion. She usually rambles a lot and teaches as if you are supposed to know the material. Also i feel that shes somehow passive aggressive. If you take the class just be ready to teach yourself because shes really no help.,0
"Dr. Hale is the best! He is very challenging, asks a lot of questions, and pushes you to think, rather than just passively receive the information. He incorporates a lot of different media for class such as film clips, music clips, and artwork, which makes class interesting. If you are into history, I highly recommend this course and Dr. Hale!",1
She blew off the students questions and told us not to bother going to the tutor,0
"I will be very honest with my ratings. This prof. is very discriminatory when he grades. To get A grade, you need to take all of Comp Sc classes with him from CSC200. His behaviour is rude to new students. He discusses and forces his students to solve his personal issues. He will keep talk against other professors tha he is the best.",0
Highly recommend Mr. Warren. He truly loves his job and cares about his students. He goes above and beyond to make sure each student has a good grasp and good understanding on what he is teaching. Always struggled with mathematics until I took Mr. Warrens class. He also gives extra credit and sets aside a whole day for class review before tests.,1
"He doesn't respond to emails very well. There were very few assignments, however, he is a good teacher with a lot of experience. You use the textbook maybe 2 times at most.",1
"always unclear expectations. she talks down to students. the entire class struggles putting together assignments and essays, unsure of what she is wanting. low class test scores due to not covering the material clearly before test. very agrivating and stressful class. she's nice. but pretend nice. she does not care if you sink or swim.",0
"Worst professor I have ever had. Not accessible AT ALL outside of class, but also will not discuss anything with students over zoom. She skips our scheduled zoom time daily, and then posts extremely long lecture movies that we are expected to watch and take notes on, but if you have questions, she isn't ever available to answer them. Do not take.",0
Just avoid him.  Take the other professors who understand students and how they learn.,0
"she is so kind and helpful, her class is easy and no textbook to use. i love her, i will continue take her class ENG107. TKE HER CLASS!!!!!!",1
Good guy. Not a good GenEd teacher. Most of our meetings are 20 minutes of him ranting about unclear directions and hammering on the same points and the remaining 30 is a lecture that gets cut short and is filled with conjecture. The workload is unreal for a gened and the projects have strict guidelines/prompts yet are impossible to find on canvas.,0
"I don't understand most of these negative reviews. He is probably one of the best math teachers I have ever had. He breaks down the information well and makes it easy to understand. I honestly think that if all math teachers taught math like him, more people would be better at math.",1
"she condescending and a showoff. i dont she realizes that some of the students are only there cause their major requires a writing intensive course. she expects ivy league work from average students. the readings are dry as the Sahara desert, its like pulling teeth. she will call you out if she knows you dont like her. she has spies everywhere!",0
"He's an extremely helpful professor however, you do need to do all the homework when I did all of the homework I got a B on his exam. Do the homework and pay attention he will have the same problems with a slight change. If you do the homework you are set for his exams and attend class & take notes. They are part of his exams.",1
"This class was very easy. Whatever you don""t know she will help you.",1
"Personal experience and friends taking the course, he tells you what will be on the exam .... he gives you the complete opposite.  He definitely knows what he is talking about but is very boring in class.",0
My class was her first ever lecture class and she did quiet well. What she teaches is fun and interesting. What you learn in class was directly used in the lab. The lab work never seemed like a chore even when we were counting cell colonies. She is a great teacher.,1
"Not a super hard class as long as you do the work, the work is confusing as hell. His website looks like a third grader learning how to use the highlight text tool on word for the first time, and there are way to many links.",1
"I was very excited to have Rachael as a teacher due to all the good things people say about her. However, she is completely unorganized, expects participation but doesn't give engaging lectures or ask good questions and then blames it on the students. BUT 505 is insanely easy course with her.",0
great class very easy!! Reconmend for Comp. Sci. 201,1
"While taking this class required for the Nursing program, I would have liked to actually been taught something. He does not give any lectures at all. If you want to teach yourself everything about nutrition, he's the professor to have. I feel like I could have just bought a nutrition book and learned the same amount I did in this class.",0
I don't get it this teacher is a master at making people think she's something she's not.  What she has been is incredibly rude and just spiteful to me.  Doesn't anyone else see what's really going on?  Shes the reason my husband dropped out.,0
"Have her for Psy 271. she is flipping the classroom this semester so we play games every time. not helpful at all. refuses to answer questions in class. tests are hard and very confusing. 50 question hw assignment every week, same thing every week.",0
"Worst Professor at NJIT.  I am looking to get him booted.  He never changes his slides, his accent is heavy, he is confused himself when he talks, his exams are confusing and do not correlate to what he teaches, he responds 2 days later too questions, the structure of his class sucks, bad textbook selection, overall he needs a major makeover.",0
Honestly this class was literally the most demanding class out there so if you have anything to do outside of class dont take this guy. His exams were too long didnt give curves more than 80% of the class dropped. I failed this class took another professor and made an A. He just makes this class confusing af take another prof and let google guide u,0
"The WORST Math teacher I have ever had. Highly not recommended if you want to pass the class and not destroy your GPA. Do not answer questions clearly. I felt like a prealgebra student in a Calculus class, will take points off if you skip steps that you are supposed to master. Also, imposes you how to write ( printed and not cursive).",0
"A very special teacher and guy. As millions already know, he is the best prof at Rutgers because he will make it his mission that you succeed. All other Chem teachers are surly chuds. Dr. T is a mench. Other teachers are egomaniacs, Dr. T has a vox populi. Other teachers are dour, Dr. T will bust you up like the 3 stooges. Go to class and laugh",1
"The class was super easy, but also more helpful than I thought it would be. It was nice how Professor Nixon was always super bubbly and happy - it really made each class have a more social and relaxed feel. Things weren't always clear to begin with, but when you ask, she will go above and beyond to help you understand what it is you need to know.",1
Weekly HW assignments take about an hour + each week. 2 timed take home tests and 2 timed on-campus tests. The content from the tests are from the weekly HW assignments.,1
"worst prof ever, doesn't want to help students, makes everything so difficult for students, stay away",0
Great to see how appreciated Mark is by so mny students. He is wonderful on Marycast. A true disciple.,1
"the professor was very helpful. She made the class interesting and is willing to help students. She answers any questions. Her class is made up of quizzes, and discussions. It is recommended to show up to every class for notes. Quizzes are based on the lectures. She is a great teacher. I would recommend students to take her class.",1
Hard grader and a lot of homework also grading system is messed up.,0
Where should I start? just know you need to eat the book and teach yourself everything. lots and lots and lots of homework. does not understand the situation of his students during the pandemic.,0
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
She gives you a quiz over the chapter before you even go over it in class. This class is very hard and she tells you from the very beginning that if you don't study 20hrs. a week you wont pass. She is a fast reader and if  you don't get the notes down she doesn't really care. If this is your first Science class to take DO NOT TAKE HER! ,0
"Pete is a fantastic teacher. I took his class that had to switch to online, and he made sure to work with all of us and ensure we understood everything and were doing as well as we possibly could. Super cool professor. If you need a math class, I'd highly recommend him.",1
"He took way too long to grade things & never followed the syllabus. His class didn't seem to have any structure or purpose. He often arrived late. He has a tendency to come off as arrogant, rude, &condescending. I asked him roughly how many sources should we use for our paper. He said, ""I shouldn't have to tell a college student that."" Um what??",0
"Taking her over the summer for 6 weeks wasn't enough time in my opinion. This subject was so interesting and engaging, you just wanted to learn more. She really knows her stuff and I highly recommend taking this subject with this professor. Getting the book before class is a must though, you WILL use it.",1
Professor Betanzos is amazing! Take her!! She is very caring and is very straight forward. I would take her again if I could. There are three essays but she is a good grader and is not too hard. The tests do not count that much and it is really easy to get an A.,1
This prof was amazing! I really enjoyed my class.,1
"Lots and lots of boring lectures, makes bad jokes throughout the school year, easy pass other than that didn't really learn anything",0
She's more than willing to help students who are having difficulty and seems to actually enjoy her job. She honestly cares whether or not students understand the material. The only problem I've ever had in her class is reading her handwriting (gave up trying a while ago),1
"Ken is the man. All his classes are the same, there's no HW just 4 or 5 papers to do throughout the semester. He's an easy grader, just meet the criteria and have some minor knowledge behind what you're writing and you'll be good. Wish he taught more REC classes!",1
She's a great professor. Pay attention and this class will be really easy. She makes time to help students that need help or have any questions.,1
She didnt teach from the book - the lectures enhanced the required textbook reading and her real world examples gave you a deeper understanding of the material.,1
"Nice guy, never took roll, crazy drawings on the board which were hard to decipher upon later review-so I recommend book study, his study guides never matched the exams either, but I still managed to ace the tests somehow (luck?), only 2 assignments- 1 final paper & one homework during whole class- EASY OVERALL! Boring lectures though.",0
"The material itself is fun and I learned a lot from it. Theres no denying hes knowledgable and creative. This being said, I think he lacks a lot of empathy for his students and can be condescending or rude towards them. If you are stressed or struggling, he wont be very helpful. If not, youll probably enjoy the class and do fine",0
Not the easiest subject and is focused on formula application. Moved pretty quickly and the textbook isnt used much but mainly as a reference. Posts slides online. Attendance is mandatory. Very good professor as he knows the subject very well. Had 2 exams allowed an index card for formulas. Final optional. 5-6 HW.,1
Tests are impossible unless you can memorize tons of reading. Tests are almost all essays and he is a harsh grader. Also he is BORING and it's hard to pay attention during his lectures.,1
I can't believe she even got a 2. She is a really bad teacher.,0
"Dr. Johansen is a really great professor. Her test are alright, some questions are pretty difficult because her book is different from the class book. So, there are 3 tests and she drops the lowest one. Also, there is one research paper and presentation. I recomment Dr. Johansen... You'll learn a lot!! Just study, no homework!",1
"Very unprofessional woman. Never stopped bragging. If u want 2 learn something productive in her class, just buy the book and teach yourself. Doesn't empathize with the difficulties of her students. And apparently doesn't put in practice the Ph.D. in ""psychology"" she has for she only acknowledges her life, her struggles, her Ph.D and finally, HER!",0
"Conspirationniste, mais nous enseigne à pousser nos recherches plus loin et diversifier ses sources. On apprend par exemple que notre système judiciaire est corrompu, parceque son ami incarcéré lui a raconté quil nétait pas coupable, que lextrême droite recrute à lUQAM et si on a le temps, on apprend comment analyser des textes. Cours facile.",0
Prof C is an awesome guy but he is so disorganized that you pretty much have to email him before every class because he is never clear on assignments. I WOULD recomend him because he is a super easy grader considering the pop up assignments. His class is an absolute joy to be in and he's super flamboyant.,0
Be prepared to teach yourself.  He only lectures on problmes he has previously done and copies them from his own notes to the board(and still messes up the problem); he will NOT help with any other problems.,0
"I was a little hesitation to taking this class since reading Middle English can be somewhat difficult sometimes. Im telling you I skipped class 5 times, did the minimum of reading (summaries on the internet occasionally), got Bs on my papers and still got an A! Awesome guy, super easy lectures to understand. Take this class",1
She's so nice and extremely helpful. She likes conversation and is very engaging as well. She also brings food every class. Assignments are essays which are not hard topics and at the end you can pick which three you like the best and turn it in. Only thing that I hated was MyLabsPlus. She's pretty lenient with it though.,1
"She is the most disorganized professor I have taken in my undergrad education. This means that assignments don't make sense, but she still gives them out like anything. With that, she still is the toughest grader who won't give you any margin for error even though the assignments themselves have so many errors in them. Worst professor...",0
"Tutuc is a great professor, though some of his lectures are very algebra intensive and somewhat hard to follow. Nonetheless, he is sure to clear up any concerns and is ready to answer any questions that you may have during office hours. Make sure to study more than you think you need to to get a good grade in 302.",1
So easy to work with,1
"Good professor- very fair. Took a condensed A&P class with him and found his tests and practicals to be on point with what he teaches. If you study, you'll do well. No surprises.",1
This is my second time in college (going back for another field) and this was honestly the most difficult class I've ever taken. She gives an unreasonable amount of homework and her tests were totally unreasonable. They're all short essay questions and about 30?/test. She is a very slow grader so you don't always know where you stand grade wise.,0
he hardly gives As on any of his papers.   just doo ALL of the smaller assignments and youll be fine,1
Was not what I expected. Advertised it as an in-depth look at Europe's great cities. It was just Western Civ by another name. Lecture's are convoluted and long. She would make glaring historical errors while lecturing. Horrible research project. Stated right before it was due that completing as asked only merited a C. Had to give extra to get an A.,0
"His tests are impossible but he curves everything in the end, so it's not too bad. He is not a very good lecturer, and likes to ramble on about anything and everything, but he is very willing to help outside of class.",1
He is the best professor! Very good explanation.. :) He is very very helpful... i would love to have him for every subject,1
There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure. He is a very sweet guy and tries his best to teach during these trying times but I don't recommend him for online classes. The only two things he's grading is a midterm and a final that's it.,0
Great instructor. Wish she taught more classes in the department!,1
Mr. Joe is AWESOME!,1
"She is my all time favorite professor and possibly even my favorite person ever. I had her for HIS150 and WGS210 and never missed any classes. She really gives women a place in history. Her study guides are practically every test question. If I could take 10 more of her classes, just to hear her tell stories, I would. She's cool as heck.",1
She does NOT care about students at all. Only interested in herself and what students can do for her.  Her participation in PRSSA is a joke. Don't waste your time with her.,0
"I'm a senior and I had a 4.0 until this class. Take this class somewhere else. This is the worst prof I've ever had. She is low-key unprofessional. I have so many things to say about this prof... Just know her tests are crazy hard. On our second test the average was a 40. Good luck to anyone who takes her, you're going to need it.",0
"The class overall was good. It was entirely online. Every week there was a discussion board and something else due. The work isn't necessarily hard, you just have to do it. Some of the questions on the quizzes we kind of ridiculous; they just had very little to do with the information in the class. Textbook was used.",1
Great Professor! Interesting facts!,1
You'll acquire next-level independent study skills - a real gem!,0
He is a teacher that acts like you already know how to complete this math. I spent most of the class lost. During lectures he talks so damn fast and again acts like we know everything that he's doing.,0
"She is by far the worse teacher I have ever She is hard to understand & tries to hard to engage the class in conversation. She'll ask a question that she intends to be open ended but its not so she forces more out. No structure! Class was a free for all, very annoying! She also has each student read like its middle school... ",0
Her lectures were extremely boring and she is very own opinion based. She also has a very strange sense of humour I found unsettling,0
"Love, Love, Love him!  His class was my favorite.  He tells you what to study and that will be on the test. Very awesome guy, cares about all his students.  I wished he taught more than this class!",1
Very nice and understanding lady. Basically just a lot of papers to write. Easy A!,1
"Easy class, Pierce knows his stuff and loves to teach others about it. Every review you should have answers word from lectures, there is no hidden or hard questions about his test. Pay attention, and you'll easily pass. He is hilarious would highly recommend for a GPA booster!",1
Talks about race too much....knows a lot about math but doesn't know how to teach It,0
Marking is questionable.,0
"This is the worst class taught by the worst professor in the Computer Science department.  We learned nothing of value. Save your money and time and choose another elective. She gives very disorganized powerpoint lectures and some articles to read and then asks the most minute, irrelevant details about them on the exams. Beware!",0
"She is my favorite professor at Meredith, hands down!  She is funny, engaging, and smart as a whip-- she knows her stuff! I've taken her for Counseling, Abnormal, and Personality and I wish I could take her more!  She is wonderful to talk to and her class is very straightforward.  One thing I will say is that she reuses stuff, but it's very good.",1
"Many people ended up dropping from this class for a number of reasons. Some of those reasons being very unclear grading criteria, as well as having an unreasonable way of grading many assignments, and just being very unpersonable and hard to approach.",0
"I took this class online and I have never regretted anything more. The material we were told to study was nowhere near what was on the tests/quizzes. Instead of understanding and being accommodating, she was accusatory, rude, and dismissive! Every week, something went wrong. If this class had been taught by anyone else, it would have been great.",0
"Very interesting guy, not a great teacher. He doesn't tell you the criteria for anything, so you are always wondering what you have to do/when the due dates are. His tests come out of nowhere. He expects you to be an expert anthropologist even though it is 1001 level class. Not an easy A at all.",0
Dont take her. She doesnt give a crap about her students. I WENT THROUGH SO MUCH and SHE GAVE ME A D. Dont take her if something drastic is happening in your life and all you want to do is stay in school. Just dont. Believe me... she doesnt care.,0
Horrible teacher. Never admits shes wrong. All she talks about is the steelers. She needs to talk about going to the gym because shes super husky. Overall weak teacher that gives women a bad name,0
"I don't recommend her for first year students as she'll destroy your gpa with her hard tests and exams if you don't learn to adapt. If you're stuck with her, go to all her DGD's and PAY ATTENTION to all examples she does in class as it might save you during a test. Overall decent prof but expect to put in at least 20 (or more) hours a week for an A",0
"I dislike this professor with all of my guts. I advise you not to take her. Not even as your last resort. She is tedious, unorganized, and boring. She will drown you in work but barely have enough time to grade them. When the semester ends it's your fault for a bad grade and not her poor teaching.",0
"Biochemistry is a complex subject to study. But, Dr. Kim makes the class easier by telling you what will be on the exams when you attend class. Plus she is very helpful during her office hours. If you study everyday you will pass!",1
"Professor Nelson's class was well organized, entertaining, and very interesting.  His lectures are awesome, and he tells you the exact information that you need to know.  The term paper was a challenge, but if you study hard and follow the directions on all tests, quizzes, and assignments, an A is definitely attainable.",1
Horrible teacher flys threw notes leaving you dumbfounded and frustrated please don't take her so they will get rid of her gives tons of homework at one time,0
"Fantastic class notes and overall approach to teaching the material. If you don't understand the material visiting him during office hours is like seeing a friend for help. Assignments can be challenging and the tests are fair. Anyone planning on taking Math1000, Dr. Dyer is the man",1
"Nice guy. Hard to hear him, but helpful if you ask.",1
This class does have a lot of homework but it's online and you can search up the answers if you need to take this class do take her it's an easy pass as long as you do all the work on time. The only hard part was the end of the class the final was a 5 pg paper with four different parts to it and it took long to finish rather have a question test.,1
"This teacher is difficult to work with. I am an honor student and the things that he assigns are completely different than what he expects on the due date. He is rude, and refuses to take into account your opinion, or justification. DO NOT TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR!",0
She is a good teacher. She is a great photographer. I recommend this course.,1
Chidinma Udezeh is awesome professor i took her class on fall and i got A+ ,1
"Tests were pretty easy, last two papers were a bit more challenging, but nothing too difficult to handle.",1
"She was nice, but graded quite hard in some of the speeches. I never miss a class, and I still cant receive full credit in Participation, she wanted students to speak a lot in class. Overall, she cares about her student, but grading is not clear.",1
"This class is a lot of fun, but also hard work. You need to really pay attention and work hard on your assignments. Professor Kendall is super nice and very helpful with answering questions. The class is great and I would definitely take Professor Kendall again.",1
Jen is a great professor though a bit eccentric. She is quite literally Professor Trelawney. She is passionate about writing but can be a bit loopy and MIA but I really appreciated her writing prompts and feedback!,1
This is an online class and almost everything is done on connect. The connects for the most part are easy. However the midterm and final are in person and completely ridiculous. Our midterm this semester was 12 multiple choice questions and our final was 16 multiple choice questions. No room for partial credit. Class is ridiculous.,0
" If you don't log on top blackboard by her date, she will drop you. I had homework every day. Test and quizzes are online except for final. She a nice person but she is very fast and doesn't really review old material in class. Each day is a chapter. If you missed yesterdays chapter you might as well go online and learn in your own.",1
"Dave is an all around good guy. I failed last semester, & purposely took him again this semester. As I've gotten older I've realized he's probably the best professor in the business school. He is always willing to help and I should have realized that sooner. I plan on passing this semester because I've actually gone to see him and did the work.",1
"Worst Professor Ever. I didn't understand any of the lectures not even one of them. The midterm is all based on proof. I made a big mistake taking his class, I advise you to stay far away from his class. If you can, AVOID at all costs. He is simply a bad teacher. Also, the entire grade was just based on the midterm and the final.",0
"Attendance is mandatory in this class, you will loose points from your final grade for each unexused absense. Lectures were boring, but there were no exams or assignments. Final grade will be dased on your attendance and 3 papers. I found this class to be an easy A, but if you don't like writing don't take the class. I didn't really use my textbook",1
"Caring, understanding, helpful and professional. One of the best instructors at DMACC. I took him for two classes, easy A.",1
"Not prepared for classes, seems to only read off a powerpoint. If asked a question which is not on the powerpoint, she is lost and continues class without answering the question. She expects you to know the material without ever being taught it, and she is by far the worst ""teacher"" I have ever encountered. It's a shame she is the only biochem prof",0
Maria is the BEST Professor I have ever had. She's big on thinking like a nurse and guiding us. Her lectures are AMAZING!! She breaks everything down into simpler terms and tells us what is nice to know vs a need to know. I wish she still taught 2nd level because I would've loved to have her again!,1
"One of my favorite professors I've had thus far. Going to every lecture is necessary as she does not post her power points online but she uses humor and pop culture examples to make them interesting and fun so showing up everyday is definitely not a drag. Exams are fairly easy, study and go to review sessions and you should be fine.",1
"Prof. Dillion is not for lazy, but if you want to hear a great story as opposed to reading a text all day I recommend her. Class moves fast, and is sometimes all over the place but will keep you alert with her infectious laugh and excitement for a subject. Great hands on experience.",0
I took her class in 2013. After finishing the class I still didn't know how to say more then a few words. I learned more on my own than by taking the class. Most of the people in the class knew some French and some had French parents or lived in France. This meant the pace for was too fast for me. She did not try and slow things down.,0
She is the most unprofessional prof. She rushes through lectures without even teaching us anything. She gives lots of labs and group work. She does not try to helps students. She is very harsh and rude if you dont do something that she likes. Id skip her at all costs. All she cares about is a low average of the class.,0
"Odd.  Good class, but he is odd.  And his overuse of the word 'What' can get annoying.",1
"Nice lady and helpful if you have questions.  Several papers and a Final (which was difficult). Also two speeches with powerpoints.  Overall, good class.",1
She is not very good when it comes to teaching and also tends to get off topic a lot which takes away from what we are learning. Does not give very good explanations for assignments that are given to us either.,0
"Loved this class! Bertram provided straitforward assignments and even told us exactly what we needed to know for tests! He provides lots of homework, which in a vocabulary and knowledge heavy course such as anatomy can really help you learn the topics, but homework is graded so it can be a help or a hinderance but thats the students choice to make",1
DON'T TAKE ALYCE HUNTER. She has made it clear that she doesn't care about anyone's situation during this pandemic. Shes a tough grader - no one gets full credit she always takes off one point for spelling/grammar but can't even spell check herself. Group work is mandatory in this ONLINE CLASS. ALWAYS emails back late & super vague/condescending,0
"He's awful. My advice for macro: 1. Don't waste your time going to class. Read the book for the hour and 15 minutes you have his class instead. It explains things much more clearly than he ever can. If you hate textbooks and need a good lecturer to learn, do not take him. You will fail 2. Memorize his packet practice questions for exams.",0
Professor explains the concepts clearly and his projects provide the students with a chance to explore all the concepts and algorithms. Learnt a lot in this course. Homeworks and Projects help you understand the concepts clearly and also allow you to experiment with different ideas. Excellent Professor would love to take other courses under him.,1
"OH MY GOD!! Stay away from this professor!  I am in her class right now and I have to drop it.  The course average for EVERY student in my online class is below a 40%.  I spent 6 hours on one of her ""basic"" homework assignments, and had a friend with a MASTERS DEGREE in computer sciences help me with this homework, and still got a 65%. SHES UNCLEAR",0
"great teacher, keeps it interesting, VERY nice and helpful, will work with you if you need help, would take any of his class!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"She assigns a ton of work. She is a nice person, but the comments that she leaves on your papers are pretty rude. She can come off as condensing.  There are so many papers and they must be incredibly detailed. She is a ridiculously hard grader. Like she grades you on participation (only professor I know that does that)  I suggest avoiding her.",0
"So unclear about everything. You will be clueless about what youre supposed to do and when assignments are due. Just dont take her, take this class with Deidre and then you will learn something!",0
"Won't provide any keys, will ask questions you haven't seen in homework or in class, will not curve, lots of useless POGIL, writes on board often (cannot read his handwriting). Recommend taking lab at the same time because he will ask stuff in lecture that you've only learned in the lab. Only positive thing I can say is that he's pretty nice.",0
"Good if you don't get accommodations, but if you get accommodations, then she ISN'T a good choice. She may be different with in-person classes, but with classes being virtual right now, she hasn't been accommodating. For example, she said it was against department policies to record lectures, yet last semester, my professor had no problem with it.",0
Worst math class ever! Goes over material too fast. Before you get one thing done he is already starting another.,0
"Very boring, no tests only quizzes. Group final project",0
"Professor cares about his students. The class is set up as a flipped classroom. Online lectures, online quizzes +final and discussion boards and one large paper, which was easier and less time than it sounds. Participation in class is a must, but I found it to be an easy A if you participate. The quizzes aren't too painful. Buy the book!",1
Ms. V is so nice and helpful.  I have never had such a pleasant and interesting science instructor.,1
"Truly AVOID him at all costs. I am a hard working student (typically straight As) and am eager to learn. Ibrahim is disorganized, an EXTREMELY poor communicator, and a horrible teacher. I honestly think some of these reviews are falsified. Exams were 3 hours when budgeted for 90 minutes as no one could finish and they were incredibly challenging.",0
"Everything we learn is unusefull for accounting, he teache things that he like, not what we have to learn",0
"AWFUL. Took this online, his tests are 70% of the grade (4 tests in total), so don't even worry about doing all the homework and quizzes assigned if you do poorly on even one of the tests. You fail a single test, you might as well already withdraw. Amazing how you must teach yourself the subject (its online) and then the grading criteria is strict",0
"She's very unclear, her lectures are beyond boring, helpful I'm sure but also at times I'm questioning relevancy. The entire class is one long group project which she can be very unclear about, she lets you know when things are due the day before and then when no one turns it she questions why. Pretty easy and fast grader,that is the only plus side",0
Awful!!! Save yourself and just go to a different school. Worst experience of a lifetime with her. DO NOT TAKE HER FOR ANYTHING!,0
This class was probably easier to understand then the other religion class but you had to take notes on the lecture because that's where her questions come from for her tests.,1
"Dr. Chisholm has been such an incredible resource for me in my journey through the UofL education program. He is not only enthusiastic about the subject matter he teaches, but he is also incredibly effective with his feedback to every student. He demonstrates his care for each individual student and & always available to talk outside of class.",1
"I can honestly say he is the best prof I've had so far. He is approachable and always happy. He makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Only class that can capture my full attention because the material doesn't seem too intimidating when introduced by him. Exams were fair, and the ""curve"" is very generous.",1
"Professor was so disengaged in the teaching process. He also played favorites and treated us like high school kids. What an insecure human being. Class consisted of multiple ""projects"" (read: busy work).  Hey Jim! Drink a coffee, anything to wake us up here! Or better yet, go back to Canada!",0
"Strange teaching style, but not impossible to pass his class.",1
"Professors don't come better than Dr. Hinch - if there is room in any class of his sign up. This is the 2nd time I've taken his classes and have never enjoyed my education more. Tom genuinely cares about you, your education & input, gives relevant examples, fair/reasonable expectations for workload, and made a dry topic like policy interesting.",1
"Homework - Takes so long but outlines a lot of what you are tested on. You need to read the book and do the homework. She isnt that helpful and she is pretty clueless about a lot of the material. Its hilarious, go to OH and she wont be able to answer a single question you have unless its adding vectors or taking a derivative LOL",0
DO NOT TAKE MEADE. I thought Meade was a pretty nice guy at the beginning and he is obviously very knowledgable about the material but he expects everyone else to be just as smart. He is incredibly passive-aggressive and will assign a 65 source pathfinder project literally two days before it is due. Then he will complain about giving extensions.,0
"This class was a lot of fun! If you show up and do the work, you will do well. Professor makes class interesting as well. Definitely recommend her!",1
"One of the very few things I learned in this class, is how to say the word ""terrible"" in Spanish and this teacher is exactly that.",0
correction to the previous post.Class is ADMS 3700,0
"Poor professor. Spent the whole semester coming to class and having him ramble for 40 out of the 50 minutes, then try to cram some incomprehensible analysis of whichever book we were currently reading into the last few minutes. Semester project was basically busywork with no guidance, and he refused to give a clear answer, even during office hours.",0
She is engaging but its an overall hard class. ,1
She's a real gem. Loves to joke around. Allows you to have a note card as a cheat sheet on tests.,1
"Probably my favorite person in the whole entire world. He is such a sweet man and really knows what he is talking about. I have him for both theory and aural and he is there to be sure you really understand everything. I recommend him to anyone! Not to forget, he is a GREAT piano player so I also recommend him for an accompanist! ",1
To be honest she isnt very helpful and she can be very rude she gives out too much work and she gives out too many essays and she is very specific on what you need to do would i take her class again nah,0
"Lectures seem to all make sense for the most part, and then somehow don't have anything to do with the tests. Plays favorites and is really rude to the people she doesn't like. Some days I can't tell if she has a bad attitude or is just really bad with people. Doesn't write her own tests, and some test questions were never covered in class?",0
"I actually enjoyed this class because he seems to be so passionate about forests. However, his tests are really hard. If you show up to every class you should do fine though.",1
"I did not really like Dr. Kaminski that much. Too scatterbrained for me to understand fully what she's talking about. She tends to ramble a lot, too.",0
"Mrs. Barclift is one of the best teachers I have ever had.  If you are a Social Work Major, I suggest taking her because she has both real world experience, and she is a fun teacher.  She teaches Practice I, Mental Health and Crisis Intervention.  I've taken all 3, with 2 A's and 1 B.  She makes sure you definitely get it.",1
"This teacher teaches Comp Lab, clinical, and adult health nursing. She is so much fun and loves to help her students learn. You can meet with her any time outside of class for help. Shes the type of teacher that doesn't mind you calling her cell phone and she will call yours if theres a problem. Great!!!",1
This professor is willing to explain things and he explains it articulately. Very kind me analytical person. I would definitely take the class again. Not sure the e,1
Shes nice but shes just a bad teacher. I didnt learn from her lectures. I mostly muted her and did my hw during class. P.S. Almost all quiz/test questions are on Quizlet,0
"didn't like Professor Weiner, he was inconsiderate & does not teach anything except after a group presents a topic. I am always one for learning something new, even if i don't agree but he fails to understand any views from his students unless its similar to his own. Final consists of 3 essays (4-5 EACH) based upon certain themes in the book.",0
"off topic. He will play 7 videos a class and none of them will be relevant to the course material. this class has so many assignments where you will be left thinking ""when did I learn this"" and it's probably because you never did. most disorganized course I've been in.",0
Save yourself some grief. No one wants to listen to Mr. God's gift to students that early in the morning.,0
"Hes a really caring and very knowledgeable of the material discussed in class. Takes attendance everyday by quizzes. Book is not mandatory at all, just need the access code. Easy A and an easy elective.",1
Online class was a bit overwhelming because I took it during the summer.  Professor was very helpful and understanding.,1
"Manu is the best prof at ASU for COM by far. His coursework take a moderate level of understanding, which requires reading the book and understanding what is going on in the class.. (not that hard). He is so approachable and wants his students to succeed. Makes participation EASY even for an online class. TAKE THIS CLASS AND ANY OTHER HE TEACHES.",1
"HE LIKES PERFECTION, YOU HAVE TO HAVE 0 ERROS TO GET AN A.I DON'T RECOMENT TO ANY BODY",0
Awesome teacher. Very thorough! The test is from the material in class and the study guides. She gives a lot of opportunities for points other than the tests which is helpful. She also drops the lowest test grade. Would recommend Ms. Smith to anyone!,1
"I have taken Dr. Wooten for a handful of courses and I wish he could teach them all! He definitely makes you work for your grade, however they are all interesting assignments VERY ORGANIZED and straightforward with what he is asking you to do. He is extremely passionate about Econ and making sure his students attain an education.",1
"He is a nice guy  but lectures are long and boring and he goes off on tangents too often to follow. Exams are tough based mostly on what he says in class, hard to know what to study.",0
Professor Xian takes a lot of pride in her work. She goes above and beyond to answer all questions or concerns from all students.,1
She is my favorite professor so far! She is very understanding and really knows what she is talking about. She assigns the perfect amount of work to make sure you understand the content but isn't overbearing. I would rate her higher if I could.,1
no comment,1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Thick accent to the point you can't understand, and he doesn't slow down to pronuniciate his words. Makes all concepts so difficult and literally speeds through everything. Tests are 60% of the grade so you better know what you're doing. No extra credit & lots of homework only worth 10%. Take someone, ANYONE else.",0
"Such a terrible class. Never learned a thing. Memorized his study guides and did OK on his tests. He will not help you and will tell you to ask other studnets in the class. The only time you receive 100 on the ""drawings"" is when he is super busy. Other than that enjoy getting a 9.0 or and 8.5 on lab drawings.",0
"Hersha is a great teacher.  She knows a lot about what she teaches and has worked in the business.  Her lectures are interesting and she has a great personality, making classes spunky and different.  This particular class is pretty relaxed, but that does not mean you don't have to read the book and research.",1
"He goes very fast and it is hard to follow along. The practice problems will help you keep up, so do them. He ends up curving the entire class at the end, so if you are not happy with your grade don't worry because it will go up.",0
"PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! Professor Crumple is very condescending, arrogant, and very rude. He tries to make students feel like they are not smart enough for his class. Sometime in the middle of lectures he goes on tangent about subject not relate to the lecture which could be very confusing. He take pleasure to see his students fail",0
Thick accent and a bit of language barrier when she explains things but if you put in the work she wont fail you and she will try to help you get a good grade,1
"He is extreme passionate about his work,very understanding. Lectures are based souly on his power points. He puts lots of information in the tests that is not covered in class. If you show up to his SI he will answer any questions you have. I asked all the questions on the study guide and my grade has increased significantly. Good luck!  ",0
"I had professor Enright for the Spring 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. He probably adapted best out of all my professors. In terms of mathematical understanding, he knows what he's talking about, something rare in other professors I had. His class isn't easy, I'll admit, but that's not because of him, it's because its freaking 3d calculus.",1
"Even if you have experience in the real world, this prof wants you to keep responses by the textbook. You think you're giving 100% only to receive a D. Assignment List: 10 Discussions, 3 quizzes, 1 Final, 1 Research Paper (based on non-profit organization), Interview Assignment with licensed Social Worker. Prof gives extra credit.",0
"Great prof, great class. I don't get what other people are talking about. ",1
"I took this class for my major for fall semester. Hes really funny in the beginning like what all Professors will do. When he lecture, someone ask questions, he would somehow answer it but the student still dont get it. I would rate more but the characters are limited. My advice is that if youre majoring math and want good grade then avoid him.",0
Dr. Persaud is a wonderful professor! She's very thorough and it is impossible to not learn from her. Go to class and study and you will definitely pass her class.,1
"Dave Dusseau is a truly amazing professor, at least for the class I had (BA 101). I took this class at 8 am and he made it less worse by having interesting and entertaining lectures. The class is not difficult. If you put in the work for mikesbikes and the textbook, it's an easy A.",1
Does not explain anything. Lazy does not reply to email or mymathlab questions. Poor communication skills if you can stay far away from this teacher. ,0
She is very sweet and a good portion of the textbook she goes over in power points in class. All the stuff she goes over in class are always on the test and if your not doing so well she allows a lot of extra credit,1
"recorded lecture videos are given but they barely help with the midterm and final. midterm and final are tricky so know small details of concepts covered. really unresponsive to emails. one class project that's ez and u have to attend the synchronous session that day. i didnt read, just watched lectures and i did well",0
"Well upon a good 1/3 of the way through the semester I find these other reviews disturbingly accurate when it comes to treatment for personal views. This professor is very unprofessional, this class is taught like a master's degree. Myself and other students have been talking about how we do everything she asks and still get basically a zero...",0
The class was interesting and she is willing to work with you if you need additional clarification. ,1
Lectures are pretty useless. He asks the class to participate and waits more than 2 minutes for someone to answer. Really heavy accent. Boring lecturer. Hard grader on reaction memos. Midterm not that reflective of the book.,0
I took Hadavas for Survey of Calculus and he is by far the worst professor I have had. He is completely useless and honestly just has bad teaching skills. Make sure you are decently good at math because most of the course you have to look up youtube videos because his lectures are powerpoints and the HW program is terrible and does not help you.,0
I figured I'd give Connor a shot since it was at a good time. I went to class the first day and I automatically knew it was awful. She was VERY unclear with her actions and it just overall confusing. I switched out after that. It just was not worth it. I'd pick another class if I were you,0
"I took Mr. Camp for EH 101 and 102 and I dont recomend him for either. He isnt very clear on what hes grading for and he didnt give any feedback. Extremely tough grader, almost impossible to get an A. Do not take it unless youre trying to make your GPA go down bc thats all this class si good for.",0
Attendance is only mandatory on Friday's and you only have to do 5 out of the 10 discussions (which take about 30 min of your day to do and not graded harshly). Dr. Amundson is super passionate about history and very easygoing. The 2 exams are easy if you go to the review the day before and the one big paper you have to do can be resubmitted.,1
"Mr. Hughes is an amazing instructor! He's very lenient with how well you perform in this class, but does expect you to show up to class. He cancels class often and a lot of the time the class doesn't run the full time period. Online quizzes are minimal and very easy. He takes off 3 points from your final grade for every missed class, so go to class",1
"She is not very precise in her lectures on what you need to know for the tests. She didn't quite answer questions in a concise way, and frankly kinda rude. Honestly, thought I was alright at math before her class. She uses SPSS and expects you to know it.. without hardly any guidance. Very hard time finding a tutor for this class. Good luck...",0
"Dr. Pasquesi is a phenomenal English Teacher! It was a true pleasure to be a part of her class. If I had to describe her in one word, that one word would be ""Educator."" Most professors focus on the curriculum and syllabus. Dr. Pasquesi has a high focus on the development and progress of each individual in her classroom.",1
"The most important thing is her exams are really difficult,You need to study hard for her exams.",0
"He posts his previous tests online, and he takes his new tests right from there. All his notes are online as well. He goes really fast through the material in class, so it's almost pointless to go. However, the day before exams, he gives you really good hints as to what else is going to be on the exams.",0
"Professor Juncay is very helpful, loves questions and discussion.",1
"He is mean to the students taking his class, vague while presenting his lectures (at times reading off the slides directly or editing his slides on the spot), and inconsistent in his teaching.  While emphasizing the importance of responsibility, it took him over two months to grade our papers and exams. Each week was a new excuse. Avoid",0
"I've always really struggled with math, but this class was especially difficult. I was intimidated when going to his office hours, as he is slightly rude and pretty patronizing. He went through problems too fast, and it was difficult to comprehend what he was trying to explain. When students asked questions, he belittled them. Please don't take him",0
"Dr. Nixon is a super bubbly, bright professor. It is exactly what you'd expect out of an English class - Writing papers & analyzing sources, so don't come into it expecting anything less! While sometimes it felt a little film-studies heavy, the class made me a better writer. You're going to be totally fine if you do the work for this class.",1
"I wouldn't recommend him. He's very bright and makes you think, but he never actually taught anything related to the course. He assigned us a project in the beginning of the semester and then changed it midway. He gave us no feedback on what we handed in. We were never given a chance to learn how we were doing. Students need feedback to improve.",0
Flashback to Elementary school. Easiest class I've ever taken. The most boring and irritating class I've ever taken. Avoid her at all costs.,0
Not very helpful. If you want clarification on anything good luck. If he believes he covered it in class he will not help you outside of class regardless of how unclear he was. He skims through the course with a clear low interest in it. Nice enough guy and has a great amount of knowledge just not great at the teaching component.,0
"Tests are not made by him. So his tests do not mesh with his teaching style. I am a son of a math teacher, and even his math oriented questions were confusing because he does not clearly go over the math part of the course. Personally, I wish there was more math so I could have had a different grasp of the information. Physics can get wordy!",0
"Her quizzes are difficult, her exams are impossible, and her explanations are generally not helpful.  She's always late to class and takes extremely long to return assignments.  Avoid.",0
i didnt feel like i got my moneys worth,0
"Subject is easy but his tests and labs are made to make you do poorly.  If you read his notes and know how to deal with multiple choice, you should do well.  Lectures are boring and uses Microsoft Word.  No one sane would use that to show lecture slides.  And his multiple choice test are like -> look below.",0
I had him last summer and found him to be a great professor. He clearly explains a lot of the concepts and gives handouts. ,1
"He has his agenda like so many others here. And though he appears to be erudite, he cannot help but be married to his radical politics. Well this is UMass at Amherst. I cannot wait to get into classes about reality.",0
Karen is a completely disrespectful and discriminating teacher towards 1st generation students who work full-time. Ive dropped from an 88/100 to a 69.9 in one mistakenly missed 30 point assignment and wont get the courtesy of a 0.10 grade round up. I'll fight tooth and nail for this 0.10. Believe me.,0
"Took this class online. His grading was a bit brutal, there is a lot of work involved, he puts you in a group to work on a major report together which got really frustrating when everyone has different ideas and writing styles. I got an A in the class but only because I put in a lot of time and sweat into it.",0
"Provides clear expectations and if you do what she asks of you, you'll get an A. Helpful when needed and fair with grading. ",1
"Professor is really understanding and a great teacher. Very helpful with essays and is easy to contact if you ever have any questions. Very fast grading turn around, especially with rough drafts of papers. The class is decently easy, and he is understanding about absences if they have a good reason. The textbook is needed for a few assignments.",1
Duane is a horrible teacher. i didn't learn a thing in his class and lost all interest in the fisheries program because of him. if you want to do well in his class just stroke his ego.,0
"Sandoval is a nice guy, and does seem to care about his students. The problem is that nothing is clear in his class. He doesn't give out specific essay prompts, and a lot of the time you end up writing a 4 page essay that's based on a 4 page excerpt you read. class lecture time is pretty useless, he tells stories for most of it, and repeats things",0
"Overcomplicates simple material and says is available for office hours but isn't all the time. Exams aren't hard at all, but when you learn nothing all from the teacher it becomes much more difficult. prepare to teach yourself",0
Worse professor I have ever had. Period. His midterm and final were extremely hard and even tests you on the minor details of articles. Do not recommend this professor at all.,0
"ACCENT HEAVY! I could never understand her, she was constantly asked to repeat herself due to her accent! She would also get frustrated when questions were asked about material. She is a sweet lady, but I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for a quality education.",0
"bias n unfair are the right words! this guy barely teaches..his class is like watching a bad skit of a comedian that already sucks. all he does is make jokes n doesnt teach class..on the positive side, you always get out of class early so depending on what type of student u r u might like him, but if u wanna learn n wanna have a fair grade, AVOID!",0
Does not cover some course material in class or in his notes. If you don't have the textbook you won't know about this material and it will likely come up in an assignment or exam as a surprise to you.,0
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
"Extremely unorganized. I dont appreciate that she does not set any due dates and grades almost everything the weekend before finals week, not to mention that there is no final exam to boost your grade. She needs to restructure herself before students should consider taking her.",0
"I really disliked the class I took. I feel that the broad topic of CIS can been hard to grasp, and I felt that most of the time her lectures were useless. The group project/assignments didn't have clear requirements and felt rushed. She's nice -and knowledgeable in CIS- just not a very good teacher IMO. I struggled for the B. Thank goodness for EC.",0
"He is really nice but there are just so many readings with quizzes (one every week) and the lectures are so long. Don't even get me started on the assignments, they are just too complicated, more complicated than they should be. The first one is ok, the ones after that get harder. The group project is really confusing, so look out for that.",0
"I don't know how this guy is still at Davis. He gives boring lectures mainly about proofs and his research. I havent taken his final yet but his midterm is HARD. It is ALL proofs. Barely any numbers and mostly writing. If you can, AVOID at all costs. He is simply a bad teacher. I emailed him multiple times and have never received a response.",0
"I loved Professor Allen, but this class definitely isn't for everybody. To do well, you need to attend every class and pay close attention. Professor Allen's lectures are very interesting if you actually want to challenge your mind.",1
An outstanding drawer and knows what he's doing. Is casual in his unique ways. He really tries to help anyone who puts in the effort to ask for the help. He's not going to push to help you unless you push first. Focuses a lot on the real world applicability/getting a portfolio ready but gives no dedicated time to it in class.,1
Great Professor! very knowledgeable and passionate about his field. Class requires connect. He is always available and is always willing to help. Makes sure you understand the info without beating it to death. Take his class! gives formula sheet for test!,1
"If you are an A student, expect a B in his class. Extremely harsh grader! Must work on grading rubric, much too strict. Also was a lot of reading, important to know if you are taking a large amount of credits like I was during the semester I had him.",0
Avoid Dr. Kim. She is INTENSE. She doesn't understand that not everyone wants to get their masters in chemistry. She rushes through complex subjects because they are easy to her. She said that other professors make her life hard because they dont teach what she teaches. She was rude to me when I went to her office. She is a VERY tough grader.,0
"Test material not consistent with lecture.  Not a helpful instructor.  Told the class he would curve, and then didn't.  Very poor professor.",0
"This class seemed a little too difficult for a 101 class, and she definitely had big issues with clarity for me. Helpfulness was sort of hit and miss but she would at least try to help. Would not recommend taking her for your first college English class if you can help it.",0
"Be prepared to tech yourself, his lectures are too fast and he gets upset if you ask questions. Choose wisely your group since the whole semester is groups projects.",0
Professor Corker is smart but she really doesnt seem care about her students. I dont recommend taking her class.,0
Great professor but tough grader. Expects a lot and is willing to help you get there.,1
"First of all, she is a very sweet woman. Her heart is genuine, but her teaching skills are inadequate. Her spelling and grammar are both atrocious, on top of her very thick accent. A majority of the time, we have no clue what she is saying. When you can understand, it's usually her far-fetched opinion and if you don't agree with her, you're wrong.",0
"Her lectures are all power points, but she doesn't really tell you how to code. While you may understand what something does, she doesn't explain the syntax of coding. You're plopped down in the lab with no understanding of how to correctly code a project.",0
Professor Trubatch is a nice enough guy but his class is the hardest I have ever taken. My entire class is failing due to a horrible textbook and unclear lectures. Quizzes are nothing like what we do in class. It is defeating that a class full of math majors are failing a math class. I have never put so much in without any results.,0
I took her for environmental bio and I thought she was a great teacher.  I never study outside of class and I was able to make an easy B.  Just make sure to go to all of her lectures and the class is pretty easy,1
"Amazing professor! He made critical theory fun! So easy to understand it after he explains it in class, and the papers/exams were so easy. He really cares about his students, and he admitted at the beginning of the semester that you shouldn't contact him through email. Very enjoyable class! Just write 2 discussion questions and show up.",1
I took this class for my major. It was my writing intensive course. The papers she makes you do are not long at all 500-1000 words due once a week. She is VERY particular about the writing style and that you follow it to a T. I found that if you email her your paper before it is due she will tell you what corrections to make for better grade,1
"Amazing Teacher. You will create things that you didn't realize you were capable of if you let yourself be pushed. Taking design from Dwayne Bohuslav is a must for a great portfolio. And yes, you must love architecture to love him so either suck it up or find a new major.",1
hate this class i went to every lecture and didnt learn a thing. he made me want to sleep for the 50min i had to spend with him. horrible grader. besides the tests being hard the homework was super hard and just plain dumb. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS choose something fun,0
"All I can say is DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. I took him last semester, his test is crazy hard. NO REVIEWS TEST. A LOT OF HOME WORKS. He said that he have extra credits in EXAM. TRUST ME, you will never get 100% of the test. If you guys think that I didn't study and just blame on him. I HAD THE HIGHEST SCORES IN HIS CLASS BUT I CAN'T GET AN ""A"".",0
Beware of this professor. He assumes that all his students come from same have same educational qualification and they all have to undergo his FIRE TEST. I knew I will fail his test as he will give you 50 MCQ 0.5 marks each with 5 choices to choose from. Then short answer questions which are as difficult to understand as this professor himself,0
"I learned way more in this class than I ever did in high school. Class can be tough, but you get what you put in. I was never lost because she gives so many examples and answers emails immediately. Super organized. Good class.",1
"I felt like she treated the students like we were in high school, but in her defense she is a collegiate teacher too. If you email her when you miss a class she answers almost immediately. You write maybe 5 papers total 600 words max. The final is the same as all the quizzes you take in class. Only 8 btw. Super easy. Taking her for comp 1 i think.",1
I really enjoyed taking her class. She let you work at your own pace and gave extra credit opportunities as well. All the quizzes come directly from the textbook (which you can easily find online). TAKE HER!,1
About as useful as a dull knife. You are better off skipping class and instead have one of the tutors teach you in the math lab.,0
"I would take him again. He cares very much for his students. He loves for you to be there and to participate. It is a ton of reading, but for a class 1 day a week, I did not mind to do it. I struggled at first, but he was so much help to me. I feel like he is not a strict grader at all.",1
Best history prof. at the U. He seems easy at first but he will challenge to do better. Wish I could pull off the way he mixes his patterns on his clothes!!!!,1
"This professor is extremely difficult. Genetics is a difficult class through and through but Dr. Jone's makes it ridiculously difficult. On our past test, no one made A or B and the average was a 58. She thinks we are doing well though. Do not plan on taking this class and coming out with a good grade even if you study at least a week in advance!!",0
"One of the most humorous and interesting people I have met at ECC. His test material comes right out of the notes. As for a lecturer, he can get a little dry when talking about music, but is creative, charismatic and spontaneous enough to keep you involved. Overall: great teacher, great person.",1
"The best Psychology instructor, students can understand him very well... Gives great notes to refer to...Helps students understand book terminology. Also,very humorous!",1
"I'm not sure where her high-ish rating came from. DO NOT take this woman's course. The tests are unnecessarily hard. She puts stuff on the tests that isn't on the practice to ""stretch"" your mind. Then proceeds to get an attitude if you say something. If I didn't have four other classes and a life to worry about, maybe her class would be alright.",0
"Lots of issues with this professor. He makes so many mistakes in both his lectures and writing his exams. It's a bad sign when a prof can't answer his own lecture questions. Exams were very deceptive, the correct answer would commonly be ""none of the above"" which is irritating for any student.",0
"Ryan has great intentions, but is very unorganized and seems like he's still getting used to teaching at Carlson. He is very knowledgeable on class topics, but almost to a fault, as he goes on tangents and side comments that take away from the true topic at hand. Ryan has great potential and should try being more intentional and organized.",0
If u are willing to waste an entire semester without learning a single thing about English u should go ahead and take it.. It seems more like history class rather than English his talks too too much about nonsense and leaves way to much papers and gives no help what so ever with the papers and grades really harsh! Be smart and do N0T take his class,0
"Dr. Sarah La Belle's passion for ""research methods"" can take a toll on someone. Going to her class everyday was BEYOND the worst experience I have had in my very long time in academia. Do yourself a favor, do not take this class. There are other ways to fulfill the research methods cred (soc295 forsome). You will be saying, what is research method?",0
Dr. McDougal is one of the best professors I have had. His lectures are very helpful and should be attended although it is not mandatory. Organic Chemistry is challenging but if you do what he says you will learn the subject and enjoy yourself listening to him joke around.,1
"The absolute worst math professor ive ever had. Doesnt know how to teach whatsoever. If you have a question, dont even bother asking because it definitely wont get answered. Makes you teach yourself and if you have a question his answer is ask the person next to you. Terrible. 0/10 professor.",0
"he is extremely hard for no reason and when you try your best, he makes you feel like a failure. i do not recommend him at all.",0
"Plays favorties with students, disorganized, unclear on learing objectives, unwilling to help or answer questions, tests are very unrepersentive of course material, etc....  Need i say more?  I'd reccomend him to find a new profession",0
"Dr. Storslee is absolutely the best teacher I've had at PVCC. I love his teaching style, he's incredibly helpful, and he genuinely wants his students to succeed. He's always available to help, he's easy to talk to, and I love how he's so proud of his students. He's just an awesome teacher.",1
Worst prof I have ever had. Completely rude and not helpful. As a junior I expected more from my professors. DO NOT TAKE HER. Screwed me on a grade.,0
great class and prof,1
"She is very nice and caring, ensures that everyone knows what they are doing for the tasks. Overall, she is a good professor and highly recommended.",1
"Moody Professor, Grades how she desires. Be prepared not to get grade results for weeks. Easy subject made hard!? Doesn't respond to emails, no grade checks ever! ",0
He may not be the best professor of physics but he is extremely helpful. He scales the grades and does quizzes as a group work together. The clicker questions help to notify that you are attending class.,1
This lady is very unfair!!! she WANTS you to FAIL.  You have to suck up to her hardcore to get anything close to a B. DO NOT TAKE HER!,0
"she is quiet (even with a mic) and talks slowly, so she is hard to pay attention to. she openly praises people (says their name and everything) during lecture for getting 100% on her tests and gives them small prizes for it, which is bad teaching in my eyes. i find her low key hard to respect, but that is just me. her test questions are confusing",0
"Such a great professor. She really cares about her students. You'll have weekly homework (very easy) and you'll have 3 big interviews (reports). This class is easy but you have to do the work. For the exams, you'll be writing but you know the questions & answers in advance. TAKE HER class. Her passion shines through. you'll Love it",1
She is great one of the best history teachers at RCCC,1
"This class is easy if you do the work!  Her class is broken down into readings for homework (VERY manageable), daily quizzes (small things, don't stress), weekly responses on the readings, two easy paper-projects,  and two exams.  Bottom Line: she wants you to succeed.  There is not enough room here to tell you how great she is.  TAKE HER CLASSES!",1
"Class is easy, but she is unhelpful and sometimes even rude when i try to talk to her outside of class or ask for help. She picks favorites, and makes assumptions about students. She also spend all of class rambling about her son.",0
Wow this guy is bad. Your quizzed at the beginning of every single class about things you had to teach yourself. Then you have to sit there for a lecture filled with tangents and that is never relevant to what you read. 2 people in my class have above a B. 9 have below a C. Find someone else.,0
"His lectures can be long and boring but he's very knowledgable if you pay attention. Bottom-line, if you don't pass this class with an A you aren't trying. He's very helpful and gives extra credit so there's no way of getting anything lower than an A.",1
Dr. hill is a wonderfrull woman. Her goal is to help the students pass while helping them learn. I have enjoyed her class more than any other. She is also very helpful. Her test are hard but she is fair about taking them.,1
Makes it incredibly difficult to understand your own grade. Not a clear grader. Incredibly picky on tests.,0
Did not enjoy this instructor. Learning environment was cold and awkward; did not facilitate class discussion. Many assignments were about students' personal lives.,0
Thad would be a very good teacher if he had more time. He didn't give out homework so you have to rely on your study skills. He didn't give out study guides at all. He's funny and his lectures are sometimes engaging. i guess it has to do with the subject. if you need homework and extra help with the class do not take him. He doesn't give ex credit.,1
"Teaches you to think, at least tries. Dr. Chen treats students as adults, so some independent work is expected. Read the textbook before class and make your own notes from it. His class notes are not very organized, more like a review. Dr. Chen does not usually assign practice from the textbook, but it'll help if you do some for every chapter.",1
Professor Juarez is a great professor I had the pleasure to take him for three classes which I grew to love social work as a field. He is very knowledgeable in Social work because he is a social worker himself. I want to become a social worker like him! Please take him he is a great and caring professor!,1
"If you must take this course, here's some advice: DO NOT listen to what the TA and prof say about failing the midterm-I swear they WANT students to freak out. All that is difficult is the format. If you complete the hw and understand it, the exams are simply re-worded hw probs. Do practice problems and don't depend on excel formulas to do them.",0
DO NOT TAKE. She replies to concerns but Im warning you to not take this course with her. Honestly the hardest Ive ever taken and constantly felt stressed. Does not give you more time to finish work and does not give any considerations at all. Had to pay for 2 platforms which is really pricey! Just dont take it and do yourself a favor!,0
I am not a fan of Frazier. I was always early to class and I always participate but for some reason he did not like me and it was obvious. After every monologue he would bash me. He's not a good person and I definitely would not take him again. Quizzes are online which is nice but he doesn't let you see what you got wrong which is annoying.,0
I took prof. Kiesow for a news writing course. I was pretty worried at first due to a very daunting intro letter with a copy of TESC late submission policy and a note stressing AP style in the course. In my experience Kiesow only wants you to put your best effort in. He is very just in his grading and overall wants his students to LEARN. RECOMMEND.,1
He just lectures the entire class which gets very boring. The quizzes are super easy but the tests are very difficult. Geography was my best subject in high school. I took this class my first semester and got the lowest grade in this class. Expect to study a lot more than you think you will need to.,1
"This guy is the easiest teacher to get along with.  He's simply a teenager stuck in a man's body, but he really knows his stuff so don't fret. (lol, it's a guitar joke)  If you have been playing guitar for more than 3 yrs then take lessons with him and not his other classes. Do yourself a favor and just have fun in his class/lesson. ROCK AND ROLL!",1
"A nice guy but not a great professor. Exams were hard, not enough time, made up 85% of grade, you needed to remember EVERY topic he taught in class. His bad microphone made lectures hard to listen to. Idk the other Econ 302 professors, he was good not great. Dropped lowest midterm grade, HW was easy. He was nice to give a 1% curve at semester end.",0
"I've had this professor for two weeks and already, I'm hearing political propaganda that has nothing to do with sociology. I'm not liberal or conservative, but it's really annoying when I have to hear about ""Bush getting his way into Yale free"" when I'm trying to understand what the hell I'm supposed to be studying.",1
"The only class I've ever gotten a C in. I studied with a group of about 6-7 people and we were all working hard for a C in her class. Since I had her for Ochem 1, I refuse to take her for any other class. I toured a med school and met someone there from UTC who also told me she did very badly in Dr. Kim's class. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",0
English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand. Very Disorganized. He forgets to teach the tricks in his trick questions. Would never take him again. Avoid like the plague.,0
Class content is really hard to understand. He only writes on the board so attendance in mandatory. His tests are so hard and labs make no sense. There's a final research project that has a presentation component. The presentation is so scary. Max will ask so many questions and make you feel stupid. He will embarrass you until no tomorrow during it,0
Professor Lanning  really knows the subject he teaches. If you don't understand a concept in class he is willing to go over it extensively during his office hours. His test are based on his lectures and homework's. Their are 3 midterms and a final that is cumulative.,1
He is a very tough grader and attendance is mandatory. Arriving a minute or two after class begins gives you an entire absence. His tests are easy if you study. If you are taking this class because you like Shakespeare be prepared to take in a lot of visual performances and analysis not only reading. You read about a play per 2 class periods.,0
"This professor assigns massive loads of work, is extremely vague, and pretends to know more than she does. I learned nothing of value from taking this class.",0
"Loved Mr. Martin's class! He is such an approachable professor, and he tries to make class interesting. He makes sure to learn your name and help you get to know your other classmates. He's adorable. I think of him as my ISU grandpa. :)",1
"Do not take for a gen ed. Hard to get in contact with and when you do her feedback is useless. Really tough grader, not worth the stress and frustration. Dont know how shes still able to teach :/",0
"Mostly do-your own work, 3 hr class and most doesn't help with exams or homework, very nice and funny likewise.",0
"Really fun to listen to.  Kind of goes off on rants about how we need to save the planet, but they're interesting.  Definitely the least boring lecturer of BIO181.  I don't really feel like I learned anything, though.  Maybe it was just her teaching style that made it feel that way.",1
Dr. Hauck is one of the best biology professors. He is super kind and he is very efficient with his lectures. He is very transparent and will let you know what you need to know. Just be a decent student who works hard and he will be awesome,1
"Microbiology is freaking hard. Hardest course I have ever taken and I have excelled at college level courses. He's very understanding and tries to work with you, honestly, a really nice guy! It's not his fault that the material is difficult. He did a good job with dense, hard to understand material.",1
Extremely good teacher for Calculus. Very standard,1
Inexperienced Boring Lacks context,0
I loved this class! You will have one powerpoint presentation to present. Study from her lectures and participate in the labs by completing all assignments and you will pass. Dont skip labs! You don't need the book. She is very caring and willing to help you in any way possible. Take her for all science classes if possible!,1
"Overall, he is a man that knows his stuff. His work and critiscm is by far some of the best you can get on that campus. However, his grading and expectations is sometimes over the top and ridiculous. He holds everyone at a professional expectation which is good and bad. He has no censor and says whatever he wants. Overall 3 stars.",0
"I loved this course, But prof is  not easy. He takes points off. But the good part is that if you do good on final exam, he will grade you according to that.Irrespective of what you got in class pop quizzes.",0
By far this is the worst professor i've ever had. he can't answer simple questions .  He is not organized and you'll get cofused by his syllabus and assignments. He write Hw assignment on board and whe write diffrent ones in the sylabbus,0
"I like Dr. Che, but his teaching style leaves much to be desired. This was a networking class. Everything is done in the Packet Tracer software. Che did not once open up Packet Tracer during the semester and actually DEMONSTRATE how to do basic configurations. Instead, he just scribbled some unintelligible drawings on the board. Nothing was learned",0
"Barely showed up to class & had no idea what was going on ever & got an A two semesters in a row (ENC1101 & ENC 1102). Easiest class I have ever taken. Grumpy teacher but if you keep your binder organized you basically get an A. Also, he lets class out super quickly. ",0
He is a nice guy but not a very good teacher. Lectures are boring and doesn't really explain how to do anything. ,0
"I had no choice but to take him because he was the only professor teaching Survey of Calculus at Armstrong. He was the worst math professor ever. He teaches terribly and the homework website is so hard to use. Don't buy the textbook, the SMART center on campus and youtube will be your best friend in the course.",0
She is worst professor ever. Really tough to get graded even though u go to class everyday. Take other professor's class. And too many quizzes and exams every other weeks. No make ups tho.,0
"You will have to: A: Learn all material on your own, her lectures are not helpful, also a strong accent. B: Memorize the entire Calender: Her online scheduling is bad C: Not have any issues, Her email response rate is poor. D: Have the patience to do this for an entire semester, while worrying about your grade. Just find a new teacher.",0
"An expert in marketing, one of the best professors that I have had. Tests are very difficult, but he is always willing to help with anything.",1
Listens and adapts to students' concerns. Knows his stuff and cares about students' knowledge.,1
"Wow, this is probably the worst teacher i've ever had teach me English.  She claims to be qualified to teach a Pre-IB class, but doesn't understand half of the things she is teaching.  If you can get out of her class DO IT, you do not want to ever experience the terrible thing this woman calls ""teaching"".",0
"the worst teacher you could ever have. she does not teach and expects you to learn the material yourself, keep in mind i did not take a self paces so she should have taught. the first day when a student asked her how we were supposed to answer the questions she said ""you have a phone, look it up yourself"" the worst teacher.",0
"Dr. De Vos has a lot of bad ratings, which I disagree with. Yes, he does go off on tangents, but they always relate back to the lecture. He is one of the most knowledgable people I have ever came across, and I think students take that for granted. He is extremely understanding and extremely approachable. I took every class I could with him.",1
"Due to the fact that her main focus is education shes not like most crazy math teachers who expect you to immedietly grasp difficult concepts, shes very kind,patient, and helpful. She knows how to present information in ways that can be understood. The class calculus you cant expect to be easy, but if you get the chance to take it, DO IT!",1
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken. He is a great guy, but the exams are borderline impossible no matter how much work you put into studying. The work he has us do and the exams are made so much harder than they have to be. This class is about to destroy my gpa because I didn't listen to the other reviews on here...",0
"A very hardworking professor whose passion is for music.  She takes time to make sure you understand the work.  Helps in class, tutoring, and gives extra sources to help via blackboard. Make sure when taking this class you choose a suitable time (class is about 2 hrs) to make sure you're fully awake when playing the piano and always take notes.",1
"Very disappointed. Ridiculous amount of work for the level of content covered. Labs worth 1% of total bio grade but could be 8-10 hours of work each week when done right. The 4 tests were cruelly short (45min) with short response that required more than could be done in the timeframe, 60% averages. Even if you are a good student, avoid this lab.",0
"Super easy class, very interesting topic. There are 4 quizzes and you have to participate in 4 discussion boards of 7, 2 exams & 1 paper. Everything was easy, quizzes are not timed so you are able to take your time on them. Offers an extra credit class meeting (I didn't attend and still got an A) but can be very helpful.",1
"All topics discussed were extremely detailed & unorganized, covering far too much than what should be expected of students immediately entering the MBA program. I would not recommend Jagpal for students starting their core MBA classes. This nontraditional prof does not give graded work throughout the semester: participation & a final only.",0
"If you have take stats at COD, take him. He makes it accessible. He knows its a hard, boring subject and does hs best to make it interesting. Has a sense of humor, easy to talk to. Also, never keeps class too late and has review sessions as well. Easiest A I've ever gotten.",1
"Terrible professor. There are blatant discrepancies between explicit policies on the syllabus and feedback on written assignments. Quizzes are based on minute details hidden in dense, utterly boring readings. Do NOT take this class hoping for an interesting perspective on Islam--his teaching will make you never want to touch the subject again.",0
This guy is amazingly annoying. He has very odd speech patterns that are just bizarre. He never talks about things relevant to the books we read. He randomly chooses topics because he leaves blank spaces on the syllabus. Bad professor!,0
"Ariail was a good professor. Helpful, clear and gave examples. Wasn't so boring and he was funny (at least in my class he was).",1
"Good TA, very nice.",1
"She's patient and is straightforward with the class. If you need help you can find her. ME classes are never easy so of course it's not an easy A. And of course she's VERY!!! attractive, not that effects learning, but hey it makes classy way easier to get through on tough days",1
"Mr. lopez is prob the most realest , most chill instructor your gonna find in the criminal justice department in lbcc. (clough is number 2). no book is require,  loves to answer questions. you have a topic you have to do in which he allows you to pick.  Any classes he teachs take the class and dont think on it.",1
He's difficult to deal with and if you can take another class for this credit or have another teacher I would do so. The text's he chooses are either okay or awful with maybe a film or two worth watching. The class description is inaccurate at best. He is a harsh grader but provides very little feed back and very little flexibility. DON'T DO IT!,0
"I took English 121 over the summer semester.  It was a lot of work.  Dr. Lewan expects her students to pay attention to detail!  If you check in every day, read the directions for the assignments carefully, and implement her suggestions for improvement, you will do well.  I enjoyed the class and feel I am a better writer.",1
Was a great teacher. Had a great semester.,1
Best instructor I've had at RRC. His lectures are interesting and you engage in what hes teaching you. He'll help you with anything you need. Easy to contact. Useful content. I would take his class again in a heartbeat. ,1
Scanlon is rude. No way around it. I was afraid to ever ask questions and he made me uber nervous in lab. Avoid taking him at all costs. ,0
"This man has pushed me farther away from engineering than even my parents' disapproval ever could. He has made me question every decision I have ever made. With his boring voice that is enough to put an insomniac to sleep, I've been unable to focus in any class. He is the WORST professor I've ever had, and that's saying something. Take it at a CC.",0
"This is an online class for which BYUI has already prepared all the coursework, therefore all assignments and tests are the same no matter who your prof is. Having said that, Prof. Gallini is friendly and always helped  whenever I had a question about the subject material or how to do a particular assignment.",1
Pretty easy class. The assignments are usually based on website links and FEMA reports which are pretty easy to write about. Not a super interesting class but passable for sure.,1
"Huge GPA booster if you stay remotely up-to-date. Got 100% on all quizzes. No textbook needed, use her notes. Crammed for the final in 1 day, got 85% and 77% in the course. Would NOT recommend though if you have absolutely no interest in the course; I lost marks because I didn't care enough to even attempt the assignments. Yes, I'm garbage.",0
"class was hard because homework was all online so he doesnt even grade anything. 3 chances online to get it right but if you have no clue as to what you are doing wrong then you cant get it right and there is no partial credit. terrible class terrible teacher, I even had a tutor and went to him for extra help and he gave me a D. terrible professor!",0
"Do NOT take this class with this professor!!! She is a tough grader and can come off very rude when you have questions. I would go above and beyond, completed all of my work on time and always received zeros. Best advise I could give other students is to find another professor to take BIO with. I never write reviews but I had to warn you guys!",0
"Amazing professor. Super caring and knows her stuff. I've taken two of her classes so far and both were eye-opening. One focused on ""interpreting the other"" and the other focused on illness and disease in literature. She wants her students to be more aware of other things outside of our own lives. She is a tough grader on papers though.",1
He doesn't follow the syllabus to teach. Hard to understand.,0
"A semester's worth of reading and assignments condensed into 4 weeks is no joke. You are expected to read every single day, complete discussion posts, quizzes, and her essay-format exams. She wasn't necessarily difficult but not easy either. The effort you put into your work is the grade you receive. Textbook is required!",1
"Traumatizing. Graded by 2 MTs & a final, but you won't have any idea what's on them since they never appeared in lecture or the textbook. Never fully erased the chalkboard. Spoke in ""proofs"" Refused to answer questions. Assumed we knew upper div math. Averages were 50-60 (which he said was good for him). Def run if you ever see his name.",0
Great teacher. Really cares. Would take again,1
Tom D'Angelo is a great person and professor. You can tell he really loves what he teaches and cares for his students. I wish more professors were like him! Always open to a discussion and never judgmental about your opinions. Homework is one weekly journal done from the textbook readings. Just show up and read and you will do great!,1
"Professor Zheng is super caring and understanding, even if you're not interested in the material. Lectures can be a bit long and dry, but you'll learn a lot. Lots of great examples and the reading is helpful. Projects emphasized over tests. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. She asks a lot of questions, so don't let there be awkward silences.",1
Well learned in subject. Willing to compromise and work with you.,1
He is the most sb professor in BU. I take it for summer term but the homework is two times more than other class in regular semester. And we all think he has OCD because he just wants us to do everything in the exactly way he wants. I don't think he knows he can grade A in this class. I feel like my time is wasted and I did not learn anything.,0
"I really liked Tim-sensei, he's a great professor, and he knows how to teach Japanese very well.",1
"Tests  Copy, Paste, A Homework  Guess until the system passes you with a 100 Learned nothing, but recieved an A. Yay",1
Really mean for no reason,0
The content of this course is very interesting but unfortunately the prof for this course makes it hard to find interesting. Plus she makes the midterms worth 45% of your grade with nothing in between to fix your grade if your screw up. Plus there are many slides and not enough time for notes on each bring a camera and lots of memory or dont takeit,0
"He is just my favorite professor, got you scared a bit at first) but then ou realize that he is very kind hearted)extremely funny and helpful if you need him! U'll have lots of fun ) take him)",1
Barcley is definitely a professor of a different breed. He is very entertaining during class and extremely helpful whether in class or out. He pushes you to join competitions and classes that can make you a better entrepreneur. He offers credit for IDK as an answer to test questions and allows you to write your own test question. Inspiring!,1
"Dr. Lim is a very nice guy, but a very mediocre professor. He never derived a problem from scratch for us and instead just scrolled through his notes which looked like alphabet soup. We all had to teach ourselves by doing the homework and reading the notes. Many grades were saved because he leaked the final while we took it, invalidating it.",0
"tough marker, hand still hurts from writing the 20 page final.",1
"Redding is cool! He keeps sociology interesting. Any soc 101 class obviously isnt going to be that difficult. Pay attention to his clicker questions, they often show up on exams. Pay attention, show up, review his study guides and youll be fine. Easy A!",1
"Organic chem will ALWAYS be hard, so i cant 100% blame her for my experience, but she only grades based off of tests and a couple quizzes. Exams are worth 90%. Its stressful and shes difficult to learn from because of the accent, i would highly recommend buying the textbook to support learning, it helped my grade a lot.",1
"Although hard to understand the accent, I think it's almost a strength in English studies because it forces you out of your comfort zone when it comes to interacting with 2nd language English speakers and forces you to carefully pay attention.  Once you get past that she has a lot of insight to provide to analyzing the structures that govern life.",1
"Jones is an above-average professor. She's pretty in-your-face, and will make you participate in class often for grades. With that being said, she is very approachable and is very lenient on due-dates and even lets you do some projects as a group instead of individually. Her feedback on papers and rough drafts leaves a lot to be desired, though.",1
"She grades on subject matter more than formatting. You get the bare minimum for feedback, and the course work was a joke. 2 essays and 2 power points. She teaches the bare minimum and by that I mean you get the link to the Purdue OWL site. Her class is a waste of tuition and you probably won't get an A unless you write on issues she agrees with.",0
"he is a nice guy, but his lectures always go past class time and he rambles about random things. Our class had nothing to do with english topics. It is a easy class to pass though.",0
"When everybody in the class got a bad grade on the first exam, he said do better. Not very respectable and cannot explain things very well. You learn mostly through the online homework.",0
"Had her for general bio and cell lab.  awesome lecture teacher.. bad lab teacher, especially for cell lab. She is a pushover and really sweet. I love her!",1
"Dr. Leamon Bazil was by far one of the worst professors I have ever taken. It took weeks to get a response via email. He was often late to post assignments. He duplicated feedback on papers for several students, which leads me to believe he failed to dedicate the appropriate attention to his student's writings required. Would never recommend him.",0
This man is so energetic and passionate about Bioengineering that it will most certainly be wonderful! This guy is undoubtedly one of my favorite professors in the department and really does care!,1
She's extremely vague and doesn't really respect students' time.  She also takes attendance.  But she's not the worst prof. ever.,0
This class is hard and the exams are really tough.,0
hes okay buts confusing,0
"Makes me feel so dumb. Yells at kids for not asking questions, then when someone does ask he says I just went over that or makes it seem like the answer is so easy. Basically no homework, just tests and quizzes, and the final is only 12% of our grades. Not accessible and always finds a way to be passive aggressive.",0
"Had prof Hegner at the beginning of year.Skelly's hard for visual learners;does quiet explainations by mouth only and most people in the class were lost.When he did write on the board, it was sloppy,unstructured,almost illegible.Learned everything from reading the text-I only came to get attendence credit. Listening to his lecture only confused me.",0
Dr. O is one of the best professor I have. His class is really easy if you're prepared before attending.,1
Very nice teacher and always answered any questions you had.,1
"This professor is helpful, but at times felt no organization, doing one thing to another, and having short time given to do essays. Also takes long in posting your grade scores.",1
"Loved her class, we had so many extra credit opportunities",1
"She is extremely ignorant of special education  and grades as such. The strategy presentations are entirely Gen Ed and if you adapt for SPED, you get graded down.  Couldn't stand how fake she was.  I sat there entirely tuned out b/c she obviously didn't want to be there, nor did we.  Don't take her!",0
very nice and helpful,1
I wouldnt suggest taking him! He doesnt give any homework or quizzes! Your entire grade is based on 3 tests the entire semester.,0
LOVED this class! I was worried about taking this class because I struggle with math. Mr West makes it very easy to understand how Logic works. You must attend every class though or it will be challenging to pass. We hardly even looked at text book. Learned everything from classroom exercises and discussions. ,1
Doctor Odedukun is a very  good professor. He explains so well for every one to understand. i found his lab classes very interesting. he gives study guides for every exam. i would take him again  for 2060 is available.,1
"One of the few profs who refers to students by name, even in a 200 person lecture hall. The coding assignments take 3 days at the least, so start them early.",1
Tests are easy if you do the take home test and review test (he only changes the number in class test) there are 2 easy assignments and like 3-4 homeworks and you need the textbook to do the homework. He is the best and easiest professor! Take him and get an A+,1
"She is accommodating, caring, responds quick to your concerns and questions. She is very forgiving, understanding. Just the right amount of work load. Class is fun and easy. If you try just a little, it is an is A. I would highly recommend her. I took online summer course while traveling and was able to finish( hopefully with A). She is the best!",1
Horrible!!! If you can avoid her please do! She is not so helpful.. Her exams are confusing and does not require a textbook. She has you read articles of moodle. (I rather study something of the book) She gives you a option of writing a 10 page paper or join a group and present in front of 120 + students. Avoid her if you can : /,0
Fair and balanced. Would take him again. Knows his stuff.,1
Very helpful,1
"Dr. Mahosky is one of the best professors I have ever had at NAU. She is passionate about disability studies which improves your motivation to learn. It would be hard to not get an A in her class, as her teaching is clear and the coursework is interesting. I definitely recommend all DIS courses. They are all exceptional with wonderful teachers!",1
"Dr. Sheffler is a very intelligent professor and is very willing to help, his powerpoints were hard to take notes on, but gives them to you online with his notes. For midterms and finals give you a cheat sheet and a study guide so you know what to put on the cheat sheet. Great professor. Take him",1
"Very good teacher that has a passion for helping students! Will go above and beyond to help you! Has an open mind and likes to see effort and new ways of making art! Would recommend him! Very open minded teacher, which is a must in art! ",1
His assignments & lectures (monologues) provided little groundwork for success in the class & his teaching (telling) was far from thorough. Pretty much nobody had a clear idea of what aspects of his teaching to digest & remained hopeful that a miracle would occur on an exam. It was hard to prepare for class/exams... I would consider other options.,0
"unclear lecture notes, not well explained, too much data less information and knowledge",0
"He's a great teacher, fair grader, and decent comedian all at once. He was relatively easy, but that's probably because I had a solid genetics background before I even took the class. His class was at 8 in the morning, but it was totally worth it. If you are going to take genetics, you absolutely HAVE to take Dr. Hauck.",1
"Sooo much extra credit! This class was really interesting, even kinda fun. He could stand to clarify what he wants for the practicals and group work sometimes, but he's good about making sure everyone knows if he gets asked a question about stuff like that. The guest speakers are pretty cool too since they have a lot of experience and examples.",1
I thought his lectures are interesting but not mandatory if you study the powerpoints. Tests based on online quiz and lecture. MC tests were easy but you don't know what questions that are based on lectures will be in it. Some online quizzes answers can be found online but don't count on it. No curve so don't mess up on your exams.,1
"Amazing lectures. You can tell she loves what she teaches. She speaks with such energy/excitement, you can't help but to listen and be interested. She's clear and explains in depth. You'll love her class.",1
"I decided to take Professor McFaul because of his rating on RMP (which were good). The class was hard, he made things so difficult to understand. I always felt confused and when I would ask for help, he wasn't very good at helping me. He would just repeat what he wrote on my paper. He is a tough grader. Honestly, I would not suggest taking him.",0
Ask for help! She repeats anything in class. I enjoyed this class very much; she keeps it interesting. Study for the 2 exams. you'll need all your notes. overall if you study and do the assignments you'll get an A or B.,1
Professor is excellent. All her material was acquire to the class.,1
"I had her for EDU 254 and 200. She is TOUGH, and I was intimidated at first but she really knows her stuff and she is a FANTASTIC TEACHER. Great motivational speaker, and leads very thought-provoking discussions. Do the work, stay on top of deadlines, and you will gain so much from her teaching and from the courses in general. READ THE CHAPTERS!!!!",1
"Took him for an online Intro to American Lit course. We had to do weekly discussion board posts, read 3 books, write 2 papers (about 3 pages each), and write 2 short essays (about 1 1/2 pages each). Sometimes the reading can get frustrating, but as long as you don't decide to read the day before an assignment is due, then it shouldn't be too bad.",1
If you have her as your prof please drop that course. It's the best advice I can give you. The midterm avg for our whole class was below 50%,0
"If you struggle with math, don't take her. She isn't helpful and makes it even more difficult. Can be condescending and treats students like children. The book is something that she and other instructor put together. There isn't much there to help you learn material. Strong accent and difficult to understand.",0
"Professor Walker is experienced, educated and a very respectable person. Show up on time, participate in your group assignments every week (they do get graded), and make an effort on the group project/presentation. The exams don't require excessive studying, if you've ever held a job/career, you'll pass the exams without ever opening the book.",1
"Okay there are too many ratchet comments for this decent guy. If you simply read the textbook (which is extremely interesting), study the vocabulary, and understand the experiments, you should get an A, simple. You don't even have to participate in discussion, that's what the talkative people are for. Sit back and relax! Not a hard class.",1
"Loved Dr. Thomas! Of course anatomy was going to be difficult but you can tell she loves what she does, which makes it fun and interesting. Labs are a bit hard but if you study and really pay attention you'll do well. If you ever have a question about your own animal she loves to help you!",1
Took Prof. Casada's 8 week online class over the summer and passed with an A. The expectations are clearly laid out. Be prepared to read the textbook and the class is fast paced. He's a great teacher,1
Excellent professor. He was very helpful and provides great feedback.,1
He went off and got a new job at Google like 2/3 through the semester and dropped the ball on our class. Told us about a huge final project and then ended up assigning it like 3 days before it was due. It ended up being easier than anticipated but it was a stress fest. Was too busy to answer any questions via Slack so no one knew what was happening,0
She is not good about getting back to her students if you email her.  She doesn't use the PAL grade book so you have to ask her for your grades.  She is a very strict grader.,0
"Favorite class at Clark. Super interesting, but there is a lot of reading and you need to study. If you're good with that, then you will be just fine. He curves his exams (or quizzes? can't remember) at the end. This helps your grade a lot. I had a B- the whole quarter and when he curved quizzes/tests & put in our presentation & final, I got an A.",1
"He does the bare minimum to teach, breezes through material & does not like to explain concepts. Also, we used a book that was mainly online & this was not communicated well. I did not know how to use the book until 3 weeks into the semester. Do not take if you have not had a math course in a while.",0
"You can tell he really loves teaching and it's refreshing and interesting to hear about his life's work. Very accommodating, MUST read or you won't pass. 3 reading quizzes, midterm, final, and a term paper. Highly recommend this professor!",1
Cet course est horrible! C'est tellement plat car c'est enseigné complètement en anglais. Le prof prend plus de temp à enseigné la grammaire anglais que le français. Je ne recommend pas de tous cet cours! Je n'ai appris riens.,0
"Without a doubt, the worst professor I have ever had in my life.  I got an A, and I have no idea what I learned...I only remember Gen Bio immunolgy after taking her rambling and disjointed class.  Impossible exams and useless lecutres...crazy stories and theories: she called the bio soc-bio med students ""useless brain-dead idiots of Rutgers"" hahaha",0
Don't take her for math,0
"This is one of the best instructors I have ever had in my entire life. I enjoyed this class very much, and I appreciated how understanding and open they were. I think if you try your best, ask questions and enjoy the speeches, you will succeed! The speeches weren't hard either, some of them were even fun!",1
"First of all, Leonard seems like a genuinely good guy. As a professor, he was terrible. I hate to be harsh, but I dont want anyone else to waste time and money like I did; this was the worst class I have ever taken. The lectures were terrible, he didnt respond to email, he didnt understand English very well... please do not take his class.",0
Has a hard time speaking. only information is pre made slides. recommend not taking him.,0
"Being a nutrition major, I thought I was going to enjoy this ""easy"" class; boy was I wrong. This is a 4 unit class (in a qtr system) and takes more than double the time of my other 2 five unit classes combined(no exaggeration). If you like harsh grading, non-stop hw, and really hard quizestests for only 4 units(qtr system), this is ur teacher!",0
"Jim was an awesome instructor. The class was not easy, but he made me dig down deep, define my mission, and really give some serious thought into my management experience. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Most importantly, my relationship with Jim continues to this day, and I am not alone.  If he is listed-make sure you sign up for his section.",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. She is extremely caring and accessible outside of class. She truly cares about her students passing. Study her slides and you will pass the class. Lab is mandatory, I recommend not skipping one it can really boost your grade.",1
"Mr Butman is probably the worst teacher ever, drop out before you regret it .",0
Graded attendance but passing means do the online work. Lots of quizzes and discussions about course material but will comment interesting feedback. Going to class is good because he is knowledgeable and shows off some really cool stuff. He has a bit of a speech impediment sometimes and cuts people off but for the sake of time management. Easy A,1
Was her first semester teaching Crim Pro. Slides were very helpful. Exam wasn't bad. Essay was one of those you can never finish bc of some many issues. She was a good teacher. Would take another class with her.,1
Not very accessable and she's hard to get on with. Don't take the online version of this class as it's hard to get a clear answer and there's no leeway.,0
"He was probably the nicest professor I've ever had! Was extremely caring and understanding of any outside problems we were having. Taught the class extremely well and overall just amazing. If you can, I highly recommend signing up for his class!",1
He's kinda boring.  Acutally pretty boring and his syllabus gives you no direction whatsoever on what to read and when.  He usually takes the full class period and at times goes over.,0
"Dr. Beaty-Nosco grades very strictly throughout the first half of the course. I feel that she did not thoughly explain things when questions were asked, it was like she was speaking a different language. Nice lady though. Makes lame jokes, but laugh anyway. Hard tests, must get a 60% or better in all aspects to pass class, and that's with a D.",0
He is very clear on what will be on the test. He makes it easy to take notes while he lectures and you should study your notes before the test and you will be fine. He gives a test review and tells you what to study to do well on the test. Definitely a manageable A,1
Pick someone else for English. Lectures make no sense,0
"Currently in my last quarter at  UCI, I can firmly say that Gilmore was one of the worst sociology lecturers I ever had. Often cuts off students and even the TA. Wants things done his way and his way only. A total dinosaur who does not listen to students but instead patronizes them throughout the lecture. A nightmare for the 3 hr. majors seminar.",0
"The class is a joke. You do not learn anything. Everything she uses is right from the text questions. She does not interact whatsoever, not even in the discussion questions. No feedback on any assignments. When emailing it took her an extreme amount of time to email back, and when she did she often did not fully read my questions to respond.",0
Dr. Curtis is extremely enthusiastic about the course material. She is also very willing to work with you IF you show initiative. She is overall a great woman who will change your view on a lot of things. Take her class!,1
"Dr Strickland is my Dissertation Mentor and in that role she has been an exemplary scholar, mentor, and friend. She is firm and has a strong passion for teaching and sharing knowledge within her expertise. I am humbled and grateful to have had the opportunity to work with this faculty member at Capella University!",1
Doesnt teach. Stumbles through examples with no explanation. Relies on terrible online portal for everything. Teamed us up at the beginning of the semester and expected us to teach each other for her. Way too many students. An overall accurate example of WIUs standard of teacher.,0
Nice guy and incredibly flexible. He seems kind of shy but he is really willing to help students out of his own time. I really enjoyed his class.,1
Lots of work but you can get a good grade if you work for it,1
I was warned not to take Smith but I decided to do it anyway and it was a mistake! His lectures are so long and dry and makes the material more confusing. The final is 70% of your grade and sometimes it's unclear what type of answers he's looking for. Avoid and take this class with a different prof if you can !,0
"Very ambiguous grading and takes off points like crazy on exams. Spits formulas on the board with little to no explanation. Can't clearly answers questions and responds with ""you should know this from a past course"" but almost no one knows. Make sure to copy down the final forms of formulas and try to get past exams to practice b/c he's useless.",0
Good information learned from the class. Make sure you show up to class.,1
"He is on ANOTHER LEVEL, an enlightened way of thinking (big picture). Has his own way of teaching, but his exact words REALLY make sense. LISTEN to him! Some will be lucky enough to get a copy of the Bush Bible, but it's easy enough to make your own. When he provides you formulas that look like math equations MEMORIZE THEM. Case law won't help.",1
"Even though I have previous calculus experience, it all left my brain the second rogers started talking. Think you know how to do something? Think again!! Good luck getting 10/10 on anything because he will always find one little thing to dock off. Tests? 8 pages at least and does not relate to any of the problems that we did in class. Good luck!!!",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER! You don't know what to expect on the exams because her study guides are too specific. And she does not explain the diagrams from the ppts very well which caused so much confusion. She talks too fast. Oh, and she does not attempt to adjust her teaching style in order to make the class easier to understand (even if you ask her to).",0
Powerpoint slides are crap.  He messes up a lot and doesnt help you at all.  Tests are deathly hard.,0
Her class is really tough. Lots of assignments. The grading criteria is not clear at all. Don't expect to get an A. Very unpleasant learning environment in her classroom. Does not know how to teach. Bad teacher. Avoid her if you can.,0
"I attended every lecture and took notes, but pretty much taught myself everything. It was difficult because the professor was not clear nor helpful. To be honest, he didn't seem that enthusiastic about teaching nor did he show genuine care for his students. If I could retake the class, I would choose a different professor.",0
"Ken is a great teacher who is very passionate about what he teaches. I took his 8am class and showed up for every class because the material was so interesting. He cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. There is about 7 assignments, no quizzes, one true/false final and no book needed. I highly recommend him!",1
She is nice but is so confusing. Doesn't seem like she understands what she is doing. Her english is not that great either. Had to drop class because I was extremely confused. Would neve take her again. Strongly advise not to take her.,0
Super smart guy. But doesnt really communicate his knowledge to students well. Not everyone is capable of teaching and this guy is one of them. Just reads the slides to the class then passes out a worksheet. Be prepared to do loads of reading and work on your own. The only reason I passed was having seen most of this material in high school.,0
"Dr. Gentry is a kind and casual guy. Each lecture he talks a little about the subject at hand, but then creates a discussion amongst the class. This is an unusual style, but a nice refresher from intense lectures. Random pop quizzes will come, but he drops your lowest quiz grade. Overall, his class isnt hard as long as you show up and participate.",1
"Justice is a good professor. I had little difficulty in understanding the content of the course. He is always willing to help students. There are no exams but many quizzes, which are pulled from the optional homework. I recommend taking his class.",1
"Painfully boring lectures and takes 15 points off for 2nd absence.  Class participation is a must. If you are abnormally enthusiastic in class and she remembers you, you can get a good grade. ",0
Calculus II is a very hard class as it is and he makes it harder when he doesn't completely finishes examples and doesn't go over complicated examples which are seen in the very long hw. Quizes are very short which make it hard to get pts. He's smart but he needs to realize this is our first time taking the course and we need more thorough lectures,0
"I only attended a few classes in the beginning of the semester. It was honestly a little hard because I never went to class, but all the exams are online, usually get an hour to take it and has 60-70 questions. It's straight forward what you need for an A, I was just lazy. I still got a B .",1
"Melinda is good professor. She reads students work carefully and gives her suggestion. However, she is a tough grader. If you want to have a good score, make sure you spend a lot of time on this course.",1
"Honestly Dr. Monroe was the best professor I've ever had! If you want to take an interesting class and an awesome teacher, take any of Dr. Monroe's courses, I guarentee if you show up for class, you won't be disappointed! Do the work and study for the exams and you'll get an A. His lectures are amazing too, they keep you interested and entertained.",1
"I'm sure this professor is great is you're a math genius and have a background in calculus but for someone that is just taking the class because it is required, she is horrible. She refused to let us submit an exam after her bedtime, even after many students explained that we WORK. She's not understanding and refused to do more than 1 exam review.",0
"Tom is a really caring and responsible professor. If you have a question, you should go to his office and he will be glad and he will help you to get a good grade. His class is not hard, you just need to go to class and take notes cuz he wont post them. Its quite easy to get a good grade if you keep in touch with him.",1
"DO NOT TAKE IF YOU ARE NOT POLI SCI MAJOR, you will waste so much of your time. This is an incredibly hard class and would not be worth it if its for Gen Ed. You have a 3 page paper due every week, lots of reading, and hard tests. Lectures are hard to follow, and he rarely gives feedback to you and if he does, its months later.",0
I really like her teaching style; really recommend her. I spoke almost fluent Italian when I went to Milano because of her. She's got the skills; no joke,1
I never went to this class UNLESS I thought that there would be a random attendence quiz and turns out.....I never missed one quiz. His lectures are entertaining but sometimes can be really tiring. He is very inspirational about music and what he does which is good. Tests (midterm/final) were only 20-25 questions and exactly like the study guide.,1
"This class was really hard .They are  4 exams with 65% of the grade  , drops the lowest grade .He reads straight from the power points ,give study guide just the questions  ,  with no answers . Students were sleeping on the class I would not take him again .",0
Amazing teacher. Really tries to keep the subject matter lighthearted and interesting. She is very straight forward about her requirements for assignments. Very lecture heavy though and only gives term lists for tests. If you go to class on and take notes you should get an A no problem. Attendance is only mandatory on reading discussion days.,1
"I never wanted to ditch class because she was so amazing! She's so sweet and nice in office hours! Gives super clear, and easy to follow lectures on very difficult subject matter. Always insightful, fun, chose some amazing books, and always incorporated other critic's thoughts aside from her own. She is one of the best professors I've ever had.",1
he is the nicest sweetest man ever in RCOE. The class is super fun and informative. I can't picture anyone else to teach this class. if you are conservative you might not like the class but people should get out of their comfort zones. would take his class a billion times.,1
"Taking this class online, she only grades off of total points, not average. There are enough assignment options that you can easily get enough points. I did not use the book except for once. I probably could've made an A without purchasing the online textbook. Easy class, if you know how to use word, powerpoint, and spreadsheet. Clear directions.  ",1
"slow and boring. reads directly from slides. concepts are reeeaaally easy its like learning about enzymes in high school again, but makes you memorize a large list of drugs and all their specific receptors in the body. tells you what kind of questions we'll see on exam but it doesn't matter if you don't have that list memorized.",0
"There's a lot of group projects and participation will take you a long way in this class. She's a very caring, understanding teacher. She's funny and definitely one of the nicest professors you'll ever meet.",1
Allen was very influential and inspirational. I will take all of his classes that he offers,1
"although he might be the easiest prof ever exist on the planet, he could be mean sometimes. if you dont follow the rule ur grade will went down, he can't really teach and i can't hear him at all.",0
Nice and funny.,1
She is a fantastic teacher and it is very evident that she cares about students success and loves the field she works in. The group projects are easy A's. There is a review before every exam that earns you extra credit on the exam. Shes provides a study guide for every exam. She also looks like Pam from the Office. Good for non science majors.,1
"A very bad instructor. Does not chemistry that well. His math level is a fourth grader. stay away, do not take his class.",0
"Dr Crumpler isn't the best at explaining. He gives plenty of examples and practice but his exams are a whole other thing. He'll go over something for 5 minutes and then put it on a test. Have questions? well, better protect your pride because this man will make you feel stupid with his unnecessary commentary.",0
"The WORST professor I have ever had. I would give her a 0 if it was an option. Some of the questions on the exam we haven't even covered yet. Homework is online, and we only get 3 tries for each problem. Doesn't give extra credit, a tough grader, and never answers emails. Please just DON'T take this class if you want a good grade.",0
Took her online class and expect to turn in papers and work. She is quick to reply to emails if you have a question or concern. She has good feedback to help you understand and improve on your papers. There are quizzes and tests which I enjoy because it helps me to practice and  understand what I just read. I thought it was an acceptable class. ,1
He is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He does not know what he is talking about and he does not teach.  He goes through powerpoints waaaayyy to fast.,0
"Never have I met a man so miserable. I tried as hard as I could to be pleasant to him, but he is always so rude to everyone. It must be an awful existence to be so angry with life. As a teacher he's not very good, he yells when people don't pay attention to him at all times. He should be teaching high school.",0
"Judith is not a very nice person.  She plays favourites in her classes, and if you're not one of them, you can not do anything right.  I think that she teaches so that she has a captive audience to brag about her writing.  So she's a Canadian writer - she's not that famous - don't be starstruck. If that's all she's riding on, it isn't much.",0
"BLESS MARK BERKSON. Seriously, what a sweetheart. His lectures are always fun to listen to. He's clearly very passionate and makes learning the material enjoyable. TAKE DETAILED NOTES! That's all you really need. Also, his dad sweaters are something to look forward to.",1
"Super arbitrary in terms of grading, I asked him in the middle of the quarter about how I was doing in the class and he said I am in the top of the class but refused to give a letter grade. Then he gave me a B+ even though I was never late nor absent, and participate every class. I am just confused.",0
he is great and very hands on...,1
"Good: free points for attendance, labs, hw. Notes are short and sweet. Bad:  since I can only type 350 characters I'll just mention the main topics. Thick accent, purposely makes tests tricky, grades harshly. No partial credit on a test problem when I left out a number, just ""-10""! In my opinion, a little arrogant and likes to make you feel dumb.",0
"Very specific grader, very strict about citations and academic integrity. Not lenient with deadlines. Very opinionated and will debate with you until the end of class if he disagrees with your standpoint. If you're up for a challenge, take him. If you're not, I wouldn't.",0
"DO the work and you won't do badly, slack off and you've done yourself a disservice. ",1
If you read you will pass.,1
Mrs. Sundberg is extremely confusing. Quite frankly she doesn't teach anything. Very bothersome and the pace of the class is super slow. One paper will take you like 3 weeks to write because she likes steps instead of rough drafts. I would fight god before I take her class again.,0
"Prof Conner is an amazing teacher, I took her for College Algebra and i am very thankful for everything that i learnt from this class. Math itself is very confusing, but if you pay attention and do homework you will have a good grade. I would recommend her.",1
I'm not sure she realizes that online courses are still supposed to be between Monday and Friday. She has things due on Saturdays at 8 am which makes absolutely no sense. Asking way too much out of students given the nature of the class. Find a different professor/class. She & the excessive coursework are not worth your time.,0
"He is a tough teacher who at the beginning tells you what exactly he is expecting you to do to actually pass the course. The wording of his tests are advanced. If you're  in for the challenge go on ahead, but besides that I would suggest you to find another teacher. In order to get some points at the end you have to speak up and answer questions.",0
"boring you want to kill yourself. I had Chaucer in high school and couldn't wait to take a course in college. HS was better, we learned something about the middle ages. The one good thing is that  its an easy A.",0
"Excellent real-world lectures, assignments and projects. I learned so much about databases and SQL programming and the professor was always helpful. She is funny and thorough.",1
"I am happy that the previous writer on this list has received help from him. However, this is far from the truth, and if the new students will come in his classroom with that mindset they are in for a rude awakening. Just do not take his class, and you'll make yourself a favour.",0
Wish there was another professor to teach this course at Fresno state. She doesn't offer plenty of extra credit which seems reasonable considering her test are extremely hard. You need to study so much for this class. She's tough on her students and expect you to know everything.,0
"Dr. Tiwari is a truly excellent teacher!  He teaches some of the hardest subjects (in my opinion), and does such a great job of breaking things down for his students to understand.  He was always quick with a joke too which made things not too serious!",1
"people say its hard to understand him , but for me it seemed like he was clear. Make sure you attend everyclass because if you miss one lecture u will be behind. His lecture notes matter because many stuff on the exam are from his notes. He also carves alot so make sure you do above average and try to do the home works on your own",1
"Pam is a pretty good teacher. Her class is easy, and assignment due dates are always clear and reasonable. The only bad thing about the class is that she talks WAY too much! I often find myself falling asleep! Other than that, I would recommend taking her for ED 320 :)",1
"Nice lady, didn't retain much information. Wish she included translations on the screen of her lectures as her accent is extremely hard to understand. Not hard at all if you moderately apply yourself. She's pretty clear about her objectives and doesn't assign much work. Its really up to you to study. Take her for the ""A"", don't take her to learn.",0
During Covid she took weeks to respond to my emails.,0
"The course work is just watching a movie weekly and discussion boards. What I don't like is how she has us post everyday in the discussion and have a ""conversation"" with other classmates. It seems ridiculous to do that because it's just about a movie, then we have to also participate in class. There is just a lot of participation involved.",0
Very interesting.  I am glad I signed up for her class.,1
"You will do very well in this class if you have just come out of high school Algebra and are a A student. I found this instructor to be difficult because She didn't give out homework assignment right away. One time she didn't post the homework for eight hours. The second exam hours were written on the white board as 9AM-12, at 11:15 test stopped",1
Worst teacher I've had yet. He judges you and belittles you in front of everyone. I hated this class and recommend that students find a different professor. He makes you feel stupid and isn't a good teacher. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS!,0
"Terrible. All she does is go over the extensive reading in lecture, she's pretentious and the class is useless, no application to anything.",0
Recommend 100%. Take him. He is really nice and helps you a lot. Everything is done online. No bad comments,1
"Dr. Zwier's p-chem class was tough, but he is an *amazing* instructor. He takes very difficult concepts and turns them into ""Oh. That's so completely obvious"" moments. Homework and tests are difficult, but he's big on take-home and group work. READ YOUR TEXTBOOK, go to lectures, and you'll get through p-chem with no problems!",1
She really isn't the nicest lady. Pretty rude as well. Leaves class mid lecture to take phone calls for what? I don't know. There are days where she's pleasant and then days where she's so nasty you can cut the tension with a knife. If you just go to class and do your best you'll be fine. It's just not a pleasant experience though.,0
"Ree is a great professor. If you're interested its easy, but even if you aren't it's still pretty easy. Doesn't take attendance on project days (which last for usually a week of class periods) but show up otherwise you'll be lost. He is also really cute and a fun, laid back guy.",1
"She was so awesome! NO homework but class assignments and the group project is so freaking simple! I got an A and oh yeah, shes really nice and cool.",1
"Very, very hard on grading.  Humiliating to some students.  Do not take writing with this instructor.  I recommend M. Hampton for all writing courses at MHCC!",0
"Professor Nia C. Mahallati, J.D.-PROC 5840-Legal Acquisitions Graduate Law course at Webster. Recommend attending all class sessions as tests based on class materials. Very informative class, exceptional professor. Provides extensive coverage of Uniform Commercial Code (Sale of Goods). Highly recommend this graduate law course and professor.",1
"Diffenetial equations is already a difficult class made more difficult by this professor.   Bad: reads directly from book Maple computing assignment BRUTAL tests BRUTAL grading Avg50% Seems reluctant to give specifics when asking for help   Good: easily understandable and seems to care  smart guy, just not a good teacher. You will struggle.",0
"I have taken many on line classes and this class has been not only interesting, but fun. I felt I learned a lot and have discovered I love sociology. Mrs Robertson is a wonderful teacher. Take her class!!!",1
"My all time favorite professor a Case. He's hilarious and genuinely enjoys teaching and making an impact. He goes above and beyond as a professor to make sure he's students have a valuable experience. Take whatever class you can get with him, you'll be doing yourself a favor!",1
Talks too much and doesn't listen to what students have to say. He also tends to talk down to students and never gives a clear answer. His grading is straight forward. Expect multiple long emails per day.,0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. She does not explain anything. She works the problem and assumes you understand. Never ask a question in her class you will MAKE FUN OF YOU! For not understanding. I hate going to her class, but I know that I have to go in order to pass.",0
"Professor Vasquez is awesome! I took her History of the USA II class online and it was very easy. But, I did learn a lot too. We had about 12 total writing assignments but she cancelled 8 of them and credited us since the first few were intense and she wanted us to focus more on the content of the class. FINALLY a professor that understands!",1
He doesn't know what he's doing. He have true/false for 25 credits in the tests.,0
Terrible choice. All she does is read off the slides and is not willing to help the students when they have questions. She even gets annoyed when you ask questions. She thinks she is funny,0
"I am taking his class for Calculus II which is the hardest. He is a good teacher, however, definitely speaks and do math too fast!! Pop quizzes once a week, projects in every section. Calc II is a very challenging course. Prof Le is not the nicest and helpful teacher I know. He requires over usual math skills. Overall he is OK. You have to work...",1
"Dr. Hill was by far the worst professor I had my freshman year. The most bland lecturer you'll ever see, she reads her notes and doesn't keep anyone in the room engaged. After five tests in her class, I still don't know how to prepare for one. If you're thinking about taking Nutrition as an elective -- DON'T. Dr. Hill makes an easy class hard.",0
"Dr. Schore makes a chemistry lecture interesting, which is a hard task to do. He is clear about what is on tests and what he expects you to know, and he is extremely knowledgable (you can ask him anything about chemistry and chances are he will explain it to you fully). Practice tests are your best friends for midterms and final!",1
"Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.",0
"I took a class with Brix  this semester after reading all the amazing reviews (and having him be recommended to me by many friends). All I can say is, no one was exaggerating. He is beyond belief, both as a teacher and a person. You would be a fool not to take any class taught by him. I never left class less than totally inspired.",1
Mr. Ross is an amazing professor. He is very accesible during office hours and at answering emails. He explains content very well and cares about his students. Extra credit on exams. Homework can be long and tedious but that is just the nature of the course. If effort is given you will get an A or B.,1
"I don't have a Calculus background, and Professor Miracle doesn't really explain the things he's doing. Even though I go to lecture, I get basically nothing from it. I read the textbook instead. It's written by him, which goes to show he's a brilliant man, just not necessarily good at teaching verbally.",0
Makes the material easy to learn and he does not want to fail anyone. Gives chances for extra credit as well. Usually lets class out early.,1
"This professor doesn't curve the test or do anything when the class average is below a passing grade than tell you to drop the class, no extra credit or anything. So if math doesn't comes to you easily then this teacher isn't the best teacher for you. You can be dropped from the class because of attendance but it is not apart of your grade.",0
An amazing teacher i enjoyed being in her class she made math easy and understandable ,1
Professor Stevenson was an amazing lab professor. She answers any questions during lab and is available at her office hours with help studying for practicals. She is very sweet and funny and I'd recommend her for lab or lecture.,1
Dr. Starner is soooo nice.  He explains wonderfully and he is very patient with everyone in class. He really wants the people in his class to succeed and he has fun teaching. Don't miss class. Everything you need to know will be taught to you in class. Haven't opened the book yet.,1
"Professor is nice, but the TA is mean and doesn't help at all!",0
"Worst teacher ever. You ask her for help, and she seems to get mad that you need her help. Piles the homework up as if this is your only class. Takes for ever to grade your work. She is fast at emailing you back if she is going to respond with a smart comment,otherwise it will take her forever. I do not recommend any one to take her. HORRIBLE",0
"Prof Seymour is absolutely hilarious. Participation is key in this class & he creates an atmosphere which allows students to engage with each other about what we've learned. His lectures however, are not always clear & do not provide enough info to prepare for exams, googled info not allowed. He's wonderful, but his professionalism needs work.",1
I'm currently taking her class. She is a little confusing but All the quizzes & test are online & every Friday u have a quiz that you take with your group & all homework is online as well on web assign and  she allow multiple  attempts to correct your hw problem online. And if you miss the due date for the homework she'll extend it for you. ,1
"Kubota-sensei is a fantastic teacher! This was my second time having her as a professor for Japanese. She really makes learning Japanese fun! There's a lot of homework, but it's all very helpful! The final project was a five minute presentation on the prefecture of your choice. It was really great!",1
"It's super funny that some students think this class is an ""easy A"" despite the fact they got a B-.  You don't want to take this class with this professor if you value your GPA, want to learn something, enjoy psychology, or are taking other classes.  The assignments are never ending and you cannot work at  your own pace.",0
"I took McCartneys Civic Engagement class which turned out to be a little bit about civic engagement and more about the United Nations. You are required to give 3 presentations, 2 in class and one to a high school class. I am not sure how it relates to civic engagement but be just prepared to focus specifically on the UN for the 2nd half.",1
"HARD CLASS!! Exciting course, but she really doesn't try and make the class easy. If you value your gpa don't take her. Her tests tend to be really tricky. Fun course but really hard! 2 midterms 1 final 2 papers.",0
"Im currently taking her classes online and let me tell you, I couldnt be more confused. She replies quickly but not enough material to help you understand it. Just a couple of videos and turn in work that you arent sure if you did correctly. Recommend you take a teacher online that provides a lot of sources online to help you master the class.",0
He is the worst teacher.,0
"Good professor. You will want to shoot yourself though if you're not into poetry and creative writing, as this is what the literature class evolved into.",1
The best!!! I can't say more than that. ,1
"His lectures are boring and confusing but the homework assignments and tests are straightforward. Fairly lenient grader on all exams too. I highly recommend reading the textbook thoroughly to reinforce his lectures. The final project is something you should be proactive about though, it can sneak up on you. Overall, it's a chill math class.",1
"Martin is not a good prof, he glances over important topics and goes in deep detail of things that should not be covered in the course(Like putting Riemann integrals on a midterm, this is not MATH 261). His practice problems he posts are terrible half of them are applied topics which you don't need to know. Get ready to teach yourself some math.",0
"I took this class for credit, she knows nothing about the material she is trying to teach, uses a tool called j creator, which is 10 years old. Meaning we as a class were learning java from ten years ago, I currently program with a tool called eclipse, which is the modern equivalent. She is rude and not clear with her grading criteria. Dont take.",0
"I took the 468 topics course in Environmental Cultural Studies and loved it! Kata was really flexible and obviously really into the subject matter. The class was discussion based and there was a lot of reading. There was no textbook to buy, just mountains of articles to read but they were all really interesting so I never really minded it. ",1
"Such a fun and interactive class! Loved going to it and learning about new philosophical concepts. Had a great time and Dr. Gentry was super nice and laid back. The class has 3 essays, a couple of quizzes, and a couple of paragraphs. If you do the readings and actually try on your papers you will definitely pass with an A.",1
"Dr. Jasmin is the BEST chemistry teacher I have ever had. If you want a good orgo teacher, take him. Yes orgo is hard. No it isn't going to be easy. Jasmin makes it more enjoyable and bearable. He curves the tests if the class average is below a 50% and he curves the final grades. Also, he is hilarious and knows EVERYONE's names. I'm not kidding.",1
"Gabe is a hilarious dude. He does get off topic quite a bit in class, cancels class a lot, and doesn't get much done during some class periods. I think he tries to make class enjoyable for all students, and he wants to be memorable. I would take him again for an easy pass. As long as you do what is asked of you, you will earn the grade.",1
Dr. Little's Cultural Anthropology class is completely unfair and ridiculous. His test are all short answer and he does not clearly specify what is going to be on the test. (The test are 12 chapters long) There is only one way to do things in his class and it is HIS way. I would not recommend taking him as a professor for any course at CIU.,0
"Worst professor I've had at Pitt. Lectures are just him deriving formulas. He never actually taught derivatives; just expected to know how to do them. Never posted any grades, just a letter at the end of the semester. Gave 3 pop-quizzes that probably didn't even affect grades. Tests were unreasonably hard and did not relate to the final in anyway.",0
"I have never learned more nor enjoyed a class more than Spanish with Professor Dattolo! I am sure that you will feel the same! He is respectful of his students, dedicated to his work and very organized. Learning is easy and fun with professor Dattolo.",1
"Winslow is a cool dude. He's corny and tries too hard, but it makes the class entertaining. Chill in terms of reading, and his feedback is helpful. His standards are about average for TO, and he does grade on improvement. He's not the most inspirational professor I've ever had, but he's a nice guy who cares about your writing. Would recommend.",1
"No doubt - the reading is like drinking water from a high-pressure firehose!  Keep up with it, though, because she can spot BS from a mile away (someone else tried that). You *will* learn a whole lot if you are serious about history! She encourages independent thought and research, and favors the enthusiastic.  Find your interest early, though.",1
She does not answer emails. It is a professor's job to respond to emails.,0
"He's a really nice guy, but a terrible professor in every way possible. His lectures are extremely boring/not beneficial, he takes FOREVER to grade assignments, he is terrible at communicating with students outside of class, he is super disorganized and an unreasonably harsh grader. Trust me, if you're not a WFB major, DO NOT take his class.",0
Horrible instruction. She rather talk about her personal life than explain what the class is doing wrong since apparently we make so many mistakes. She has handed out three pages so far and has not discussed any of the questions we answered for a grade. gives prompt for two passages to choose then pushes off the book never to talk about it again.,0
"Have a question in class? Don't bother asking, she will tell you ""you should know this,"" (and move on). Want to know the subjects on your upcoming exam? Too bad, she will beat around the bush as much as possible to make things 10x more difficult. If you are looking for a teacher that will make learning almost impossible, this is the one for you!",0
"She's a lovely lady who loves to talk about her life. Lessons are clear, all you need to do is take notes. Tests are easy.",1
"Mi-Sook is by far the best professor I have ever had. It takes a while to get used to her strict grading, but she will go above and beyond to help you when you ask. She cares about students on a personal level and truly wants each person to do their best. Her high expectations are a reflection of her interest in student's learning.",1
Her Ant 010 was the easiest course I've taken in college. Good filler class; helps the GPA.,1
He is an absolute awful professor. He will give you grades based on how well he likes you. Don't make yourself known to him. Sucking up to him is a must. Brown nose as much as possible. His grading is not fair and even if you are right and argue he will not do anything about it.,0
"Easy class, interesting materials!",1
Class was very focused on hands-on learning which was difficult but fun - 95% labs and 5% lecture. LCDR expects you to do your best to figure it out on your own but is very knowledgeable and will answer questions if you genuinely can't figure it out. Quizzes and tests are not easy but are straightforward.,1
"Online class, home works and quizzes are easy. Test are all short answer and barely relate to topics on homework or quizzes",0
"She is very nice and will work with you even on the exam questions that she gives you before hand. She can be a tough grader for quizzes and writing assignments but  again, she will give you feedback. In my class  she didn't use powerpoints and just wrote on the board, SO GO TO CLASS.",1
"I found her lectures to be quite interesting, she likes engaging with the class and I enjoyed that. Exams weren't too difficult as it was mostly based off of the textbook. If you miss a class you can usually make it up by reading the text book to add to your notes as her slides are pretty vague.",1
"Kate is ultimately the best teacher that I ever had at OIT. She is a fantastic educator and extremely knowledgeable. Unlike any other educator, Kate is more than willing to help her students in any way even if it means coming in on her own time to tutor students.",1
"This was my second time taking Mitchell, as I had him for CHM1025. He's a hilarious professor, making lectures fun. He does an okay job of explaining topics, but they can be pretty convincing, as he uses the same slides from previous classes. His tests don't always match the lecture, but he does release topic lists for the exams.",1
"Matt teaches exactly what you will need to know for the exams. Participate in lab and follow the manual. Ask questions, he'll only go deeper if you bring it up. Form groups to study the lecture notes and slides. His Nerd News facts are funny. Overall good professor.",1
"This class was kind of difficult in some parts. Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor though, he's very passionate and insightful through his lectures. He gives 2 major tests (midterm and final) and 3 quizzes based on the 3 thematic books that he assigns.",1
"Portfleet is such a nice professor and is hilarious! She goes on and on when she tells stories and always let my class out sooo early. She is so passionate about what she teaches, but I do not think I learned one thing in her class.",1
"He's infatuated with flowery prose, plots that range from wistful to depressing, and image-heavy poetry. That's it. Not helpful if you write genre fiction. Very traditionalist and pushes a literary fiction-or-bust attitude. I took a piece I cared about to him during office hours, and he essentially told me to can it and write something else.",0
"Lectures do not help for tests, but he is a great guy and won't put you to sleep all the time(I mean the material is boring he does what he can)",1
Prof Sigal is great. He's far from the stereotypically boring history prof. He really encourages you to be creative which is refreshing. I took his course on colonial Latin America and enjoyed it a lot. Whether you're taking a course in history to fulfill a general req or for your major I definitely recommend him.,1
This is probably one of the most challenging Classes I have taken. Proffessor Robertson expects a lot out of her students. You have one big research paper throughout the whole semester and a final group project. Personally i feel like a lot of her assignments were rushed and required a lot of crunch time . But i will say I learned a lot.,0
Gives extra credit and will help you understand the material. All points count.,1
"She is very organized, clear with what she wants. Cares about students and gives lots of extra credit. Homework is optional, doesn't collect it. Gives lots of worksheets as assignments, enough to give you practice. Frequent tests and quizzes, online but really help study and understand. Open for questions Highly recommend. Easy A if do all work.",1
"Very interesting guy and youll learn a lot that will be useful in the real world. That being said, if youre looking for an easy A in the 478 class take another professor. Our project was a semester long group project that ended up being over 100 pages. No rubric either just his subjective grading. Youll pass but it probably wont be an A",1
"Lisa is a great professor. She's very knowledgeable, personable and approachable with questions. She is flexible on attendance as long as you let her know. The quizzes and exams are easy if you read the book. You can use notes on exams. There are three small assignments which are fairly easy. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Great class!",1
"Dan Singer doesn't care if students learn. Over half the class failed. The half that did pass cheated on every exam. The cheating was obvious (phones, notes, even talking during test). Some students slipped him a note about it and still nothing was done. An absolute disaster of a class. I probably should have cheated too, the tests are very hard!",0
She is one of the worst teachers i've ever had in my life. She doesn't know what the hell she is talking about half of the time and repeats herself constantly. Very disorganized and you never get out early!!! She always talks about her family and when she lived in spain. Don't take her class she is HORRIBLE!!!!!,0
"Prior to taking this class, I've never made a B in college. She doesn't teach during class but instead talks about world events like others have mentioned. Grades excessively hard on essays and isn't available for office hours when you need help. AVOID.",0
"I signed up thinking this would be a fun French film class. He has taught it before and made that clear, heres the catch... it was a new book. He gave insane amounts of homework for absolutely no reason then we spent the whole class GOING OVER the homework. I learned nothing at all. Grading criteria was switched two weeks before the final.",0
"Dr. Besing is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's always willing to help you outside of class, and while his classes are a lot of work, you'll get a lot out of them if you're willing to do it. His lectures are very high value, and really worth attending. His sense of humor is unique, but he can be funny. Occasionally.",1
"I really did not like this class, Dr. Barnes was disrespectful, always went off task, never specified details for assignments and was a tough grader. You won't learn anything in this class and she doesn't give any help when asked. Probably the worst teacher I've had in college so far.",0
He is a horrible teacher. I can't stand to listen to this man speak. He is alwasy 20 min. late for class and he always leaves early. I'm not talking 5 min. early I'm talking 30min. early. He can't teach. You will learn nothing in this class!!,0
Dr. Wood is an amazing instructor! Not sure what the other person was thinking below. He challenges you to do your best. He is very helpful if you make the time to meet with him. He pushes students to be their best. I have nothing but respect for him.  He will challenge you. The courses are difficult. But in a very good way!,0
"You would think in this day and age a professor would be able to use a computer, but apparently not. This teacher gives messy hand written notes. Gives notes strictly by talking which is hard to understand,talks fast, and just gives his view of the situation. His tests term part and essay part. Marks answers wrong even though they are right.",0
"Melvin Hall makes you read TONS of redundant material;  over 200 boring pages a week!  His tests have obscure questions that are hard to  answer.  The reading makes you fall asleep while slogging through it.  Avoid this teacher and EPS 550, Marisa Crowley (she uses his tons of reading  material ).  This class is NOT about learning.",0
"He goes about the class in a great way. He wants to just open the Bible and dig in, but he grades hard and unless you read before class you cannot participate in discussion. He wants us to lead a lot, and the idea of a discussion-based class is great for sure, but the insight and instruction he gave on seemingly tough passages was most beneficial.",1
"Horrible teacher, offers to help but never takes you up on the offer, i emailed him several times for help on the final paper and never received an email back. Then has the nerve to give a bad grade. Also takes up the entire class time talking about nothing and yet attendence is mandatory? He enjoys hearing himself speak about literaly nothing.",0
"350 characters is simply not enough for me to explain all of the reasons NOT to have Stephen Connor as your professor. Please save yourself hours of studying, attending his lectures with hopes of learning, and the tears of getting an awful undeserved mark. If you can wait a semester to get another prof, please do it. Just trust me.",0
Dr. Rizkalla is tough but an excellent professor. He is fair and easy to talk to. The material he teaches is hard and it is important to attend class and recitation to learn the material. You will be left behind quickly if you miss or ignore the homework assignments.,1
Does not care about students and it shows!  Multiple choice exams ... he does not care about student learning!!,0
Gets ready to study hard. If you missed assignments no chance to cover up its done. work hard get good grade else end up with D or C.,1
She is very nice professor but a tad intimidating...she is classy.  She expects a lot but it is Grad school.  She may seem like she is not interested in her students but I came to find that she is...you have to seek out help and have questions ready...don't expect her to baby-sit you.,1
Shes rude. She teaches us stuff in which The class doesnt believe will benefit us. She also tried to get loud with a student because He didnt have his flash drive. Like idk what type of teacher treats there student in such a rude way. Its unacceptable.,0
"Callaway knows her stuff, but that makes her a really harsh grader on papers and microthemes. She's super clear about what she wants from you on the midterm exam, so study and you'll do well. She always offers opportunity to revise your work and improve your grade, and is always available for office hours to help with whatever you need.",1
"Max makes some good jokes in class but he is hard to approach for help. He'll make you feel really dumb when you're asking for help. He doesn't use a textbook or post any practice questions. There is no clear guideline for tests, the average for the midterm was 23% curved to 46%. He calls on you in class and gets mad when no one answers him.",0
"Wow, what a joke. This guy is horrible. Changes his mind on everything from day to day. Makes fun and insults people who do poorly on assignments and/or do not understand the material. Told the class ""if you don't understand my lectures, don't come to class!"". I honestly can't explain in 350 characters how big of a jerk he is. Avoid him at all cost",0
"Good professor, helpful, accessible and generally cares about you. Go to the office hours like the other student said. Tests and quizzes are straight off text / class - but you have to do the work - but you'll learn a lot. Prof is pretty cool actually.  Class is recommended and prof is good overall...",1
"He sucks tbh. He wont let you ask other students for HELP (he considered it cheating) hell call you out for other students to see, rude, unprofessional, and a horrible source of help or guidance. Dont take.",0
"I was hesitant to take her class because of the poor reviews, but a friend of mine had taken the class prior and encouraged me to take it with her. She became my favorite professor! I loved her class and the discussions we had as a group. She is so funny and has so many stories from her time abroad. I definitely recommend taking her!!",1
"She is the worst professor i had in my life the worst in UBC so far. Unorganized the explanations are totally unclear. The grading criteria and feedback on midterms is confuse as hell. The tests are not abou the lecture. My course is Algae, fungi and bryophites the finals were about Corey Bradshaw's presentation that, and about the whole eukaryote",0
"Avoid Mook at all cost. Where the other professors/sections curve, Mook did not. Also his class is significantly harder than the other professors to(We learn more material than them). And his lecturing style is atrocious. All he does is make terrible jokes and does no example problems. Final was insanely hard(worth 40% to). HW at timesis impossible",0
"Will never forget the endless stress and exhaustion this class gave to me. Doesn't teach well, assumes students are dumb but in reality we're just completely lost and always says to ""google"" if you can't find an answer. -_- Takes aways 10% of final grade if you are absent once and was consistently late to class. Don't take unless you know coding!",0
She is so incredibly boring. I thought that the class material was going to be really fun and exciting but it was such a let down. Could have done a lot more interesting things in the class and instead it is the one class I dread going to the most. Seems to be pretty easy though.,1
"Amazing man, terrible professor. He is kind, caring, and hilarious, but does not know how to teach in the least. This class was the biggest waste of time. I can't believe this is what my tuition went to.",0
"Not only is this class hard, his lectures are beyond boring. He missed his calling somewhere and should not be teaching. Even his extra credit opp. are more work then all my other classes. I would never ever taking a class with him again",0
"Very hard tests! but he's a great lecturer.  Beware that problems on the test will be more advanced and harder than problems done in class and assigned for H.W. Again, his tests are very challenging. You'll need more than lecture problems and hw to get an A in his class.   He's very nice and always willing to help. current grade is at a B+",1
"Soo much work! An excessive amount really, almost a hundred questions per chapter and you do two a week. Always includes a post with the work and she is an extremely hard grader. The work itself isn't too bad but it's very time consuming and very pointless.",0
"I Took Abnormal Psych Advanced as an independent study for my Bachelors's. Just a suggestion when you get her book start reading the book and begin answering the questions through the chapters; they are either in red or blue boxes depends on edition. Not consistent giving feedback on the papers, made it clear to me she is VERY PART TIME.",0
"Passionate lecturer, knows his stuff, three easy exam each takes 33.3% of the total grade. No attendance, no quiz. Cons: he doesn't like private conversation with students",1
"The worst professor I've ever taken. Talks about herself, and is kind of rude to students. Forgets everything, sends assignment instructions out late, but still expects them to be due on their normal due dates. Doesn't teach anything. Don't take a class with her, ever.",0
It was all Greek to me. When he teaches he expects you to know everything there is to know about Finance when the class is supposed to be an Introduction to Finance. He made it harder than it had to be.,0
"Very nice guy! He talks about himself a lot, but did a great job of structuring a class that was both workshop and lecture. All of our work was based around reading and writing creatively. Take his class if you can, he's a really solid professor.",1
Great teacher!!! She has a willingness to help all her students and she wants us to succeed. She is the best teacher I have ever taken. Wish more teachers were like Ms. Berger-Hill. ,1
"Professor just reads the slides off in class. He gives lots of study material but he never posts the answers so you never know if you're doing the right thing. The formula sheet that he gives for exams is insane and really hard to use. Ive never been so frustrated with a professor, I have a 3.6 gpa always done pretty well in school but I may fail.",0
She is boring and her tests are hard! She asks very specific questions about pointless facts. Worst class ever.,0
"It states that you don't need to know some music to take this class, yet I'd recommend you should. The reading was heavy and the homework the teacher gave was not clear, nor did he offer any correction for them. Tests were heavily weighted compared to homework.  I do not wish to take another music class for an extremely long time.",0
He has such a monotone voice and i tired to stay interest in the subject but listening to him puts me to sleep. He does crack jokes on a occasions. Gives you a chance to do extra credit. if you miss more then 7 classes your grade drops to by 12%. i wouldn't recommend taking him,0
He is such a great teacher! He doesnt sit up their and bore you with a lecture. He actually teaches so it is understandable. He also does so many examples to make sure students understand.,1
She is very rude and reads directly from power points. She will force people to make friend with the others . The class is very boring and is very hard to remain focus,0
I would definitely recommend her .,1
"ATP was a great professor. Funny and engaging. Definitely have to work for your grade. Attendance is not mandatory but Iclicker points are in every class (50 total for semester) so if you skip, you lose points. Super helpful and always willing to answer questions. Highly recommend this class. Don't buy the textbook but DO buy lecture notebook.",1
haha could not get any worse. You're better off taking this class online because you're going to be teaching yourself the material anyway.,0
"She is a nice lady, and can be  very accommodating, **BUT** as a teacher, she performed VERY poorly! She doesn't set clear expectations re: learning outcomes, is awfully disorganized grading ( often failing to provide feedback on quizzes & homework in time to keep you from making the same mistakes on the next test. Worst college teacher I've had!",0
"Prof. Keeling is a good teacher, and I found his course material really interesting and engaging. I would have liked the course better if he were more respectful. He tends to be very passive aggressive to his students and even complained about several of them to me in office hours once. Recommended as a professor, but not as a human being",0
This class isn't exactly difficult although at the end of the semester you are given a news article essay. After waiting three weeks for a grade I was given a 50% after emailing professor Baltodano he was extremely rude and it almost seemed as if I bruised his ego. I ended up falling by .7%. That's right point 7 percent.,0
"Professor Wood was awesome! I felt like it was one of the more useful classes from Chaffey. Not only has the class tremendously helped me in my future endeavors, but it was an extremely enjoyable class. I started off avoiding and disliking group projects,but the class taught me how to become a better group member, and best of yet, a leader. nothard",1
"Great dude; every lecture will have a 5 min tangent or life story for sure. Fair amount of homework, I showed up half the time and managed to get an A (he's receptive to emailing assignments and posts class notes online). Exams are exact copies of the practice tests he gives out save a few minor switch ups. Overall great course, very educational.",1
I felt like the labs actually were useful for the class (rare). She was nice and friendly. I didn't enjoy how she would basically yell student answers out loud when they would ask for help correcting or verifying their work. Activities in the class were often difficult but I appreciated how she went through them thoroughly with us.,1
"Literally the most boring professor ever. Everyone falls asleep in class and the absurd amount of homework you have with the most extra essay criteria is really annoying. If you really need the class for Hub, it's good to take because the class is not hard. It's just a lot of work and wanting to cry listening to his lectures.",0
"Started off liking him as a professor and slowly began to really hate him. As many people have said, his lectures weren't great. His tests were very confusing in his set up since he did them through Moodle, although the class required web assign and could've just done it through there. Refused to give back credit due to syntax and was mostly rude.",0
"Easiest class I've taken! Material is hard but her tests are easy! Straight from her notes, most are fill in the blank but she also has some multiple choice & matching. Even gives a few small hints on tests. She even gave us a word bank on the muscles test! Gives lots of points for homework & attending class.. Gives several ""bonus"" quizzes too!",1
Very passionate during lectures and entertaining throughout. I always left the class wanting to know more. Very clear expectations on assignments/exams. Don't fall behind on reading or read just enough to answer the assignments. Has a really strict no bathroom/water rule. Overall fun class to take to learn more about why the world is the way it is.,1
"Great class, great teacher, and interesting class. Take it! Be sure to stay caught up.",1
"Prof Engleke is great!  She is very helpful especially during clinicals.  She will always call everyone to observe/try a new procedure.  Her lectures could be a bit too fast paced.  Somehow she expects you to know the contents.  But then I took her during 203, so I guess by now she expected a lot from us.  She made nursing very interesting.  A+",1
"This class was a nightmare. She never posted the material like she said and never answered emails. Her reasoning always being she ""didnt get the email"" even though when BCCd to a second party, the second party always received it and Thielo never did...... interesting. study for days for final only to find out she posted the 2nd exam again . . . .",0
"By far the worst professor that I have ever had. She never responds to emails, but those rare times that she does, she wont even answer your questions. Shes never taught .. just gives the work. She makes it hard to learn, and wont help even if you're begging for help. You're really on your own. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. YOU'LL BE SET UP FOR FAILURE!",0
"She is nice, but she is EXTREMELY ""loopy.""  She forgets things all the time and even changed her teaching topic mid-sentence into something totally unrelated! It's pretty scary. It can be very frustrating. If you have other options for piano, I would strongly consider them.",0
Rude and condescending to students. I wouldnt recommend this professor.,0
assignments are too hard!!!,0
"This professor is TERRIBLE. I have never seen a professor grade so harshly on DQs. On top of all of the homework I already have, he makes me stress about them. He is not considerate of personal issues going on in your life either. I would never take this class or professor again. I am a 4.0 student and he makes everything 10x harder with these DQs.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Worst experience. She is so disrespectful towards her students, disorganized, yells at people who are trying hard, blames others for her own mistakes, and insults on a personal level. An overall really terrible experience.",0
"This guy teaches the class as if we're professional accountants. He moves way too fast, tip-toes around ?'s when u ask them, he is very stuck up and condesending. The material is hard enuff without this fat idiot speeding thru the material and making u feel like an idiot when u ask ?'s. He also sweats alot during class,do yourself a favor AVOID HIM",0
Not helpful,0
"He hadn't taught Bio100 in a long time and it was very obvious that he wasn't as into it like he is with anatomy. Comes prepared, will answer questions. Okay teacher, but not a great teacher, or a bad one.",1
He made me not want to take a Bio class ever again. ( he is not approachable),0
"Had Mr. Knesek for my final class before graduation (MGT 489), and he's an outstanding guy. Always available to talk after class. Tests are tough, but he does give out extra credit to improve your grade. You will be assigned a group presentation and that counts as a big chunk of your grade. Be sure to show up to get points.",1
"Her lectures are very dry and she gets off track easily. It takes her forever to start the lecture since she always has some random thing to say at the beginning of class. Her tests are by far the laziest I've seen which leads to the wording to be either convoluted, ambiguous, or unclear. Even the typography and appearance of her tests look bad.",0
Due to the online only format he was thoughtful in allowing multiple attempts at quizzes and homework. It was a great option some sections were harder than others.,1
"This was a diagnosis and assessment course on DSM V. Unfortunately Dr. Meshelemiah is NOT a clinician. A non-clinician instructing this course was absurd. She is a confusing writer and will debate it is your fault for not reading her true intent into ambiguous language. Students have no idea what a writer intended to say, only what was written.",0
Pretty hard to understand at times and needs to keep up on the test to pass the class.  Rarely any homework but online quizzes.,0
"Fair enough, he's a nice guy but the contents of the course are BS. This class disguises religion as philosophy, and you need to treat myths like credible facts. There's a ton of reading and it's very difficult. he's a very tough grader on the in class writing, and the exam is brutal because i felt completely underprepared for it. not recommended!",0
"Incredibly tough marker. My english profs cared less about APA in papers than Steve. He is a very knowledgeable prof, however he holds students to a very high level of understanding and mastery. APA matters just as much as content, at times it feels like it matters more. Text used in class was also very difficult to read. Very fun classes though!",1
"Great Professor!! Compared to the calculus classes at a UCF this class is cake. I love the way he explains problems! He doesn't speed through them, but he obviously can't go too slow because there is a lot of material to cover. Quizzes and test are required, but homework is optional. Obviously with the more practice you have the better you get.",1
"She teaches absolutely nothing in her class. If you ever wanted to be better in writing, please don't choose her. ",0
"Dr. Schauer is the best professor I've ever had. She's a fantastic teacher and very caring! The material itself isn't super difficult, but there's a good bit of homework. Really though, as long as you show up and try, you should do well.",1
Ms Jane i would marry you. She's cool. helpful. gives time for questions. Bad = accepts hw that is super late which is unfair to A students who do their work on time.,1
Professor Nelson is a great professor and is really understanding if you clearly state a problem you have. Her lectures are straight-foward and she is reasonable with her grading. She can be a bit tough towards the end but she isn't a rude professor. She will answer questions as long as they're respectful.,1
He is an old man. He makes lectures boring and gives only a limited amount of extra credit to a few students. He gives too much homework problems to do. He makes mistakes that involves math and sitting on his own glasses (Best Moment of his Class). He is disrespectful. He takes points off small details. He makes people feel bad. He shouldn't teach,0
Homework every class containing about 20 questions. Each assignment takes about an hour to complete. Couldn't fully understand his demos.,0
I do not know where to begun because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps in class and can't teach.,0
"Dr. Kalinowskis tremendous amount of firsthand experience, passion and ability to relay the material in a relatable and memorable fashion make her invaluable as an instructor. She has high expectations for her students and expects you to put in the work, but ensures to make herself readily available to her students. I highly recommend her!",1
"The worest Teacher on this planet 100% sure of it. Can not get any worse. Doesnt help students, makes fun of students. He gives us projects to do and we have not even completed the lecture on what we need to complete the projects.",0
"Do not take this prof she made almost the whole class  fail, the midterms was not what was on the textbook or on her BB slides, try to switch, or drop the course I highly DO NOT reommend!!!",0
I love you Professor Conta all I have to say. His compassionate in all that he does and goes out of his way to make sure every single student is able to succeed. Keep up the good work you have a nice surprise before you retire at the end of this semester.,1
"Very nice, willing to help as long as you do the work, just do the work and study and you will end up doing well. English isn't my first language and she was very understanding about that. Wish I could take her again! (:",1
"Easy.  But frustratingly, irritatingly, infuriatingly, mind-bogglingly inane classes.  If you seek to learn, do not look here.",0
"Do not take this professor. Exams are hard , he doesn't really teach. You don't have any support to study for the exams.A lot of students drop this course.",0
The class is extremely helpful it allowers dancers to learn the beginning steps/basic. Only negative is the classes are a little slow at times and the songs we listen/dance to arent really Latin songs they are mostly English old pop songs.,1
"I took A & P 2 with Dr. Montes this past summer. He is very kind and very helpfull. The class was very fast and demands a lot of hard work. If you are organized, you can get an A. He knows the material and he used to be a medical doctor. Very easy going guy and funny sometimes. I recommand him to students who want to put in the work.",1
"He's a very chill teacher, but his accent makes it hard to understand him at times. He teaches directly out of the book, could be repetitive at times, the homework does add up, so even it out. He's very laid back & doesn't mind if students are late. Gives weekly quizes & study guides only for the 2 mid-terms.",1
Boring class. Simnet test can be very difficult at beginning. Double check before submitting. Easy A if you study and complete all work.,0
"Heyborne is an amazing teacher! He cares about students and even remembers names. Tests are tough, he words things a bit tricky, but he schedules review sessions with his TA before every exam. You can always go to him for help. Exams are graded quickly, lectures are fun and he expects everyone to participate. You can see how much he loves science!",1
"His assignments are easy, but he will challenge you.  He is one of those professors who lays out arguments and presents counterarguments while very infrequently telling his own opinions.  Make sure you participate frequently and well, because I got a nice bump on my final grade and he takes attendance.  He is helpful and seems like a cool guy.",1
"SF STATE, had him for Stats. It was his first time teaching the subject so he was just getting the hang of things which is completely understandable. Very chill guy. Exams based on lecture and/or homework questions. Can be a bit difficult to understand him as he confuses himself at times, but is willing to answer questions for clarification!",1
Professor Vair has been one of my favorite professors while at STU. Unfortunately this is her last year of teaching and therefore this review doesn't even matter because none of you reading this will get to have her as a prof. So this is just an FYI that you missed out on one of STU's best profs! We'll miss you greatly professor!,1
"Kai Du is very hard to understand, and his teaching style is ridiculous. During class he'll write a few short-hand notes on the chalk board (even though there are 6 sliding dry erase boards available) and proceed to try to explain the information, which you probably wont understand, and so you MUST read and study the text book every night. GoodLuck",0
"Dr. Feige has a passion for teaching and works very hard to explain things to help us understand, not just memorize. He uses lots of pictures. This course is hard! You have to work for your grade. He even posted video presentations explaining challenging topics.",1
i loveddd cogan i had him for my freshman learning community so im not really sure how he teaches but he seems like an extremely easy grader and hes halrious ! take himmm !,1
The course itself is a very hard class to take. However Rafferty made the class interesting and not so painful. She made herself available for her office hours and was always there for assistance. I would take another class with her if I had to. Highly recommend her. You get what you put out while taking this class.,1
"Prof. Robertson had a huge workload, so much that I felt my other classes started to suffer because I was constantly worried about her work, even with my good time management skills. 4 group projects in 1 semester and some overlapped which was annoying. Gives no feedback and is extremely annoying. Save yourself the trouble.",0
"She is the best teacher in the world! She has her doctrine, SUPER SMART IN ALL SCIENCES. She will do anything to help you understand the material, very patient, and funny. She loves her subject! And I love her.",1
Do not take if you're not great in Math,0
"I enjoyed the feedback & resources Marco offered. My complaints were mostly in the content of films he chose to continuously show in class. There was little to NO inspiration and motivation in students and the art work suffered b/c of that. Marco was funny, but his humor is swallowed by a select few. I'm an older student and enjoyed him very much.",1
Dr. Strauch is great. Scary smart and super interesting. She taught the class from a Native American and African American perspective as well. She made great connections to larger social and political issues. Easy grader. Make sure you keep up with reading and participate in class- -that's really all she expects. 10/10 would recommend.,1
Literally the worse teacher I have taken within my two years of being at NCC.,0
"Andrew Nedd is an engaging and kind professor. The workload is great, every other week is an online quiz or a very short essay, which are both manageable and helpful in understanding the material. He leaves good feedback on essays and is very open to hearing what students have to say, all questions and comments are welcome with him.",1
"Span. 101 5 wk course in the summer. The professor seems like a nice person where she will answer emails, but I would advise NOT to take her (or maybe any other..) language class during the summer semester, its intense and her workload is insane. Remember, you have to memorize a language in a matter of 5 weeks. Do not recommend.",0
"She is the best chemistry professor. She replaces your lowest exam scores with your final. Her lectures are really good. She gives you lots of opportunity for practice. Take her, and do some practice problems you can pass her class with 100%",1
"So when I had him I thought he was a good guy, but whenever i asked serious questions, he would come back with really smart ass answers that were unnecessary. He is a fair grader but he likes to keep people between A- and B+... participation he rarely gives over a 90% and rarely over an 18/20... just to warn you, its not hard, but not so fun either",0
"She is probably one of the top 5 best professor at Westfield State. Not only is she super ultra helpful and gives reasonable but helpful assignments, but she does not favor students and does not say or do anything that will irritate or rub the student the wrong way. ATTENTION ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS MAJORS! Take her, take her, take her!!",1
Ms. Dillon is very helpfully and she never thing any quesstion is stupied and she really cares about the student as a person too. She Great.,1
"pat mckee=GREAT TEACHER for class strings. your grade is UP TO YOU. the entire class is practicing for the little tests. he has a list of things you will need to play, and when you do, he marks it off and to get an A, you do all of them. at the end of the term, all checked=A, missing a couple=B, missing a lot=C, missing most=D, didn't try=F easy.",1
"I took Dr. Bazil in the Philosophy of Race in person, and he was amazing. He was great at allowing the students to direct the flow of the conversation without getting so far off topic the discussion would become pointless. He really challenges you in a way that feels empowering and is not dedicated to one line of thought. Excellent professor!",1
Monica is an average prof. She makes good notes but doesn't post her slides online so class is a must. Her tests are pretty straightforward and I did enjoy going to class. She made it interesting. My only complaint is that she takes a long time to grade things so don't expect to get marks back very quick,1
One of the best teachers at Emmanuel. I went out of my way to take more classes with him. His classes are not very hard. As long as you are trying your best he notices. I highly recommend taking a class with him.,1
"Would not take a class from him again. ECON201 should be simple, as it is still core principles being taught, but he made it extremely confusing. Exam material is not covered thoroughly in class, as he only touches on simple topics in lectures. Do yourself a favor and avoid",0
"If you take her online, all she does is link you to Pearson's my math lab. I find it astonishing that she is getting paid to just have a link in blackboard without even making her own slides. If you can teach yourself statistics, its an easy A. I would recommend Doctor Kasha instead -- he is one of the best!",0
He thinks of himself as the go to source for work advice when in reality he has no work experience or knowledge. He brings politics into class. He also takes off points when grading papers with no explanations.,0
Dr. Field is the BEST professor at UNL. Tom is a very unique guy who really cares for the students in his courses. He really wants to cultivate a great future for everyone. His classes are very fun and exciting to attend. All information is very practical and relatable for the REAL world. Take as many classes with him as possible. Hes a GREAT guy!,1
"Parkhurst was pretty chill and rude at the same time. I thought I was a decent writer until I took his class. He grades your papers extremely hard. The topics you write about are pretty flexible, but I feel like if you dont write it how he views the topic; youll suffer. His class is extremely stressful! Please, save yourself.",0
"Very nice, father figure professor. Get's very excited for class/ anything about technology. How class works: Read online text book, 15 Cornell notes on book due for class, group quiz in class, online quiz, Microsoft video project first week, 4 projects the next week, Capstone (final for unit) last week, repeats for all units. All due Friday @ 5pm.",1
She can never be satisfied.,1
"Wisla was a hard teacher. I worked my butt off on every assignment and felt the grading was random. His tests give random terms from the book that are never mentioned in class. He will call you out, so make sure you read. He gives pop quizzes. Avoid if possible. He has too much knowledge for his own good and expects you to know everything PR.",0
"yvette was so great!  definitely a favorite professor, and she was so good in lecture.  the paper assignments were really easy, and her TA for our class (javier) was very helpful with grading.  he was good looking, as well!  i would definitely take another class with her.",1
"very hard exam! took little bits of info from the text that you thought you'd never have to study. did bad on his exam, but amazing on prof southams. make sure you study stupid trivia.",1
"I took this teacher for Statistics at De Anza and it was a rollercoaster to begin with. Constant shouting of ""Stop Talking, You have a question?"" and other little distractions that would get her off topic. Her lectures move at a slow pace and staying focused is hard due to her thick accent. Overall would not take again, nor recommend to anyone.",0
"Story and Structure. I didn't like her much for this class. I felt like I didn't really learn anything. She was very unhelpful when I was having issues with a paper and told me it wasn't going to matter much, but then I got a D on the paper and it really brought down my grade.",0
"Like most art history profs, she shows slides of the artworks and then talks about them. The course content is interesting, but sometimes the lectures feel long. You don't need to do the readings regularly, but they are useful for the essays if you scan through them. This is an easy course and it's good to attend for content on your essays.",1
Prof. Shine is really a sweetheart! He really cares about his students and how they are doing rather than just pushing work on you. His work expectations were clear and grading is fair. The only downside of his class was that his voice is so soothing it is easy to doze off while he is reading.,1
"Dr. Viriasova is extremely passionate about what she teaches, and it shows in her lectures. She is a tough marker but makes it very clear what she expects. Easily one of my favourite profs.",1
OK teacher I don't think he's truly a bad person but may not realize the condesending attitude he gives students when he picks on them or they don't know an answer or ask a question. Find it ridiculous at this level 2 take attendence & that actually effects your mark. We're paying his salary so if we dont want 2 show up it's our problem if we fail,0
Super dry and boring lectures. Must go to lectures however because she does not post slides and will test the specifics from lecture and the readings. Know all of the definitions. Tons of reading.,0
"Sam is a great guy who really knows what he's talking about. If you have questions, he will definitely answer them. He really seems to understand students. His lectures are interesting, but my only complaint is that they lack structure and are quite repetitive. Overall, if you come to lecture and take decent notes, you will probably get an A.",1
"You have three books and lectures to read each week, averaging at about 140 pages per. Then you have a 30 question quiz, often with paragraph long questions. Then you have pages long ""discussion"" board topics to write weekly and bi-weekly journals. All the while you need be working on your 40-50 pages term paper. This class is busy work.",0
Will is a captivating prof. He is very knowledgeable and wants you to ask questions. He took a few weeks to get back to me on an email. And LFS 250 will have unequally distributed grading because some TAs mark differently. Your writing will improve over the course of the year.,1
His Intro Biology class is very hard. He told class that if you need help study he would help. when I was failing the class I went to his office a few times. He just went over the tests it didn't really help me. Hard for him to explain things. Most of the time in class we just take notes which aren't very helpful for the test. Withdrawal the class.,0
While the class is not difficult Professor Zaech is unclear in her expectations. The discussion board work is usually vague and unrelated to the textbook. The textbook was hardly used for the class as the discussions usually did not relate to the chapter that was assigned that week. When you email her for clarification she does not provide it.,0
"Great professor. My favorite course at Walsh. The books are enjoyable to read and they make the class interesting & easy to engage in discussion with your classmates. Dr. McHann is very passionate and truly cares about the student. If you read and pay attention, you will do great. Do the extra credit.",1
Great professor. I would definitely recommend her to other students. The tests are pretty tough and so are the assignments. But there is no excuse for failing any of the assignments. They are tedious but her directions and tutorial videos (for the online students) are very helpful and she is there to answer any questions about the assignment. ,1
alot of reading early on but using summary's will get you thorough discussions. Come to class and you will pass the class,1
"Sooo hard. she clearly doesnt know how to teach, students corrected her all the time, and her tests were very hard. I even had tutoring and still failed. and she had assigned seating and in alphabetical order, what is this gradeschool? DO NOT TAKE HER, i took math 125 the next semester and got an A.",0
"Mrs. Moss knows her material, and can answer your questions to the best of her ability, but be careful if you ask a question on something she doesn't agree with. Dissections you basically have to do on your own and hope you do it right. We were given a crayfish, a knife and ZERO instruction. Interesting material, but poorly designed tests. Hard B. ",0
"He loves to talk about american politics, how great Trump is, and american involvement in other regions rather than the actual curriculum. He also loves to talk about the booming oil industry(its not, its actually beginning to decline)... he isnt very clear about whats on tests and quizzes but hands out a quiz ever class period.",0
Will is a great professor. He made programming really easy to understand and is lightyears better than most of the other IT professors. Definitely recommend his classes.,1
"The worst class I have taken in my entire life, it's literally the middle of the semester but I can't stand this class. For heaven's sake DO NOT take this class, Spare yourself from stress.",0
"She gives good and thorough feedback but if your goal in life isn't to be the best writer in the world I wouldn't recommend her, she might just bring your GPA down. She is a tough grader but it does eventually lead you to improve your writing. This class will require lots of effort so don't take if you're lazy.",1
"Exams were taken in Pollock, lots of math, with no partial credit given, so if you mistype the interest rate in your calculator for one year in one problem, you can kiss 10% of that exam grade goodbye. The practice problems he gives require excel, which you can't use in the exam, and he rarely answers messages. The class isn't a priority to him.",0
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,0

"Professor Campbell was amazing in his lectures because he shares his personal experience a lot, and teaches the material well, using case discussion (light) and getting people to participate. He kept classes short (online) but perfectly covered everything we needed. His notes and online book was good material for all projects/exam. Would take again",1
I took her class twice and found out there was other people in the same class that took her class twice. I notice people dropping her class with complaints I truly thought I was doing great in her class to find out I got a D at the end of the semester now I have to retake the class before I can take any other my classes ,0
Dedicated prof.  Knows his stuff.  My favorite prof in the J-school so far. ,1
Great professor. You should come to classes because all the material is covered in class.,1
"Gives you outdated power points,  doesn't allow pics of current ones, Goes through them fast & hard to catch up. She puts things on test that she doesn't go over/ makes them difficult on purpose,Makes you do pointless labs that are confusing & unhelpful to the subject. Miss one test & it is literally impossible to catch up again. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
"The way she speaks in her lectures is really really monotone and boring which makes you (at least me) really disinterested in what she has to say. There are 5 quizzes, lowest 1 is dropped and the final is made up of all questions on the 5 quizzes. There is a lab due every week, a little time consuming but not hard. Attendance mandatory on lab days",1
"One of the worst professors/teachers I've ever had. Sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Tough grader but also takes a long time to post grades so it's hard to know how well you're doing. Do not take her class unless you have to.",0
She is a hard grader compare to other HDFS professors.,0
Had Dr. Jennings for several graduate courses. His wealth of knowledge is unbelievable.I learned more from him than any other professor I've had for over 240 credits of college course work.,1
This is hands down the best and easiest online course you can take. Rebecca makes it simple and easy understand the material by providing the book online and making a powerpoint. No textbook needed. There are only two extremely easy lecture exams and one weekly assignment each week. Highly recommend!!,1
Took this class and learned so much! We were placed in a group where we worked on marketing a new company. It was such a great learning experience! There is a quiz on most class days. They are short and easy as long as you look over the powerpoint. This has been one of my favorite classes!,1
"Professor Faux was super chill and I really wish I was able to take this class with him in person because it wouldve been even better than it already was. Exams are open note, so if you pay attention and take notes its an easy A.",1
READ the textbook before each lecture. You'll get like 2hrs of online hw a week but they are great grade boosters and get you ready for the exams. The midterm and final are multiple choice and are much harder than her other two written tests. Overall she really knows her stuff and how to teach it. Go to class and build a relationship with her.,1
Hes overall a very good professor hes a little hard but he will work with you and do your homework and you will succeed in his class. Hes a hilarious person and makes the class very entertaining.,1
"Very smart man, but his teaching style wasn't for me. Very strict and assigns a lot of work. You can't miss more than 3 classes or you fail. He is very passionate about Spanish and will help you, but I did feel like he could be rude to some of the students in our class. I probably won't take him again if I can.",0
"she takes off points for no reason and doesn't teach her class, she makes her students do it",0
Very helpful Professor always available responded to my emails in 24 hrs or faster and to help with my questions he skyped to resolve issue. Gives good feedback and he is accessible outside class. Class seems intimidating with many exams but once you get started the trainings are very helpful to pass the exams. I highly recommend this class.,1
"Dr. Bost is rather scattered. If you take any class from her, make sure you track your points very carefully as math does not appear to be her strong point.  Asking questions and getting an answer was often not possible. She talks very fast and goes the the material rapidly-Good notes are key! Overall I was not impressed with her at all",0
"Great professor! She provides you with all the help needed but don't expect to get an easy A. You have to study for exams and show up to class for attendance. There's one group project, fairly easy. She provides extra credit opportunities so you should def be fine!",1
"Overall he is an okay teacher. He is somewhat unwilling to provide help to students, and he talks down to students. However, if you miss class everything is online. Personally, I have not enjoyed him as a professor.",0
"Very hard to understand, and very fast paced talker. Hard to follow what she is saying and I cant stand this teacher. I took her on accident and I hated her class. Regret doing it . Do not take her class.",0
"I do not recommend taking this course. He is very bias in what he teaches and the content he uses. Because no sociology book or criminology book was good enough to teach his bias opinion, he used articles as old as the 1910's and as recent as the 1980's in his boundaries book so he could teach his bias opinion about government and crime. ",0
Hes so hot its a pleasure being in his class for that only. Butt;) he is also the only teacher in the HRM course. The other are a waste of time and a shame to the profession. This guy is a true teacher. Thanks!!!,1
a calamity,0
"She's incredibly anal about grammar when grading your papers. None of my french teachers have been this picky and petty about sentence structure, yet she's an art prof. She cares more about how a paper is written rather than the content. I recommend submitting your papers in English for this class if your French isn't 100% perfect.",0
"He's a cool guy but the class is basically power points. There are only 3 tests, random days he decides to take attendance, and a final exam, so you have to get a good grade on all of these. he will drop your lowest test score though. he gets mad about people being on their laptops and phones.",0
"Great professor! Clear and straightforward with assignments. Actually has thought-provoking, in-depth discussion questions compared to many other online family studies classes. I'd definitely recommend taking a course from her!",1
His resources for success are not helpful and are outdated. Way too many things to navigate throughout the website. Feedback from work arent helpful. Prof responds emails in a long time. The online meetings have nothing to do with what were learning. The criteria and rubrics he left for us to work on for assignments are not resourceful or helpful,0
"He only gives 30 minutes to do assignments in class, and he grades them harshly. Do not take this professor unless you're auditing his class.",0
Absolutely no direction from her. Assignments are convoluted and not well explained. First bad professor I've had. Truly disappointed.,0
"I did awful in his class. He doesn't believe in extra credit and expects ppl to know everything he's talking about. He FREAKS if you're 30 seconds late for class. He literally turns into the Incredible ""RED"" Hulk......If you're gonna take him, you better leave the house early.",0
I would highly advise you NOT to take this class if you are doing online right now. This class is incredibly discouraging and took a lot of the enjoyment I usually have for writing out of me. It was exhausting how much work I would put into it just to get told it wasnt good enough.,0
"This class was and is an great option for anyone who needs a history credit. The readings and videos are informative and easy to keep up with unlike many boring options we could read and watched. The quizzes were very easy for you read the material, I would just make sure you read every question carefully as the wording can be easy to mix up.",1
"His notes are lack of examples, even some of them are not completed. Most of the content are definition and hard to understand. the assignments are so tough without a clear definition list or a lot of examples. he is not a good choice for math classes.",0
"Her work is beautiful, but her work is clearly her focus.",0
"Professor McCarthy was one of my favorite teachers this semester, she made the class fun and genuinely cares about her students. She leans on the tougher side of grading, but she gives out clear rubrics and good feedback. There's a lot of readings and short homework (like reviews) in this class but if you do them you'll have no problems at all.",1
"Wonderful instructor. Very friendly, and her assignments are simple (they require that you think, of course, but they are in no way difficult) and direct. Her lecture style (which we have only a little of being that this is largely a discussion class) is clear and well articulated. My favourite LSU instructor so far.",1
"Amazing professor!  Grade was made up of midterm, final and one, giant paper.  If your undergrad is in Psychology be ready for an in-depth review!",1
If he was cutting it short on time in class due to the amount of material needed he would make mistakes but they would be him forgetting a negative sign or something small like that would cause an issue but not have an issue in the formula used.,1
"Taken over the summer. I'm not gonna lie - this class was tough. She makes you write a lot, but it IS a communications course so that is too be expected. She gives GREAT feedback on writing. She's not one of those profs that just write ""fix this"" and underline text. She takes the time to write long comments and encourages you to ask for help!",1
Gartland is horribly unorganized and unprofessional. She goes on and on about her personal life. I'm not paying tuition to listen to her actively try to avoid teaching us the material. A number of us are considering complaining to the department chair.,0
"He spends a lot of class time begging his students to talk and doesn't teach. On the papers, he wants you to write his opinion, but we don't ever get to hear him explain anything. If you ask him a question about your paper, he gets really defensive and think you're trying to ask for a grade change. He doesn't try to understand what you are asking.",0
Not bad. Very enthusiastic about her work. Does not take criticism well. Tests are not hard. Takes marks off of assignments for no particular reason. A new lecturer that still has room for improvement.,1
"If you want an easy English class, take her! There were a few essays and a final group project at the end. She gives short readings for homework and has quizzes on them but if you do the reading they should be easy. If you turn in your essays and do well on the quizzes you should be able to pass the class with an A.",1
I took her for Calculus II.  She is a very nice person.  She is also patient.,1
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Do not make the same mistake I did. The book is awful, power points are pretty much the same thing as what's in the textbook. If you have trouble with math, even a little, wait to take this course with a different professor.",0
"Respectively, I don't understand what's up with all these negative review ratings although you're expected to show up at mandatory online orientation meeting throughout first week signing off important e-signatures of coursework documents and then briefly introduce yourself on discussion panel list while getting started on your homework assignment.",1
"She's pretty good doing lectures. She makes them interesting and entertaining. However there is a TON of iclicker points every week so make sure you go to lecture. Also, there is a lot of homework online. But overall, the course was very easy to manage.",1
"Good, nice professor but there is a lot of work for this class, especially group projects (get ready to present more than a few times)",1
nice guy but not a good teacher. His lectures are boring and very confusing. Does more explaining theories and ideas rather than doing example problems. Tests were very difficult with the average between a 40 and 50%. I do not recommend this professor.,0
"-This teacher has hearing aids so speak loud and clear, if not he will NOT answer your questions nor look in your direction -If you know Spanish this class will be easy but if you do not know Spanish it maybe a struggle, I say team up with others in class and do all ONLINE work -Professor does not give any reviews for test-study book/online assign.",0
"A great professor. When he gives you the study guide, do every question. The test is word for word from it. Just a very nice, polite, and funny guy. I had no interest in philosophy, I just needed the credit, but I genuinely learned a lot from this class. He also has the cutest dog and I've seen him walking her around campus. Also he's hot.",1
Great teacher! Gives lots of extra credit!,1
"Great guy,  very helpful with writing skills. Attendance is mandatory but I love going to his class.",1
"Ryburn is a sweet sweet teacher. Finite is a weeder class, but honestly I wish it were easier with being online. It is very hard to get a good grade in this place",1
Do not take this prof. She seems all nice and sweet while she is talking but as soon as you go to approach her she treats you as if you are a child and dumb. save yourself,0
"Kim is a good lecturer, although things can get boring sometimes. He is very open-minded and kind. After taking this course, I plan to take more ASA courses.",1
"He helped me  love the material and his research is super inspiring. He is very organized, helpful, and very funny. This was a 3 hour long class but he is very knowledgable about all of the material so it is rarely boring. He truly cares about his students. As long as you listen, do your work and study, you'll pass!!",1
This class is extremely difficult so if you want to do well you have to put in the time and effort. I would highly recommend going to the tutors if you are struggling. And try not the leave the homework to the last minute because it can take awhile.,0
"Very good online lectures and interesting projects. He takes forever to grade assignments, though, so you never really know where you stand in the class and his grading requirements are unclear. Overall good professor and I feel I learned a lot about C++ programming.",1
Pfttttt....,1
She is a helpful teacher who knows her material.Discussions have a gender/class/race analysis.This is important in life. People who complain about that need to check themselves on  their personal discrimination and behavior.,1
Monica is the worst professor you will find. When you go to class her slides do not make any sense and she is terrible at explaining the simplest things. She also doesnt post notes. She does not show up ever and is awful at marking/responding to emails. She is the most unprofessional professor.,0
"Professors dont matter that much with organic chem II. Good or bad the class is still gonna be one of the hardest youve ever taken. Accept that. But MS is one of the best professors if not. Always has a hilarious story, makes lecture fun. Material is hard, exams are fair and professor is amazing. Take MS above all other orgo professors.",1
"um ummmm ummm um um um.... this is all I would hear in lectures. He can sound intelligent but at the same time also sounds like he is just reading the pp. again he says um so much the class started to keep count, up into the 700s....",0
G.O.A.T. Best ever.,1
"Dr. Jay Ou... he's okay. Thats it. - Doesn't teach - Doesn't give detailed information about the assignments. It's kind of like ""okay, here's the assignment... do it"" - Your grade is based off 5 quizzes and 2 assignments, so if you miss an assignment or do bad on a quiz... your grade is down the toilet Like I said he's okay...",0
"Often misunderstood: In class, she is not only teaching the subject but also a very singular conception of ""the professor"" and of the philosophy of teaching, through a self-conceived postmodern performatic method, that makes use of facial gesture, body language, and vocal expression, plus sartorial and make-up props: A truly revolutionary method.",1
"If you want to learn history this is not the guy for you. If you want to learn how to read a ton of pages, write several papers, and take exams which are only free response and essays then Turkovic is your guy. Not my cup of team but maybe he is yours.",0
I don't know what people are complaining about. The material was pretty straight forward and the final was nothing special; you just had to understand the equation instead of only memorizing it.,1
"She will break you. Side note, her wardrobe: pristine. Paulet is fond of calling her 210 History major's boot camp and it really is a break down, build you up sort of class. Can smell fear.",1
She is very boring. The first 3 classes have been about GALILEO and research. She seems to mean well but her teaching style is so bad. She tells long unimportant stories that arent relevant to the course. Best part is the open text/ open google tests. Shes really liberal about device usage. Dont ask questions cause shell go off on a tangent.,0
"Honest intrest in students, knowledgable, always willing to stay after studio and help you out! great stories, fun, knowlegable",1
"Matt is tough, but a great professor. You will learn a lot in his classes. He really knows his stuff, and is very helpful outside of class.",1
"You can tell Dr. Boyes is a prof because he loves both the research AND teaching aspect of the job which makes him caring and motivational. He's a humble guy who wants his course to be fair (ex. he reconsiders questions where students perform poorly). Lectures do not cover all you need to know for the exam, so reading the textbook is mandatory.",1
"If you have him for microelectronics, do not expect to learn anything from him. My advice is to find a better textbook, and follow an online class so you can learn the the material. When midterm comes, copy every useless and very confusing assignment questions that don't teach you anything on your cheat sheet.",0
"Could never understand what he was saying with his accent. Even if I could the lectures were boring and couldn't pay attention. I studied the material myself outside of class. Pop quizzes but he drops 3- although he ended up dropping 4 and an exam because so many people were struggling. Bought the book but never used, all powerpoints are online.",0
I know journalism writing is different from the usual essay writing I was use to.  I expected in a journ. 1 class to learn the basic mechanics and techniques to newspaper writing but she failed to do that.  She started the class off as if everyone already had experience in the field!  I ended up dropping it.,0
"His classes are very informative and interactive. Unless you have the time to really stick to the text book and lectures, you'll have a really hard time in his class. He is a really hard marker and has very specific expectations for his assignments. Be prepared to receive lower marks than you expected. I would not take a class with him again.",0
Professor Pearl is a good guy. If you pay attention to his lectures in class and do the homework you will get a good understanding of the various Microsoft programs. He uses iClicker (attendance) and another homework program that require students to pay a fee. Get on his good side and take an interest and you'll be fine.,1
"His class is incredibly challenging,but his classes are incredibly interesting. He's a tough grader.",1
This teacher is one word. RUDE. she is passive aggressive and kind of a bully. She asks these long winded confusing unclear questions and when no one answers them she lashes out. god bless the poor souls that try to answer the questions. Oh but don't ask her to repeat herself because she'll just tell you she doesn't remember what she just said. ,0
"Extremely poor professor, not because he doesn't know the information, but because he's a very poor communicator. His handouts are all over the place, when you ask questions he writes out things in handwriting only he can understand. The class is difficult, but moreso because hes a hard grader and a poor teacher which makes for a bad combination.",0
"its hard to find anything nice to say. she is an awful professor. can't use moodle or collaborate. wastes an extreme amount of time in class, teaching nothing herself. very outdated ideas. very unclear, poorly worded instructions. is very rude if you have any criticism of the way she poorly runs her class.",0
If you invest a lot of time outside of class for this class you will be fine. She expects you to practice around 10-20 hours outside of class for accounting. I don't recommend because it's hard to catch up once you don't understand something. She goes through lecture slides very fast.,0
"She is a teacher who firmly believes on 1 hour of class equals 2 hours of homework and in a 5 hour course, that's a lot of homework! She would say that life happens but when it did she questioned our want to be a speech language pathologist. But for a positive side, I hear she's more understanding now. :)",1
"He needs to work on his people skills. However, if you have to take a religion class, take with another teacher please.",0
I loved Professor Reynolds. He made Sociology 101 super fascinating and his lectures were always enjoyable and funny. He is a great professor and I would recommend him to anyone!,1
"This class was a bit difficult, but I got so much out of it! Prof. Mangone was amazing!! He was always available for you to talk with and really wanted students to understand the material. This class was one of the best I have ever take, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about RNA or research :)",1
Prof Mirbod is awesome. Her lectures informative and well structured. She can get side track some. Do the Homework follow the book. To do well on the exam follow the detailed study guide. I would take her again if i could. She make accounting come to life. Made the class enjoyable. She is super nice and grades easy. She is fair. questions are fair,1
"Literally the most I have ever learned in a class. It is a lot of work, lots of readings and quizzes every week, but it pays off. He made me such an effective writer and he just makes you really diligent in your coursework. If you put in the work, you will be able to succeed!",1
This professor gives a lot of homework and is not easy on grading. If you have a holiday trip planned with the family and ask the teacher to let you do something early or later theres a zero percent chance she will accept. Make sure you practice homework questions and study hard. Does provide a lot of learning materials.,0
"Take this professor if you wan't to become any form of a writer or poet. If that is not you, avoid this guy's class. He does not care for any reason or excuse you may have for missing a class or doing something in a way he doesn't want done. I was one of 3 kids who passed with a C or better out of a class that began w 30-40 students. Good luck",0
Anne is an amazing professor and truly goes above and beyond for her students. She does assign a lot of homework and readings but they all come together to help you become a better student and a better historian. She does not get the credit she deserves in the history department and is very easy to approach outside of class.,1
"I don't understand how she is better at Anatomy than Physio. She talks too fast while going over detailed slides and diagrams. It was just overwhelming. She's pretty picky on the short answers on her exams. She doesn't let you know what DIAGRAMS will actually be on the exam. To be on the safe side, you need to study everything on her study guide.",0
"He is a genius. Hi class can be boring for some because, his strategy and counter strategy is based on numbers and is a mix of economics and finance. The best prof I had so far in MBA!! hands down !!",1
"I've never written a review before but for him I needed to warn others. I won't lie if you're really good at programming then his class shouldn't be that difficult. Regardless, he grades late, and is very disorganized. Has labs for homework and gives 3-4 tests that don't always relate to the material. Also he's culturally ignorant and picks on kids",0
"Easy if youve seen basic physics before, but beware this is a modelling class, so lots of drawings, and the class is very slow",1
"Not a hard class if you stay caught up.  if you fall behind it may prove to be more difficult than I experienced.  Helped considerably with my writing as I learned to edit, and edit, and edit.  Definitely worth taking.",1
"Dr. Neupane was absolutely amazing! I took him for a five week physics course. It was extremely challenging; however, he was always available before and after class for additional help. In addition, he was very fair with grading, and he truly wanted his students to do well in the course! I would take him over and over again!",1
This was the most interesting class I have had so far! He is a great prof. and is funny!,1
"Shes knowledgeable about PR but as a teacher, she is very condescending. Barely answers questions and when she does, shes usually snotty. She never admits when shes made an error, instead makes you feel dumb for her mistake when it wasnt your fault at all. 2/3 of assignments took over a month to grade and made excuses about it. Hard quizzes!",0
"Professor Leonard is one of the best Biology  teachers at Clovis Community College. You must be a serious student  in order to succeed in his class, if not plan to fail this class.",1
"I loved Adriano! He honestly really wants to see his students succeed and is really engaging and entertaining in class. He does require a lot of reading and expects people to participate, but he is funny and quirky and very lively.",1
He does not teach well,0
Ryan was a chill professor to have for 3001. He genuinely wanted his students to pass and was obviously interested in the material. I really enjoyed his class and would definitely recommend him!,1
"Extremely easy, learn nothing. Easiest A I've ever gotten.",0
Takes her class way too seriously. Better teachers for this class. Nice person but way too strict. Give NO leniency at all. Isnt the type of person to let you make up things. Give no leniency towards attendance either,0
"She's a great teacher! She will go over something and ""iron it out"" until you get it. She encourages questions so shy people speak up because she can move fast and you will get left behind. Homework is easy and you get several chances to get it right so there's no reason not to get a 100. She's try's to use examples that will make it easier for us.",1
By far the worst professor I have ever had. I always enjoyed math until I took his class. The average on the first exam was a 64 and the median a 67. The average on the second exam was a 44.5 and the median was a 46. He just puts the book on a projector and reads it to himself then jumps into the example problems without explaining anything.,0
"Took Prof. Osoba two semesters back-to-back and not only did he remember past students, but he would also genuinely take the time to ask how you've been, what you've been up to, and will reference past class information. He's quite old-fashioned and is a very paper and pencil type of guy, but he's a fair grader, and the syllabus is easy to follow.",1
"Humber is one of the nicest profs I've met, but I hated taking MATH 213 with him. He wasn't prepared to teach for two hours straight. I found his lectures very difficult to engage with, which was unfortunate because the textbook was not helpful either. His homework was really difficult, but tests and quizzes were easy.",0
"Very good philosophy professor. Attention to the class is a must, as he teaches rather fast (and sometimes the topics can be very confusing). This is not an ""Easy A"" class, but it is very rewarding.",1
His quizzes and exams are based from his powerpoints. Because of COVID-19 we didn't need to do the volunteer hours for the research studies however they are easily done online by filling out surveys. The final paper is fairly easy as long as you follow the essay structure he provides.,1
"Had her for Personal Fitness Rude, disrespectful. Mocks you when you work out if not up to her standards. It's a 1 credit class and she treats it like three credits. One of the worst teachers I've taken at this college. Think very hard if you're going to have her.",0
"Bio 2 class had 3 exams, 1 final, and 1 presentation. Exams are a big part of your grade, as there is no homework or quizzes, but the labs do help out. Attendance is mandatory for the lectures and Dr. Sunny knows biology like the back of her hand! She wants you to participate and invites questions. Study hard and review the slides if you want an A.",1
"Took Legal Negotiations with this professor. This is a good class. Material is not as cut and dry as some other graduate law courses. However, professor does a really good job explaining the material/concepts clearly. Learned a lot/practical material.",1
"Dr. Love is an excellent professor. He explains things well, is approachable outside class, and truly cares about his students. I had no idea what to expect from this course but I found it very interesting and fun! Dr. Love is very enthusiastic about his work and loves when students ask questions.",1
"Okay, she is extremely vague in what she wants, yet she is such a hard grader when it comes to essays. Like i have professors in the 200 and 300 english classes giving me A's and A- on my essays, yet she gives me a C?!!! And i still dont understand what she wants from your writing. Class was very stupid.",0
Mr. Rodriguez is a great professor. I had small knowledge of the spanish language going into his class but he made it really easy to keep up. I understood what was being said but I could never form a reply. He will constantly ask if there is something you don't understand and that is your chance to ask. He will re-explain to get the idea across.,1
I was one of the people that didnt drop her class even after reading these reviews and it cost me. AVOID this evil lady at all costs!! She did not let me make up 1 lab of 1 week before in order for me to qualify for the NC grade. I attended all her classes and that was the first lab I missed. I have never come across someone so evil in my life,0
"Easy class but she pushed off big assignments for ones she made up that and only went toward participation. Terrible at making tests, ended up getting around +12 on each exam bc she made them up so wrong, and claimed we were being disrespectful if we debated one of the questions. Semester is over and she hasn't graded half the assignments yet.",0
"babbles to himself, lectures worse than useless",0
"To help everyone out DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! I went into Farmingdale to get amazing grades and he made my GPA so much lower. He talks very low , when sitting in the back you can barely hear him. The Exams are VERY heavy so if you want to do good make sure you read everything he posts on blackboard. Like I said DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
"Her grading system will not always make sense. I took her her class online and got a zero on one of the Essay. Had the Essay checked by online classmates and they were mostly positive about my Essay and I met most rubric requirements. Unfortunately, her way of accepting ""credits"" is from a different perspective.",0
"She definitely knows her stuff, as she has been a teacher, principal, etc for many years. The only problem is is that she assigns WAY too much reading . I know her goal is to teach us to be the best teachers, but its a bit too much. She has been really understanding about my situation though and is extremely nice & has helped me a lot this year.",1
"Lisa is one of the worst professors I have ever had, hands down. I have had for a few classes now and she is a good teacher when in the classroom but her online classes are some of the worst experiences I have had at school. She is the least helpful teacher I have ever had both in and out of the classroom.",0
I heard so many great reviews about this professor so i decided to take her class. She is extremely sweet and means well- she really cares for her students. BUT she does not teach material efficiently. She goes over content and assumes you already know it. Her accent is a little tough to understand. And occasionally she is very unorganized!,0
"Sobie basically just takes the entire book, writes every word onto a powerpoint and says good luck. His powerpoints cover way too much unnecessary material so theyre useless, exam reviews are 200 qs, but the exams are only 85. The exams are all too close to eachother to learn that much!! He also grades vaguely!! Do not reccommend!",0
"This is my first review on this site. The professor was THAT awful. Take my word for it and DO NOT take this professor. If you are thinking of dropping his class DO IT NOW, I regret not doing it. He's awful at teaching to be frank. He does not explain the topics well. He will write out answers without showing steps or explaining the foundation.",0
"She was very clear on assignments, the few times I didn't understand the assignment she was very fast to email back and help to solve the problem. Was easy for me to take, only because she was very descriptive and easy to understand. I defiantly took the skills she left me with and use them in life today!",1
"Neset Hikmet cares about work more than anything else. He has an extremely strong work ethic and expects the same of his students. His grading style is MORE than fair. As long as you aren't too far out in left field, and he sees that you put in a significant amount of effort, you WILL get an 'A'. He is also a brilliant and entertaining lecturer.",1
LOVED HIM!! Best class i ever had!!!,1
"Rachel is a great teacher. The only reason I didn't get an A was because of personal struggles, but all I did was tell her about it, and she was more than happy to accommodate me. I know she's not available nearly enough, but she's only part time, and has a young child, and is working on her PhD. Give her some slack. Would highly recommend.",1
"I was confident in his class because he gave his students the confidence to do well. He is a very intelligent caring,organized and fair professor. I loved his class and I am sure that you will too.",1
Very good teacher. Had C's through high school and she made me an A student. Absolutely love her!,1
Because of sue i lost 10lbs. got a 1.5 on the beep test ended with an 85% somehow. keep up!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"The class was pretty difficult, but he is willing to help outside the classroom in a lot of ways.  He tries to make the class interesting, and I believe that he won teacher of the year for 2007-2008.",1
"An absolute delight; poised, extremely knowledgeable, and has a good sense of 'intellectual' humor. Brilliant while remaining down to earth; took massive amount of information and made it digestable and incredibly fascinating. Grades fairly while motivating us to do our best. Inviting and interesting in office hours. Will return to Berk Fall 12. A.",1
Amazing! I learned a lot from his lectures. He provided all the materials needed to be successful in the class as well as giving input to keep everyone on the right track.,1
"He is just a great guy... sometimes can be goofy, but he really is awesome. If you need help he will help you. He is a great teacher, and knows his stuff. He is just an overall caring and great professor. Highly recommended",1
"I found this class so interesting. It's definitely not for everybody, but the information discussed was stuff I had never even thought about, before. It's a lot of reading, but interesting reading. Professor Aizura is funny and definitely does his best to make his lectures interesting. 1 paper, 6 reflections, a group project, and a final exam.",1
"There is not much teaching in this course in fact he is quite inconsiderate,  won't provide preparation material and doesn't help you in anyway. Likes to be authoritative but ends up looking silly. I pay too much money to hqve my time and effort wasted by such.  Bye",0
"I took her winter class 2021. You do a open book multiple choice exam 3/4 weeks that is based on the chapters you have read for that week. She has Discussion questions that are also named as legal essays. She requires you to reference the book and or use resources to back up your reasoning. Pretty straight forward, hw takes up a bit of time",1
Horrible online teacher. Does not communicate well with students at all. Is not willing to work with students and most importantly she is very rude to some students.,0
"Professor Valvo cares a lot about her students. I am taking her for a writing intensive course and I highly recommend her! Read what you are assigned, complete the in class assignments and homework, and you will make the grade you want. She is always available to answer any questions that her students have.",1
"One of the finest professors Ive had in my academic career. Teaches real world work, inspires students to learn, help student to understand whats out there in IT world when you eventually leave college. Never missed a class even though the attendance was optional but he made the fun so great with great lectures and his knowledge!",1
"Ok wow I can't stand how she talks, so boring, and her online quizzes are pointless. Also, her whole participation grade is CRAP because its only if you show up or not. So if you're deathly ill for two weeks she'll give you a Zero... so basically you can show up and sleep in class and get a 20/20 she friggin sucks... i will never take her again",0
"I am so confused in his class, the whole class is. His lectures barely scratch the surface and his tests are the hardest thing that you will ever take. I do not recommend.",0
"lots of note-taking, quizzes, and little assignments to turn in as well as a few annoying labs. i like him because he's so into the subject, but it was hard to take him yelling for us to speak at 8 am. also, he sighs and groans a lot during tests, which kind of drives me insane. and the tests are hard, but multiple choice.",1
"-tested us on content we did not cover -never responded to emails throughout the course (sent 4, one in regards to her broken midterm that didn't load images required to answer certain questions. was marked down for those even though they couldn't be solved) -took 2 months before she finally fixed a grade she accidentally entered as a 0",0
She is really mean she has made me and other students i know cry.  The worst part of it all is that she runs like everything so like you cant get away from her.  if i knew a person like that was running the theater program I would never have joined.  time to switch my major,0
She can be confusing. First few weeks I had no idea what was going on. I know some people who dropped CSC altogether because they just didn't get her and some changed professors. Although I hear she is open to help.,0
Not very clear on assignments and gives a lot of homework. Most of it is just busy work and not actually helpful to your learning. The material is mostly common sense but he asks very specific questions from the book on the tests. ,1
Reall good course..a good balance between clinical and lab content and techniques..However the course isnt too easy but Dr.Hill makes it fun:),1
"Linear algebra: Gupta does nothing to inspire students: reading straight off slides, he teaches computations and definitions s.t. when students like myself try to employ intuition he fails to understand our thought process. Neglects any curiosities you have in topics not directly addressed in the textbook. 3Blue1Brown will be your best friend.",0
"Nice lady and teacher, she knows her stuff and replies back to emails fast, would recommend her",1
Dr. Swint is a great professor and an expert in his field. His directions and expectations for the class are super clear and he is approachable and helpful if you have any issues.,1
"she is a nice woman, means well, however: she is a VERY VERY POOR teacher. In fact, she doesnt teach. she goes over grammer in the book. explains horribly. responds to every question with: ""IT JUST IS"". though she is very knowledgable (speaks over 6 languages!) she is NOT recommended.",0
This was the worst professor experience I have ever had. I  never made above a low B on my speeches with no explanation. She gives insanely hard quizzes without really teaching the material. She takes forever to reply to emails so you can't even contact her outside of class. Would not recommend taking her.,0
"Professor cares only for literal policy translation, cannot be bothered between classes by any students, is ignorant and callous to student needs. California Issued Drivers Liscence is not enough to prove your identity to him, either student ID or you're treated as an imposter.",0
Such an amazing and passionate person. Her teaching methods are an exciting and refreshing change of pace from the usual boring lectures and heavy homework load. Best teacher ever!,1
"Honestly the hardest and worst class I've taken in college. He expects you to memorize 80-115 slides per lecture. He calls his 6 tests ""quizzes"" but they're anything but. Large curve but if I didn't HAVE to take this class for my major I wouldn't have tacked on the added stress. Don't be fooled either this class is not psychology. ",0
"She started on topic A then jumped into B without satisfying questions or concerns of students.  Quite moody at times, rolled eyes when asked questions.  She was all over the place, scatterbrained.  Very confusing.  Did not give partial credit for answers on exam which were close but not on point. You either wrote what she wanted or you are wrong.",0
"She gives you details on what the course is about via a syllabus. Since it was an online course, any responses from students were taken via emails; in which she was ready to rely to many. Gives positive feedback after finishing their work, which is an easy pass.",1
"This teacher is really nice! you have to buy her books for 80 dollars and you get two, its totally worth it because her tests are exactly from the study guides at the end of the chapter. the only reason you cant understand her is she has a really thick greek accent. other than that really easy class and pretty interesting.",1
"She dismissed class late every day and was difficult to understand. All of the homework was online, so we received very little feedback. This is an incredibly lazy teaching method and made me less passionate about mathematics! I'm now in linear algebra and have never had a professor as awful as her.",0
He isn't the most communicative instructor. Had to ask for the assignment schedule and it isn't laid out well online. Not the most responsive to emails.,0
"I would have rated her a 0. She is a harsh grader for no reason. BEWARE of exams with locked browser, webcam and no way to go back and forth. She is not helpful and will eventually ignore emails and won't reply. no matter how well you do on anything else, if you fail the exams: you will fail. Unclear grader as well.",0
"He is a really helpful teacher and you can tell he cares about his students! The class is really easy if you do all of the work. The quizzes are online and there are also group quizzes in class. Even if you do bad on the tests, you can still get a good grade in the class if you do your work!",1
This has been THE single hardest class I have ever taken at Creighton. The classroom environment is intimidating and very demanding. This is a capstone course so you have to get a 'C' to graduate. He treats the class like a Stanford MBA course. I would avoid his class at any cost! Look for Laura Mizaur who also teaches it. Midterm average= 36%,0
Course is set up so you basically can't fail because 45% of your mark is weekly quizzes. She basically reads word for word off the slides and it's very hard to stay engaged during her lectures. It also doesn't help that you already learn the majority of what she teaches in SOCI2445. If you do your readings you don't even need to go to class.,1
Easy B fench class!!! Try and you'll get an A-. She will notice if you're not there and homework may be posted on sundays,1
"If you take down good notes during lectures and do his practice quizzes, midterms and finals multiple times until you understand every type of problem, there is no reason that you shouldn't get an A. No surprises on exams.",1
"She is really sweet. I have statistics with her, which is obviously a lot of work, but she makes it as easy as possible. Lectures are very thorough so its easy to understand the material. I took Stat at community college and it was way harder than Dr Reiser-Danners class",1
"Also had him for higher plants and wetlands. Lower plants too. Excellent professor. Take his classes and getting out of the classroom is guaranteed. Might end up getting a little dirty or wet, but seeing and touching nature is much different from reading about it in a book. Tests can be difficult, so work on his practice questions. Enjoy!",1
"Nice but grading is arbitrary. Turned in final draft of paper that was nearly identical to 1st draft and got perfect score on final but B+ on 1st draft. Students with weaker presentation skills graded more leniently. Largest grade scaled down based on rating given by teammates, opening you up to being screwed by anyone you had a disagreement with.",0
Not a bad person but insisted that we brought the $120 text book and that if we didn't we would be required to drop the class. Upon buying the book a week later he made the class online and you were not longer required to have the book.,0
"Network Architecture and Protocols was a living nightmare...Karvelas' slides we crap, his DL format was email vs. Moodle like everyone else, exams were absolutely impassable, and he didn't even admin his own exams...STAY AWAY!",0
"Luallen is great. Like the other comments say, he is really tough.  Probably the hardest micro section at Tufts. That said, I have also learned more in his class than I have anywhere else. If you are a serious major, take it with him. If you are a minor/just thinking about econ, take it with someone else. (This is coming from someone who did well).",1
"I love psychology with a passion but this has been by far the worst class I have ever taken. She is a sweet women but my goodness! I never even knew what my grades were because nothing was graded till the end of the semester, by that point I couldn't fix my errors on the next assignments. This was also a very unorganized.",0
Arnold is not the most efficient teacher when it comes to her class. She assigns long papers and then takes over two months just to correct them. She is also a narrow minded teacher and only accepts views that are similar to hers. I wouldn't recommend a class with her.,0
"You know that teacher you always wished for that would understand that you're a human being, not a studying robot? Who wanted you to learn the bigger picture, and didn't care about memorizing names in a science class? Who wanted to help you succeed, and wouldn't throw you into the water and say, ""SWIM!"". Yeah. That's this this teacher.",1
"The professor is a bit dry in his lecture style, but he is nonetheless a good teacher and provides very interesting material. Show up and put an effort into assignments and you'll be fine.",1
She's the reason I decided to drop my psych minor. prior to her class psych classes where the least stressful because professors were always too nice and had their students wellbeing in mind but this professor was so not understanding even in the middle of a pandemic. how did this class stress me out more than a calc 2 class.,0
"Class was unruly and prof was not good at managing it. Class was regularly disruptive and off task. I don't think we finished one lecture in its entirety before I decided to drop this class. The subject matter is dope and prof seems to know it well, but it did not translate well into her teaching methodologies.",0
"All you learn in this class is editing videos. You don't learn anything else about media. He is picky on how the videos need to be done. He does mot teach anything. You just film, edit, & present in class. He also has favorites. You make 6-8 vids throughout the semester. He thinks we will all become reporters ugh. If you cant use imovie, good luck.",0
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
"Gravitationally challenged, says 'tickle me elmo"" when projector breaks, makes bugs buuny jokes ""use the stragety"" and says calc can be used for human problems too. LOL this guys hilarious but knows his stuff",0
"Average exam scores for the whole class was like 45. She boosted grades a week or two before the last day to drop, then put them back to what they were. No idea why she gave false hope but yea. Honestly my fault for not dropping and staying. Dont take this class she sucks at teaching.",0
"If you don't care to learn, don't pick this teacher because he will help you learn. Great teacher. A lot of work, quizzes and essays. All the work will make you smarter, but it can be too much.",1
"She is a nice person,but is not recommended. She had you answer a question out of your GuidedNotebook everyday.So you had to be there to get the points,put tons of HW online. i slept through  the class nearly every day and would have skipped if i could have and still got like a 99% in there.The test are easy did not study for 1 and aced em all!!!!!",0
HE IS A NICE PROFFESOOR. HE MAKES THE LECTURES FUN. I RECOMMNED TO READ THE BOOK BEFORE THE EXAM AND MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT THE SLIDES! SOME QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE SLIDES.,1
"Heed these warnings, for they are all true. She even stated in our class that she is not fond of teaching and no longer wants to do it. Doesn't answer emails. She does not give grading criteria for big projects, and then grades very hard. I even lost points for being ""too concise"" on a big project. Is that even possible?",0
"Very enthusiastic and friendly. He made Advanced Writing as fun as it could be. Lots of writing assignments and verbose rubrics. Class was enjoyable, though, and he's definitely helpful and committed to his teaching.",1
"offers great instruction from an actor's perspective, not JUST a professor",1
This subject could be decent if taught by the right person. She's not it. Lectures didn't correlate with anything and we all seldom scored above C-range on tests. She cancelled our final the day before without explanation  which shattered my chances at bringing my grade up. She then refused to let me do anything else to help my grade. Steer clear.,0
"I liked Professor Perez and the class is easy enough. But his TA's are super arrogant and very disruptive during lecture. One of the TA's is constantly on her laptop during the lecture. Thankfully I had Brian as a TA, he was tough but his discussions were super helpful.",1
"Loved this class. Great teacher, and I was able to do some of the most creative work in my entire time in the art dept. I am obsessed with animation, and soooo happy to finally find a true mentor who cares. Thank you Kathleen. You've changed my life.",1
"Great sense of humor, helpful, patient and makes fantastic analogies to help one understand dance better.",1
"His class was the strangest I have ever taken.  He has so many personal issues, all of which he shares, that it's amazing this man functions.  He actually showed up to our class over medicated, and we were afraid he would pass out!  Although it's an easy A, the stuff he puts you through is not worth it.  I can't ephasize this enough- AVOID!!!",0
"hardest comm class out of the other teachers. she would teach you the chapter after the quizzes, so you basically need to teach yourself to pass the quiz. Would purposely unmute me during lectures on zoom which was weird. only would happen in this class. Grades harshly, follow the rubric, read the book thoroughly for quiz",0
One of the best professor in the SMC theater dpt.. Highly recommended to take all of her class!,1
"Best teacher, so nice and caring of her students. Tests are not hard if you study from her guided notes.",1
He is the one of the BEST math teacher I had in my life. He makes math so easy to understand and he teaches the fast way to get the answers. I took him over the summer so he was more lenient but I would definitely take him for any math that he teaches lol.,1
"I took his online Evolution of Hip Hop class. He doesn't show you just how much is due each week, he releases the week's work all on one day exactly 7 days before they're due. One week he assigned 3 quizzes, an hour and a half long documentary with 3 required posts afterwards, and an 8 page research paper all due on the same day. This class is hard",0
"I really enjoyed Proffesor Sigal's class, Sexuality 120: Sexuality in the Americas.  However, it was not what I was expecting.  It was much more about the European sexual colonization of South American than current American view on sex.  He was a fair grader and the lectures were interesting.  He also gives a lot of leeway in papers and projects.",1
"Professor Ramamoorthy is not a very good teacher. His accent is very thick and hard to understand, he's very unclear about the assignments even when you clearly ask him, and it's hard to get anything done in his class. Lectures are boring and the labs are torture. He's an easy grader and gives out an extra 5% if you attend every lecture and lab.",0
"The most caring and approachable prof I've had. She can be biased at times and less knowledgeable about certain topics but the way she teaches her classes is very hands-on and enjoyable. Grading criteria for essays is sometimes unclear, but she's willing to help in office hours. An A is tricky (cutoff was 95). Highly recommend for pre-law students.",1
"This professor messed up my GPA. He expects you to know a lot. If don't know to write an essay well, you're done. He repeats everything and isn't very helpful. He is really nice but a harsh grader. Avoid him. You been warned..",0
"Dr. Capper is an excellent teacher but his tests are downright cruel! He believes that when students come to his class, they will have no other classes. His tests do not reflect a student's learning and they are highly unfair.",1
"first midterm was the exact same questions as the study guide. second midterm was nothing like the study guide. midterms were 2 questions. very generous curve. the final was really just another midterm, and really easy. much easier of a class than i anticipated.",1
Grades hard for no reason. Its an easy class you just get no chance to ask questions because she acts like your dumb if you do.,0
Claudine is the best instructor I could have asked for in a mental health rotation where I didn't know what to expect. She is so supportive and not the least bit intimidating! If you show her you genuinely care about your patients she will love you. She truly just wants you to succeed and makes you so comfortable. Wish I could have her again!,1
"Great guy! Not a great prof! He has no order to his lectures and bounces from place to place and it's almost impossible to follow. Also, his topics for essays are beyond bizarre so if you are going to take eng 1122 don't take it with him.",0
"This is one of the best kinds of graduate school professors: the kind that will challenge you, enrich your experience, and provide you with vital tools to move forward. She is not an easy professor and takes hits from no one. But she is empathetic and willing to invest her time in you if you are proactive.",1
"This professor during a pandemic does not provide any extra credit that will actually move your grade up. There are only 3 exams that make up the majority of the grades and she does not curve or care. Overall the professor can't keep her personal life away from her professional work, which is a bad trait to have as a professor.",0
"Professor Fazelpour's lectures are very condescending, he seemingly talks down to the class and has a hard time articulating his words and some parts of the lecture are hard to understand due to a harsh accent. Sets seemingly arbitrary rules for homework assignments and passes the buck on any mistakes he makes when it comes to the class in general.",0
Slow grader,0
Amazing professor! His lectures are very interesting and he'll have your attention the whole time. He tells you exactly what will be on the midterm and final. Both exams are based on the readings and what you learn in lectures. Easy marker and is always available to clarify any questions you have.,1
Louise is a very caring professor that you can freely talk to about concerns. Her assignments were a bit confusing and her tests were very tricky (to avoid cheating she asks questions like which one of these statements is false). Her 4 midterms were all open-notes and multiple choice but you only have a limited-time so be careful.,1
"So starting off, this professor is a very sweet guy, but his accent and the way he goes about teaching is definitely difficult. the Wiley math homework consisted of things that we never went over, and I just had trouble overall in the class, when I never had problems in calc before.",0
"Julien loves to teach which is evident through the fact that he makes sure the entire class understands everything before moving on. He will always take the time to help you out no matter what it is, and will make sure you do well if you want to. Show up, do the in class games and take time for the project and its an easy A.",1
"I found Jamie's lectures hard to follow. When I asked her for help, I was usually left more confused and slightly insulted.  Assignments are fair and the quizzes are very straight forward. If you can figure out what  Jamie wants, you will do well, if not, try to maintain your sanity.",0
"In the beginning she seems like a nice,good professor but the whole semester we did nothing, I learned nothing, struggled with quizzes and tests she let us take home because we did nothing in class, can never get ahold of her out of class, she grades stuff late & I felt I didn't get the grades I should have. Nice lady, but should not be a professor",0
"Professor Lopez was a funny, charismatic, and approachable lecturer who could make Shakespeare appealing to anyone. Plus there's an option to write no essays (if you take an extra test)! I would recommend his classes to anyone. It",1
"Ms. Kim is not the best professor to take for calc. She has a very strong accent, which makes it difficult to understand her. Even if she didn't have the accent, you still wouldn't be able to understand her. Do yourself a favor a skip this professor",0
Boring. Difficult. Extreme amt of assignments. Ridiculous amt of hw to do.,0
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken in my academic career thus far. However, Dr. Weston provides the BEST feedback to help guide you in the right direction. Assignments may take a while to be graded, but the quality of her feedback is worth the wait. The feedback tells you what you need to fix, so fix it and you'll be golden!",1
She don't teach,0
"She has a very thick accent, the things she teachers doesnt make sense, I would not recommend this class for anyone that has a hard time understanding math like me",0
Avoid at your own cost.,0
"Team business simulation was fun, but we had members who did not pull weight. Points system he uses does not fairly reflect that. Possible 575, and only 20 reflect team support. Two of us worked tirelessly, and other two got gifted 117 points for our work. Unfair system. Directions on assignments left much to be desired as well.",0
Seiously...easiest course and this prof returns your email ASAP and easy marker...GUARANTEED !!!,1
I thought we were suppose to be refining what's in our minds and not what's in her mind. He assignments felt like she was mining her students for info that would help her next book of criticism. She gives a lot of work and very little valid feedback. I'd look for a more generous teacher whose easier on your grades.,0
"I pay the University to learn physics but in return i end up teaching myself. The only time u will be taught by him is if youre lucky enough to be inhis group (which he changes every 3 weeks ) , his TA sucks and confuses everyone and no one gives you a straight up answer . its frustrating to be in a class where its all a guessing game.",0
Good Job! Dr. Che,1
"Be ready for a lot of homework... and STUDY!!! NO NOTES for quizzes or tests! Usually gets out early... If you do your best and complete ALL homework, you should pass. You will use Connect a lot for homework and quizzes. TEXTBOOK is a MUST.",1
"Perkins was my favorite professor at Sam! His class is so easy as long as you go, pay attention and do the work. Textbook is not really he needed. He is a very good teacher and always tries to make sure you understand the material",1
She is very demeaning to students in class and is one of the most unhelpful professors that I have ever had. If you can avoid taking a class from Aurore Victor then I would strongly suggest it.,0
"He is an awful professor, the whole lecture is just gibberish. He doesn't even know what he's talking about, and won't answer a simple question even if asked multiple times. He gives his students no encouragement to even come back to class. He makes Composition the worst class ever took. I wouldn't advise selecting him as a professor at all.",0
Honestly she is my favorite teacher! It's lecture heavy but she tries to make it fun and she has small quizzes (that she gives answers to) to keep you engage. There's a lot of info to remember but nothing insane. If you show up and study you'll make an A. Plus she gives a lot of extra credit.,1
"Amazing teacher! I took her for an 8 week summer course and was nervous about so many speeches and tests in a short time. She is a motivator. She will help you in the direction you want the speech to go. She made the most dreaded class for most absolutely great. If you try, you will do well. ",1
She is a good professor but the language barrier is an issue and she gives a lot of work. As long as you do all your work and show up for class you will get an A.,1
"Unorganized. Objectives a joke of a study guide. Prepare for 75pt exams that turn into 250 pts because she can. Writes her own exams and questions are tricky. She is nice to your face but u can tell she enjoys making everyone squirm. Read your book and answer questions in lecture, she will ask a lot of them and will grade you easier if you answer!",0
"Dr. Mkhatshwa goes out of his way to ensure that each student understands the material, and if they don't, he's willing to meet with them outside class anytime to go over it. He often gives chances to make up bad exam grades. His PhD is in Math Education, so he's also just good at teaching math. He's great. Can't recommend enough.",1
"Great math professor, clear examples and good notes.",1
"Great instructor. Course is easy if reading is done & effort is made. Consistent, fair, quick grader. Quick Communication. Participated in forum. Fair work load. Open book & untimed quizzes - MC & essay, power point, and paper. I learned a LOT! One of my favorite classes so far & interest was peaked. I would take another course with Prof. Browning.",1
"I would take this class. It's completely changed my political beliefs. I'm not sure if it was the reading material or Professor Brownlee's lectures, but I walked in a moderate liberal and came out a leftist.",1
"Horrible teacher! The textbook basically taught you how to do math. He did one example of a lecture and the rest was up to you to figure it out. I love math, but he made me hate it.",0
Professor Duncan is an inspiring teacher. Lectures are always interesting and interactive. I'd take this class 100 times over!,1
Jacki is an awesome professor. She wants her students to be successful and take something away from her class. History of Economic Doctrine was extremely interesting and she helps you understand its importance in overall economic theory and practice.,1
"I doubt if we were in an English class because half of the all blog responses are to be in English 150 points, the final project in English 100 points, the annotated bibliography  100 points also in English. He does not respond to emails, has blank assignments which he grade at the end of the semester. Can't even speak French himself!",0
"LMG is the best. She sends a kind reminder after each class to let you know what went on during class if you missed. Homeworks are easy points. Hardest thing in the class is the test, but study some and you should be alright. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
"I really liked him, especially having an 8 am he didn't make me want to fall asleep. There are a lot of online assignments so it helps your grade if you don't do well on tests and he is available for office hours.",1
Amazing professor.,1
Professor Bruce was absolutely AMAZING. His lectures were easy to understand. He was very nice and willing to help at all times. His quizzes were tricky so you had to pay attention in class but they were easy. 1 paper to write which was not difficult at! Im glad i took psy 101 with him.,1
"Very friendly individual and at first the class seems like it will be like any other math class. Slightly challenging but do-able. His exams, however are some of the hardest material I have ever seen. His examples and homework do not help at all. Save yourself the pain and do not take his class.",0
"He is very difficult to understand while talking, but his class is incredibly easy. Just had to write a paragraph summary once per week on the information. I would suggest learning from the textbook though if your going to take his class.",0
The class is sorta boring and you really need to pay attention to grasp whats going on. Tests are almost identical to practice but the final was pretty tough.,0
SHE IS AMAZING + SWEET + KIND. Very understanding and flexible and you will learn a lot.  Recommend her 11/10.,1
His lectures hardly made sense and were very difficult to follow.,0
"Overall an ok professor. The biggest issue is with the assignments grading criteria not being very clear, also tests are medium difficult. Questions in exams are tricky to medium difficult. Study the powerpoints and read the chapters and you should be able to get a C. A good thing is he does seem to care and is somewhat funny.",1
"Dr. Jacobson is responsible for me choosing to get my masters in sociology,. She sparked an interest that I'm grateful for. I learned a lot of material in the class and passed with a great grade. I would recommend her to anyone looking for an interesting class",1
"Shes hilarious and very intelligent. Although, shes extremely unorganized and takes all the time in the world to grade tests and labs. She will contradict herself on occasion by stating one thing, and deny had saying it a week later.",1
"I took her Spring 2016, she started out on a good road but went completely left at the end. She actual taught the last two weeks of the semester. When she began to teacher she was giving a crash lesson. She believes you should be a professional writer not thinking this could be a class you have not taken in thirty years.",0
"I literally had no idea what I was doing in this class, and he didn't really teach much about it. You just follow along with his 12 step process and hope you don't get lost along the way or you're going to end up with a terrible grade. He's accessible outside of class but doesn't take time to read the reports students worked all semester on.",1
He is by far the hardest physics professor in Kennesaw. He doesn't care if his students understand the material. Overall not a good teacher in my opinion and other peoples opinions as well.,0
"If you do have to take chem class, take Dr. Borglin's class. Super patient with her students. She wants her students to pass thats why she will also work hard for you. She will listen when you have questions no matter what your question is. She will completely guide you. One of the best profs in CCC.",1
"Gives you leeway if you accidentally mess up a paper, pretty good professor.",1
"Professor Sapp is hands down one of the best criminal justice professors! He gives you feedback on your work, responds quickly to answers, his syllabus is pretty simple! You have 8 discussions, 8 lessons and 4 exams! I received an A in his class. You will enjoy his class, I promise!",1
"Love this man. This class was incredibly easy and so interesting. Three exams and a 5% bonus participation mark. Getting an A+ is easy! I didnt read the textbook once, rather just looked up quizlets of other peoples cue cards from the text! Lalonde tells dark jokes and is so monotone but actually hilarious if you give him a chance!",1
"Dr. Mason is the perfect example of what good teaching is. He is organized, intelligent, consistent, articulate, and very passionate. Not only that, he shows his students respect and extends himself to ensure that you know how to be successful in his class. For me, Dr. Mason has made the UW-Stout Sci Educ program a great experience.",1
"A real stickler when it comes to attendance and grading and doesn't forgive mistakes at all (won't even reply to emails for explanations). I accidentally turned in a wrong paper and even though he knew, didn't mention anything until giving back my grade and wouldn't accept my actual paper. Jerk. Take this class with a different professor.",0
I could not believe the poor comment left by someone about Professor Everson. I've studied with him for the past two years and cannot say enough good things about him. Insecurities? Stubbornness? Narrowmindedness? You must be talking about a different Terry Everson. This man is brilliant and absolutely the most talented musician I've ever met.,1
"She was all over the place! Her examples made no sense, and she made mistakes ALL THE TIME. She never knew when the quizzes were. And her voice was so raspy it was hard to focus. I do not recommend her at all.",0
"He is not an easy professor, you have to take a 3.5 hour test and then a quiz as soon as you walk into class. His quiz are very hard, 95% of the class fail them. You have to memorize 3 to 4 chapters and lectures. He is very hard headed and the questions are created to make you fail. He admitted he enjoys making people squirm. Don't recommend",0
Worst explainer and doesn't help you when you don't understand something. She expects you to know everything.,0
"Nice guy, but he drags his lessons out soooo much. It could seriously take 15 minutes. I can't listen to him because I get so bored and distracted. A nice class to work on homework from another class though!",0
"This is an intro class to theatre, but all she can talk about is her history in costume.  it gets redundant and annoying.  if i wanted a theatre costume class, i'd take it.  no dice.",1
Steve is really enthusiastic about his subject but doesn't always do a good job of explaining. He will throw problems up on the board and go through them but doesn't really go into detail enough to grasp it. He makes a lot of little mistakes sometimes so you have to watch to catch him or he will stare at the board in confusion for 5+ minutes.,1
"this class killed my GPA, i was studying all day and night for this class and still tough grading made it a D for me in the class. Worst teacher at nova!!!",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER!!!!!!!!!! I cannot emphasize how bad she is! I don't know where she came from or who does she think she is but she acts as if nothing else is going on but her own class. Avoid her at all costs!!! I won't be surprised if i don't see her here next semester. For what is worth, she is left with 3 students for the rest of the year.",0
He explains the materials of lectures very well !,1
Very nice guy and super easy course.  Just lots of busy work.,1
"Dr. Schmurr is such a great guy! The material he teaches is hard sometimes, but hes open to helping, and also allows a lot of corrections. I would highly suggest choosing him as a professor. Also, as long as you go to the class 50% of the time, youll be fine. He doesnt take attendance.",1
"While Professor Culter is pretty okay at exposing things in class, she is awful at giving good examples in her online video lectures. She expects you to know the material (which is fine) but doesnt explain how she gets certain numbers and where they came from. Half the class dropped out after the third chem lab. Do NOT have her as your professor!",0
"I am going to be real with you: this will be the hardest you ever work in a French class and you will be all the better for it. He gives clear and extensive feedback unlike any professor I have had in French before. Try to stay on his good side because he is super sweet, but that sweetness will quickly end if you are not giving it your all.",1
"She is nice as a person, horrific as a Prof. Dont expect to get an A if you only plan on attending lectures, you will have to go above and beyond to decipher her work. For the love of god find another Econ 2201 Prof or avoid it at all costs. I dont even know why I took this class, I thought it would be interesting.",0
the information was easy to understand and apply but the test just seemed complete 180° from the quizzes and homework,0
"Literally do not take this professor. I took this as a mandatory credit and will be receiving my first C ever in college. He grades as if everyone in his class will be professional writers. Not clear in feedback, nor does he ever talk about how he wants papers to be written. I do admit that the class discussions are interesting but not worth it.",0
"Professor Nelson is one of my favorite professors I have had so far in college. I am not an architecture major, but found his class engaging and his talks very interesting. He is a fair but tough grader. There was a lot of reading and writing in my class, but he gives you plenty of useful feedback on papers. He is particularly a stickler on prose.",1
"Ortiz is amazing. He really teaches the course in a way that works best for the class. He's very laid back and teaches you how to say what you mean and mean what you say. He seems grouchy at first, but at the end of the day, he really cares for his students. He's a ""tough love"" kind of guy.",1
Everything was so logical. If you study the quizzes and exams are easy.,1
"Lots of essays and essay quizzes. Instructor did not provide clear instructions on essay topics & her critiques were vague. The books that were required for reading were very 1 sided & I felt that the she was trying to push her beliefs onto us. We read a book about feminism, immigration, & police brutality. For an entry level class it was hard.",0
"I dont know why everyone didnt like this class.  i thought it was enjoyable and rather easy, and im a business major!! this is a great elective, a little bit of work but alot less then my other classes.",1
We all love Doc!!! Best Instructor Ever!,1
Make sure you attend every lecture and discussion! I had 90+ in both midterm and final. But only got B+ overall because I missed a few lectures. His one page essay is really restricted in terms of his requirement. His lecture is always useless and you better off read books on your own. Participation grade is so subjective and unfair. Avoid him.,0
"Prof. Van Der Poel literally teaches what's in the book, even using the same examples. She's a stickler for notation and exact solving of each question. Every minor error means a point deduction. If you don't understand something she said, she gets annoyed and asks another student to explain. Be ready to pay $100 to turn in homework online.",0
Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,0
"Took 446 with him and LOVED it. Awesome course and materials. Want to take 494 but now have learned he is not teaching it. Ah man, terrible. Other students disappointed too. We respect him for his teaching prowess. Also because he catches plagiarizers. I wish others would teach w/ academic rigor like him. Thank you Dr. Alderete, a role model..",1
"I took this class expecting math to suck, math sucked but the teacher is definitely nice and when had questions about the lecture or HW during class she would explain things a little better so that was good. The bad began when she would forget to post the homework and the work stacks up, and you fall behind. She doesn't answer her emails.",0
"what started off as class with what we thoughyt was going to be a strong start , ended up with a dissater witha atttitude, who dissappeared 75% of the time. He had excuses in not giving back work in timely manners, the rarely showed up and used his daughter and other school additives as his dissapearance and he lacked commuinication pathetic teach",0
"You can't hear him most of the time with his german accent and he may look mean, but he grades easy on the lab reports, gives you full points for non-lab report labs, and always wants to end the class early.  You never stay the full 3 hrs and he is nice!",1
"Brad is very relaxed. He makes typical teacher jokes and has a teacherly sense of humor. He's very approachable and eager to offer help and advice. He's very laid back about attendance. He understands if you sleep in or can't make it. Attendance is stricter in the beginning, but later in the semester - very relaxed. He takes awhile to grade papers.",1
"Professor Allen is the best. You have to go to class he takes attendance everyday, but you have to show up if you want to pass the tests anyways. No homework or quizzes, but there are six tests. He is really funny in class and he takes the time to answer lots of questions and makes sure everyone understands.",1
Easy A but don't bother showing up to class. Assignments are online and easy. All the assignments are due at the end of the semester. Would recommend doing the assignments as they are scheduled in the syllabus since it's easier. He made access assignments optional when we transitioned online(COVID19).,1
"Excellent professor, I wish Mass Bay would give this professor more classes to teach. He made accounting exciting and not too dreadful. He gives homework only to make sure you understand the topic.",1
"unclear marking criteria, very slow and boring class. VERY picky when marking written assignments.",0
hate this class. she made the experience of learning about children boring and in fact made me want to switch my major.,0
She is a really TOUGH GRADER.,0
"Class grade is a total of four paper.  After you receive the syllabus, you honestly do not even need to show up because he posts the paper questions on his blackboard site. All information gained in the class is from the two textbooks. No structure in the class or even powerpoints. Very harder grader on papers. Says one thing but wants another",0
"Miss Pillai is very responsible and passionate about teaching. The grading is strict I do admit, but that does for the whole French department, no points were taken out of personal favor or so, the rubric was clear. But most importantly, her class is not dull at all, so personally I wouldn't even want to skip this class because it was just SO fun.",1
"Not an easy class or Professor. She requires 8 books but you only need 2 of the novels. She talks fast and everything you're tested on is based on notes (I usually got 5-7 pages/class). Because she talks so much and gets off topic, the amount of things you need to study for exams is insane. She'll do everything in her power to not give you an A.",0
"I know learning new language is hard enough,but she expects you to know everything.I mean everything! She lies too!Said she won't put some of the stuff on the exam. She repeated her herself atleast 5 times! But oh no,she had to put it.Everyone in my class had to say something about her.Thats how bad she is.",0
"I took a class with Al 1st semester and gladly took another 2nd semester! Classes are lectures with a few assignments, quizzes, and tests so not the most interesting but always manageable. Do the homework and study and youll be fine. Al is very organized and has very clear expectations. Hes funny, quirky, and overall very likeable! I recommend!",1
Professor Richards is an amazing teacher to have. He focuses more on teaching the subject rather than giving out a lot of homework. He does give out homework but its very manageable. Its an online textbook and you answer questions on the readings. Then he teaches it in class. He wants to make sure you understand it. Thats his priority. Hes caring!!,1
"Makes sure to share several good sources of, well, sources.  Loves the topic, very knowledgeable.  Plays guitar.",1
This was one of my worse experience with a professor. She gave so many papers (2 per week) Plus she gave an entire 15 page research paper with only 2 weeks to complete it. Plus 2 5 page papers due that same week. On top of that her instructions were terrible and she grades so hard! I would not recommend her to anyone. Everything was too repetitive.,0
Ms. Feagin knows a lot about American history but I feel that she tries to cram too many activities into one semester.,0
"Dr. Hoban is a nice person, & she lectures very well. She provides powerpoints & visuals to help students understand concepts & follow lectures. She's also willing to help outside of class as much as possible. BUT, she does assign an unreasonable amount of MP HW. She'd even have some of them due on exam days. She's good, but get ready to WORK!!!",1
"Tough teacher, but cares about the subject and students. On one hand, he doesn't give A's often, lectures for long periods of time, and sometimes wings class meetings. On the other hand, he will work will anyone struggling and make sure they understand what is expected of them. You will actually leave his classes with new knowledge and skills.",1
"Professor Grant does a great job, not only introducing you to authors and their works, but he makes the connection from a historical standpoint and outlines how these authors impact society.  He assigns a lot of reading from the text and then does a great job outlining the lesson and presenting it in various formats (audio, video, etc.)",1
"This class is very difficult, we're completely online you gotta learn everything on your own. Hw will take a long time. The test is insanely difficult and has no correlation to what we learn or the hw which is so annoying, the curve is really big bc of that but I wouldnt rec anyone take her unless you wanna study 3 hours every week on your own",0
Prof Corker was awful. She did not even pretend to care about her students. She also teaches the material like we should already know it and gets upset when we don't. Be ready to do lots of work. And don't bother asking her questions-- she's not very helpful at all. Get someone else if possible,0
"Professor Gutteridge is hands down the best professor I have had. Audacious and cleaver. Lectures are engaging, he is very knowledgeable and open to discussion. He wants you to take responsibility for your own learning. TAKE NOTES: assignments are based off of in class discussion about readings.",1
"Ms Apryl ,One of my best teachers at Reynolds. I've taken ENG111- ENG112- and ENG 242. I enjoyed her class and would highly recommend to everyone. Just don't miss the class a lot because some activities are based on being on class. Do your homework and you'll pass with a good grade. and the most important, she is very understandable and easy going.",1
"She is a great professor! Really funny and crass sometimes, but she knows a lot about the subject. The material was somewhat challenging, but in a good way. If you go to class and take the time to understand what's taught, you should be fine. They try to give you extra easy grades to help you",1
"This prof is a little scatterbrained but her enthusiam shines through her lecture, especially when we learned about fungi and protists and diatoms. She is a so-so prof, in the sense that you will either love her or hate her for her teaching style. Her midterms and finals were easy but it will still take a decent amount of effort from you.",1
"Some people were permitted late work and some weren't despite same reasons. Grading of drawings is inconsistent: a student loses 5 points for having a dimension line that is too long and another student loses 1 point for the same same line, same length. Why? I don't know. You teach yourselves, get others to help you. He does a short demo each day.",0
"Be super careful on tests as she will ding you for the slightest thing. Lectures quickly, making it difficult to understand everything. Goes over time on the lectures every time, making it difficult to make it to your next class on time. Believes that memorization is easy for everyone. Not the worst professor I've had, but definitely not the best.",0
all lecture from PowerPoint which is from the book boring class all you do is take notes no taking to people next to you for help.  Review below me is on point about his grading  For me the test were hard his review did not help different from test. Bad eyesight people he writes small and bright color seat on first row. you learn one python script,0
"Nora is the best. Show up. Do all the labs. 2 exams and a final zoo project.  She is the sweetest and cares for her students, it shows. Attendance is mandatory and so is the Lab Manual Book. ",1
"Ms. Lewis is NOT a good teacher. NO test reviews, NOT even for Finals!! Practice Test on my math lab for the final were not reflective of her final exam. Very Tough Grader, no room for error on Any exams! BEWARE... classes start out full most will drop! Studied my tail off, A student, enjoy a challenge but Something was off here!!",0
She is by far one of my favorite teachers that  i have ever had. She is so worldly and intelligent and loves to share her knowledge. She is Russian and has a russian accent but that is all it is she speaks perfect english and i would assume english is her second language and she does a great job. I just love her class so much. Def recommend her.,1
"Professor Keeling is very nice and pleasant. That being said, she's not a great teacher. She asks for something in a paper and will then take off for it. She also puts her views into what she teaches. And she holds class long virtually every class period. It's really annoying with a six o'clock class and I'm trying to get dinner.",0
"The midterm and final were comprised of exactly the same questions that were on the reviews, so if you study those well, you'll ace the tests. It's a difficult class that requires outside research if you want to make an A.",0
I thought her lecturing was ok and clicker questions were the easiest of all the profs. Her midterm was tricky and difficult as she put one 8 point question on a diagram that she only showed for 2 seconds in lecture. Study everything! even if you think its not important!,0
"She is great. You will learn a lot. Expect to write a lot as well. She will help you, just ask.",1
OK,1
"Melissa's lectures were informative but very lengthy. A lot of the time she would spend class giving a tutorial on how to use Adobe Premier but would get upset when we followed along on our computers because we weren't ""paying attention."" I feel like her class was better pre-covid. Overall she was just alright, do the work and you'll pass.",1
Professor Paradis is such an amazing teacher I really enjoyed taking his class if he taught something else I would totally register for his class again. He knows what he is talking about and makes the class fun.,1
"Her notes didn't make any sense- my study group couldn't even comprehend them when I asked for help. Her tests are ridiculous and she doesn't teach in any logical order, just throws random information in at different times about different things.",0
"Really nice lady! She is super helpful! As long as you do the work, you will pass!",1
"Great professor! I took theclass during the Mini Winter session. Though it was condensed into 3 weeks at the most, the professor was so helpful and replied to questions in a timely manner. At first I didn't know anything about HTML and feared of failing the class and the difficulty of it, but it was very helpful and fun to learn. Enjoyed it!",1
"I can't see how anyone can not like him! Having to take religion, I only took him and refused anyone else. I thought it would be religion shoved at you but no, it's the values and theology behind them. Plus, you learn a lot of valuable life lessons. It's the one gen.ed class I didn't mind at all and think everyone should take. WONDERFUL professor!",1
"An amazing professor that made me love marketing. He is not here to make it hard, rather give you the facts and make it relatable and fun. Engaging in the class makes class discussions fun and the quizzes as well as the midterm is open note and the final is a group project that's fun.",1
Prof Infante is both an adorable person and a fabulous professor.  He listens to his students and makes time to meet at least once during the semester with each student in the class. He make required material interesting and understandable. I furthered my Spanish significantly in the 2 semesters in his classes. SPAN 307 & 334.,1
"Awesome, fun laid back teacher. Made classes fun. Bring him chips!",1
"If you have a family emergency and don't notify her ahead of time, (you know, because those things are under ""your control""), she'll lower your grade 22%. She changes the syllabus a lot, gives a lot of articles to read, briefly discusses articles, puts mostly videos in class, and her class meetings are unpredictable for a hybrid class.",0
"I don't understand how this instructor got good ratings on here. She is by far, the most least qualified and horrible professor I have ever had. I don't think she would even be qualified to work at a McDonalds. This professor not only did not know how to grade correctly, she would miss class all the time, and you never had an idea of whatwasgoingon",0
"Mary Layoun is a very nice person. Its nice that participation is 30% of grade but lectures are just painful. She will talk about ""trying to get people to talk about difficult topics"", then turn around and make offensive asides in lecture. TA's grade your 3 papers, and they are really strict. If you're not a lit major, then I wouldn't recommend. ",0
"Worst professor I have encountered thus far. Like everyone else has said, we didn't get our first test back until a month and a half after we took it. He doesn't post assignments or readings until the night before they are due. He coughs and clears his throught 150+ times during class. Not helpful, arrogant. If you scheduled it drop it, now.",0
This professor wants you to know how to do each writing assignment that she gives to you. I thought we are suppose to learn not come into the class having a background in writing. Even though I am a wonderful writer she still found ways to be very critical of everything I turned in.I would not recommend her class please do not take her.,0
Every review on this is basically a lie. It is 2 months into the semester and not even the final withdraw date yet and 1/4 of my class is gone. If you cannot teach yourself stay away. If you go to him for help he will get annoyed if you don't understand the material. Always cancels office hours. More than half my class is failing with like a 50 avg,0
"Great looking guy, enjoyed looking at him more than learning the material - no wonder I got a bad grade?",0
"I had a very poor experience with Ms. Benton, for some she may be fun. To me she was very lazy, did not do anything to help the students because ""that would be too much work for her"". She doesn't actually give lectures you just kind of waste the class time with a variety of either small activities, hints to what we are supposed to know, or talking.",0
you! yes you! take her now because she is the best,1
"He is all over the place when it comes to his lectures , he talks really fast and you can never read his handwriting. Its hard to keep up which him when he teaches. Never gets into any real good details in his lectures. At the end of the day, he is passionate in what he does and is a nice and caring person but it can be hard to keep up with him.",0
not useful,0
"Professor Baez class consisted him of going over powerpoints in class then assigning homework through saplinglearning. Here the homework consisted of mostly multi choice questions you can find online. There was one midterm, one final, one research project and overall it was a great class and I learned a lot about economics!",1
You should not take HUMAN101 as an online course because you will not have enough time to absorb the material covered. La-turner had no problem letting the students know that he did not like teaching this class online. I think if I had of physically attended the lectures I would've enjoyed it.,0
She wants every single person in the class to do well. If you go to class take notes and listen you will get an A on every test. I never bought the textbook and just used the workbook to study and got an A.,1
Very easy if you study the study guide and listen to the lecture. He has a lot of good insight and will tell you everything you need to know. Great class. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. Literally everything you need to know is on the handout he gives each week. ,1
The class doesn't allow much flexibility as the criteria consists of 3 modules where it covers 3 topics per week. . The class is practically on auto-pilot as the lectures aren't even taught by her mostly. Just having some insight from the professor herself post-lecture would be great. Read the syllabus as there is a warning for taking this class.,0
"I sat in his class and felt lost the whole time. He is all over the place, he does not follow the quiz/test dates, his review sessions are useless. Tough grader, be prepared to read and self study !!!",0
"Dr. Shartin is a very nice guy, but not a very good professor. He was very unorganized. The class was pretty difficult, because of the readings, and he did not help very much. The class wasn't impossible, but very frustrating.",0
"Deborah changed my mind about what Math could be, if you don't like Math then her class will be good for you.",1
Do the weekly homework assignments there is two every week grades for completion. quizzes online. 5 exams & final but don't freak out. lectures can be boring but he is understanding lets you turn in work late. I did my homework during lectures. Took his lab was easy do the lab in group and just a project & trip at the end. drops lowest exam & hw.,1
"I took ""Exploring Photography"" with her as an introductory class. It's a pretty laid-back class, no homework other than the four major assignments. Participation is essential to getting a good grade, in the sense that she likes you go explain your thought process at critiques. She can be a little sassy, but has an overall funhappy persona. :)",1
Clear explanations and course objectives.  Willing to help students at any time.,1
"Not a great professor, but definitely not terrible. Lecture is a bit hard to pay attention to (boring and slow) but he covers all the content fairly well.",1
"Mr. Hunt is a great teacher. He is pretty shy, but he is so helpful. He stayed after numerous times and wouldn't move on until everyone understood the lesson. The best math teacher I've ever had!",1
"Pell is a nice person and is helpful and easy to reach via email, however she is the hardest prof, AVOID IF YOU CAN.  2 sets of homework due every sunday at midnight and they can be really long.  I strongly recommend you find a study group to help with the homework because they are alot different from what you do in class.  EXAMS ARE HARD",0
"This was the hardest class i have had so far in CBE. If you do not have old tests, you will not pass. The old tests have EXACTLY the same questions as the tests he gives you. I found this out halfway through the semester so my test scores went from a 30 to a 80. HW can easily take 10 hours per assignmt even w help. HW is EXACT same every year.",0
"He's an amazing teacher, is impossible to fall asleep in his class. You'll love this subject because of this guy, but he is a hard grader. Awesome teacher.",1
I really enjoyed taking this Prof online. He gave good feedback and whenever I had a question about assignments he responded very quickly. Do the work and you will pass.,1
"Monika was so disorganized. The course structure was all over the place and so last minute. 90% of students in French112 were taking for language requirements - we don't want to be doing presentations in French, we just want to pass the class! Terrible, UBC needs to reassess language requirements.. ",0
"Makes students cry regularly. Gives lectures, but doesn't actually explain anything. Don't take him. Just don't. If you ask him any questions he's condescending and rude.",0
Taking 351 with Stewart was amazing. The class is lecture heavy but he's hilarious and easily accessible outside of class. He generally doesn't use powerpoint so the notes you take are your lifeline but he answers questions during and after class and through email. So glad I chose him for my advisor. He also knows a lot about chem and bio,1
I was so excited about taking physics until I met this guy. His lectures didn't make any sense. He liked making people look stupid. He used the sample problems from the book for the in class problems. I ended up dropping the course because I couldn't get it. I didn't take the first test but talked to some classmates and most of then got 20-30%!!!,0
Prof. Fink is one of the best professors I've had Fordham so far. She really cares about her students and wants everyone to do well. She's super accessible outside of class and even offered a review session for the final exam which was super helpful. She's so passionate about the subject and always keeps her lectures interesting,1
"If you take one of his classes be prepared for class you will be called upon to answer questions.  You will be embarrassed in front of the class. Be prepared to provide supporting data for answers.  There is alot of discussion as part of this course, but I did not find it to be a supportive environment.",0
His teaching method uses the material from the text but he goes beyond and incorporates real world experience into his lectures.,1
so entertaining and she makes the class enjoyable each time. she knows how to keep attention and hold interest.,1
"NOT GOOD. Avoid this professor if possible. Manages to make incredibly interesting material VERY dull. Very nice lady, not a good prof.",0
her quizes are hard now and she marks paper hard too!! and she changes syllabus 3 times...not easy any more.,0
"David is a ""gotcha"" kind of teacher. He often times places items on his tests that he has not gone over in class. He is demeaning and rude when students ask questions during class. Unfortunately, he is the only option for many students who have no choice but to take evening classes. Made easy material difficult. Worst math teacher I have had.",0
I defintetly learned a lot in this class. I want to pursue something amazing and get my name out there. I feel like this class gave me a good beginning view. However the teacher needs to be more specific with her students. Excellent helpful powerpoints but also with the coding/intro to languages I found a lot of students partially struggling.,1
Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Very inefficient and unclear lectures. Don't think he actually knows the material very well himself. Test questions seem easy but it's impossible to predict what he will demand in terms of answers.,0
She doesn't give feedback or let you see what you got wrong on quizzes. This is especially a problem because she has made mistakes grading. She gets annoyed when students ask questions. I basically taught myself using the online homework and book.,0
"Professor Infante is great! World Lit is a really interesting class and he clearly is very passionate about it. He chose some really great texts and always gave insightful lectures. He is very laid back and approachable, enthusiastic about what he teaches, and is a pretty easy grader. Overall it is a very casual atmosphere and highly enjoyable.",1
AWESOME Prof!!,1
don't take this class,0
"I had to battle with him and eventually got tossed aside to the math director b/c Zhang wouldnt admit that he was wrong. I ended up being 2 wks behind b/c he didn't post the WebCT correctly. Self-teach with only your classmates to help you;his plan I think b/c he wants to give you a partic. grade. Tests r hard, but passable. No extra study games.",0
Worst professor I have ever had. Thank god I never have to take this class again.,0
She was very inspiring and it was a pleasure hearing her speak everyday in class!,1
"Dr. Tavss has a special place in my heart. He loves chemistry as much as he loves teaching, and will go the extra mile for his students. To do well, read the textbook, his notes, and complete all of his problem packets. Do attend his office hours as well; he is very insightful and has more time to break down the material further.",1
She randomly calls on people and isn't clear with her questions. Biggest issue is she tells you that she's giving a test the day before you have it. Lots of homework that she never checks and doesn't really give credit for - its hard to find incentive for all of the work assigned,0
"If you want to devote your life to math while taking her class, then take her! but otherwise, i would stay away. i was good at algebra and math until i got into her class, she expected her students to go to the homework hotspot everyday if they didnt understand something. Shes a smart person but does not know how to teach. I regret not dropping.",0
Professor Hafey is a great math professor. He is really helpful and won't move on until he knows that everyone is confident with the material. He is very supportive and explains everything clearly.,1
"Terrible prof, very anal retentive about minor issues. Goes through content too fast then wastes time talking about her son. She missed a class due to personal reasons and rescheduled the class on a Friday during a time where others may have had classes. And then she refused to post the notes of that class online. Take with someone else if you can",0
She teaches class like a middle school teacher.,0
Beyond the best. He is an amazing human being as well as an amazing teacher. I honestly feel blessed to have been lucky enough to accidentally been enrolled in his class. And I am not religious at all.,1
"Professor Hulsey really wants you to succeed, but the class sessions didn't help too much. Her lectures didn't tend to help me. Review the learnsmarts and practice questions before tests, and you'll be fine. She is very accessible outside of class and will be happy to meet with you.",1
"Professor Mustard's downfall is that he is an EXCELLENT biologist. Sadly, being a biologist is extremely different than being a biology professor. He lacks the ability to relate to students, and refuses to acknowledged that we are in this class because-newsflash-we don't know the material. 0/10 do not reccommed. Ruined my 4.0",0
"i absolutely adore professor ferguson. i had her my freshman year and every semester i tried to take her again but there were always conflicts �� super interesting subject matter, and she is really nice and understanding. keep up with the work and this class will be easy but if you fall behind on reading it can be hard. also she brought her dog.",1
Dave Orso Rocks! Very easy instructor. Hes younger so he relates to students. His lectures are very interesting and very helpful. He knows his stuff! I highly Recommend him!!!,1
10/10 take her! she was amazing and by far my favorite teacher ever. Show up to class and put in effort and you shouldn't have a problem getting an A.,1
"Mrs. Myers is committed to seeing her students succeed! She is happy to answer anyone's questions in class & gives plenty of reminders about MyMathLab HW and Quizzes. She is energetic about math, often nerding out over the cool higher-math stuff we ""don't get to learn"". Willing to chat after class, & VERY responsive to email. Generous EC on tests.",1
"Bob is an amazing professor. His passion for writing shines through his lectures, which makes class very entertaining. He's a professor who truly cares about his students and the uniqueness of each student's writing. I had him for W301 and it was easily my favorite class in college. If you love writing, you'll love his class. Guaranteed.",1
Avoid at all costs. For context I am in the honors program and was a straight A student. Ive had hard profs and classes before. But she is a gpa crusher. She doesnt care about any student. Terrible teacher. Wont learn and will be punished for it. Avoid this professor,0
"poor presentation skills, and very less techniques covered in this course, but you can get A easily.. if you want to do some practical projects and find a job related to what you learn from this course, you should rethink about it. Don't waste time on his course, better take online course to learn more.",0
"First and foremost, it takes months to have assignments graded.  You'll think you understand everything in class only to have quite a surprise after tests.  Not always approachable or accessible.  Overall I was disappointed with Shelome.",0
"One of the best profs out there! Gandy is really funny and class is super interesting. All notes for tests will be on slides, only in the class. If you show up and at least get the notes, read them the night before, you will pass! He does have extra credit essays to write, but they're long. IF YOU LISTEN IN CLASS AND LEGIT STUDY, THEN AN EASY A+ :)",1
She is really sweet and really helps when it comes to giving feedback on drafts. She gives a clear criteria on what she wants in her papers. Really tries to make sure you do your best in her class. She listens to what you have to say during discussions. The only downside is that she gives a lot of hw but I would definitely take again.,1
"Overall, Prof. Ehinger is a great prof. I took her at FSU and the exams are fairly straight forward. If you fully understand all the HW and quizzes then you should do fine on the exams. Don't be afraid to reach out to her as she is always looking to help her students.",1
"Short story, long suffering. We maintained good relationship until the last. Surprisingly, she filed me to the conduct center on the last day of the school without informing me what made her think a work I spent hours of working was not mine. Yes, she violated the rules. She ruined my good moods for 3 months until righteousness came.",1
"If you're going to ask us to supply you with stamps and envelopes as a pre-requisite to passing your course then for God sakes man, at least mail us the darn final exams sooner than 4 months after they were initially turned in.  Seriously, get it together dude.",0
Prof Neff. is the best he is such an appreciative grader and is literally the GOAT. He is sooo nice and caring and really wants us to learn. The only homework is index cards reflecting on the reading and a midterm paper and final presentation. I can not stress this enough - NICEST/FUNNIEST/MY FAV professor.,1
"classes are all lecture style but he's funny and kind of out of it. 2 midterms and one final, all multiple choice which sucks because each question on the final is basically 1 percent of your grade. homework is online and super easy. he does cold call every class though so be prepared to get called on",1
"Let's start with the fact that he teaches from his own book that he wrote. His presentations were stale and boring and hard to understand, he is also very careless of job oblogations, especially law enforcement. I had to use the tutoring season and I was told by them that he doesn't teach statistics the correct way. Find a different teacher!",0
I LOVE this man. I go to his office (he's also my advisor) just to talk to him and end up spending way too long there. Not only is he helpful but he also is such a fascinating lecturer. He can show you the other side of any issue. Highly recommended!,1
She was very helpful. I learned how to swim because of her ,1
extremely tough grader. on all assignments I didn't get any higher then a 70% I highly recommended avoiding her class. She takes forever to grade assignments i turned in 3 assignments and she took the entire quarter to grade all of them and took 3 hrs to grade my final.,0
"He is alright.    Nothing great, offers a lot of information that can benefit you  For me it was like a review on stuff I already knew",1
He is not a good professor if you take him for an online course. Also doesn't provide good feedback. If he has an issue with your writing instead of letting you know with the first few weeks so you can correct it and still pass the course he waits till the end so you end up failing. Worst professor I have ever had is no help what so ever.,0
"Class is disappointing. Supposed to be a translation class, but time is mostly spent on grammar and vocab. We have to figure it out mostly on our own. She often starts class by yelling at everyone over things that annoy her. Required story book we all purchased has never been opened. No real instruction on translation techniques.",0
"She did not structure her 225 class very well. She is a fine lecturer but when it came to preparing for her exams, she didn't give us any practice material other than just studying the homework assignments for the first 2 exams. As a result, many students were having a hard time with the exams. She even threw some questions that weren't on the HW.",0
"All lectures are online as PowerPoints & content is straight from the book. Preferred to just read the book rather than sit through lecture. Does give extra credit for attending events & writing one page summary. Soft speaker so, if you want to hear lectures clearly, sit in first two rows.",1
"All we did was write 4 reflection papers. He is extremely unclear and unorganized. He didnt even upload the syllabus or readings until the 3rd week of the semester and the paper was due that next week. Honestly, an easy class as long as you just write the paper. You dont even need to do the readings as long as you can answer the prompt.",0
"Tags i wish i could add but ran out of tags: LECTURE HEAVY, caring, kind, passionate, understanding, INSPIRATIONAL!! Falcon was an amazing professor. He makes sure you understand the material. He genuinely cares about his students and is there for them no matter what. He assigns a crap ton of readings that can be boring, but his lectures are great.",1
"Although Professor Butowsky does not seem very interested in the efforts of his students, he pays very close attention to the students that show interest. If you do the work, it will pay off. Take the time to speak to him! There is a lot of reading and videos, but this class is possible to pass even if you don't do them. He's honestly not that bad.",1
"I had her for lab, I did not learn anything from her. If i did not have an amazing lecture teacher i wouldn't of passed BI121. lectures are all linked to personal stories from her life and job of being a nurse. Took test from different professors, so wasn't diligent on grades. Says spelling doesn't matter but will take points away if spelled wrong",0
"So. I've been in Ryerson for 2 years and she is the only prof that I despise as a Lecturer. She starts off with the phrase the establishes her bias and privilege as a 'white-privileged, cis-gendered, left-leaning' PhD person and keeps going. Lectures are the worst stereotype of University lectures; I spend too long not knowing what she teaches us.",0
"Lori was a mess of a professor. Rude, arrogant, and all over the place quite honestly. The class taught themselves each chapter every week and she completely could care less about the stuff being taught. As a matter of fact - she never taught once. Also, twice a week meeting class only met once a week, forcing tighter deadlines.",0
"Two weeks in and already the best class I have had dealing with advertising (of the three I have had).  Not too much reading, but the projects look like thy will be a lot of work.",1
"Very responsive , and she doesn't try to make the class harder than it is.",1
The Best. Period. He makes a subject that to most people would be dreadful very fun! He lightens up the mood with jokes and goes over exactly what will be on the test. He provides study materials and hints. I definitely recommend Baumgartner. He will keep you interested throughout the entire 2 hours.,1
She's horrible!!,0
Good class to take for an elective if you want to work with children! Very caring for her students and you learn a lot in the class but it is fun!,1
"She is an amazing teacher; very helpful and caring.  Her class is not hard at all if you just study her notes and her review sheets.  In this class there is only a midterm, final, and a project.  Not bad at all, I recommend her.",1
"When I took this class years ago I hated it and didn't understand anything in the class. Now that I look back on it he had the right idea of covering the material he did. He is a nice guy if you talk to him, just can't explain things well. I passed the CPA exam and this class helped make studying for the exam a little easier. I have had worse.",1
"He did not read from the book at all in my class. Yes he uses powerpoint, which I found very helpful. The fact is he cannot make this subject as simple as some people would like it to be. Almost half of my class dropped, but that seems typical for HACC! All of the adults stayed.",1
"Kristi isn't clear with what she wants for the projects. Expects us to do a lot of things, but can't even catch up herself? It's past Christmas and still isn't done grading all of the assignments. Very little engagement with the class. Disappointing.",0
Awful professor. His lectures make no sense and he is always off topic. Do not take this class if you can help it.,0
Do NOT take this professor. He doesn't input any grades. He expects you to learn everything yourself and come to class with questions. He just throws up so problems on the board and solves them and goes over the powerpoint really quickly.,0
I definitely recommend mr. Hammond best teacher i've had,1
general physics 1 and 2. hard but he scales it so everyone does okay by the end. could be more clear - lectures can be boring. do the study guide problems before exams and try to remember concepts. final was insanely hard but he scaled it so it worked itself out.,0
"Had to get a tutor because this professor is dry, boring and scattered. Gives lots of homework and quizzes which is great for learning- except he gives one or two question quizzes where the questions are much more difficult than anything he went over. He changes his weights at the end of the semester - I went from a b+ to a C. Horrible",0
"Fairly easy grader on assignments, test maybe only 25 multiple choice but they are not easy. Doesn't teach at 101 level, he thinks you are already a master in geography. Can easily pass with a C and never attend class because he doesn't take attendance.",1
"i cant stand her! worst professor ever, i would NOT recommend! she pics a few ""favorites"" but stay away from her! your GPA will thank you!",0
"Hands-down the worst professor I have ever had. He rambles every class, never following the syllabus. He is a really tough grader and is unwilling to discuss his grading techniques/reasons for giving you the grade he gives. If attendance wasnt absolutely mandatory I would never go because he is very disrespectful and talks down to students.",0
"He is a good professor, just a really easy class. The lectures are kind of hard to take notes on, but if you pay attention you'll be fine.",1
Great teacher who keeps the class entertained while helping them remember the material. Gives opportunity to earn extra credit. Study and you will pass! Tests can be hard only if you dont study! I would definitely recommend her!,1
"Swartz is very arrogant. Terrible professor, my friend had Dr. Liddell and said she was a better teacher. Avoid at all costs",0
Professor Wheeler is a very knowledgeable and has a lot of great things to say. I really enjoyed her class and did well. The only issue I had was a large amount of reading she assigned and tested.,1
"Rebecca is hands down the best instructor at COCC. She knows what it takes for a student to actually learn the information from the course, and she teaches in a way that is engaging, contemporary, and fun. She makes it seem like we're all learning together and like we could all just be friends and have conversations about sociology. Take her class!",1
Very easy going,1
I did not like this teacher he is very boring and will not go on until someone answers a question in class. His tests are easy and gives you what to study. He never takes role but goes over alot in class and sometime has assignments due at the end. He gave a lot of extra credit opps. but he is a nice professor. He can be an easy A!,0
"I really enjoyed her class. She's a younger professor, but she is very respected. She seems intimidating at first, but she is very nice and loves one-on-one time, so take advantage of her office hours. Attendance matters. She gives quizzes every class, so read your material and show up. She will mark up your paper, but she doesn't grade too tough.",1
"Great teacher, she does her best to make sure you understand the material in the easiest way possible. You should definitely take her classes.",1
"Precalculus is a ridiculously hard class so do yourself a favor and take it with Ryburn. She is so nice and always willing to work with you. She gives great feedback and actually cares about her students passing, no that doesn't mean its an easy A so be prepared to put in work!",1
My adviser would not let me drop the class. All he did was rant about conspiracies and the government. He briefly went over material before announcing that we had a test on it the next class. I love music and he made me hate the class. I was extremely disappointed that he gets paid to not teach.,0
Too many non-textbook books to read all at once. Basically impossible to truly learn when having to read numerous books and other materials with such a heavy load within each week.,0
"A kind, knowledgeable, phenomenal teacher.  I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious, engaging, and intelligent.  This class was so far from my major, and yet I enjoyed class everyday.  Study, its astronomy.  But Looney is fantastic.",1
Jane's great. She really loves what she teaches. Lectures are almost exactly like reading the chapter so you could either go to class or read. Her review sessions are very helpful.,1
"Good professor overall, really knows her stuff. She is funny but stern. Get ready to read a lot of articles, the tests are mainly based off all the articles she assigns. The test questions are very difficult, she asks for very specific things. She allowed our class to have an open computer exams since there were so many articles.",1
LOVED him. He is awesome he just wants his students to succeed. I love him and have taken all my classes through him. Way to be the BEST trower!,1
"Tests you over rote memorization of schematics. Schematics are very detailed. You talk about a horrible approach to teaching. Why does it matter if I can remember the exact location of a capacitor if I can tell you exactly how the circuit functions. Essentially, he is the teacher that dissuades you from becoming a teacher. Nice guy though.",0
Shields is laid back and his classes are disscusion heavy. His teaching won't be from a textbook but from real world examples of projects he or someone he knows worked on. The industry guests that he invites to speak are top-notch and confirmed to me that I had picked the right school.,1
"Waxler is a very smart man and gives good lectures, but that's it. He is very old fashioned in his teaching style and doesn't really engage with anyone in class. I went to ask for help with him once and it felt like an interrogation. Make sure you don't get sick or miss a class ever.",0
"Good teacher, very approachable! Her tests were tough, but if you do the work they all will turn out A-ok!",1
"The best part of this class is when it's over. This class is almost too fun. He uses puppets, imaginary competitive juggling, log throwing, and mustache growing to show how invisible neutrinos are the real cause of his headaches. He also once arm wrestled a bear to raise funds for cancer. He is truly too good to be a chem 101 teacher.",0
"Oyamont, I know you're reading this. The only complaint I have for your class is that your lectures BARLEY cover the concepts on your study guide. I feel like this class should be offered as a hybrid class since half the time I was looking up studies on the internet more than in your lectures/my notes. Class is okay but very dull. Easy if you try.",1
"Her grading is REALLY critical and she will not try to clear up the homework, and will tell you to just read the ""instructions"". I also felt I was being treated as if I was still in middle school. Wouldn't recommend this class.",0
"This class is lecture heavy and a lot of notes. He did provide the book however, so its not necessary to acquire a book although I did. The quizzes are all online if you dont know the answers to them, but I strongly advise you read the chapters are there are discussion boards. The final exam was all on Quizlet and it was open note. Easy A.",1
UT doesn't do A+ so really I just got an A. The professor expects you to know a lot of pre requisite work and I did. I didn't have to go to office hours or any sort of tutoring for help. He did end up dropping an exam even though he said he wouldn't. DON'T skip lecture or discussion.,1
"Prof. Webb is so obsessed with his lectures, which renders them boring, irritating and ill-informative. He takes his job way too seriously for a GenEd!3 exams (essay portions) 3 essays, a film review, a presentation, a film every week that you must watch to participate in class, which accounts for 5% of your grade. I do not recommend him at all.",0
DO NOT TAKE. There are 2 quizzes every class on the reading which was homework and the lecture he gave to make sure you were paying attention. Both quizzes and all of the exams are online tho with is a plus. I had a C all semester but the class did so bad he had to scale everyones grades at the end so I finished with an A.,0
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I took the online class. There is an experiential paper you have to write in the end, plus other papers! I like how he has a recorded audio session available for you to listen to. Remember your quizzes because they will be on your exams. Take advantage of the extra credit he offers.",1
"I absolutely LOVE Dr. B.  He makes class so fun! Take notes, and fill out the study guide you will make an A! You will not find a better teacher. I recently transferred from a larger school and my teacher's did not even compare to him. So, don't take him; because no one will live up to his style of teaching. Anyway I digress, he is great!!!",1
"Dr. Richards is scary at first but once you get to know her, you will love her. She is super high energy and knows everything there is to know about books. She has a good sense of humor and is always willing to help you if you ask her. She is strict about things like grammar but overall a great professor.",1
"he is really a terrible professor. His class is boring but not very difficult. However, he won't give your marks in the exam for some ridiculous reasons.",0
"Dr. Beck is amazing, she is always willing to help and answer questions.  She will try everything to help her students achieve.",1
She is very unorganized and unclear.,0
"If you come in to this class thinking its going to be an easy A, then you won't like it. But its college and there comes a time when you classes won't be so easy. Do the work, come to class, participate, and you do fine. She talks a lot, but its to benefit her students. Overall i think anyone is capable of passing, and do well in this class.",1
Amazing,1
"Lectures are very brief you will need to read to pass the exams. Group projects are no joke especially the 2nd and 3rd. Very kind and straight forward prof. she really wants groups to communicate literally, so just do it. You will really learn how to present if you have problems presenting. In class activities are super fun like the games.",1
If you can learn on your own I'd recommend her otherwise if you need a walk through of the information in order to learn find another professor.,0
No email response ever. Terrible feedback. Terrible grading. Quiz questions make no sense and neither do the writing assignments. Very poor communication.,0
"RJ was the bomb! He made this class seem like a breeze compared to what I've heard of the other sections. 7 online quizzes, and 4 noncumulative exams make up your entire grade. His study guides/powerpoints cover everything that will be on the exam, and he offers extra credit for every exam. Posts the powerpoints, with the answers, online! Take him",1
"Great prof, the course was structured well and the MCQ exams were fair if you studied for them. His lectures summarized the content well and were a useful starting point for the chapter.",1
Very interesting class. Watch movies and turn in a weekly paper. Easy A if you're looking for an elective. No text book required.,1
"Take this class and you'll be sorry. He pulls up the book online, throws it up on the projector, and reads directly out of it for the whole class period. While he's doing that he explains how the book is meant for mathematicians, not students. His grading system seems completely random and will give you 0 on a question almost randomly. Do not take.",0
Worst math professor I have had. ,0
"If she likes you, the class will be great. If she doesn't, the class will be hell.",0
"Are you looking for an awesome English professor? well look no further because you have found her. Mrs. Jessica Zbeida is my favorite college professor! You have a total of 4 writing assignments. She is very sympathetic and understands that life happens. Show up and pass, that's it. Did I mention that shes awesome?",1
"my suggestion would be to avoid taking this class at all costs. clawson drags lectures on and on, and is a kind of a jerk. there are 6 pop quizzes so while going to class is worse than watching your grandma clip her toenails, it's kind of necessary since you don't know when there will be a quiz. the only upside is not having to take the final.",0
"as long as u go to class and take notes, pay attention, & review the listening a lot before test but super easy",1
He's a really good professor but he's a little confusing at times. He tells you to write what you feel is right but then tells you how he thinks you should've felt. He's not good at explaining stuff so if you're not really into English take him if you want to get by. But if you want to really learn how to write essays no.,0
She makes the class absolute hell if she doesnt like you,0
"The worst teacher I have ever had. I have never studied harder for a course, haven't received above a ""C"" on any test. I have don well on the papers, so that does not add up. Just skip him on the class list, for your own good.",0
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
"Really cool guy, obviously very knowledgeable in many fields, especially those he teaches. Electric personality, holds classroom attention with ease. His lectures are always provocative, sometimes intentionally uncomfortable as he delves into sensitive topics. However, the class was too easy and he had a tendency to ramble is lecture.",1
HORRIBLE. One of THE worst professors I have ever had the misfortune of taking. All she does is read from a PowerPoint. Does not teacher. GOD WILLING TSU will hire another AIS teacher,0
"Very strict with students, but does not help you.  Leaves you hanging in online classes.  Does not grade, correct, answer or help in any way with your education.",0
"Gives six tests, drops your lowest grade and about 50-60% of her tests consists of multiple choice questions. Very nice, and realizes that learing Spanish is a process.",1
Her class is not too hard but not helpful. She is nice but not really fair.,0
"Took her for civic engagement. Great class, and I'm a business major. Not too hard, but you have to listen well in class and take good notes; no need to read the book! Civic engagement is a lot of fun, you get to volunteer at a hospital or other med institution.",1
Be prepared to have Lab and bookwork ready by test date. She does give twothree chapters in one day. Does not review before test. You have to download labwork grades or email but if emailed sometimes you get a zero. ,0
Super nice man. He knows a lot in his area but does not push it on you. He is very sweet and patient. His tests are the only grades you get but you can work in groups and they are take home. Great teacher.,1
"Lots of circular reasoning, and endless babbling with many useless readings.  Terrible class.  Papers are poorly explained and do not tie into class.  Do not take this class!",0
"Just show up and do the work and you will pass. There are a fair amount of in-class group activities, but they are completion credit. There are 3 tests and he drops the lowest one. No homework except studying and one essay with a presentation. Great teacher, I really enjoyed his class.",1
Big exams consisting of lots of terms. Four chapters each exam. READ THE TEXT,0
"always late to class, class starts at its earliest 15min late. slow to go over material and thinks the entire class is incompetent to learn at a normal pace.( mind you there are a couple of idiots in the class that ask ridiculously stupid questions because the can not manage to get their head around the siple subject of vision.",0
"She seemed to be very caring, but was a terrible teacher. We never once actually went through a power point. She would always leave it on the title page and then go talking about her life. Though we never once went over any actual material she still expected us to take the test which proved to be very difficult. Must buy textbook to pass.",0
"She gives a lot of homework, but it's easy to keep your grade up as long as you try! She's also very creative and always makes efforts to keep the class interesting. Khan has her grumpy days like all of us, but really is a nice teacher if you need help. I'd definitely like to take another class with her.",1
"The best teacher, he is the gem of the IM department. Will help you no matter what you need. 10/10 would hug",1
"I took McCartney's US-Russia relations class and It was a heavy workload. However, it was probably the most I have learned from a class while at Towson University. There was a probably an assignment due every few weeks, but it was explained in detail. If you do the assignments and show up to class you should be fine.",1
"Very knowledgeable and helpful, I could immediately tell she was a good professor from her reputation among upperclassmen, her tests only have 20 questions so you will have to do lots of practice problems to do well on them since the homework is usually easier than tests. Definitely recommend ATP for Chem 111.",1
"She's an amazing professor that was nothing like you'd expect from a college professor (in the best possible way!) She has clear ""liberal"" views on feminism as well as social and racial privilege. As far as essays and work, you will get clear and concise feedback on what to change as well as her thoughts and opinions on your work.",1
Weird guy.  Grades hard.  Boring lectures.  Guy's a total slacker.  Avoid if you can.,0
"This is a terrible class. DO NOT take him. He is not clear and makes you read a whole book for approximately 2-3 questions on the test. There are about 4/5 books. He does not care about the students and is rude and oblivious. One question on test is one percent of grade. Do not take, very bad class!",0
"Kind, compassionate and amazing professor. Helps everyone understand the material, which is very difficult in this course. The extra credit helps a lot and is worth doing. Tests are tough and requires lots of prep from the study guides, questions in office hours or email, and taking good notes in class. Overall, tough course but well worth it.",1
"Yeah so if youre a good student, you better be more than that.. he is absolutely brutal on tests and leaves no room for extra credit. Good luck",0
"Everyone here seems to think this teacher is easy, but what they forget to mention is that the tests for each chapter are completely asinine. Asking the most unrelated questions and always using vague questions. If you can take this class with someone else. Or else take like 10 practice tests before the real test, they cover useless material.",1
"Ben is such a fun, quirky guy in his lectures. He cares about his students and just wants to show everyone what the world of Healthcare Ethics is like. He just wants you to learn and tries to make his as lectures engaging and fun as he can. I would recommend taking him if you enjoy dry humor and someone who is passionate about the hce field.",1
"Okay, Professor Gartland is a sweet lady but has to be the worst professor at YSU. She rambles about absolutely nothing for an hour and 15 minutes. Often times I found myself in disbelief. A lot of students will just get up and walk out of her class because it is a complete waste of time. Extremely easy A. The questions on the exam are a joke.",0
"Harland is hands down the best instructor at the u of m. He gives great homework, lectures, and tests are quite fair. Always responds to emails promptly and with detail. It is calculus so expect to work for it, but you can easily finish with an good mark with a bit of effort. I highly recommend this instructor.",1
"Judith Shapiro is a wonderful human being. By far my favorite teacher last semester. She's so interesting, like one day she dropped that she did sword dancing. Such a cool teacher. She will expect you to do your reading and participate but personally I think thats what made her such a good teacher.",1
"I thought she was awesome. She's hilarious, has been teaching for multiple years, and she has actual experience in her field in the real world. Make sure to attend every class because if you miss one you may struggle to get back. You're supposed to read the textbook but as long as you are their for notes in class, you'll be fine. Exams aren't hard.",1
Melanie is a teacher who cares about her students her lectures are a bit boring but the slides are very explanatory. Final was easy but REALLY long with 100 multiple choice  worth 50% and 7 LONG answers worth the other 50%.,1
"The class material is very interesting and it would have been amazing to learn about if there was a competent teacher. Did not receive a single grade the entire semester and the only thing we received was a reading schedule. There were supposed to be lectures each week, but after 6 weeks in he stopped posting any sort of lectures.",0
"Prof. Abdo is THE best. If you want to learn she is the person to go to. Her class is not easy but she is extremely helpful. For those who believe the only A is in her last name, it is not.",1
"He gives 300 question study guides for a 50 question test and you basically have to memorize every single question. Three exams and one final note test. The class is structured very weird, lectures and then go home and teach yourself the material from the textbook. I should have dropped this class when I had a chance.",0
"I loved this class. Animation is not the easiest thing in the world to master in one semester, but this was a great intro class and I can't wait to take another advanced class with this instructor.",1
"The prior rating is not true. Prof. Is caring and if she doesnt explain is cuz she want us to be pro active between classmates. I honestly have to say that I probably not pass her class but was my fault for missing so many homeworks to turned in. If I have to take this class again I will do it with her. Shes very patient, helpful and fair. ��",1
"She has a lot of personal experience under her belt. However, her grading is harsh, and her manner in class was very uncomfortable. For her I'm sure it feels like impassioned political discourse, but it comes off as mean and belittling. Unclear assignment criteria. Interesting but narrow range of topics discussed. Needs major changes to class model",0
The professor was okayish. He is not a harsh grader or rude. The only problem with this course is how he gives out the projects. The projects are difficult to understand and very hard to accomplish. He talks a long time giving feedback to people who need papers to get signed.,1
This professor is TERRIBLE.  It's one of those classes where you have to teach yourself.  The class is unorganized & lectures are extremely boring.  Oh and don't plan on getting an A+ in this class....I had a 98% and he only gave me an A.  I emailed him about it and he said that he only gives out A+'s to students who get 100% or more in his class.,0
"I have always received an A in every math class I have ever taken. I love math but this professor nearly ruined it for me. Every class is a lecture with note taking but ALL OF THE NOTES ARE WORDS, NO MATH PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. He made something simple seem extremely confusing and he YELLED LOUDLY at us because of it. I didn't go back. Disrespectful!",0
I would take one of his classes again in a heartbeat if it pertained to my major. His lectures are easy to listen to because of how funny he is. I had trouble with the multiple choices on tests sometimes but always did well on the essay portion. Hardly any homework- just reading articles from time to time. Definitely a class for the logic-minded.,1
"I have heard goo things about this professor, but please DO NOT TAKE if you are taking him online. He has no clue how to run and online class and we never meet. We doesn't add any assignment to the D2L calendar, so its a fun game of guess when the next assignment is due, at to top it off he take of 50 POINTS for one day late.",0
I got an A on the midterm paper and blackboard says that i have more than 100% on every quiz but I was still given a B in the class. I pretty sure she is out to get me. Not to metion she likesto push her politics on the class.,0
"She is very quick to get smart with you.  Her work doesnt make sense, she expects things that are sooooo stupid to be crystal clear. if you leave class early, she takes off points. No book....cant enter class.  its like high school...even worse, middle school.",0
"She was terrible! She was inconsistent, and was never focused. She would tell some nonsense story for half of the class. Also, she assigned meaningless homework assignments that were subject to change the day it was due. I disliked this class immensely.",0
The prof was amazing. He was quick about reminding everyone of grades and assignments due very frequently. He responded to your progress in class and how you were doing. Take him for this class and make sure to do any extra credit because it helps your grade a lot and the tests are moderately difficult.,1
She tries to be caring and upfront but her teaching style is not the best. I've learned more from google and youtube videos than from her own lecture videos/discussions. She may make students feel as if they are not trying hard enough even when they may be putting all their time and effort into her class. Quizzes/exams for lab are never returned.,0
"Assignments are terrible, book is horrible, exams are, complicated. This class was heavily reliant on lots and lots and lots of reading and researching. It doesn't seem like much thought went into the assignments. I hate to rate it this way because I chose this class because I only saw good things about her, but for whatever reason the coursesucked",0
"This is the worse professor I've had, extremely rude. I emailed him to clarify information, his first response was to read the description. I sent him another email because I was still confused. He responded extremely rude and angrily, making me feel like my only choice was to drop the class. Take a different class if you like to ask questions.",0
"Arguably the best professor at Western State.  He is very clear, and it is almost impossible to go through his class without ending up understanding the law.",1
"Dr. Kerber's lectures were hard to follow as she just spewed random facts and she DOES NOT post any lecture slides. Her tests made you recall random, minute details that she mentioned once in one of her unorganized lectures. This course was way harder than the other first year English courses I have taken. Tons of material, too much to remember.",0
"He likes to rant and go off on tangents.  Homeworks are rough, tests are like long homeworks.  I find him annoying, but at the same time he's like a hamster at the front of the class; I can't take him seriously.",1
"Great Professor. Really does care about his students and will go above and beyond to make sure the material is understood - all you have to do is ask. He always tried to throw in a joke or two which, even though they're not always the best, still lightens up the class. Great guy to have a talk with in and out of the classroom.",1
"Hands down, one of the most inspirational teachers I've ever had! She truly cares about her students and helps them succeed. Her lectures are highly engaging, which encourages genuine student participation. Even if you're shy or have an adverse view, her class is a safe space that welcomes students to express themselves without judgment. TAKE HER!",1
"Everything week to week was the same so you can always know what to expect. Lots of reading but the work is easy if you actually do it.  The instructor however was not understanding at all. I had a few sudden unexpected things happen in my life (newborn in NICU, step-father died ) and he had no leniency and wouldn't even offer me a few extra days.",1
"doesn't post notes so attending is mandatory. tests are straightforward, and does test on stuff from the textbook. marks VERY hard on the assignments. also my friend and I both had mistakes with our final grades and we didn't know it (b/c she doesn't give back grades) until we emailed her for mark breakdowns and figured it out ourselves. >:(",0
Constant lecture.  Does not ask questions.  Exams questions are very specific and its seems like hes trying to trick you.  Nice but not helpful when I stayed after class 3 times.,0
"I took field ecology and intro-ecology with Eric. If you want to do get a good grade in his courses you need to do your work the right way. If you do half-arsed work it will show in your grades. Follow his directions, ask questions, and you can get an A.",1
"Professor Cowherd, while well published and highly regarded in the eyes of faculty and the institute itself, is fundamentally lacking in teaching ability. His single assignment type and grading are overwhelmingly subjective and his elitist and arrogant personality make for an underwhelming and frustrating classroom environment. WILL NOT TAKE AGAIN.",0
This prof made me dislike Economics... lecture is extremely boring.,0
"This professor is kind. Although the assignments are more, you have any problems with the study, and she will help you. as long as you do your jobs, this course will get good grades.",1
"Raul is a great instructor. He is involved in the class and encourages you to do better, and corrects your form if needed. He taught us how to use the weight lifting machines, as well as different free-weight lifting techniques and core exercises. I would recommend taking a class with Raul!",1
"He doesn't teach the material; he expects you to learn on your own. Wastes valuable class time telling personal stories having nothing to do with the subject, wasting my money. Need I say more?",0
"She gets real snippy and definitely has favorites. She is impatient and very negative. Amber definitely Does have favorites. Some people she jokes and laughs with, others she treats like dirt. It never ceases to amaze me how diff she'll treat one person from the next. She treated me real unpleasant, and some others too. But some poeple she loves.",0
"Professor Campbell seems like a nice person, but her grading is way too tough and rigid. She has one specific way of looking at things and grading, and she doesn't really appreciate or accept alternative ways of thinking. I've had her for a number of courses, and she assigns a lot of essays that are just regurgitation of lectures and the text.",0
"Nearing complained in her retort that ""there's always a few students that complain and she has an exemplary record"". Typical cop out! Doesn't matter, she needs to look in the mirror at herself and realize how cold she is to students. She also needs an ego check very badly. Being a snob does NOT make for a great teacher! Reality check honey!",0
"Lee was one of the greatest professors I've ever had. His lectures were always interesting and he was one of the most kind, caring, and optimistic people I've ever met. He genuinely cared about all of his students and he made sure we always knew that he had hope for us and that we were going to save the world. It was an easy A, but I learned a lot.",1
"Great, Great Teacher. The Comp sci dept is the best. KC is easy going and fun to be with. sometimes she gets a little over the top but you leard to deal with it. She loves everybody and will take walk ins anytime of the day in her office.",1
"This professor's mind is on another planet. She's constantly talking about things that have nothing to do with the course, uses a monotone voice the entire time, and makes you read material that you never use in the class, EVER. The assignments are easy but she doesn't even know what she's assigning or when it's due half of the time",0
This class only had one test and one major project. She was super caring and made students feel like their opinions mattered. This class is worth taking.,1
"I do not why MAE dept kept Mook in this department. He basically refuse to provide bare minimum of the content of the course. On top that Mae 340 is a diffcult course. He literally recorded audio for this calculation heavy courses. It is a calculation heavy course, we need to see the math/calculation or order to understand the concepts.",0
"I really wanted to enjoy this class because of the subject, but Professor Sewell makes it hard to. I've taken more academically rigorous classes, yet this professor has the harshest standards of grading I've witnessed so far. She does give instructions, but even when you try to adhere to her standards, it's not good enough. Regret signing up.",0
"I tried to give him a chance throughout the year and not be mean on this website but he is  the worst professors i have taken my entire 3 years in college...... WAY to much work, unrealistic expectations for class, and in my opinion is your students are consistently failing your test and you have to cure them by 30 plus % then something is wrong!  ",0
awful professor . she is not clear at explanation that was my fault I didn't rate that whatever her name is .guys is not because I am mad. it is because that truth don't take her otherwise you going to regret this or the rest of your life,0
"I enjoyed this class with Trevor. I wouldn't say ""speech"" is my favorite class but he made it fun. Chill dude. Take him if you can. Graded on what you would expect. Various speeches, critiques, and participation.",1
"Ins. Warden is a kind woman and her lectures aren't bad. I only go to class to be counted for attendance and in-class assignments. She doesn't give many test or papers, just one long paper. The class is not hard, you just have to do your homework and pay attention to what you write. Don't make stupid mistakes and she will help you if you ask.",1
"This class was great. We met twice a week for an hour and 15 minutes or so. He give a lot of essays, which he covers in the syllabus. He goes over every essay in a slideshow with what and what not to do. He really cares about his students and will help them. He plays videos either to enforce his lesson or just for fun and to entertain. I recommend.",1
I had Oksana for a community engagement class and she was OK. She didn't explain things very well and she never emailed us the readings by the time she said she would. There were no tests but there were a lot of outside of class things we had to do.,0
" Her agenda is to ""defend"" agriculture. With all of the inefficiencies in agriculture right now it was heart breaking  to see a PhD  professor dance around the problems we face with pollution and resistance. We spent absolutely no time trying to look at new solutions but focus on how laypeople give ag a bad name. It made me uncomfortable and sad.  ",1
"i do not like him at all. he seems so full of himself. he is not understanding, yet everyone understands him and respects him. he has this attitude i dont like. it's a very hard class, confusing, impossible to catch up. i studied so much for so many hourse and guess what his test question was? Who is the author of the textbook?",0
"really good teacher, challenging assignments, you learn a lot, and he's so knowledgeable.",1
Professor Thompson will stand in the front of the class and brag that students averages 66 on his tests. Ive never seen anybody be so proud of their own failure before. his tests have nothing to do with what he is teaching. This is like an SNL skit of an actual microbiology class. Except no one is laughing. Very sad to witness and pay for.,0
"This class was fairly easy. There is ALOT of reading, a 10 question quiz for every chapter. Discussion posts (3 paragraph essay) for every unit. Midterm was quiz questions. Final was a little bit more difficult than the midterm. There was a documentary project that was pretty easy. Overall an easy A if you do the work.",1
No interest in teaching and not accessible to students . His exam questions will be having no relation to his lecture or practice exams.,0
TOO MUCH PAPERS! This class is definitely not an easy A if you are not good at writing. I totally regret taking this class.,1
"Unless you are majoring in philosophy, it is highly suggestive to not take this course. For a gen. ed req, the work is overpowering as well as difficult. Not everyone could grasp such concepts so easily, and she is very critical with her grading. Tries too hard to seem like a good prof. when half the class is complaining that they are failing. Sad.",0
Suggs is awesome and the class is great. A lot of people will probably only say that because it's easy but the content itself is really interesting and I learned a lot about a topic that I didn't think I would enjoy. I didn't need to take the class but I'm really glad I took it anyway. This is one of the few classes at JMU that I'll miss.,1
"Took him for the 4 week session. Lectures can be heavy. Their is a practice exam, you must turn it in for points (majority of it is word for word, multiple choice on the actual exam). Labs are easy and somewhat fun. Also, lab exams (easy). Book was not needed. He was pretty chill. I recommend him if you need to take Bio 3.",1
"No matter who you take for Bio 111, it will be a VERY difficult class and you still most likely struggle. HOWEVER, Hollis is a great dude. Don't be intimidated, go to his office hours, he is very helpful/honest. He got me through this course and is honestly a pretty funny guy. Take notes on his specific lecture examples they'll be on the exams",1
"Shimizu is ok. Her lectures are scattered and sometimes incoherent, but she's definitely passionate about what she's saying. The grade consists of 2 papers, 1 essay final, and some pop quizzes. She is very strict about what the papers needs to be like, but I found that made the papers easier since you knew exactly what she was looking for.",1
Great Professor. As long as you do the reading and re-read slides you can pass the class with a good grade. Discussions are a key part of the curriculum. Took it during summer and therefore it was very reading intensive. Clicker questions about the readings. Just do what youre suppose to to and youll be fine. Is lenient with attendance.,1
"First of all, takes 2 months to put in grades. Second, does not highlight what he is grading on and makes you down 10-20 points. Third, if you disagree with his opinion you are marked down. Forth, final grades are currently due in less than 10 hours and I still have several blanks in grade book. He does not answer emails. AWFUL CLASS.",0
"I found the professor very caring about her students. As for the information, there is lots of it, and the tests were hard. However, professor has been very fair in grading and also has given extra credit to help out. I find her very fair, and the class is very interesting.",1
Does anyone happen to know if Professor Abrams is still teaching here at Hofstra??? Did he retire or move to another school?,1
"He is a nice guy, a great lecturer, gives great feedbacks during office hours. He is a tough grader, and I cannot stress how tough he grades on exams. He nitpicks solutions that are not identical to his, and he does not give partial credit. If you're looking to learn, he's the man. If you're looking to pass, try another professor.",0
"Funny, awkward guy. Lectures are very boring (sorry Wes), but he's nice and very helpful. Participation isn't a big deal, but make sure to show up often... there are in-class assignments on random days. Attend the group conferences and turn in essays on time.",1
"will teach yourself, hates to break prob down, shell be annoyed but be sure to ask all the questions, vague teaching, shes lazy & uses a math app for hw & grading & because of this she wont know how a student is doing on their own, the midterm/final is in class & must show work this is when shell know if u can work problem but still wont care",0
Too much emphasis on group projects. Unclear presentations. Power point after power point.,0
"This teacher is the worst accounting teacher in the US.  He is a very nice man, but his teaching skills are horrible.  All of his lessons are done in powerpoint.  He does take the time to explain anything.  He could care less if you learn anything.  I took this class with 2 other friends in order to pass it.  We got an A, but didnt learn anything.",0
"This guy can barely speak English, he zooms through chapters expecting you to know the material and constantly gets his own math wrong. I can barely stand this class. DO NO TAKE HIS CLASS. Expect a lot of homework and it's best if you know the subject already.",0
"He is a pretty good prof. He's funny and breaks the content down well. I've taken two accounting courses so far, and he was my prof for the first one. My second prof was horrible and really made me appreciate how well Haroon taught. The midterm was fair, not too hard. But the final was really difficult. Would still recommend him though.",1
"I had him just last semester, if I'm correct, all except one person in the class failed due to him going off topic and being very vague when it comes to explanations.",0
Absolutely terrible at explaining things and talks too low to be heard unless you're in the front row. Lectures are very rambly. Didn't seem very confident about anything he was teaching. Would not take again.,0
Douglas was not much help to me.,0
"I had Professor Steiner in my first semester of college (Fall 2019.) She has by far been the BEST math teacher or professor I've had this far. She is available all the time, being in her class you can truly tell that she genuinely wants her students to learn and succeed. I actually miss going to her class. I'm confident in my math skills now.",1
"One of my favorite teachers ever. I took his night class, and he loved it. it was a 7-10pm class and never got bored or tired He was always excited to be there, and was very helpful. There was a lot of work though always h/w on blackboard, which is crucial for an A, you get to have peers read your stuff too. great class, got an A+. TAKE HIM:)",1
"This class and her coursework is a complete joke. Assigns redundant papers and essays on corny poetry. Does not let you pick your own material to write about. Picks annoying due dates out of thin air. It's an online class, but you may have something due on a tuesday, wednesday, etc. Gives a boatload of easy work, which is annoying. Spare yourself.",0
"Dr. Houston is not a good choice. You have to write EXCELLENT papers to get good grades. I had papers critique by professors and adults and till received a ""C"" on it. She doesn't seem like she wants to help and majority of the class  left after the 3 month of school!! DO NOT take her because she can make you life miserable and it is not worth it!",0
I would absolutely take this class with Hassey again. He is a great professor and really cares that the students get it. He always says grades don't mean anything to him and I'm pretty sure most people got an A in the class. He's so funny and makes the class very interesting and it is also really helpful for any business student!,1
"It's been a real pleasure having Mr. Hayes as my instructor, We can cover daily news, life problems,and he still brings us back to the topic at hand. He knows how to tie in everything",1
"ENG120 is going to be a lot of work no matter who you take it with but she will make it painless, fun, and enjoyable. I've never loved English so much.",1
test are hard. he takes forever to grade and emails you back after a century has passed. very irritating. doesn't have notes for the class or power points for online class. would not take him again.,0
"He doesn't curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution",0
I love Allen. He is so passionate about helping other people and I really admire that. He's also very understanding. Get ready to help him help others.,1
Shes not helpful when you go into her office or ask for help during work time during class. The beginning of the semester seemed like a lot of busy work which didn't help at all. I don't recommend taking her because she's not helpful and her lecture days are just her rambling on about useless information. Only good thing is she split up the project,0
I'm white and I love Dr. Fontenot's class. He is in no way biased towards any race. Just because he is teaching a class about a specific race doesn't make him ****. The people who say these things probly didn't come into the class with an open mind and weren't up to learning about another culture and THAT is why they didn't do well.,1
"Mean, just mean",0
"Denise is nice, but her class wasn't so great. It's almost stuff you have to teach yourself. READ the book! Do ALL the practices, participate, and study and you'll be okay. Don't miss class either. She did contradict herself quite a bit and it would make the material confusing. Often it is unclear what is expected of her students.",0
"I love Gershuni, by far the best professor I have ever had. She is very proper and does NOT tolerate any type of talking or disruption during class. Participation is huge in her class and requires you to sign in for attendance. Her assignments make you think a lot, but you learn a lot and do a lot of critical thinking.",1
"Professor Nelson is a very nice, very educated Econ teacher. He does lecture a lot but is extremely knowledgeable. Curves grade at the end of semester. If you need Econ for your major, I recommend taking him",1
"He provides examples of what he is looking for, so it's easy to know what is expected of you. He just talks forever sometimes about off topic things and sometimes wastes time. His feedback is sometimes arguable. You can turn them in as many times as you want. There are only 2 quizzes. Check email before class, he cancels. (He doesnt enter grades).",1
"she has a thick accent, sometimes hard to understand. She teaches you one way and ends up telling you not to do it that way. She knows what she is teaching but sucks at explaining the material. I wouldn't take her class again.",0
"Listen for nonart majors, this class will kill your GPA if you think oh that's an easy A. He's rude and tough grader. I took an upper-level painting class and got an A, this is a 1000 level class and he gave me a C?? this class makes no sense like is this even art ?He's too demanding someone needs to put him in his place cause it's 1000 level class",0
"Literally the worst teacher I have had here. DO NOT take this class. Her lectures make absolutely no sense and it's hard to find anything that seems worth writing down. She makes us do stupid physical exercises that add nothing to the curriculum, and she ruined some of my favorite books by her confusing comparisons and fixations on philosophers. ",0
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! take her if you can! This class as a whole was so interesting and you learn so much about yourself. There's three 2 page papers in the class and only 3 exams. The exams are a little difficult, but the papers are pretty easy, so it weighs out. Make sure you buyrent the textbooks because they're crucial in this course!",1
Amazing. That's all I have to say about that.,1
"She is very clear with her instructions! Always willing to help if you aren't understanding. There is a lot of textbook reading, but if you participate in class it won't seem like too much. Ask for help if you need it and you will pass her class easily.",1
He is awful. He comes to class unprepared and shows us videos of other people teaching. He says he has office hours to help but he's just shames you for not knowing. He goes fast and writes SO sloppy. He gets flustered if you ask him to explain something again. He starts every class with a lecture about how we're all lazy and stupid and terrible.,0
"OH DEAR GOD KILL ME NOW! I DREADED this class every wk.the tests are beyond hard,& he shows the first films EVER made in EVERY country.try to take cinema 2 to avoid this.NEVER out early.nice guy tho.i just thot his exams were way too hard.BUT I HATED THIS CLASS",0
"I took Ms. Jafroodi's nutrition course, and while most of the homework was easy, there was a good bit of it and I had to be careful about checking the due dates or one would slip by and I'd miss it. Exams were slightly difficult, and very long, so my advice is to focus on those, and do the extra credit offered unlike me who should've to pad my A.",1
"Be prepared for confusion on almost every assignment. The only thing he gave us a written guideline for was the final essay. He knows what he wants from you, but cannot communicate that clearly to students. Very nice though.",0
Shes not very clear with her grading rubric as well as being a very tough grader. Shes one of those teachers that thinks her class is the only one youre taking because she piles on the projects all at once.,0
"Dr. Ambrose knows what he's talking about and this class is required, so take him over the other terrible professors. He has sales and airline experience (he worked for Delta) which makes his class enjoyable and worth it. All of the lectures may seem boring, but I enjoyed them. The only negative thing about this course is using Cengage for quizzes",1
Really cool class. requires two books. Long lectures that are all spoken with not detailed notes that do not follow textbook. Only two tests and lost of worksheets.,1
"Terrible, terrible, terrible.  The woman is completely pointless.  Why is she employed here at all?",0
"He is absolutely awful. He doesn't use online resources like d2l, his lectures are not clear, every exam has super low average and he doesn't even tell us where we stand on class. He doesn't post solutions to exams or homework. He is not helpful in office hours either. The syllabus he gave at the beginning of class doesn't even include exam dates.",0
She was unfair at grading and made the class a living hell.  I now HATE animation class and never want her as a teacher again.  Worse time of my life.  She is good but expects too much from you and the grading is unfair and bias.,0
"Hybrid course, the days we met in class, we would only go over homework, homework was also difficult. Have to study weeks before test to pass. Try to avoid. Have to use book and program to pass.",0
"decent teacher, but he is really strange with grades.  It seems like he just pulls a grade point average out of a hat to determine your grade.  Makes you believe you are doing better than you actually are as well.",0
"Homework is actually fun & 100s if you do the work. However, his exams are nothing like the homework. Even with open note they're hard to pass, since there is not enough time & he focuses on confusing concepts instead of practical problem solving. He also talks incredibly slow & repeats announcements unnecessarily. I would never take him in person.",0
Don't expect to get your grades back,1
Avoid signing up for him. Run as fast as you can!,0
"Caring, and loves to help. Be prepared to do essays but she will help you through the whole thing. Moderately tough but I managed to get B+. Awesome teacher and would take again if I could!",1
"Dr. Zhao is so nice! He is very good at explaining difficult concepts and doesn't assume you remember concepts from classes you probably took years ago. He is very nice outside of class and offers extra credit! His lectures are usually at 8am, but you get used to it through the semester, and he gives random extra credit for showing up.",1
"100% the best professor I've had at UK so far, he's very passionate and knowledgeable about what he's teaching. There's just a few quizzes, a project, and a few participation points. He's always approachable and willing to help with anything. I wasn't even interested in the subject but he made me love this class. Highly suggest any class with him!",1
Judith was a playwright who steals ideas from her students.,0
"If you are taking 3 or more classes, don't take her. She gives assignments every 3 days and expects you to read a whole book in a few days. Her grading doesn't match her grading criteria either. Do yourself a favor and don't take her class. I invest the most time in her class and out of my classes, this class is my lowest grade.",0
"She's a very nice person but terrible professor. All we ever did was critiques, which are important, however she has given us hardly any instruction and is very harsh when it comes to critiquing.",0
"What she teaches in class is interesting, however she sometimes she does put you on the spot. Her tests have NO relation to what is taught in class. Seems to have little direction in her lectures (no wonder she hates power points).",0
okay teacher.... you must study for EVERY test to do well!!! as long as u put in the time you are good to go. its just a hard class in general.,1
"Terrible professor; would avoid at all costs. Powerpoints are very scattered and lack flow. She slides in unnecessary, snarky comments at times. ",0
"By far the worst professor I have ever had. Very scatterbrained, doesn't have a marking scheme for exams. All the questions are open ended even though you are given the questions before the exams. Doesn't know what is the right answer for examinations and not willing to give extra marks, even if you have one portion right, if another part is wrong.",0
If you have this Professor RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!! She is by far the WORST professor I had @ Temple!!! Buy the book cause its more useful than her Notes. This lady is so careless it's not even funny. The only useful thing in this class is the homework which is extra credit towards exams. DO THE HOMEWORK!!!!,0
"Be aware. He'll say that he wants you to get a ""general understanding of the concepts presented in lecture"", to focus more on the lecture than the readings, which are supposedly to ""complement the material covered in class"". What he will expect on the exam is to refer to several readings per question by both title and author and use specific terms.",0
She is a sweet heart. she is approachable and is very helpful. do not feel afraid to ask for her. she is always wanting her students to feel comfortable and to enjoy the material.,1
Tests are unnecessarily tricky. The way she asks questions makes you second guess yourself. They are so tricky that even she messed up 3 of the questions. The NCLEX questions aren't even that tricky. I am an A student and got a C on the first test. She told the class we were doing very well with an overall C average. How is that a good thing?,0
"Dr. Matlack is extremely passionate during each and every lecture. Pay attention and take notes (copy his drawings on the board they're helpful). The class is a beautiful distribution of history, ecology, and biology which was enough to keep me entertained. The aerial photo project takes time just start early (It's very easy).",1
"DON'T DO IT. Ryan is very popular with the Advertising students for the lower division classes, but for ICC (Campaigns), he's the most lackadaisical and vague professor to pick. Your grades are pretty much based on his opinions, so you can follow the rubric and STILL get a crappy grade. Instructions are unclear and his organization of the class sux",0
He definitely cares and wants students to succeed. The problem was is he did not teach in a way that helped that. He mostly read off lecture slides and class was boring. Tests were difficult and he does not do nearly enough examples in class to make sure you understand material before class. Homework didn't really help you learn and was very hard.,0
boring lecture..! too long ..! attendance is mandatory ...! can't leave class until he says so.! even he has taken your attendance many more things likes this,0
She is a very nice and understanding professor but her class was so boring. It was so hard to get through but she uses tophat and asks questions for participation so you have to go to class. We had no exams just a lot of quizzes that were difficult. I am not interested in the topic but her lectures just dragged on and you also have to take a lab.,0
"well it has already been said. He is hoooooooooorrible! I dont like his class and wish I wouldnt have taken his class. First of all he reads off of his slides. And because the slides are available online, he does not even allow you time to copy notes. he tests you on on about 4-5 chapters at once and eachchapter is about 40-60 slides. DONT take him",0
"Potential students,Please take your preq.; know it well. has a power control issue. He will tell U up front, he always win. What ever you do do not challenge his authority, He will target U through out the course and make it very difficult for U.",0
"I thought Ning was a very good teacher.  There was a language barrier, but he was always willing to explain Physics concepts to willing students who wanted to do well.  He is very enthusiastic and breaks things down to basic easy to understand concepts. He seems very committed to his job and Physics as a field. I thought he was good!",1
"I am not sure why so many students like this teacher. Calling her nice is like calling a rabid dog friendly. She grades at a post graduate level, and is not very approachable. If you take her in conduct, you will have a different professor for the first semester than the second.  Maybe she changes over the holidays. Study 8 hours a week or take a C",0
"Textbook is mandatory, lots of homework, and tests aren't difficult. He will give u a worksheet in the beginning of class and u could work on it alone or with a partner and then he'll go over SOME questions. If u have  a hard time understanding the way he teaches, he'll tell you to ask for a tutor instead of helping you get a better understanding.",0
"For his online class, Dr. Kageyama has put little effort into making his content accessible. Rather than recording video lectures he just gives you a link to his Google Drive full of PowerPoints. Even worse, the content in the PowerPoints are barely representative of what's on the tests and quizzes. You can't see what answers you got wrong either.",0
"An insightful class that changed my perspective on the world. Take good notes outside of what is on handouts and on lecture slides, such as examples he gives, and you are likely to succeed. Study guides reflect the exact material that is on the test. Study that and you will be fine. Prof. Goldiner is inspirational & truly a gem of a teacher.",1
She is absolutely horrible. Very unclear on what she would like done. Also very rude. She waits till last minute to tell you exactly what you need done. Would not recommend taking her class!,0
"Very unclear instruction for her project. She is NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS on email but talk about other stuff. What she says on the comment is totally different from what she said during the class. She is very tough for grade. If you take her class, you have to be professional to Adobe Dreamweaver, a beginner will not pass her class.",0
"Gives tons of reading and writing, oblivious to your time. Thinks his class is the only thing you do with your life. Boring lecture, very repetitive, monotone voice. Grades and does not explain why you got a grade",0
Best French professor ever!,1
Crazy hard grader. Reported everyone for plagiarism for no reason. DONT TAKE,0
"In my case, there were only four grades in his class: 2 papers, midterm, and final. This is what made the class tough. However, Professor Schuster is a great guy and a solid teacher. He keeps the class interesting (as interesting as history can get) and is willing to help those who seem to be struggling. Give him rough drafts of your papers.",1
"This is a pretty difficult course and there is a lot of information, but it is manageable. She is extremely helpful during class, and her office hours. She wants you to do well in the course There is a lot of homework for this course, but it helps with the understanding of the material. The exams are hard, but there are not too many.",1
"Sometimes, I want to purposely get into a car accident to avoid his class. The workload is extremely heavy... although its just copying but beware lab reports. Bless your soul if you have him. But outside the classroom he's dope, he's a great dude.",0
"Professor Stockton is amazing! I always looked forward to going to class due to his zany nature, good humor, and the interesting lectures. It is evident that he really knows his stuff. There's no required textbook and attendance is optional, but I never wanted to skip class. Even if you're not a philosophy major, take Phil 101 with Stockton!",1
"Zeng is a pretty nice person, but english isn't her first language so occassionally it was confusing when she said certain words. But the class is kinda tough. She does curve and give extra credit but she doesn't do that great a job teaching us material.. she was my only option for this course",0
prof. goldner is very unorganized during lectures. good luck taking notes because he jumps around from topic to topic without making anything cohesive. his study guides are useless as nothing listed on them correlate to the exams. he's very rude and patronizing to his students and his classroom etiquette is ridiculous. history majors avoid him.,0
"I took Professor O for both Financial and Managerial Accounting, first in class and then online. Didn't make a difference because everything is online anyway, and I felt the 1 12 hours in class was wasted on irrelevant examples. It's clear what you need to do to pass, but in Man-Acc. none of our books had the last chapter. Overall don't recommend.",0
"she did a good job, but this class has a lot of work!",1
I took him for creative writing and he's pretty chill I love him so much . He's so funny and so carefree but answers all questions thoroughly.  His work is so easy to complete and gives solid feedback,1
"A very difficult class to do. I took her online so I didn't get to meet her in person. She was a very difficult grader and had very unclear instructions on her assignments. She has a lot of work for you to do, and I honestly would not recommend her unless you like difficult classes. A lot of the highest scores for assignments weren't even 100%.",0
"Although she may have been teaching communications for the first time, it is no excuse for the level of difficulty the class was. She assigns way too much homework, never gives due dates until the last minute, and grades way too strictly. I think she bit off more than she could chew and we as students payed for it.",0
"She was incredibly disorganized and confusing. I understand her being stressed with COVID and the transition to remote classes, but this was a college class we paid for. One good thing about her, was that she gave us a large amount of time to complete assignments... but did not grade them in a timely manor so we did not know what our grades were.",0
"Whatever she says in lecture, write it down because everything is on her exam. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK!! you don't need it. Her exams are super easy. One research paper, but she is an easy grader. If you want an easy A, take her!!",1
"Whatsoever, DO NOT take him as your prof. Biggest procrastinator i have ever seen in my life. Took 8 weeks to grade 2 assignments. No feedback on time and doesn't reply to emails for up to 4-5 days, sometimes never.",0
"Most sporadic, unorganized professor ever. Not clear, changes her mind. Your grade is dependent on whether or not she likes you, emphasizes group work then will give members of the group different grades. Plays favorites. Rudest person I've ever met ",0
"TAKE COLLEGE 100, NOT THIS BULL CLASS! I don't know how any of this will help with my nursing career. She doesn't give a rubric or anything and will knock you for the stupidest things. SAVE YOUR TIME AND DON'T TAKE HER COURSE!",0
"He occasionally tells a funny story but is usually boring, but the class is easy. Don't buy the book you'll never use it",0
"Do not take this class! Hardest class ever. He expects you to memorize everything from pre-calc. Tests are the majority of the grades and are waaay harder than the homework. I'm usually great at math and I have never struggled so hard through a class at GSU, making this the first class I have ever failed. Do not recommend.",0
Li Liu is a solid teacher. Her presentations in class and her assignments helped me learn the content of the course well. You're definitely going to need to do some work outside of class but not an extreme amount. She's a solid teacher if you're looking to learn about communication,1
She's awesome! The classes are fun and we usually got out early. Matsushima is very patient and grades fairly. I never saw her mad or raise her voice or even get upset really. She will joke around with us a little and creates a fun learning environment.,1
"I would NOT recommend Eric for anyone who struggles with math. He is a nice guy, but he really isn't the best teacher. If you are the type of person who can figure out math on your own, he'd be good for you. For those who need extra help and an easier breakdown, he is definitely not for you.",0
"His lectures are all based on history and history again! never teaches you anything such as grammer, new words, etc. you supposed to know everything. He has his own way of writing essays and can give all class same grade. He wants you to really study hard and keep getting bad grades again put in the effort and try harder. eventually you might get A",0
"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",0
I wish I would have taken another professor to be perfectly honest.,0
Overall I would have to say this was one of the worst professor I have had. It is nearly impossible to get in contact with him and his instructions for the lessons/class in general are not clear at all. I would say its a fairly easy class although the way he operates makes it horrible and confusing. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take,0
"I have had to spend a lot of time re-teaching myself because I can not understand a word she says, she seems very nice but I wish I would have known how bad her accent was before I took her class. I am problem solving what she is saying while I am trying to solve the math problems.",0
"He's a good guy, but a lot of what he teaches is hard to understand because of the way he teaches it. I strongly recommend having a background coding before taking this class, otherwise it'll be hard!",0
"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID !!!!! He is like a nightmare! Terrible lectures. And he is really mean to you. He is a Monster. The homework is hard. You spent so much time on it, and you still couldnt get a good grade. Worst Professor Forever. If you dont want to torture yourself, be wise and don't choose his class.",0
I would never in my life take this class again.. If you don't write your papers in his writing style then you can best believe you're not going to get a good grade in this class. He's rude and I did not find his lectures to be interesting. I would never in my life recommend this class to anyone... even if there aren't any other classes available.,0
"He's really down to earth, makes the class fun so you aren't checking out the clock every five minutes. If you love writing he will make your passion stronger, and if you don't he will make you interested anyway. The only thing is that I was always distracted by the thought of having sex with him because he's hot...just being honest.",1
I am not so very good at English but she made sure I knew what to do and I did it and I passed and I am happy about the grade and her helping me.,1
"Never gave assignments back on time. Never gave assignment rubrics when she said she would. All her class is is busy work and her talking about herself. She never answers emails so don't expect to get any advice from her about grades, projects or clarificiation on anything. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
Summer A class which is only 6 weeks. Each week from Mon-Thurs you have to learn about 6-8 chapters worth of material. The lecture/study guides given made the material seem easy to get but his tests are hard. The wording of the questions got a lot of people confused. I would highly suggest a study group and outside sources. The book may help.,0
"Schreiber expects quality work from her students, especially on her big paper. You MUST be a good writer to do well on her research paper. She appreciates clear and concise writing (no flair). Labs are nerve wracking but if you perform, you'll get the points. Understand how to do proper SOAP notes. I never had to study for quizzes. ",1
The class component in this course wasn't bad it was pretty straightforward math. The labs on the other hand were the complete opposite. The midterm was even worse he literally tested us on the smallest things from our labs and then to top it off gave the LONGEST integration question known to man as the final question!!!!,0
"Professor Caldwell is such a nice person, he is a great professor, he is caring if you care to learn. He gives you a lot of homework to train after class. I would take his class again!!!!",1
An amazing professor!!!!,1
"Dr. Cheers definitely picks favorites and picks on students in the class. If you do not stand out in the class during discussion, you will be unacknowledged by him. If you do not participate, you may as well not be in the class at all because of how he treats his students. Definitely participate if you plan on taking this class.",0
Terrible at explaining the material. You come to class and all he does is work through examples. If you ask a question -- be prepared to look like an idiot. His tests are more difficult and somewhat different than what's on the homework he assigns.,0
stay away!! he is a really nice guy but he doesn't teach AT ALL. Unless you are in his group (there are 3) you get taught by the TA or LA's and they suck. He doesn't give a straight answer so you're basically teaching yourself or learning from the mistakes of other people which only makes everything more confusing.,0
"Worst course I've ever taken. The midterm focused on minute details and heavy points for each essay question. Average was a D. She seemed ok with it though..but it's not ok. With the final, similar deal, except minute details were on the multiple choice. Avoid if possible, don't take this class.. Boring and difficult and it just didn't need to be.",0
"Terrible at teaching, you will not learn in his class. Very specific grader for hw and exams but once you realize all the ridiculous little things that he wants it is an easy A, even without fully understanding the subject. Even other professors complain about Jalalvand, take him only as a last resort for required credit/prerequisites.",0
"When he speaks of Spirituality he is  without peer, when he dives into other arenas he rambles.  There is hubris beneath his façade, just a little bit, he manages it well. ",0
"Dr F was my prof for KNW and Data structures, both of which are the hardest classes I have taken at SMU. Fontenot has been the best professor throughout both classes. I can walk into his office and debug code with him without a meeting, talk about future classes, etc.. Best part about him though is how much he cares for students and their success.",1
"Dr. Lyall is a very good professor to take For intro to counseling. For the class you will read a self-help book and do a summary for each chapter (about 15 chapters throughout the semester). His lectures are funny, interesting and informative and you will learn the basics of a being a counselor in his class.  He's an easy grade and gives easy test",1
Michelle ROCKS!!! one of my best profs at SU. Always ready to help.,1
"Absolutely loved his class. He was well informed on what he covered during lectures, as well as anything that may have popped up spontaneously during class discussion. Not a difficult class, but I would advise reading your material and participate in class. Exams were straight forward. This was easily my favorite class since I've been at CCP.",1
Shes very rude and doesnt even do english its all about plants,0
"she was very awesome to have as a prof for someone in their first year.  she was very helpful and made the class interesting with her group discussions. i highly recommend her to first years, just make sure you show up to class.",1
Initially the content seems really easy but the final exam is an eye opener. Midterm is fairly easy. Final is a killer. Overall I didn't find it to be an easy course.,0
Took his calc 2 class at Scripps and loved him! Very hard class but he makes it so it's easy to get a good grade even if you don't do everything right. Homework assignments are very long but you have a week to do them and they are graded very generously and he tells you exactly what will be on the tests. Be sure to take good notes!!,1
"Get ready to read. Pretty tough grader, and not very approachable outside class so it was difficult to get feedback on assignments. This course was also very philosophy/theory based, and was rather dry - and often difficult - because of that. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.",0
"Tough grader, way too much reading. rude, obnoxious and very opinionated . Only her opinion matters in class and she will let you know that right way. Take her courses if you want to be miserable.",0
"I LOVED THIS COURSE. The online setup was easy to follow & navigate but the course content is what did it for me. Even though its 100% you learn so much that is applicable irl. Just do the weekly discussions, quizzes, & annotations & youll pass without the ec. The course is so interesting you cant fall behind. There are no papers too!",1
"had dr. Lowi for many classes. She is a great professor. You must take her if you are interested in politics. She knows her materials, very VERY smart. We need more professors like her.",1
"I took her summer online class. Doesn't accept late work. I am a straight A student, haven't missed a class, and got in contact with her for extra credit submissions, she didn't offer any, and gave me almost nothing on participation. If your major isn't Psychology or anything related, don't take this class.",0
"Worst professor alive. His practice tests make you complacent for the real test. Also, he grades on grammar over correctness. I felt like I was taking an English class not a Biology class. Take Ecology online!",0
"He is an okay professor, but he is terrible with technology and told us no to email him. He definitely knows his stuff, but he is just not cut out for teaching. ",0
"Great teacher. 4 unit tests 15-20 questions-review is the class before it, he does the review in class and it's exactly like the test just different numbers+if you complete it you get bonus points. 1 final of 30 quest no bonus points. No mid-term. Mymathlab HW due on the day of each test - easy!!! I suck at math but he makes it easy for you.",1
"So far I am really loving this class. With online learning I usually dread having to participate through zoom, but the professor seems super caring so far and I am loving the material we are learning about. Hope the rest of the quarter continues to be engaging!",1
"This class was way more difficult than it needed to be. The quizzes were 10% each and had over 50 vocab words and 10 listening examples to memorize for 20 Q's. Reading ""requirments"" came from an $85 online textbook that students hardly used. Lectures were material heavy and dry and slides were not posted after or before lecture if you missed class",0
Very bad at teaching his lectures were insanely boring and the information on the exams are much more difficult than the information in the power points. You basically just have to teach yourself literally everything and hope you have a good lab professor!,0
"Horrible class, I could write a monologue about how the homework was excessive or how the lectures were unclear or maybe about his inability to work with me, but I'll save you the trouble of reading all of that, and of taking this class.",0
Really confusing.,1
Professor Kaur is a very nice professor. She is very caring of her students and very passionate about her teachings. She does give out lots of pages to read from the textbook. You're mostly speaking and doing powerpoint presentations in each class. Overall the class was okay.,1
"Overall, shes not a bad person. Shes a good professor and knows what shes talking about but she expects you to be on her level.... she grades SO HARD. And does not care at all. Ive had way better HDFS professors who actually care and understand that we dont know as much as they do which is why we are taking the class to learn.....",0
Definitely take this course with her if you like for people to be condescending to you. Heavy workload. Assumes everyone wants to be a Pollution Manager...This course and instructor were so not worth my time. The material could be interesting if you didn't have to WASTE so much time being an English major for an Environmental Studies course.,0
"Nice person, but not a good teacher. She is way scatter-brained but means well.",0
HOnestly I have taken manuy online classes and have a GOA of 3.74 before before I took this professors class. She is hard to please if you get a bad grade and you question her she will give you details but when you apply her notes to the next assignments she will just add more issues. This professor is seriously the worst professor ever. STAY AWAY!,0
"She was very unclear, the books that she has us read are interesting though.  Your whole semester will be essays and pop quizes.  The essays are back to back and you rely on your classmates to look at your essays to revise them",0
I looked forward to going to her class each day.  She was very supportive and easy to talk to.  She wanted everyone to do well.,1
He is a very nice teacher and his class is easy to understand. There is no homework and the class is based off test that you take.His test are very confusing because he does not really clairify what he wants you to write on the test.,0
"Thick accent makes it hard to understand lectures. Very strict, leave class early and he will count you absent. No phones/ laptops he will call you out. A lot of homework, and can't really study prior to class since you never know what parts of the notes he will teach in class. If you're decent in math I would no recommend him",0
"Nothing. Not only did she give me attitude on the first day of the semester, but also falsely accused me and a classmate who is also my best friend of cheating on an exam, by asking us what's up about our scantrons in front of the entire class. I have never felt so humiliated and disrespected by anybody like this ever.",0
Dr Foster is great! He cares about his students and their success in college. He is very helpful if you are having any issues. I recommend him to anyone. I am just starting college and he alone has made me look forward to the rest of my time here. The material he taught will make my college carrer a success!! Thanks Dr. B!,1
"The book was really helpful and interactive. His lectures basically repeat what you read the night before. DO YOUR HOMEWORK or you will not pass. Tests are difficult, but not impossible. Amazing professor and really makes sure you understand. iClicker required so show up. Mikes Bikes simulation is fun, but hard and you must remember to do it!",1
Thomas Flowers is a nic person his only downside is he gives to much homework lecture heavy his work is hard and homework is to it takes six hours to complete his homework assignment the work load is to much for a Beginnings class lots of reading I hop this was helpful,0
"Prof. Durst is horrible.  She doesn't explain anything, and instead just acts like everyone is already supposed to know everything. If you try to ask her a question she cops a huge attitude and acts like you are an idiot for not already knowing, or just says ""it's in the book... go look it up"".  I wish the book taught the class, not her!!!",0
"I took Tompson after hearing PS101 was an easy-A class at BU. She is not the teacher if you want an easy A. She very engaging and a total genius, but her tests require knowledge from the book and the lectures so a lot of work outside of class is necessary to fully understand. If you want the easy A, consider another professor.",1
"I would not recommend Prof. Ehring to anyone. The material he uses in class is not his own - you can find the PPTs on Google. He reads directly off the slide and gets bored teaching (he announces it in class). Syllabus is not downloadable, was not helpful when I asked for it, grades are not clearly communicated with you. Stay away!",0
It really doesn't get much better than Mark. Knows his stuff; his dialogue is clear; even his choice of words seems chosen to avoid any kind of confusion. The assignments and tests are relevant and you leave each course knowing something useful.,1
"yes, very disorganized and very boring but her class is quite easy. i found that her tests are pretty easy but there is alot of reading within the class. tests are spread out and there is alot of info on the test. overall, very compassionate lady and down to earth. attendence no big issue",1
"Dont take this class if you want to understand statistics. Do take it if you dont care and just want an easy A. Lectures the entire time but never explains what any of the distributions or equations mean, and instead just gives you homework answers and tells you exactly what format exam questions are in which you can put on a cheat sheet.",0
dont be fooled by Elementary Spanish this class is tough and if you are not comfortable with the language do take it. im fluent in Spanish and there were some questions that I struggled to answer. the professor seems nice but completely disappeared throughout the 10 week course. she DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. avoid at all cost. no support at all,0
Correction: I believe she will return to Berk. Spring 12. Any serious English major should take this Theory course and any other lit course she offers; it would simply be foolish to pass them up. Enjoy.,1
He's really sweet and wants to make sure his students pass. He was willing to hold extra office hours on Saturdays the week of an exam. However it was really hard to understand him because of his heavy accent. It's hard to get what he's saying the in class so I recommend recording his lectures and listening to them when studying.,1
"Jana is very helpful, she has high but reasonable expectations of her students. She is very helpful, emails back quickly, returns graded papers quickly with useful comments.",1
Terrible as an advisor!!!!!... His classes are confusing and he has a hard time trying to answer people's questions. Grades pretty hard especailly on papers.,0
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so energetic and loves being in class. One of my biggest role models ,1
Ms. Jackson is THE BEST PROFESSOR AT GCC. I had a fear of taking this class but she really makes it easier and by the end you will become a better speaker. Her class is like one big family. I absolutely loved it. If you need com225 TAKE IT WITH MS JACKSON. you wont regrett it. Shes seriously one of the best teachers I've EVER had.,1
"Terrible teacher. He can not hear so class is just him asking for people to repeat themselves. One midterm one final pretty easy since the ta's held review sessions, but I never knew what I got on the final. 4 crucial projects, a lot of work, but doable. Finished the last 100 point assignment in one day. Barely went to class. No feedback.",0
If you want to learn to interpret--Prof. Boam can teach you!  My whole idea of ASL changed though this class.,1
"One of the worst professors I've had. Nothing she talks about in class is on the tests so if you don't memorize the text book, you won't do good on the test. All she talks about is sex because apparently she is a ""sex anthropologist"" -which would be funny if she didn't make the class so hard.",0
"Smyth is a great professor who is super passionate about history, especially Native American history. He likes to get the class involved in discussion and respects differing opinions on historical topics. If you like history, definitely take his course!",1
"Goes through the slides fast, and the test has random questions",0
"If this is the guy I'm thinking of, he's a boring dolt who was always complaining about **** college student puking on his lawn.  He used to hand out candy though.  That was the only high point of the class.",0
"When I was actually taking the class I hated it, but looking back now she has been one of the best teachers I have had at U of L. Yes, there are a lot of papers and group projects but they were so valuable in learning, I feel like I was a step ahead when I had to take the next English class because she prepared me very well. Do the assignments",1
It's a so so class. I would not take it again though. Too much writing,0
"I really enjoyed Dr. Vanderzalm's Bio 2 lecture.  She makes lecture as interesting as possible, and really encourages students to ask questions and have discussions.  Tests are not easy, but also very fair - I studied a lot for them, and always did well.  She also has you do online at-home assignments, which can help with easy points.",1
"Professor gave a lot of homework everyday, it took me 4-7 hours to completed it. He doesn't gave clear direction or syllabus. And he only accepted the work that is exactly what he is thinking. I have received his emails for most of my homework saying that I did most of them wrong, and he doesn't accept the correction.",0
"Makes her lessons clear, but doesn't take a lot of extra time to explain things, so make sure to pay attention and ask questions when you can! uses ALEKS for homework which ends up being alot of work but helps you to grasp the material well. Overall a nice teacher but doesn't go easy on late assignments",1
Great class and teacher. Pay attention and show up. It's mostly essays but what's expected is made obvious.,1
Horrible prof her lectures dont match our assignments/ test and she makes us pay for wiley cuz she doesnt want to make her own exam.. when we could be doing the exam on BB for free Avoid if you can plz,0
"Ms. Smith is so nice! Her lab practicals are difficult because she doesn't give you a word bank, and you have to memorize several complicated body parts, many of which sound Latin. But other than that, it's an easy course. Go to class, she gives you points every time you go!",1
Dr. Palmer would tear apart my papers and let me edit them. When I redid the things he did not like I would still get a bad grade because he found other things he did not like in the paper. He does NOT give good feedback. I was PRE MAE and he expected me to be like one of his research students. I would not take him for your capstone class.,0
I had Professor Johnson for my first Web Development class. It was easily my favorite class in the program. Really great videos and super helpful. Felt like I learned a lot!,1
"Although she's a really nice person, I would never take her class again. Lectures are very boring and all over the place. If you miss more than 2 classes you can't take the exam except attendance doesn't even count towards your grade. Her assignments were unusual and guidelines were vague. Would not recommend.",0
"If you have a difficultly grabbing concepts in oil omg math, Dont take Mathi. She knows what she is talking about, and is understanding, but does little to help you. And she will rush most of the book the last few weeks of the quarter. Prepare to teach yourself or have a tutor.",0
absolutely ridiculous grader.  he teaches ANTHROPOLOGY yet tries to grade everything else.. unfairly.,0
Abdallah is a fair marker and a phenomenal lecturer. I've thoroughly enjoyed all the courses I have had with him.,1
"Excellent, knowledgeable and very considerate when it comes to due dates and helping you out. Exams are based on the handouts you get in class, lots of homework and long lectures but they help you out in the end. One of the best professors ive ever had very nice person!",1
Hard ITM class but this professor grades on a curve. He also allows you to have 2 full sheets of notes front and back. What helps out a lot is that the Homework assignments were 20 percent of the grade and quizzes were another 20 percent of your grade do well on those you will pass. Midterm and finals are hard but the cheatsheet helps.,1
"Easy material, however, she makes sure that if she doesnt like you that you will not pass.  Cannot pass class if you miss ANY homework assignments.",1
"One of the nicest profs I've had, this was my favourite class this year. She's super caring too and is always interacting with students in the funniest way. But she explains everything really well as well and isn't too bad at answering emails on time.",1
"Owen is as zany as they come.  You're basically learning chemistry from Jim Carrey.  He inundates you with content and requires total comprehension.  50% of all test questions are trick questions in an already difficult subject.  He is not very approachable in office hours.  If you can't pay attention for the entire lecture, you will not do well.",0
"Absolutely horrible at giving feedback. And when asked to give feedback, it is not helpful or specific at all. And only responds to select few discussion posts. her grading does not coincide with her rubric at all also",0
You know exactly how to get a good grade with this professor. As long as you do your assignments on time you will get a good grade. This professor is very willing to work with students.,1

"Professor Dillon made Pop Culture very fun, as it should be! Discussion topics were very engaging and interesting, and the class overall was a breeze! Just participate in discussions and you'll do fine.",1
"He is a good guy. YOU really have to read the chapters before the lecture, otherwise you will get lost. Ask him for help, he is always willing to help you. Tons of extra credit so that is a plus. He does not use powerpoints  or handouts, just his own lecture on the board. Do the HW exercises and pay attention and you should be ok. He is funny!!!",1
"take this class i failed english 1101 last semester, not because i was lazy or stupid but simply because the class was hard so i took it again at 9am with dr.venus and i love it. he makes his class interesting and hes so spontanious you never really know what he is going to say next. i like that. his class is not boring and easy. TAKE HIM FOR AN A",1
"I went to Professor Rombo for help figuring out Blackboard and she told me she ""didn't agree with my observations"" and then proceeded to talk about it during class, implying that ""the student"" just couldn't figure It out for themself.",0
"Best introductory Linux courses available in the Puget sound area. I would highly recommend D.C if you want to jump into the Linux world, be a Slackware guru.",1
"His personality is ok, but I found him to be intimidating lecture wise, and participation wise I never really knew what to say. I went to office hours, but he was tough to follow for me, but he seems understanding.",0
Fun and easy spanish class. Especially if you are not a spanish minormajor. There are test corrections. Tests are OKAY. Lectures can drag on but he is very funny. He loves what he does. Very helpful. Would recommend for spanish.,1
"Lauries class is very easy. You should definitely show up as the online quizzes are very very easy if you have notes. Questions are taken directly from what she says in class. No homework, just 4 (easy) essays and 5 (25 Qs) quizzes thats are all online. And no final!",1
Best professor ever. I would want her to be my professor for every class if that was possible! Definitely take her class!,1
This class is asynchronous during COVID-19. The lectures get a bit dry but I can tell Doug is a kind professor. He seems to be easily accessed (I just never have). The TA gets a bit confusing with deadlines and assignments. The class is 5 exams and theyre kinda hard. No extra credit this semester but I think he will give us a bit of a curve.,1
Our course went online bc of corona virus and Dr. Carter acknowledged it was a bad time for students. He did not require zoom lectures but gave assignments to do at our own pace and used zoom for office hours anytime so we did not feel alone. He is truly a professional and can be demanding but in a good way. He will not let you down.,1
"I took this class by mistake. The school signed me up for this coarse that i don't even need. He doesn't speak clearly, he is to fast, a lot of people dropped this Friday and Saturday class. He is not understanding at all, and he does not comprehend very well. He says mean things to students like oh well you don;t pass not my problem. Fire him!",0
"I cannot stand this woman. The class is easy, but she is awful to her students. In her online course, if someone asks for help she wont answer them, only say things like ""this cannot be any clearer"" and leave it alone. SHe is persumptuous and egotistical, and an overall snobby and elitist person. i don;t know how she got her job. F-",0
Dr. Duncan is not a competent professor at all. She is usually unprepared for class and is easily distracted.She is a poor professor who lacks intelligence and thought.,0
I would highly recommend this professor. He is great at what he does. I have never enjoyed an english class as much as I did sitting in Mr. Hetricks class.,1
"Taking a physics class, I expected the curricula to be difficult. Mr. Bannow has a great sense of humor and likes to talk about his life experiences to explain topics. As long as your prepared to do the homework and like using google, you should have no problem getting at least a B in his class with all the extra credit he gives.",1
"Good lecturer, but can dwell on irrelevant matters during lecture. Disorganized and the load of work he assigns is ridiculous. I did well in class because I find microbiology really interesting. Overall, he is a good teacher, but you're also expected to work a lot for the grade so keep that in mind. ALSO: FIND A GOOD LAB PARTNER.",1
"I'm not one to use this application, but for this class, I'm going to have to make the exception. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. She is a tough grader, however she is also a very poor professor. She reads off the PowerPoint verbatim and is not good at answering questions. She has no problem teaching a chapter and testing you on it the same class. Overall, bad",0
"All of the comments that say he's tough are not a joke. I didn't think this class would be too difficult since it is a review of FR601 and FR611, but I was wrong. Josh is tough. I know I improved a lot, and he is really good at making things make sense, but if you aren't willing to put in the work, I would consider taking someone else.",1
Learn the programs bert,0
"A very nice man, but, he really needs to keep political views out of class.I don't care if your views agree with mine or not. I'm paying 14 grand a year to learn, not to hear a bunch of political propaganda. Any person that starts a class with the number of deaths in the current war isn't right in the head. Oh,and reading the material for tests, an",0
Dr. Persaud is the best instructor I have seen. She is very clear when teaching and provides a study guide for every test. I was one of her top students & those who didn't perform well are the ones complaining. I speak fluent Spanish and learned new thing in her class. As a bilingual speaker I give her a high rating. TAKE HER she is NOT HARD AT ALL,1
"Kirk is kind of entertaining, but he likes to call students out a lot. He is willing to help students after class, but he does not fully teach the material in class. He also does not give a lot of homework, but that is harmful in Calc II.",1
Professor Worrall really cares about her students. The course work is fairly easy and allows a decent amount of creative freedom. Overall this was a fun (and not too stressful) class!,1
Professor Huerta is genuinely one of not only the most caring professors but one of the most caring people I have ever met. She cares so much about her students and building community between them. She is one of those rare professors who understand hers is not your only class and will work with you to ensure you are successful in the course.,1
"Boehm is not an organized professor, but he is an amazing professor. He grades essays mostly on grammar so if you're not a strong writer then as he likes to say ""fake it till you make it"".He does give pop quizzes on stories he asks you to read so always read .He is always in reach outside of class for extra help. He takes longer to respond to email",1
In SOCW 316 you learn a lot. You will have to attend a group meeting like an A.A meeting and then you will have to write a paper on it. You will also be working with a group in 316.,1
She was very sweet and knew what she was talking about. Her critiques were always good and really helped when writing papers. She wasn't available for office hours and through email. I thoroughly enjoyed her class and recommend her to everyone.,1
"Fantastic teacher. REALLY engaged. The material was interesting. So sad I won't get to take more classes from her--she's not at SF anymore and that's too bad for all other Comm students. Make sure you don't say anything discriminatory, though; she will call you out on it in the middle of class to make you think. Not the class for you if you can't.",1
"Only 1 final paper about 8-10 pages. 10 small assignment to lead you to your final paper. Those assignment were really helpful. She gives good feedback, and you will actually learn how to write a great paper.",1
Susan is SO AMAZING. She is to date the best professor I've ever had. I still go to her for advice. Going to her office hours is a great experience and she will remember things like that! She knows so much about pre-production and makes you want to come to each and every class. LOVE HER!,1
"She is very disrespectful to students in lecture and lab. She's a hard grader and will take points off any little mistake you do on exams. Her extra credit isn't all that good and won't really help you out. However, I do love her PowerPoints on each lecture but some PowerPoints are way too long for no reason. I wouldn't want to take her again.",0
I don't understand Math very easily and she did NOTHING to help me out. I went to the extra tutoring lessons and her office hours and she didn't seem to care enough. She likes to pick certain people from each class and embarrass them in front of everyone. Its kinda of a disruption...anyways DONT TAKE HER!,0
"I dreaded every single one of her classes. She constantly gives the class lectures about how our class is lazy and dumb and that we should go to community college instead. After she explains her lectures she always asks, ""do you understand? yes or no?""  although this class is an easy A, i do not recommend it at all. ",0
"SO many errors on her tests. EVERY test we had there were at least two questions she had to go and ""consult"" with another instructor about. She is CONSTANTLY talking about irrelevant information (her son and her ""granddog""). Over half of lecture was spent talking about her family. You don't learn in her class!",0
Not a very good class!! 2 months teaching and 1 month homing!!,0
afd,1
"Dr. Clasen has not impressed me. His ""lectures"" are just him reading slides. He was responsive at the beginning of the class, but then he just disappeared. Lots of assignments; it's a summer class so it's 3-5 ch/wk and no feedback on any homework and rarely on tests either. YouTube is a better teacher!!! He does give extra credit, which is nice.",0
She doesn't make it easy to approach her or ask questions. Condescending remarks are in every lecture. She keeps you the whole class time and rambles. There is no acknowledgement for effort. I'm considering dropping this class which would stop me from graduating this semester. I'm a 3.8 GPA student and have never failed a test until now.,0
"Awesome professor! If you go to class and listen you will understand material. I barely studied just the night before the test and ended with over a 100 due to extra credit. Super interesting lectures too, highly recommend.",1
"He was really awesome! Very very clear lectures with organized powerpoint slides, always took questions and answered them thoroughly. His tests were fair and not just MC which meant it was a little easier to BS...Great class though :)",1
"Had to drop this class bc after a 51% average on the midterm, he refused to curve and would not help ANYONE. I know like 16 other people who dropped. Material would've been fine with some sympathy and help. He's so unclear",0
"Erica is one of the best professors I have had at UNL. She's kind, funny, and knows what she's doing. She makes french super accessible to anyone",1
"Don't like this class, feels like any passion for MIS has left me after I took 3202 and this one. Ryan is very lengthy with his explanation and the slides are usually confusing and hard to comprehend. He teaches with a very high level mindset so that'd be useful more for IT consulting. Did learn from the cases but didn't enjoy his teaching.",0
"Insulting the legends, and making fun of them. Wow. What a teacher.",0
ARH! sometimes he just babbles....,1
"I've been taking English 102 with Professor Robertson and have found the course load in this class to be ridiculous. For being a general education requirement, the work is hard, tedious, and unnecessary. The deadlines change often, and not enough time is given to complete projects. I do not recommend taking any class from this professor.",0
"Professor Howson, is such an amazing professor. She is well prepared to answer any questions you ask. Connects with students , really accurate with her grading . And accessible to help at any time . Lovely conversation with students, so active and keeps a safe and positive environment. I recommend taking this class.",1
he is a very helpful teacher. he is funny too! before he give you quizes he will give the answers right before the test. if you make a bad grade on one of your papers he will let you revise it to get a better grade. very easy teacher!!!,1
"Honestly, way too much quizzes and tests are very difficult. Never take with this professor thats my advice to you",0
"Don't even bother, change the professor if possible.  John Tyler needs a system of checks and balances when evaluating staff for teaching.  He walks and talks erratically around the room, scribbles nonsensical information on the board.  Best part, he's the only teacher who teaches the subject in class, maybe one other guy.  Steer clear, he's bad.",0
"David is incredibley intelligent however not a good prof. Rambles, spends the first hour of lecture playing music videos, repetitive and monotone. The content has the potential to be so much more interesting. This course has really put me off from indigenous studies. However it's an easy A, attendance is not mandatory and marking is very lax.",0
"Professor Lawrence is my favorite professor. Incredible! He really cares about his students. He grades based on improvement, which I really enjoy. He gets the class involved and teachings in a way that sparks growth and improvement. Incredible teacher! I'm taking the second half of the class next semester.",1
I think his classes are useless. I don't understand his explanations. He cannot be a good teacher!a good researcher? Maybe!,0
"Professor Hasson was one of a kind. I was placed in Basic Mathematics and he was the professor. He is very kind, understanding, patient and a very good teacher and listener. I am pretty bad at Math but taking David's class made me feel comfortable and at ease. And I overcame my fear of Math and actually got good grades. I got a B for my grade.",1
financial economics. dont do it.,0
"Ive been doing great throughout the semester, but then he has had us study our two last assignments and study the answer key. The 50% midterm was based almost entirely on those two assignments. Frustrating that if i didn't understand something after doing well consistently i will suffer heavily for it.",0
"Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!",0
Dr. Amid is hands down the BEST teacher at Windsor. He sincerely cares for his students and is always willing to help and explain hard to grasp concepts. He takes time out to make sure each student is getting the core concepts down for the step exams and for clinical practice. Truly AMAZING and I am glad I had the opportunity to be taught by him!,1
Lectures were so monotone. It was very unclear what he is looking for on exams. Take this class with a different professor if you can.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! so much work, lack of interest; can come off as rude..take someone else!",0
She is nearly impossible to understand. Her class is horribly organized and teaches absolutely nothing aside from a feeble attempt to expand your world view to fit her own opinions,0
"Takes forever to turn in grades. Very stringent grader. Beyond that, his feedback is very rude and not at all helpful. I did well in his class grade-wise but was upset and off-put by his feedback process. The phrasing and language he used when turning back essays were not professional. Straight up mean. I do NOT recommend him as a psych professor.",0
Absolutely amazing professor. You can tell he genuinely cares a lot about the success of his students; he holds many review sessions and is always open to help even in the middle of a lecture. His lectures are very easy to understand and actually quite interesting. He is an amazing person and teacher... 10/10 would recommend taking his class!,1
"Great teacher. She's a tough marker with essays, but it only pushed me harder, which is what a good prof should do. Sometimes it was hard to get a class discussion going, and she'd get peeved when no one responded to a question asked. Overall, good prof.",1
"Oks was an avg teacher. When I took him, he made the grading scale A=80-100; B=65-80; C=50-65; D=35-50; F=35-0. I honestly did not learn much from him. I knew most of the material bc I had a good high school physics teacher. Made an A in Oks class bc of this knowledge. NOTE: Oks is known make ""E) None of the above"" a correct answer on some test",0
"She is a very nice and helpful professor. She is by far one of the best. She is very helpful during office hours. Stop by if you do not understand something during class and she will clear it up. Seven homeworks, Seven quizzes, two exams, one 3-4 page term paper. She is by far the best. It makes up for the term paper.",1
His 5631 is highly related to distributed systems and cloud computing.  This helps me A LOT with the job hunting.   I am now in Seattle !,1
Professor Fast was not bad. Just get ready for a lot of homework which isnt horrible since you can work ahead and the homework is a huge part of your grade.,1
"The entire 781 experience was an enormous disappointment. I found the training to be a lot of talk and theory with no practical foundation. Further, Wendy is unfriendly (unless you're one of the whippersnappers ready to sacrifice precious time to her committees and workshops) and narrow-minded. Take questions to Eddie instead.",0
Professor Wheeler and her husband taught this class together and they are so cute and funny! The TAs are also super passionate and helpful outside of the classroom. Wheeler will make you get TopHat and quizzes you every day on the readings so (unless you're good at history) do the readings and you'll be fine.,1
"Professor Luckett is really organized with his lectures .All the test come from what he says in class. take notes and you will pass, He answers all the emails and questions you might have. took him for both intro to social work and social welfare easy classes. if your really interested in social work then you will pass. lectures are interesting.",1
"Restricts creative freedom. You're practically forced to abstract your work to her liking before you can start painting. Style is redundant, it's mostly collaging images on Photoshop and regurgitating it onto a canvas. The readings and the questions are a pain. Lastly, it's drawing and painting, wish she didn't restrict it to merely painting.",0
"This class is not easy A class anymore, because recently she changed her lecture. Such as finish minimum 2800 words 12 pages report paper in a week and 20 pages reporting paper for final. unless you love to write reporting paper, I am not recommended this class.",0
"Esposito is an awesome professor. He makes greek history engaging and even though it's expected that you read all the material, he breaks it down so well that if you miss a few days of reading you won't have trouble knowing what's going on. Highly recommend",1
"Don is the best prof I have had so far, and the reason I went into finance. Finance 3227 is a tough, tough class, people seem to blame Don for this. Most of the class is going through practice problems which is the best way to learn finance.",1
Lectures are not effective at all! I took all exams without following the lectures and I got an A-,0
Professor Hayden was AWESOME! Took her online during the pandemic and she was helpful. Always tried to help me when I had issues becuz of me job during COVID. She let us text her if we needed help. VEry understanding and patient. I learned a lot of stuff I didn't know. She's a caring teacher that I needed this semester.,1
"Dr. Wolff is an awesome professor! 4 exams and an optional final exam to replace a bad/missed exam, tophat participation points, and two brief papers(CBTL and movie assignment). Exams are very easy if you study her powerpoints. I would definitely take another class with her!",1
"Very nice lady. She does her best to make the class simple, she understands that it is a mandatory class for some. She gives you the information on the tests to study and she gives extra credit if you screw around and forget to study or something. You end up learning some of it without trying. Don't go to class if you are going to sleep, it's rude.",1
"She's nice but really annoying. Her lectures are long and pretty boring, her tests are usually completely different from what she says they'll cover in the study guides, and she grades papers harshly and only gives A's if she sees what she wants to see. Don't take if possible!!",0
Professor Neff is a genuinely great guy. He is so nice and cares so much about his students. He really believes in the material he teaches and is really enjoyable to just listen to. If you are taking Mosaics you can't do better than Professor Neff.,1
This class is the most difficult online class I've ever taken. There's quizzes for every chapter which isn't the problem it's how hard the quizzes are. They are full of trick questions and the book tricks you as well. I failed at least 2 quizzes every time and you can only take them once which is not fair considering how hard they are. DONT TAKE,0
"Professor Mizell is a very nice lady. But she doesn't teach AT ALL in class, all she does is talk about current events. She hardly ever replies to your emails when you need her to. She does make a good syllabus that is clear and easy to follow. Overall, she's nice but not a very good teacher.",0
"Great professor, the course was interesting, follow the syllabus and youll do great. Prof. Pfeifer was communicative he provided feedback and answered emails almost instantaneously. The man is more than fair, the work for the course is manageable providing you stay on top of it. Midterm and final are written essays highly recommend",1
"Heavy workload, most of which is busywork. Acts like he's trying to get feedback from students but really will end up doing what he wants anyway. Journals are horrible and he marks you down for not having enough personal reflection. Keep checking due dates because he sometimes gets them wrong in class, and if it's late he won't accept it.",0
I love Dr. Nikkel! He is super enthusiastic and has interesting lectures. The homework is an easy two questions per week. He reviews for the tests quite thoroughly so if you go to class on the review day you should be good for the test.,1
"Tests can be a little challenging, so be sure to do the assigned reading. She does offer extra credit off and on. Quick to respond to emails. Very kind to students, encourages asking questions if you need further explanation. Fair grader.",1
You could actually watch the oxygen leave the room.,0
"Laura seems like a nice person, but she is a horrible teacher. She thinks she's explaining things, but leaves the class confused on what's expected in homework or exams. She said it's not her fault (teaching style), but our learning style. She never releases the homework on time on Canvas, leaving students confused. I get As but not in this class.",0
"I had her fall semester and she was very unclear but I thought it was the language barrier but it was not. I stood in her class till the end which was a huge mistake. She is very specific in what she wanted and you got no credit if you didn't follow her ""format"" (you just fold a paper a certain way) or not complete sentences. It's math..",0
Awful professor. He is so unorganized and does not clarify anything. Do not even bother emailing him because he will not answer. All of his assignments have nothing to do with one another and he does not thoroughly explain them. Would not recommend him.,0
Music 152 is by far the easiest class to take if you need a fine arts requirement. All you need to do is show up for the tests and you'll be fine. All the tests answers are on quizlet too so don't worry about having to take notes.,1
"Every student who is fortunate enough to take class with Kendra knows what it is to be inspired and informed.  In a lifetime, you are forutnate to have any one have such a positive impact on your outlook and your creative work.",1
"One of the most unorganized professor I have ever experienced. Unclear answers when students ask questions. Assign homework, quizzes, and exams on materials we have not touched yet. Do not take this guy.",0
David was literally the best professor I have ever had! I always left his class feeling so encouraged and motivated! He not only equips you well for your career but also for life too as cheesy as that sounds.. haha He is so bomb and I literally can't say enough great things about him!,1
the absolute worst teacher I've ever taken. Never take her!!! every other day there's a quiz on a lecture of 5 pages. only like 3 words matter and her tests are Impossible. Taking class with a friend who is an A student and also had a C like me. Take this if you want your soul to die or don't have anything to do with your life.,0
"LOVED THIS CLASS! Professor Hinshaw is the BEST PROF EVER! Lives up to the hype. Seriously, TAKE THIS CLASS, hands down best class at Cal. ",1
"Dr. Jacobson is easily one of the best professors at the college. The workload is light. Her lectures are engaging, lively, and fun. At the end of the semester, you'll walk away from the class intellectually stimulated with a wealth of knowledge that's been distilled from her ability as an instructor, rather than from mountains of arduous homework.",1
"I took Prof. Smith's FE429 (Futures and Options). That was tough. His lectures were very unclear, explanations were confusing (at best). Well educated, but arrogant and ignorant of his class. This class was an elective.",0
Worst acc prof ever! She expects everyone to know everything before class so what's the point of going to her class? She will go through easy questions in class (super basic) and homework questions are completely off and takes hours to complete. exams are hard!,0
"She's a good Professor, and very nice. But, her grading technique is a bit strict and she makes/creates her own quizzes/exams so be prepared to actually read and gain a thorough understanding of the work. No searching up questions on google, she's not that easy. But yeah good Professor and make sure to address her by her full name, not a nickname.",0
This class has more assignments and harsher grading than any programming class. I would rather retake programming classes than deal with this class ever again.,0
Fuyez pauvre fou,0
"excellent instructor!!! always look forward to his classes. writing was not an interest to me (couldn't write APA style to save my life) til i met this man. Really detailed oriented, you'll enjoy this instructor.",1
DO NOT TAKE HER! She gives a lot of assignments and takes a long time to grade them. She doesn't explain anything and never responds to emails. Plus a lot of presentations.,0
"Arka was a great teacher, and his tests were VERY similar to the sample tests he provided.  The homework is reasonable, and he is more than willing to interact and help his students.  Take his class!",1
this class is the reason i question the use of gen eds.  literally so confused every class. his lectures have absolutely no structure  hes really good looking but i wouldn't take him again,0
"Avoid!!! Nice lady but she is by far the most unorganized professor I have ever had. Posted every week's assignments late, grading criteria was unexplained until semester's end, and she never graded anything on time- seriously, not once. Can BARELY get a hold of her by email. Posted final paper guidelines 10-days late too. Not worth the headaches.",0
JUST READ THE COMMENTS BELOW. AVOID THIS TEACHER SHE IS AWFUL. SAVE YOURSELF,0
"Worst teacher I've had in my 5 years of college, 3 years at UCD and my 2 years at FRCC. Really regret not looking the teacher up first considering all these horrible (and accurate) reviews.",0
Birch was very knowledgeable about Latin America.  I enjoyed the videos and case studies we went over.  I would recommend her class and I would take another class from her.,1
Dr. Vohs is really great at helping us in lab and can give feedback for us to become better chemists,1
"Lectures can be boring and the papers are a drag, but the final is optional. Easy to get an A or B",1
"He is great. I have never gotten tired in his class, but it is almost impossible to get an A. Very Hard grader but you learn alot",1
"Professor Arnold does not try to be difficult.  She is not a difficult grader, but she is about as clear as mud when it comes to explaining her expectations of an assignment...and although I don't like to be negative, I must say she is rather unhelpful in nearly every area of the classroom.",0
"Dr. Berger is a really funny guy who has a great personality. He's pretty tough to follow in lecture, but the exams are a piece of cake. For intro to computer engineering, half the mid-term is in class, half take home, easy grade. Then there's a presentation you have to do which is another easy grade. Final exam is all take home. Class is an easy A",1
"I avoid Misurda at every chance I get, you will not find me willingly taking his class. All his lectures are monotoned, without use of examples or direction. Projects are extremely hard, no structure to the course and lack of examples in class. TA's are more helpful at explaining concepts then the teacher. No piazza even tho class is online.",0
"Fowler is such a smart woman and it is apparent in her lectures. she is so enthusiastic about the material, it's hard not to be interested. her lectures were sometimes unfocused, but fun none the less. with an awesome ta, this class is great and engaging. (and you learn a ton)",1
"Johnson is very opinionated. Her opinions are clear on whats right and wrong, the class isnt based on truth, its based on her own moral objections of right and wrong. At one point she even threatened that if we didnt like it, we could take sociology with the other instructor who shared and would also voice the same opinions.",0
Amazing man. Caring and  very helpful. Statistics is not easy and he does everything to assist. Thought I would fail this class but got an A. He really wants his student to do well  .,1
"Teacher is very nice,but is very confusing, goes beyond what is required which makes it confusing, grades random problems and i have never done so poorly in a class until this class. Went to the tutor center many times to get help. I would not reccomend this class unless you are very good at math and need little help or you want to retake it.",0
"This was a really good course, especially if you know econometrics! Paola was very helpful throughout the course and she was always there to help us understand the papers and the tables, and give feedback and tips for group presentations",1
"Syllabus is very clear, keep up with each weeks modules, quizzes are fairly easy, exams come from the quizzes and chapters, most of the questions can be found on quizlet. Fair grader, would recommend. I took the 8wk class and worked ahead finished all of the assignments in half the time.",1
Not very good,0
"Professor Lockett is amazing! I didnt do so well on the tests however, I was able to partake in every extra credit assignment so that helped me achieve a satisfactory grade in the class.",1
"Very average math class. Not very exciting during class (you basically just go through long example problems), lots of textbook homework problems, quizzes on the homework and then a couple big tests. If you are good at math you'll be fine. If not expect a B. He takes a lot of points off for strange reasons.",1
I love Dr. Burras and will take more classes with him in the future. He cares about all of his students and genuinely wants you to succeed in his classes. Willing to answer questions and willing to discuss grading on assignments and exams. A great professor overall.,1
"Dr. Ferguson is a nice enough guy, but the class was difficult. There was way too much reading assigned and he is a hard grader when it comes to assignments.",0
"I think this class is best to take in summer since it is a writing intensive course and it could be hard to catch up to daily hws, readings and some long essays that had to be written. But if you can manage your time wisely then this is an easy A+.",1
Worst professor I've ever had. Sits in front of the class and reads of a packet. Does not teach anything. Seton Hall is better of paying me to do a better job,0
"I believe I took her on her first year of teaching so she was very new and you could tell she didn't know what she was doing. Her exams were okay, just study off the power point slide notes. Her final is a combination of all her past exams. Basically I give her a 7/10.",1
Dr. Butowsky is one the best professors I have ever taken at Mason. He is passionate about the history of world war 2 and a great teacher. It was a pleasure coming to his class every week.,1
"If you show up, you'll be fine. However, just warning you that the tests are a bit difficult. If you are on top of your assignments, you will be fine. Just know that the tests are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.",0
Dr. Kelley is a great professor that actually gives you useful information about nutrition. Just make sure you submit all your assignments and take advantage of all the extra credit opportunities given.,1
"Dr Day is a very intelligent man, but he isn't very good at teaching to a class. He fails to break down what he is teaching into easy to learn chunks and instead slathers equations and algorithms up on the projector. Don't expect for him to teach you the MatLab language either, you will have to teach yourself 90% of it.",0
"I'm incredibly happy to see McCay has such good ratings! His class was a bit lecture heavy, but we got breaks. McCay truly cares about your success in his class and stays after as long as he possibly can to go over assignments with students. 4 ""tests"" (not actually), 2 papers and a third paper called the ""A"" paper required for the A grade. Great!",1
"I really enjoyed the class I took with Professor Qualls. While I learned a lot, I struggled as well. He gives good feed back on papers, but it's not always clear and is mostly negative. If you don't feel like you're a great writer, I'd be hesitant about taking on of his classes. However, he's a great prof who you'll learn a lot from.",0
"Not a good teacher.  He's difficult/unwilling when you go to him for help.  He makes FREQUENT mistakes on the board, which he sometimes doesn't correct for days.  His tests have gotten either ruthlessly hard or too long to finish in an hour.",0
Nice guy but you won't hear from him. His class is self-paced for everything is due at the end. You have two weekly assignments then 3 tests. These assignments are one discussion then one just 2-3 paragraph response paper. His tests are open-note and not time limit for you have to write paragraphs. Very easy class where he wants you to enjoy it.,1
"WOW. i literally met with her everyday after class, went to the writing center- and spent atleast 5 hours weekly studying for her class, Still got a C. She is ridiculous- and expects you to answer exactly the way she wants- or no points. Deflates grades- highest grade in the class was a b-. this is NOT ok",0
"Professor Jassen is the best professor I have ever had for Biology in my academic career. She takes her time to explain things when they aren't clear to someone. She drops lowest 3 quiz grades, uses online HW via blackboard, and has quizzes every week. The quizzes actually help learn information! I cannot wait to take her A&P classes!",1
"Professor Leung is a wonderful teacher! He worked very hard to present the material in a clear and understandable way.  He responded to all questions quickly, even over the weekend.  I recommend this class to everyone!",1
Professor wasn't very flexible and was relatively unapproachable. Had two course calendars with only one containing all of the due dates. Expectations for papers weren't easy to follow and you just had to figure it out.,0
"I cannot recall a time when we even used the book; because we didn't-- WASTE of money! Check it out of the library like I did and keep renewing it!! All of his tests are essays, no matter which class you take. Just be a deligent students and you will do well. And, do GREAT papers otherwise suffer the consequences of a bad 20% portion of your grade!",0
Cant teach. Doesnt curve. Dont bother going to his office hour to fight for your grade. Wont give you a point back and will ask is this why u come to my office hour? Caring professor. Sarcastic. Doesnt care about your grade tho.,1
"Going into this class I was excited to learn about philosophy but coming out of it, I don't think I will ever take another philosophy class again and if I do it will definitely not be with Jeff. He's an easy grader but will tell students that their opinions are wrong and force them to agree with his own opinions by arguing with what they have said.",0
Hes a great teacher and the study groups are super helpful but hes strict about texting in class and about being there for tests... if you arent there for a test day you dont get to make it up,1
Don is a boss,1
"The study guide for the final had 68 terms & 16 of them were on the final and we had to choose 12 to give ""short answer"" on, being 3-5 sentences! Knowing who, what, where, when, why, and historical significance. Only 15 of the terms were on the exam, one of them being a term that was not on the study guide. There are no way to know grades thru enti",0
"Prof Merdian is not funny or caring. He screams and mocks students in front of the whole class. Some students (yes, plural) dropped his class due to the anxiety he was giving them. He surely knows his stuff, but teaching is not his forte. Very disorganized and we never used the book or lab manual. Be ready to lean a lot on your own...",0
McAdam is one of the best professors WPU has to offer. She works with her students so they can get the best grade possible. 2 papers and 4 quizzes which she goes over beforehand. TAKE HER!,1
"The course was reading-intensive, but the stories all contributed to the course topic. Professor Tulin is willing to provide clarity about the readings during the lectures and wants students to give their input on the material and class structure. The group projects and discussion posts require students to go in-depth to get full points.",1
"CHIEUX  !!! pas de classe, commentaires ****es. pédophile, emmerdeur, ne connait rien a sa matiere et veut faire croire qu'il est connaisseur !",0
Boring and loves to ramble about nothing. If you tell him the tests are too hard he WILL make the next one easier.,1
"Hard teacher, but she knows her stuff. You really have to study to do well. She will help out if you need it just be prepared for sarcasm!",1
"I had him for Integrated English and he was okay. He is very nice but very unorganized and will call on you during class to ask you questions. He gives out at least seven different papers per class time which means, A LOT of homework. He will let you turn homework and major assignments in late and will give you take home tests with study guides.",0
Terrible! He is truly all over the place with his ideas and thoughts. His exams do not relate to the lecture or the readings. And why does he make us watch a movie about CORN?!(great nap time though),0
Sister Kirkham is by far one of my favorite professors i've ever had! She is always willing to help you in the course and she brings the spirit to class every time! She teaches through personal experience and tries to make the work less difficult. I learned so much from her course and from her that It changed my outlook on life completely!,1
"Kathy is awesome! Definitely my favorite professor within the Journalism department so far. Attendance is mandatory, but if you skip a few and do the extra credit (which she offers a lot of) it should even out! If you turn in an assignment late, she still accepts it, you'll just have to remind her. If you can get Kathy as a professor, do it!!",1
"this made me reconsider if i truly liked music or not. fascinating teaching style, his lectures remind me of slow cinema. went through an existential crisis but i'm still doing the 1 point quiz every week",0
You might as well start writing index cards from the beginning of the semester ( chapter 1 slide) up until chapter 12 slide because there is NO midterm and NO study guide for the final. The 12 chapters that he talks about during class is basically your study guide for the final. Good luck because half the stuff you study might not be on the exam,1
"This professor does not teach the class well, he'll stand in front of the projector so you can't see the notes.  His test average for the first test was a 50.9, with the honors class included, so it would be a 35 without them.  Horrible professor.",1
DeMello really makes you work hard to understand the material he lectures in class. Attend every session and then repeat all handwritten problems he does in class. He uses these questions as problems on the exams (he curves exams too). Homework assigned has nothing to do with exams. Stocktrak and homework are easy ways to keep your grade up.,1
"Do not take this class until you have taken physics! That's all it is! The people who were lost were the ones who never took it. 3 exams with an optional final. Exams were HEAVILY curved. She wasn't too bad, but didn't seem sure of herself. Study old exams, read, and visit office hours and you'll be OK.",0
"Fairly simple material, but goes over it well. I see a lot of the reviews says he ""penalizes students for groupmates' mistakes"" - he gives group projects, but you have the opportunity to review what your groupmates do just like any other group project. He is accessible via email. Nice guy, can go on tangents that at times are ""out there""",1
The average on this professors tests in 50%. His tests take 5 to 6 hours to take on average. He is super unhelpful and does not teach what he puts on the test.,0
"Englund is very strict, hard to get ahold of, and makes tests very difficult. He does not review in class nor does he give students a review for the tests. Rather he says ""just look over your notes and you should do fine."" Also, clickers are very important if you wish to have a good grade.",0
"TAKE THIS PROFESSOR AT YOUR OWN RISK! Completely unhelpful, unwilling to correct mistakes, straight lecture, no actual problems done until you do your homework. Extremely picky grades while creating ridiculously vague problems on test.",0
"Hard work pays off in every class except for this one. If you can't sleep during the night, show up to his class and he will put you to sleep with his lectures. If you can't read, no need to worry because he will read the powerpoint slides for you for the entire class.",0
Nice professor Boring class,1
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points*. Thanks Wendy! But srly, do not take her!!!",0
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. I cannot say it enough times. This man thrives on seeing his students fail. His tests are downright impossible. He is an incredibly tough grader as well. I took the online course and he made us come in to take an exam because he thought we were all cheating. I promise even if you did cheat you'd probably still fail. AVOIDDDDDD!,0
"Great prof, will take again. Speak up in class, participation matters",1
"Nice person, and willing to go the extra mile and help students connect to the material. Do the readings, speak up in class each week, and turn your work in - you'll do fine and you will even have fun. I am considering a major in philosophy because of her.",1
"I'm really dumbfounded by some of these poor reviews, Miles is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. I would highly recommend taking one of his classes. He's a great professor and I always found his classes interesting and thought provoking.",1
"Content was interesting, besides the fact that the entire course grade is determined pretty much by four things. Be prepared to read three very heavy chapter books from the early 20th and late 18th century. Stay away if taking online.",0
"I took his online class, If you want to teach yourself an entire math course this is the class for you. Very little homework, Very little instruction, tests are huge! So if that's how you work great! Also I found he took points off of problems for very small things even when I would get the answer right.",0
"Professor Pangallozzi is a knowledgeable professor, but I felt the class was disorganized. She was definitely very busy and was not easy to get in touch with. This class was online, the course might be more organized in person.",0
Missing grades until the day final grades were due. Unclear grading scales. Required an expensive McGraw Connect when she did not use the software. Unclear deadlines. Stacked assignments. Dropped a student without notice. Doesn't answer emails in any resemblance of a timely matter. Her class was a full time job.,0
"Very friendly, easy going teacher who knows her stuff and is there to help.  Never made me feel inadequate.  While you could just get by, she encourages you to go just a little further with each project to get it just right.",1
"Lectures pretty much follow the book, but he makes it interesting. He also has on-line lectures if you miss class. Points are given for attendance and extra credit.",1
"I felt like I was getting a lot out of the text/discussion boards until I took the midterm which completely plummeted my grade. I'm a senior, and an A student. Studied very hard for this test. Questions are very tricky. I didn't feel like the exam was testing my knowledge, but rather, trying to trick me.",0
"nice guy, great proffesor, a little much for a intro class but he makes it easy to learn and is very fair when it comes to grading, all in all a good guy and a good teacher.",1
"Leila is probably one of the worst professors I have ever had. I did not learn anything from this course really, I had to go home and teach myself. I will try to stay out of any course she teaches from now on.",0
Assigns homework she doesn't bother to collect. Then docks points because we didn't watch YouTube videos about an obscure filmmaker. Assignments are often unclear and she is angry is you ask her to repeat. Gets angry at class for not knowing all about Italian geography.,0
Hameed is one of few teachers who actually cares about each individual student passing.  So he helps alot in office hours and even meets you when he is busy.  But he takes you through hell and back before you can pass his class.  Over 10 hrs of HW a week.,1
"Good prof, He is old fashion and doesn't use lecture slides. Exams are more then fair, he supplies you with a short list of possible short essay questions for review and chooses a select few of those exact questions to be on the exams. Create a google docs with everyone in the class and this course is a easy 80!",1
"This teacher is nice, but is not a good teacher. Doesnt seem like anybody in the class is doing well, pretty bad when the class avg on tests is a 42%...take another teacher if you want to pass",0
"He was fun, entertaining, and kept the class interested. He was also incredibly helpful to those who struggled. He even took the entire class out to dinner for study time, in preparation to the final exam. That was the best, because everyone felt at ease to ask questions. He is a great teacher.",1
"What a wonder class, he became a Purdue faculty scholar and outstanding engineering teacher in 2019.",1
"Her class consists of 1-2 quizzes a week they' re kinda difficult. Her lecture videos for the quizzes are from off YouTube, there is usually 3-4 of them that are 15 min long. Study question assignments: 3-4 reading assignments with questions to answer. Always one discussion due every week and to do that you usually have to watch a video or movie.",0
"two homework assignments each week, one was due on wed, the other due on sat. prof bertens has good instructional videos posted each week and each video is for each hw assignment. discussion post is rlly helpful bc you can post which problem you are struggling on and either prof bertens or a classmate will explain the process and give u the answer",1
"OMG..class isn't hard, test aren't difficult IF you go to class, take notes and read lectures. No, he doesn't spoon feed you material for test, but it's all in front of you. REALLY? You have zero HW, read some, ONLY 3 exams with 25 MC questions and the course is DIFFICULT? Professor IS Hysterical and genuinely interested in the material. TAKE HIM!",1
While Mrs Yang is a very kind professor her ideas over group work are less than ideal. She will assign people to random groups at the beginning and at the middle point of the semester. Group work sometimes isnt bad but when you get stuck with a bad group it hurts your grade bad. The professor also did nothing as one or two groups had conflicts.,0
Tough but she is very clear on what she expects. You have to go to class becuae you get a lot of points from in class assignments and she will work with you on your grade. The class does require work but it is very interesting!,1
"He's a great professor. He always explains what you can do better in your drawings, and will understand if you speak to him about any problems you have. Classes are very entertaining and he fully explains what we need to do for each assignment. Dont be afraid to ask questions. He grades you based on your improvement in drawing, not how good u are.",1
"Gives good instruction, really helpful hints and critique, and fosters a positive environment.  Is respectful to all levels of painting skill, encourages deeper thought. Would like her to accomodate students whose focus isn't painting (i.e. don't require so many expensive supplies, spend so much time on non-basic info.",1
I passed this class without learning anything. Prof does not respond to emails in under a week and takes weeks to a month to post grades. This coupled with errors and unclear information in chapter notes etc makes it seem like she doesn't know enough to teach or simply doesn't care about her online classes. I am disappointed that I paid for this.,1
Weekly homework & 3 exams. Takes long to reply to emails. Honestly was praying for a C and ended up getting a B because everyone else did bad too and I think he was a little more lenient after the COVID situation. I would recommend taking someone else if you can. He did end up letting me redo two homeworks at the end of the semester when I asked.,0
"First few classes she said the components in plastic are linked to estrogen increase in men and it could be a reason ""for the rise in gay men"" recently. Then said excess estrogen doesn't affect women. Kind of appalled still, especially as a gay and trans student. Hoping she gets better but she still goes off topic about the Chinese gov and tiktok?",0
Great TA,1
"Some lectures were rough around the edges, due to him not teaching microeconomics for a while, but he showed a clear passion in the subject and I am sure the minor problems will be fixed by the next time he teaches this class. He tries to make economics interesting by showing pop culture clips related to the concepts. Definitely a great professor.",1
"funny professor, tests are easy if attend lecture! however, the powerpoints and recordings are posted online! his grading scale makes it difficult to get A's, but he does offer make up essay for missed questions on exams. very interesting class!",1
"Shes the best of the best, class isnt boring its fun every time! Shes super nice, shes awesome and you wont regret taking her class.",1
"I think he is not that much into teaching, and kind of irresponsible. I gave the test for him to regrade, and I never got it back. The materials is hard, and he think we understand everything already, but in fact none of us understand the subject.",0
She's a little bit quiet but definitely audible. She's very good in office hours and the homework load is reasonable. As long as you attend class and go to CLAS you should be fine.,1
"Looking back, i feel like the material for this class was way overcomplicated by Hines' teaching. He went way too fast and messed up more times than I could count while solving problems. I highly recommend going to Johnny Prints and picking up the slides used in class. Get ready to teach yourself this whole course.",0
"Not helpful, only class I have ever failed, I got migraines because of this class! Awful! ",0
"This course is near impossible, the prof is boring so memorizing the infinite number of concepts make it even more difficult. she will ask a question no one knows and will wait a good 5 minutes, as the whole class is silent, until someone decides to guess. terrible professor",0
"WORST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE!! AVOID HIM!!! He's awful, the grading is completely inconsistent, he's hard to understand because of his accent and he's extremely rude sometimes. Don't expect help from him!! He is an awful professor and I wish I never took him. SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN!!",0
"Interesting topics but not worth it honestly. She is very passionate but lectures the WHOLE time, readings everyday, and only 2-3 tests with a good amount of papers.",0
"Had him for S&P and Cog. I didn't find either course too hard to manage (though S&P was notable tougher.however, his teaching style isn't what Truman students might be used to. You need to read the text but it is much more essential to listen closely to lecture and think carefully about it. Very fun class if you're into a more abstract approach.",1
Dr. Kang was an amazing professor. He really cares about your success in this course.,1
"I would never take this professor again. She is extremely unorganized and does not want students contacting her. She does not leave her number or email. You can reach her through the WWCC website; however, she will not respond. She wants students to ask questions through discussions. Her response time is late and does not explain her grading.",0
"Dr. Kunz can be dry and lectures can be boring, but he knows this. Really sweet and wants you to do well. Would take him again!",1
"Christina has, by far, has the best lectures. You likely won't be bored, plus she does some really cool demos throughout the semester. The class itself is really straight forward; go to lecture, read, do the homework, and you'll definitely pass. The concepts get a little complicated, but put in the effort and you'll succeed no problem.",1
We love Gary. He is a great teacher who is always helpful.,1
"If you don't have biology background, the class can get confusing really quick, so take the time to study his background material he gives you before semester starts, even if that sounds boring. If you are a biology major, you have an easy class ahead of you. He's animated and fun to be in class with, and he's got a very generous bonus point system",1
"Excellent Professor! He's incredibly laid back and down-to-earth with his students and never fails to make us laugh. We discuss compelling issues and debates in class which are always current and interesting. Class is probably one of the easiest English classes ever, I got an A on every essay I've written! Highly recommend him!",1
"Dr. Whitaker is VERY knowledgeable. He is not organized though (if he was I would take him again) & you will never be let out of class early.  He's a great professor, but not my style. It's NOT an easy A, but it's an easy pass. You need to read & study for the homework/quizzes (which he will never tell you when you actually are going to take them).",1
"One of the best professors at Seton Hall! Makes the class super straight forward and easy. Only assignments are 3 tests and 3 case studies (which are pretty simple). All tests are directly from his powerpoints, which he posts on Blackboard. Study for the exams and you will do fine. Beneficial to read the textbook chapters, but not mandatory.",1
Do not take this class. His lecture are boring and his exam extremely difficult. He doesn't know how to teach a class. RUNNNNNNNNNNNNN from this class and from this professor. If you want to fail a class take this one!,0
"He is a good instructor but it is not an easy class! You have to attend, ask questions, pay attention, do your homework and even go to tutoring, if needed. His test come straight from the homework problems! He will give you ""Suggested homework problems"" but you should really do them and get familiar with what each problem is asking you to do.",1
"As an English major, I dreaded coming to this class every day. I have never been more dissatisfied with an major required course.",0
"Onyiah isnt very considerate of his students. Tough to understand. Gets angry when asked questions about the material. All homeworks/tests require hand-written work that takes extensive time, but you are not given enough time to complete. Worst professor ive ever had, and its not close.",0
If you have the chance to take him as a teacher I would avoid him. He makes makes things WAY harder than they should be. He gives plenty of worksheets and practice problems to prepare us for tests and then makes the tests unnecessarily hard. Elementary Math should not be a hard topic to teach but he makes it more complicated than it should be.,0
"Brett took a dry course, Accounting, and made it bearable. I enjoyed his lectures and his humour. I highly recommend him for anyone who is required to take accounting and not overly interested in it.",1
"Only had two zeros on homework out of more than 10, turned in everything I needed to, just wasn't one of her ""favorites"" and didn't suck up to her so I made a C. Undeservingly. One of my friends got the same grades as me and made higher because she was close to her. Is very unorganized. Gave us no idea of our grade, and grading was so inconsistent",0
Amazing prof who cared about her students. She responded to questions quickly. Shauna expects full attendance and relates the course material to real life situations from her practice or from the news. Makes the class enjoyable and is very inspirational.,1
Can give tough assignments but a very knowledgeable teacher.  Very caring and interested in student and success.  Makes you work but you learn from an expert.,1
"Hasson is an easy going teacher. His classes fill up fast, so you better signup fast. Communication is key, you always are welcome to leave class early, but you miss his whimsical joking. Funny and helpful. Lots of group tests.",1
"He's very monotonous, which isn't great considering that the material is very dense and hence it necessitates focus. Dude just reads off the slides. He's very smart, but he gives off the vibe that he doesn't want to be there. If you want to take this class for premed then wait until another professor is teaching it",0
"Nice and understand but not very good at teaching online course, at all.",0
He is a great professor! I would take him for every class if I could. He is very clear on what he expects from you. He is a super nice guy and has lots of experience with business and management. It is an easy course but you also learn a lot from him. Highly suggest taking him for any class. His study guides are the test and there's one project.,1
Thich accent you can't understand. Quizzes are way different than lectures and lectures prepare you little for tests. Prepare to spend hours outside of class learning the material.,0
Unorganized and scattered during lectures. Uninteresting but the class is easy. A few short papers and easy online quizzes,0
The way he grades you seems very unfair to me. All it is is about 3 tests and then two papers that only count for 10% of your grade. The subject is interesting but your ability to pass may be questionable.,0
"to many writing assignments, you should be able to read up to 10 chapters a day because he makes you read like crazy and its too much stress especially if you have a job, hardly any tests in that class, its too much freaking work for a class that you'll never need in life!!!!!",0
Is a great professor out of the 3. May be hard to understand because of his accent but he is class is very easy. It is hard to fail his class. Is very understanding and will help you if needed,1
"Memorization heavy; 130+ terms per midterm, three poetry recitations, eight papers ranging from 1 to 6 pages-double and single spaced, three midterms all recall/essay questions, re-writes tests every timeno student feedback on questions, no curve, little mercy on late assignments, extra credit often in the morningunavailable, hated the class.",0
Dr. Ba is an amazing professor! Very clear in his expectations and understanding in that people have lives and things come up. W?He was more than a professor he went above and beyond to help his students!,1
Hes not good at teaching. He doesnt work with his students AT ALL. So dont expect to talk to him about where your grade is at and him help you succeed or do better. I wish I didnt waste my time and money in this class. In the 6 years of going to college Ive never been more frustrated with a class. Dont waste your time with this one.,0
"Dr. Fetter is an absolutely amazing professor and I highly recommend taking him for accounting. His class is straight forward, easy, and he does not assign a lot of homework. Nevertheless, you still cover a lot of material and he really ensures you understand the concepts before moving on.",1
"She is an amazing teacher, but you have to be willing to work hard and study. Otherwise, you won't pass. Attend class and do your homework! ",1
"The classes were boring, the exams were impossible, and I struggled for my C.",0
"Professor Karani is AMAZING. I took her class over a Summer session and she was great! She would go over the lectures with explanations, examples, and make us participate (which got us engaged). Extra credit opportunities! You will probably need to attend class to really understand the material, but her slides are very helpful.",1
"She's nice and smiles A LOT. The semester is spent working on one huge essay, so make sure you choose a good topic that you want to spend a lot of time with and like! She's super confusing with due dates and assignments in general. She told me my essay was good all semester then a few months in said it was wrong & I needed to talk to her... ",0
"Get on his good side and you are golden, otherwise good luck.",0
She is a very helpful teacher and takes the important points out from the book and puts them into notes which are very helpful. Reviews are about the same as the test so it helps alot..She teaches and you get alot out of her class..Great teacher!!!!,1
"Mekerta is a demanding teacher, but a fair grader. She's not afraid to give an F if you deserve it. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the texts BEFORE class starts. She will give quizzes, and they will be challenging. Go to her office hours and get to know her, she might raise your grade if she thinks you deserve it.",1
"I enjoyed his teaching of AT. He made the topics easy to understand. At times, his lectures did get boring but he teaches life lessons which were helpful. Make sure you know basic math or you will struggle a little, but ask questions, he loves to help. There is a group project and group quizzes. Make sure you take notes! It's essential.",1
"This is the first class from FSCJ That was boring. The assignments were uninteresting and so I didnt bother to complete some assignments and I prefer to take the C. There were 3 writing assignments, 5 discussions, 1 team marketing plan, and 8 quizzes. The professor was MIA for most of the class and graded all assignments after the class was over.",0
"He has very good slides presentation...but they are of no use!Dont waste paper printing them !Exams are tough....you will find nothing similar to what you have learnt throughout the course.He has his own methods of proving problems....and expects students will write on the exam paper exactly what he has in his""MIND"".In the beginig of the sem he tel",0
"Not a great professor. Pretty sure most of the class failed since the class average for every test was way below a 60%. He gives a study guide which is really a list of topics thats going to be on the exam, as long as you study each topic and do lots of examples from his slides you should be good. use Tyler Dewitt on youtube to study hes the best!!",0
"He will quickly scribble a list of ""how-to"" instructions and while your trying to catch up on writing he just explained 3 other things you have no chance of understanding anymore. He doesn't allow the student time to absorb. You may only see one example per topic. If you heard it one time and took your notes thats good enough for him. Sink or swim.",0
Class was so easy grade is based on tests only pretty much and the one easy project. I didnt even read the book and still got a's on the tests,1
She likes the whole new-agey interactive teach each other type of style. The rare times she lectured she was wonderful (VERY charismatic) but it's mostly group work. Lots of test questions end up hinging on technicalities or her interpretation but don't panic. PARTICIPATE and  demonstrate you know what you're talking about and grades will follow.,1
More work than all 3 of my other classes combined. Her class is literally a full-time job.,0
"Changed syllabus several times with no reason/warning-unclear grading policy. Took 5 plus weeks to get you back graded work (which affected all other assignments in between). Does not email back for several weeks. Knowledgeable but lazy as a professor. Not the hardest class, but insanely frustrating getting feedback. I'd avoid in the future.",0
"I could go on forever about what a terrible teacher and person she is but let me help you pass. Half way through the semester I discovered Quizlet, I was failing up to this point. She likes Lewis Medsurge textbook so study from that and her lectures and do every practice question on the topic being studied on quizlet. NCLEX is easier than her!",0
"AMAZING  teacher, very helpful, unfold the material in an excellent way, understanding and always there for his students! I took him last semester for intro Sociology and so far no teacher excel like him + he made me love the class so much !",1
This class is a complete waste of my time. i actually counted one day and in the hour and fifeteen minutes we were in class we got through a half of page of notes and the rest of the time is spent on whatever pops into her mind at the moment. great glass for an elective becasue she gives you the notes for her quizzes so you'd have to try to fail.,0
Do not take this class! Our Final exam was too long and he sent out an email before the exam saying he knows it is too long and doesn't expect us to finish it in time. Also the exams are very proof heavy. He flips a coin just 10 mins before each exam to decide if he should proctor it. Skip this class if you can.,0
"Carol is very sassy (in a good way) and is serious about history. DO THE READING! Class discussions are based on the readings that are the only form of homework, and the discussions are extremely helpful for essays and midterms. Once you submit a paper and you don't like the grade, you can submit another draft and she will regrade.",1
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0
Quite possibly the worst professor I've taken at Rutgers. Took him last year for  Research Methods and thought that it was just the class that I didn't like. He ended up teaching this class last minute and has never posted a syllabus or graded assignments from two months ago. Makes jokes at the expense of any student with a different opinion.,0
"6 films, 6 quizzes, 4 papers one of which is ""a semester long assignment,"" and 2-4 readings before every class. Completed all her papers exactly how she expected and recieved a B on all of them, with no explanation as to why. Not terrible but WAY too much work for a Gen Ed.",0
Worst mistake to take this guy... absolutely clueless,0
"If you do the HW and understand it the exams shall be straight forward. She eve gives a list practice book  problems, which DO come out on the exam. Very willing to work one on one.  Attendance isn't required but she does work out problems step by step that are in HW/Quiz/Exam then some days you get a problem you try on your own for points. ",1
Fail me although he knows my difficult situation,0
"Your grade for the whole semester will be determined solely by your grades on the four exams. There is little room for error. Also, you will most likely get frustrated in class if you do not agree with Mr. Wingender's political views, because he spends most of the time trying to push his views on you.",0
"I took Mrs. Sanborn for two semesters and she is by far the most helpful teacher that I have ever had. When going over the material she is very clear and helpful, she will make sure that you understand the material she is teaching. There is NO way you can fail her class unless you do not do the work, but she is beyond helpful, wonderful teacher!!",1
"The sweetest professor ever. I had her for Span 101 and Span 102. I never took Spanish in high school, but Profe Ana made the class easy. She knows that there are a lot of things to memorize, so she sometimes gives hints on her quizzes or exams. Restarts Wiley problems when you run out of attempts. The best prof ever! Take her class if you can :)",1
"Professor Raghunath is a very teacher in terms of giving clear guidance and providing lots of resources. Assignment is easy, as long as you finish all the stuff before deadline. I will definitely recommend Professor Raghunath to anyone who wants easy but interesting class.",1
She's very unclear and doesn't give specific instructions. You have to beg her for help. ,0
There is entirely too much work. I worked more in this class than any other. The material is fairly easy. Lectures teach you nothing. You learn everything from the homework. Probably 5-6 hours a week.,0
"EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR,CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS. I TOOK HIS HYBRID CLASS.STUDY GUIDES ARE SAME AS TEST 100-150 QUESTIONS EA TEST. 5LEC EXAMS+FINAL, 2LAB TEST+FINAL. CAN RETAKE LEC EXAM EXCEPT FINALS. TAKE HIM, HIS CLASS FILLS UP FAST.",1
Not very helpful outside of class.,0
"Lectures are lengthy and he gives out many many long packets but he explains everything you need to know for tests in his lectures. He also gives examples with personal stories, there are lots of them. He is caring and doesn't really care if you show up, but will pull you aside to ask if everything is okay.",1
Nice professor. Very well organized. She would tell you whats going to be on thetest. And very helpful. Just do all her homework and come to class and you will receive a good grade,1
"She's nice but lots of notes that aren't always relevant. Ask questions and you'll succeed, just show up and you won't.",1
"Dr. lyall is amazing and very funny. His lectures are so informative and interesting. His lectures are filled with great practical concepts. Just be aware you must complete chapter summaries, although the book is interesting. You must also submit two interview videos. I looked forward to every lecture. I love the way he teaches. ",1
"Mr. Koehler generally rants about things that have to do nothing with the material of the class. 10% of the class is spent actually looking at the material, and usually, that doesn't end up on the quizzes anyway. I have sat through multiple 2 hour and 20 minute sessions without getting a single note in my notebook.",0
This guy decided to change up his grading policy mid semester thinking it would help students. This was the first time I have ever gotten curved down in a class. He is a new prof and thought a 100 question final was fine and said 300 questions was bad. He is new and doesn't teach. I highly recommend you don't take him,0
Worst prof. graduating...actually believes too many Finance degrees are awarded at SU.  Likes to fail half the class.,0
"The material sometimes isn't very interesting but I looked forward to every class because Mrs. Mattox has wonderful stories to illustrate almost everything that she teaches and I highly recommend her for Psychology of Exceptional Children & Youth. Her tests are 40 questions, multiple choice, and not overly difficult if you've reviewed the material.",1
"Excellent teacher, touch course. You will need a study group and I definitely recommend attending SI sessions. The course is heavily based on anatomy and the majority of your grade comes from your lab. Don't be afraid to ask questions, she's intimidating, but she truly cares for her students.",1
"While you could easily get away with missing class and learning all the material via the power-points (which she posts online on OAKS), she docks points off your grade if you miss more than 3 classes (excused OR not - she takes attendence)... Tests are difficult and it's really hard to understand what she's saying in French or English. Unclear.",0
Dr. Filipe is a great prof with clear expectations. I'm sure he will becoming a better prof with time and maybe will change his assignments from year to year :-),1
"350 characters is simply not enough.  Professor Ball is the most valuable asset Fordham University has to date.  His previous ratings on this website do him no justice.  Trust me, I have no reason to boost his ratings on here, I am simply doing YOU a favor.  Just trust me, my review is the only one you need.  He is the best professor at this school",1
She is so sweet! Go to her office hours to see the exam or for help. She'll answer anything and tell you how to study. It's really nice to have a professor who doesn't ridicule you for your questions!,1
Fantastic teacher. He has the class laughing all the time but he still does well teaching a hard subject. Choose him if you can.,1
"Close to retirement & she could care less, skips steps when teaching, Hates 2 show how 2 work problem fully, 2 HW assignments & quizzes online wkly, Shell never know how well u do individually because all work is done & graded online, Test are in class & must show work & thats the only time shell know if u know how 2 do prob & still wont care",0
He was a good professor and was very knowledgeable of the material. 4 tests that were 25 questions and 4 assignments worth 10 points. 140 points makes up this class with a few extra credit assignments.  For 100 level course the tests were somewhat difficult. Overall good class and professor.,1
"As a freshman Biochem major I took this as a prereq, and for being a level 100 class it was very rough. I missed only 2 lectures, took all the notes, did all the readings, and did all of the study guides he provided but struggled to maintain a C. The tests are very hard, I would recommend to take Psych 1o1 instead.",0
"he is a DRAMA KING!!!!He spices up Psychology to the max. He is well rounded and hes has wisdom, knowledge and understanding in his field. HE IS THE MUST HAVE THE BOMB!!",1
"Connor's lectures are extremely boring. All he does is read off of slides that he has already put on Brightspace. When teaching a heavy material subject, a little more enthusiasm and preparation on the teacher's part would be apprectiated. The use of youtube and khan academy is recommended as you will need to teach yourself. Beware: GPA killer",0
"He is a very nice man, will help you if you seek it. However, if chemistry is not your strong suit, take a different professor. He does not provide powerpoints, he just does a bunch of problems on the board and messes up a lot and confuses things.",0
"Alicia is very pasionate and funny, her jokes will make you laugh but the summer course for span149 is a pain.  Too much to learn for 100 level course and the quizzes is hard to get a good grade.  Not a course to boost your grade at all.",0
"Literally the worst professor Ive ever had in my life. Hardly anyone passed the exam, and the average was around a 65 consistently for exams. Passionate about the subject but not good at teaching. Would not recommend",0
"Had my reservations about him prior, but this was the best class I had.  I heard he may teach other classes poorly but insurance is his wheelhouse.  He is undoubtedly an insurance super expert.  I learned an incredible amount.  Tests were not impossible but challenging.  I got all A's.  This class was for 3 hours long and in no way was boring.",1
The poems and stories definitely weren't for me however i managed to get a B with very little effort. She is a great lady and helps/wants you do succeed in the course.,1
"Professor Perkins lacks in the area of professionalism. I have never been so offended by an educator. She constantly berades her minority students and passes it off as having a "" unique and hands-on"" teaching style. There also have been several instances where I have feared for my personal safety under her leadership.",0
"As other said, and at this time I have to add, even in an online class, be ready for this teacher to go off topic, very unorganized, shares too much of her private life. I will say if the class were face to face she would have been talking about her life all day long. No offense but may be it is time to stay home and enjoy your family.",0
"Buhler is a basic professor who is out to prove a point. If you really want to learn the concepts, take an online Algorithms course, or just read CLRS by yourself.  You'll learn more and get your money's worth. 541T is not worth the tuition cost or time. If you do take it, be sure to cheat on HW. Everyone else does.",0
"Dr. Moorhouse is by far one of the most knowledgable people in the health professions college, and in general for that matter. His lectures are wonderful and entertaining, he gives plenty of extra credit and is super caring about all of his students. Anyone saying otherwise must have never spoken to Dr. M!",1
"Honestly, she expects that you know everything that she is ""teaching."" She flies by material, and doesn't slow down. If you can avoid her, I would, just make sure you don't take Andreeva either. ",0
Prof. Donato is a horrible person. I cannot believe he is a Professor at Bentley. I took him as a freshman. He was terrible-- way too hard for a 100 level course. Multiple 10-15 page papers and the cold calling is unreal. I can't stand him and would never take him again / hope to never see him again.,0
"He is accessible outside of class but it is hard to understand. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. Tests & quizzes are not hard but can be tricky since he is not specific about what he wants you to study. Make sure to keep communication open, he is willing to help and is not strict about deadlines. He wants his students to do well.",1
Attendance points every class. She is very sassy and doesn't answer questions directly/ is not helpful. Half of the class consists of online labs using SPSS. The course reader helped a lot and she gives you a cheat sheet on the final.,0
"He assumed that the student knew too much, was too fast on his examples, and didn't seem interested in talking to his students after class. He was not helpful in the least. I would recommend anyone who may struggle with math to steer clear of him.",0
"Cool, laid back guy. Just lectures from a slideshow, emails you the slides after class. Gives two tests, which are super easy. Def take if you're not the best science.",1
"I don't know what others here are talking about. She's a very nice teacher. She responds quickly to emails. The exams are timed which is very nerve-wracking but it's how it's done in person so I don't mind. At the end of every exam, she gives 10 extra credits which is ALOT. Chem is a hard subject overall so get ready to study hard.",1
"Worst teacher ever. Studying in KPU from 2 years, never dealt with this kind of stupid teacher. Never take any course with this guy. Doesnt know ""C""m of coding just copying code from internet and showing videos. If the teacher is reading, I want to ask how data structure is related to AVENGERS movie budget.",0
"Online class. Everything is laid out for you + there are no lectures. You read the textbook + do weekly assignments. This might seem nice, but I see no point in having the professor when the textbook does her job for her. Also, midterm/final have 100+ questions that ask you to memorize VERY specific info from the text - poor, lazy test design.",0
"Dr. Zeng's class was a very difficult subject but she helped us understand the materials with homework, team class exercises, and quizzes. The students knew exactly what to study or exams. She is passionate about economics and is very accessible outside class. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her.",1
Econ is hard but flannery makes it a little easier. His powerpoints and slides make no sense but he explains everything enough to where you can get the point. Hes also funny sometimes,1
"Dr. Li is very nice. He enjoys getting to know students. I didn't like how he taught the class. It was a lot of information (especially on cells) and he wouldn't explain a lot of things. The labs were tough because he was extremely particular on how things were drawn. Even if an organelle was not on the microscope slide, he still wanted it drawn.",1
"I have never failed anything in my life.  I put hours in trying to study on my own.  Why do I go to college to try and teach myself.  This professor is unorganized, wants to cover only what is required each week according to his weekly agenda, does not answers questions, tells you to see him before class. Unorganized. DO NOT take his class.",0
I love her,1
"This professor is the worst!! She is rude and mean. She does not care to help students, Laughs at us when we ask questions. She is writes rude emails and is rude when you go to her office hours for help. Despite her being hard to understand and confusing, she is not nice at all.",0
Debate coach. The cheese. They rock but make sure youre keeping up with homework and your debate stuff or else you will feel it.,1
"she's really easy going, fun teacher, nice class. her marking is lenient too. go for it!",1
"Alright, Ted is a great guy. Young, relates well to students, cracks jokes, knowledgeable. But he was very unclear and even confused himself at times teaching the slides; students had to correct his mistakes. His tests are ridiculously long and hard, even for a 50 minute class. Also, if you ask him a question during a test, he won't help at all.",0
"Tolich isn't the most exciting guy, but that's not what you need from your physics professor. Lectures are clear and informative. He's accessible outside of class and seems to genuinely care about students. Was really helpful when I missed a midterm due to illness. Solid choice for sure.",1
"difficult, but necessary",1
"Gerritsen is one of my favorite professors at SUNY Cortland. He is willing to do whatever it takes to make the material understandable, and will put in countless extra time if it's not. I recommend taking a class with Gerritsen, if not for the credits, then just to get to know him, hear his stories, and learn a thing or two about the real world.",1
When i hear her name i think of charlie brown.. waawaawaa,0
"He is a really nice man and a kind teacher but he does expect you to know things beforehand which is not always true. He does not really teach during his lectures, I think the book helped us learn how to code more than him. He is willing to answer questions and help you. His wording in assignments tends to be confusing,",0
This woman is crazy. She told us not to let kids use glitter because they will sniff it. She should retire. Avoid her class because you will learn nothing.,0
Wonderful teacher. She gives a quiz every time you walk into class. They are open note. She takes some of the questions off of your homework and puts them on the quiz. Make sure you do the homework. The quizzes are just to help improve grades. Not anything too hard.,1
"The class isn't the easiest, but she's the best professor to take it with.",1
"His tests are extremely hard. If you must take this class, I recommend a light load, it is very time consuming. His study guides and lectures barely cover anything he asks. The test are timed and questions and very tricky. I was on youtube a lot for better understanding. Also do the extra credit even tho it cost extra, it will help in the end.",0
"Gives an outline each class with underlined terms. On the exam, there will be an essay (100 pts) and 8 ID's  (underlined terms from outlines) & you need to choose 4/8 to elaborate on (100 pts) These 8 ID's could be any of the 40-50 terms from the outlines. Miss notes? you won't have enough info on ID's. Doesnt give any clues which ID's are on exam.",0
He is humorous. He makes you feel comfortable in class and lab also. But he does care what you have done in lab. He is helpful and highly appreciates your efforts. Good teacher,1
would only recommend this class if you really enjoy journalism and I mean really enjoy it. The professor is very demanding of how he wants things done and there is a ton of writing for this class,0
"SOC 201 is interesting and, thanks to this professor, inspirational. I'm a conscientious student so I did a lot of studying to earn the A. There are good opportunities for extra points that actually help you study the material. Read the book, take notes, watch the videos, take quizzes. Can't wait for her SOC 222 as well. Join me!",1
"Assignment submission areas are disorganized. Not very responsive in emails. Had an issue with exams that I was hoping he help me with, ended up grading me as incomplete instead when I had all the work done. Not a good online course experience, caused a lot of stress towards the grading period. If you are working online, please choose someone else.",0
"Dr. Best did a great job with medical sociology this semester. Interesting content, easy to follow",1
"She also made me change my major! she's ridiculous. We spend the whole class talking about what we are going to be ""talking"" about but we never actually cover again. Tests are ridiculous. On her test i got a question wrong because she claimed an animal cell has a cell wall! completely has no control over english!",0
"At the end of the term, my whole class agreed that we would miss the lectures, but not the course. The lectures genuinely made my day sometimes, just because the environment was so friendly and fun--which is a weird thing to say, but still. Read the textbook, do your homework, study hard, and go to office hours if necessary, and you'll be okay.",1
Dr. Batman is usually confused and unable to write out the answer to his own problem because he forgets steps or starts over three or four times. He really needs a wake-up call because he is failing to get students engaged because they do not understand the material.,0
Take this class with CAUTION!,0
I was so excited to take this class but it's definitely hard to take online. We didn't have scheduled meeting times (but there were office hours). My only issue is that it was hard to follow and understand what was going on. You really need to live by the syllabus. Not hard once you figure everything out.,1
great teacher..you must work hard but you can get an a,1
He meets with everyone after the first and second project and gives great feedback. This course requires a lot of effort.,1
Don't do it. Just DON'T,0
"Excellent professor. As straightforward as one gets. She's tough, but if you do the work and come to class religiously, as anyone should, you WILL get an A. But know this- you need to understand the material and DO the problems. Taking notes simply will not help. Look over her slides, do all the problems and you really should do well on her exams.",1
Took her for the summer course and it was a lot of fun. Quizes before class on readings but pretty straight forward and simple. Really fun professor and she definitely knows her stuff. The class was really fun just try to engage in what is being talked about and you'll be fine. As long as you go to class and try you'll have no issues with thisclass,1
"feels like the class was moving so quick in one week we would finish two chapters plus you need to do so much homework, for every section it felt so over whelemed and most of the homework is not explained how to go about so i was loosing points. if you like RUSHED class with alot of HW then take this class.",0
"This class had new curriculum for my semester that relied on using a workbook with a group to work through an activity every class period. We never had a lecture, which was much more interactive than lecture form. He is very eager to answer questions. He is very compassionate and willing to give you a good grade as long as he can see youre working.",1
"Easily one of the nicest people you will ever meet. Even though waking up for a 7:30 was rough, his attitude towards teaching and Latin made it easier. We had vocab quizzes almost everyday which aren't that bad, and he cuts you slack if you don't do the translations.",1
I really enjoyed her class she makes lectures interesting and she even tells the students jokes before exams she is very nice. iclicker questions will bring your grade up so you must attend to class she gives you 2 questions per class. I would take another class with her. ,1
"Yvonne looks for passion, and creativity. Show interest in the subject and show up to class and you will have her respect.  There is a million humanities classes at normandale, talk to her why you choice this one.  She will be understanding and lenient on grading if you talk to her about it, but she does have basic expectations.",1
"Horrendous is the only way to describe this class and professor. Constantly unprepared, has no idea when her own due dates are, and halfway through this online summer class and the first assignment has yet to be graded. Mountains of busy work between team (group) assignments, individual assignments, for a short summer class. Ridiculous.",0
I love Patti - she's brilliant and funny and passionate about things that I didn't think I was interested in but I could see her point. I'd take her again,1
"Super funny professor with great lectures! Tests are easy! You will notice something in common with complainers, they don't go to the lectures or don't watch them online. If you watch the lectures and READ the book, you will get an A on the online, open book, open notes test. This is the easiest class, I've ever done at MDC. Take him!",1
"if you have this teacher, don't even try to pay attention, just read the book.  That is all he does in classto teach anyways.",0
"Mary is so sweet and has such a big heart.  She really cares about her students, and she'll make it impossible for you to dislike her class.  She honestly does her best to make sure you do well in class.  She's super fun, cute, hip, and she totally rocks!",1
"Go to class, just go. Go to office hours the second you need help, he is more than willing to help, but it's hard to do that in class lectures due to the class size and the fast pace of his classes. Don't wait till the last minute to do homework. Get a tutor if econ isn't your thing. Always go to test reviews. It's a difficult course.",1
"I was advised not to but honestly, the class was not that difficult. She states that this class is often a make or break class for non physics majors so she caters to us. Exams were replicas of class work and videos she provided. I liked the class because it was easy but our personalities did not blend well. She was nice but got on my nerves.",1
"You will LIVE in your textbook. She is a loving person but the worst professor I have ever taken. Unfortunately she is just uneducated, a bad teacher andirresponsible. She DOES NOT HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING, lab or lecture. ""What does the book say?"" She simply doesn't know the material well enough toteach it the 1 time she answered me, she was wrong.",0
"This class was loads of fun. Super nice and hilarious professor. With the transition to online learning midway through the year, she did a phenomenal job",1
"He's OK, but he's boring. I took his three hour class I just was so BORED. He's so old-fashioned and the books we had to read to write essays on were incredibly boring as well. Make sure you read book after book because he won't warn you that you should have your rough draft done by the next week. I felt like I was wasting time.",1
I loved Prof. Kroll. He is the best econ teacher by far for AREC202. He is able to explain difficult topics really well and wants to make sure that everyone is doing ok. He is a hilarious man and his lectures are engaging. You can tell that he loves what he does. I totally recommend taking him. The only downside to the class is the clickers.,1
"I am warning u all now....this class is not a joke. If u love Anthropology, then take it. She is very passionate and intelligent but there is TONS of work. Like way more than 300 levels. Tons and tons of useless work. Tough readings. Don't take unless u absolutely have to. U will regret it",0
"this guy speaks in a sign language.although helpfull personally but tests are so hard, going to class meaningless, i would rather jab a fork in my mouth than take any class from him.",0
"Epley's class is super annoying.  She's nice, although she is borderline insane. Going to class is generally pointless, but it is mandatory for credit. You get points for participation, so throw in some comments to humor her. Her essay topics are incredibly stupid, and the length requirement is entirely too long.  Easy A, I could deal w her again.",0
"Moshe is nice, and he's definitely smart - which he will make known. A bit arrogant, but nothing too extreme I guess. He's a tough grader though, especially on his exams that were short answer-based. He will pick things apart kinda harshly. The content of the course is interesting, and he delivers it in a fun manner, but he should ease up a bit.",1
"Nan is a tough grader, but it's definitely possible to get an A in the class if you work for it. You write three news stories, I got above a 90 on all of them - bring your rough drafts to her office hours and she'll tell you exactly what to fix. Her lectures are sort of boring, but there are no tests! Pretty easy!",1
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
"I had the privilege of taking all three of Pittman's classes: Comparative Relg., Hist. of Christianity, and Geography. Out of all the Professors at RBC, she was definitely my favorite. Her tests aren't hard if you take good notes. She is a very approachable, and nice lady who is always willing to help if you need it. Take this professor's class :)",1
"She's obsessed with Ireland.  That's all she talks about in the spring semester, before her annual trip.  If you have a problem in the class, go outside and grab a stick. You'll get more assistance from it.",0
"Higgins was for sure my favorite prof at UW so far. She really cares about each individual student . Definitely needed the books for class because we talk about the readings in discussion and a lot of the readings are questions on the tests. Overall, great prof, hard class, but would take it again.",1
"Her lectures are long, dry, and boring. She is knowledgeable, however; she lacks structure and clarity in both the lectures and exams.  In her Japanese history class, the exams are heavily influenced on Japanese names and terms versus historical events. 60-200 pages assigned to read per week. very tough grader. Waste of time and tuition. ",0
Hard to get in contact with via email. Failed to pique my interests in the subject. Quizzes where pretty easy as well as the final which was on campus. He put in the final grade after D2L closed the class so I was unable to even see my grade for the final smh. Wouldn't recommend him unless someone had no choice. ,1
"she goes off topic a lot, makes it hard to pay attention and understand her",0
Love Venus he is definitely one of my favorite professors at Gordon. Such a good personality he has dark humor but he is very funny if ur into that. His work is not hard had a lot of quizzes but there easy I came to every class and did all my assignments so Im sure I will b finishing with an A. I would definitely recommend him to anybody,1
He is the most AMBIGUOUS and CONTRADICTING teacher I've ever taking. He'll say he expects one thing and you ask for clarity so he says something else but then in the end he really meant something else. You never have any idea of what he wants. He is very difficult to figure out and changes his mind on what he said very often. NEVER AGAIN,0
She needs to care more about students.,0
"Dawn was a very hard teacher, she expects you to know all the material already. In class there is 5 mins of instruction and its basically her telling stories about her job that don't connect to what you are learning. Class time is 2 hours of study so be prepared for that. She doesn't teach the material, you will have to learn it on your own.",0
"Lecture's optional but I would recommend going because they are entertaining and he includes real world applications to what you're learning. He cares that you learn the material and succeed as opposed to trying to fail you, which is a nice change of pace in the ME college.",1
gives us extra credit with helps alot.,1
"One of the best professors hands down, makes the class super clear and her enthusiasm she brings to class makes class enjoyable. Take her if you get the chance!",1
"He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.",0
"Melissa is a literal blessing of a teacher. She was really kind, easily accessible if you have questions, and she gives great feedback on every assignment. As long as you put some kind of effort into your work you will be well on your way to an A. I would definitely recommend.",1
"Dr. Norris is cool (for this class). There is a quiz each Monday but during his lectures, he will tell you exactly what is on it. He'll say, ""In the not too distant future, someone WILL ask you..."" There's a lot of information that you need to memorize but he makes it easy. Quiz every Monday, 1 midterm, 1 final & a paper... piece of cake.",1
"Asynchronous, does review once a week of the chapter we read(optional). Weekly quizzes (pre quiz & post lecture quiz) on Cengage. 2 midterms & 1 final, really hard tests. Professors accent is hard to understand.",1
THIS PROF WILL MAKE YOU DO WORK. YOU MUST ATTEND EVERY CLASS HE WONT EVEN LET YOU GET A SIP OF WATER HE WILL DOCK YOUR TIME FOR THAT AND MARK YOU ABSENT OR LATE FOR THE DAY. HE HELPS THE NONSENSE STUDENTS WHO DONT EVEN CARE ABOUT HIS CLASS AND THE STUDENTS WHO TAKE HIM SERIOUS RECIEVE AN F! THIS GUY NEEDS TO READ THIS POST SO HE CAN CHANGE,0
"She is one of the best professors at Baruch. She cares for her students and is determined to deliver, if students participate. I was in her 1st batch at Baruch. Awesome woman and a wonderful Professor. She knows her stuff well, you just have to work hard to earn a good grade.",1
I found myself often feeling very upset in class. She centres people out in front of everyone and embarrasses them. I felt sick most classes wondering if I was next to be picked on that I couldn't even focus. My advice is to try your best to go unnoticed by her.,0
Physics sucks He's the easiest out of the phys prof He's difficult af if you dk how he works to pass & maybe even get a decent grade Do ALL the mastering & written hw its a ton don't wait until last min answers on google WATCH LEC VID & WRITE DWN ALL EQ & WHEN TO USE THEM IN 1 PLACE- exams r xactly like hw but 3 ?s WRITE IN DETAIL WHEN TO USE EQ!!,1
"This class was both very enjoyable and enlightening, despite it being my earliest class all semester! Professor Henigman is smart, encouraging, and accessible. She goes out of her way to make sure everyone's comments are heard and validated during the discussion. The required film viewings are lots of fun too!",1
excellent,1
"If you do the readings and write the essays, you will likely do well, but not because of his teaching. He is often unprepared and goes on inconsequential and (often weirdly sexual) tangents that will not help you decipher the texts at all. You learn much more in discussion than class. Calls every female student ""dear"". Wouldn't recommend taking.",0
"Not my cup of tea. Assigned a ton of reading, expected really high level in class essays. I say stay away from her.",0
The most approachable professor I've had. He cares about students and is even willing to help outside of the class. I would recommend him to other students.,1
"easiest classes ever, online classes, even though it said writing intensive but not much to do this class, easy A",1
"Great professor. You definitely have to do the assignments. Homework and quizzes every week. It took a little to get use to,but it wasn't long. You get to comment on your own personal thoughts, which is nice. There is one paper due towards the end of the semester. Really glad I had Professor Smith for this class.",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but it will be very difficult to pass if you don't go. He always makes himself available to students for help outside of office hours. It is important to him that you understand the basics. Everything stems from them.",1
"I thought this class would be interesting, but he provdides no chronological order to his lectures and its very hard to find a link to all the info he is giving you. A nice man but expects alot out of his students, and a hard marker.",0
"horrible! horrible! horrible! He seems like a cool teacher at first but very confusing on his grading and instructions. 3 test thats tough. Tough grader, long lectures, has favorites but makes you feel uncomfortable about learning.",0
"I took archaeology out of a general interest for the field and prof. brown didnt disappoint, he does alot of full class lectures but keeps them interesting using physical as well as digital examples and honestly I never fell asleep in his class so they must've been interesting lectures. I would definitely take another ANT class again and recommend.",1
"I studied the power-points to prepare for exams and always got an A. I think the syllabus said the access code/textbook was required so I bought it, but never needed to use it. As long as you try you can get an A.",1
"Your success in this class is up to your TA. Mine was great and made everything very clear. Gilmore is intelligent and gives somewhat engaging lectures, but his examples are all very abstract and to understand the notes and handouts it'll take a few tries. TA does all of the grading too, and he held midterm prep sessions. So the TA is important!!!!",1
"I took characteristics online. TOUGH. There's a lot due every week including a quiz. YOU HAVE TO READ THE TEXTBOOK TO PASS THE QUIZZES. The quiz questions aren't easy. I wouldn't say it's a super hard class, but it's not an easy A like a lot of Kent's online classes.",1
"Lectures are terrible, and to make them worse, she quiz at the beginning or end of the lecture. Not organized and I felt genuinely did not care about teaching.",0
She is fun to listen to and makes me want to go to class. She is polite to her Students.,1
By far without a doubt the worse professor I've ever had. She changes her grading rubric weekly. I am convinced she comes up with her own rules of the English language and grades your papers based on that. Avoid her at all costs.,0
"Dr. Krell is my Dissertation Chair. He provides great feedback, he provides resources and is very supportive. Dr. Krell does not give just pass you, You will earn the grade. I would recommend Dr. Krell as a professor. He will help you as long as you help yourself. Get ready to work, it will pay off in the end",1
"Professor Spearman made this class enjoyable.  There are two readings that need to be read before class everyday and a four question quiz at the beginning of class over those readings.  The lectures really helped me connect the daily readings to important literary concepts. The final grade consisted of: quizzes, 2 exams,  and 2 writing assignments.",1
Great professor. Algorithms was very interesting.,1
"She's the worst prof I've had. Sweet but cannot teach. My friend and I compared assignments and we'd have the same answers but one of us would be wrong and the other right. Expectations were unclear, lectures boring, extremely unorganized and if you ask for clarification, she just repeats herself. You have to teach yourself. I don't recommend her.",0
Save yourself the struggle and take Ryba. She uses his material anyways except Ryba is much clearer and actually knows how to explain the topics well. Take her only if for some reason you have to retake the course and you know half of the material already.,0
Sweet. Knows and loves her subject well.,1
"She is the nicest professor I had till now. She was the first professor I took my class with in US and till date she is my best professor. I really like her, she is not a very hard grader. She wants her students to do good.",1
"Dr. Mitchell was very loud, funny, and outspoken (can be seen as rude). No homework, 4 exams, and 10 labs. Labs are worth 200 points, since he drops the 2 lowest. Do labs for an easy 200 points. First two exams are very hard, which weeds many students out. Stick to the final 2 and they get much easier. Drops lowest exam. Hard but passable class.",0
Extremely helpful and fun.  Highly recommend taking her classes.,1
Very Difficult. If I could give her a 0 I would. The learning style is horrible. When Ms. Lewis go over the lesson its like she never taught them before. She do quizzes portfolios and Aleks as well. Not will to work with you.,0
Professor Maltman runs fun energetic classes in writing.  Time flies and you leave a much better writer than before.,1
Excellent professor. Genuinely wants her students to do well and will explain things in a variety of ways in order to ensure that everybody gets it. Her experience outside of academia shows because she emphasizes the topics that are actually used on the job. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,1
"He can be interesting, but he records and posts all his lectures and slides online. The text was very interesting. He is a bit rude. Had no problem until grades were released and it said I hadn't taken the final, which I had. He ended up losing my scantron and giving me a lower grade then I had earned. His TA was useless.",0
"He was a a really good wisner. Loved his class, got an A.",1
"Prof. Dana is amazing! Her lectures are informative, you can really learn much helpful knowledge from lectures. She is also a very kind person, feel free to ask her questions related to class, she will explain clearly for you!",1
"If you need a science class take him, easiest class ever; it's almost impossible not to get an A. Only gives three exams, and he gives out study guides, and literally puts the same thing on the exam. I did not pay attention in class and I just made sure I studied the guides and I got a 100%. He's also really nice and super chill.",1
"Grading was unclear and inconsistent for detailed reports  for the simulation. He assigned a lot of busy work and some that does not seem to have any value or take away for the purpose of the class, wasted time. Group project was a problem, unfair structure and not all students are held accountable for knowing basic concepts prior to the project.",0
"Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree",0
Prof. Zhao is a pretty chill professor. The course content is a bit dry due to the nature of subject. The course consists of 2 midterms and 1 final making up 90% of the grade with 10% biweekly homework. The tests are pretty straightforward (although the class average always seem to be low). A relatively easy A compare to other econ classes.,1
"He is a good human being, but his tests are tough. Not too much homework, but a lot of reading. Sometimes when M.R jones talks, he uses a lot of pronouns, so you miss what he is talking about. Also, half of the class is about brain anatomy which is in my opinion, not a part of psychology.",0
"this is the worst class i have taken in my three years at hamilton; i advise you to avoid it like the plague unless you like unnecessary requirements and more work than you've ever gotten in your life.  while nice enough, werner expects everyone to have a significant background in world politics.",0
"Dr. Borglin was very helpful. Will come to lab an hour or so earlier to go over anything students need help with. Ask for help, and you shall recieve. Fair grader, easy to understand. Do the work that is assigned and you will do fine on the quizzestestsexams.",1
"Took Calc 1 over the summer with her, amazingly attentive toward every student, and extremely helpful both in and out of the classroom. I have nothing but great things to say about her",1
"He rarely lectured, if he did he rushed thru the material and most likely, his lecture had NOTHING to do with exams. You are expected to read and teach yourself-- however, good luck trying to decide what obscure questions he will ask on exams. Worst prof.",0
"I loved her teaching style. Very informed and actually interested in what you have to say. Easy to talk to, and willing to work with you for you to succeed. Would highly recommend her to anyone. Great proff that cares about her students.",1
"If you're in his class for Quantitative Methods, I have only one piece of advice for you. GET OUT NOW! How he is qualified as a teacher is beyond me. You will not LEARN anything, but you will pass his in-class tests very easily. Beware come exam time as the only thing you will only have learned how to copy off others. Ho' Boy, Enjoy... ",0
"Avoid at all cost, probably the most frustrating educator I've ever met in my life. Constantly changing teaching plan and grading criteria. You have no idea about what you're actually doing and what to expect. Better teach yourself phonology than attending her class.",0
"Lizs lectures are unorganized & unprepared. She does not use visual aids which hinders the learning of majority of her students. She is incredibly soft spoken & without personality. Her lectures are dry, long & seemingly unimportant. It is hard to evaluate what information is most important in her lectures & what will be found on tests and exam",0
"He does not go through any examples and just shows the answer. Rather learn on my own. Spends way too much time explaining concepts and its hard to follow along since he struggles to speak fluently and constantly says ""uh"". His lectures are the opposite of engaging you'll wanna just teach it yourself and wish you switched to another professor.",0
"He uses Wiley for his class but he does not teach us anything because in every class, he just writes the homework on the board and does not explain the reasoning behind it. Sorry, but not for me, especially that this information will be on the CPA and I gotta teach myself all of it.",0
thick language. forces to learn the problems her way. is always cancelling class at last second. do not take her if you want to fail,0
"Professor Conway does nothing but read off his powerpoints every lecture. There are few opportunities for grades in this class so make them count, especially considering he is a very hard grader. He will pick out the smallest detail in an assignment just so you don't get a 100. Don't take the class if you don't have to.",0
Ben is a really nice and smart guy but I do not recommend his class. He's very confusing. He tries to help but usually just confuses you more. He does use the online part of the Algebra 1 and 2 textbook which has great examples if you follow along. They have examples and online personnel to help with questions. It's the only reason I did so well.,0
"Nicola's use of the Canvas website had a lot of difficulties. she has pop quizzes and would take pictures of the board but then forget to post. I emailed her once asking how to turn in an assignment because it was unclear on Canvas, and she never got back to me. Overall, Nicola and her TA's taught this class with little regard for her students.",0
"I had Dr. Attard for mechanics of solids. Cute guy but really tough. He talks fast and really knows his stuff, but man, he will work your tail off studying outside of class. He won't pull any punches on exams and will test the fundamentals, but you REALLY need to know your fundamentals in detail. Having just a ""general idea"" won't cut it.",1
"I really enjoyed having Nolan as my TA. The class is not an easy A, but it is really interesting and Nolan is always there to help unpack hard concepts. He always made time for me because I couldn't make it to his office hours and answered emails within the hour.",1
"Maybe it's my hearing, but I could barely understand her. Half the lecture I'm trying to understand what she's saying because she pronounces word very differently, and the other half I'm lost because I do not understand what's on the board.",0
very passionate and knowledgable,1
Very nice person but not the best professor. She goes way too fast and makes you feel dumb if you don't know an answer. She is willing to help but has an attitude which makes you not wanna ask at all!! Wouldn't recommend unless you're good in math!,1
"She is SO unaccessible. She teaches at like 3 different places, doesn't always reply to emails, and has a grad student do ALL of her grading. If you want to feel like you're taking a pointless and difficult class with no teacher, take Oakley. She isn't helpful but still grades harshly. Complete waste of time, do not recommend.",0
"Rudest professor at FAU. He seems to hate what he does. He is very confusing on explaining the material, and makes it too hard to understand. Run away!",0
the man knows a lot about the ocean but his lectures are as boring as watching paint dry. His knowledge of technology is terrible and usually put the opposite of what he says will be on the exam. the funniest thing about him was that he put his office hours around the same time as the class we had. Nice guy but you can tell he doesn't want to teach,0
"Terrible. This prof wasn't engaged at all, just assigned work with not real follow up. Wouldn't take any of his classes again.",0
Prof. Baez is a very funny and caring professor who takes class to the next level. His lectures were so in depth and he really makes sure that the class knows what is going on with the material. There is weekly homework that he goes over if there are any questions and he hands out an in depth study guide to prepare for the tests. His class was fun.,1
"He is a good guy but not the greatest professor. His lectures are very unclear and boring and it is very hard to understand him. He has a very strong accent. Although his class is easy and an easy A. Just go to class and you will pass the class. But be prepared to sit through long, boring and unclear lectures.",0
"Professor Stevens was straight forward with what he expected from the class. If you go to him with your graded homework's he will walk you through what you missed, and even offered extra credit opportunities. Would take him again!",1
"Extremely intelligent and interesting individual with a great interest and passion for what he is teaching. Really broke down the literature to a level that I understood &connected with. Holds high expectations regarding work, participation, &attendance and WILL educate you (as any GOOD professor should, because thats what we're paying for, right?)",1
Stein is a great and fun professor. There are plenty of times that he made the whole class laugh. He teaches out of the book and from problems worked out in class. Homework is optional but recommended if you want to learn. Attendance is taken everyday and will affect your grade. Quizzes are almost guaranteed every Friday. ,1
"Erika's class is ridiculously easy, but beyond boring. I love anthropology, but this class made me want to sleep. I sat on my phone during every class and ended up with an A. Erika also is strict on her grading in weird ways, like turning in assignments. I was NOT a fan of her as a professor. She just talks and talks and talks until you sleep.",0
"Dr. Juncaj is amazing! Everything she teaches you in class is on the exams. She also provides some review packets which are exactly what is on the test. She helps you understand something if you dont get it and her homework is nothing too crazy, its usually lightwork and helps when studying.",1
"taught u stuff that was not applicable till the next test so she would teach u new material right before a test, that is foolishness",0
"As many have said, brilliant physicist, horrible teacher. First day he gave assessment exams because the uni told him his fail rate was too high. There are no 'pre-tests' anymore, no kind of study guide given, just told to do the homework again (loads of homework at that). Only three tests and a final, with no curve.",0
"This was an online course, 5 quizzes, midterm, final, and 8+page essay. Everything was really easy, quizzes were based on the ppt and required readings. Provides study guides which help a lot. She provides an example paper for the essay which helps a lot because the essay can be a little tricky/confusing, oh you get to work in partners for this.",1
"Stay away from any of her classes as much as you can! I used to wish that I could get hit by a car before going to her class. I cannot urge you enough to stay away from this professor. I may have gotten a decent grade but I had to fight tooth and nail for that. Please, stay away.",0
"Shes not a bad professor, however sometimes she does not really answer questions and is not clear at all.  The whole semester is sitting watching classmates present their lesson.  Two big papers to do that are tedious but otherwise it is easy just boring",0
"One of the most inconsistent professors when it comes to grading. He grades papers primarily off of quantity over quality, so if you aren't good at writing fluff, he is not the professor for you. He does not have a clear grading criteria and will often base your grade on your performance in class. If you care about your GPA, I would not recommend.",0
Prof. Kopp really helps you come out of your shell. Public speaking can be difficult for some and Kopp made it a welcoming and less intimidating environment. Speeches are graded fairly easy as long as you're prepared and follow the criteria sheets. Quizzes every Sunday based off the online textbook chapters & are also super easy.,1
"I took this class as a session A so it was very fast paced. Every 5 days there was discussion posts, a quiz, and a 'media critique' due. There would be a few readings per module and videos (some videos are documentaries so don't wait until the last minute to watch them). The media critiques are 250 words minimum and quiz are around 15 questions.",1
"Didnt learn much from this guy, and the only reason I passed was because the answers on his multiple choice practice exams were actually the same on his actual test.  So theres that.",0
I highly recommend taking Dr. Reese's online course. He gives you a very clear syllabus with all the dates on it of when everything will be due and all assignments are due on the same dates every week. A few quizzes here and there and one paper. He's also very good at getting back to you when you need to contact him.,1
Unclear about class he's teaching & unorganized.,0
"Didn't enjoy the class at all.  The professor wasn't very helpful at all, but in the end, it was an easy A.",0
"! If you ask him a question most times he wont answer and will say well if you read your notes you would know. He also graded extremely hard, gave very difficult exams with over 70 multiple choice questions and short answers. No laptops or talking in class. If you disturb class in any way he will absolutely lose it.",0
"His lecture style is not for everyone, he assume you know  the material in advance which sucks because  that is what we are their  for to learn it.  His grading policy was unclear at the end. He skips and goes back and forth in the text , no powerpoints. If you are a visual learner don't take him. Overall I did not like his style. not approachable",0
All he does is lecture until the end of the semester when he will give you a six to eight page paper. This can be hard to if you have other classes that have tests in also. So take him when you do not have any other classes that take up a lot of time. Knows his stuff!,1
"Randomly jumps years,religions,people,topics. ",0
"His class was the best online class I've ever had and I've taken alot. You do have to do the work but his grading is very fair. Even though it is an online class, he is friendly and gives you feedback on your work which I appreciated. He did have different due dates for assignments but it never changed which was nice.",1
"The approach of this professor is to have a seminar style discussion of ancient philosophy. Because of this, you need to do the reading, highlight the main ideas, and be able to interpret them for the classroom. Knowing the assigned material for the day was mandatory when I took the class, yet attendance was not. Testing based on individual's notes",1
A very nice and approachable professor who was willing to meet with me. Be sure to ask for help as many of the students thought that they were doing fine on their projects and then dropped the class when they found out otherwise.,1
"2 in 1 class. Computer programming & whatever your really taking. You don't have a computer? To bad & you can not download vPython on school computers. I informed him nothing done. HW, never told what is needed for full credit & you will never see full credit. You get a new comment each time. Test easy question but show everything Formula & mult -1",0
"Sara is the best teacher I've ever had at BGSU. I've had her for multiple THFM classes, and I learned so much in each. People think she's ""tough"" but she just has high expectations for her students and doesn't expect less than their best efforts. If I hadn't just graduated, I wouldndefinitely take more classes with her in the future. ",1
"I had Professor Bushey for CHEM131 and he was fine, however having him for 132 was hell. He is not good at explaining material, and often moves wayyy too fast. He got some of his own answers wrong and made the learning catalytics very stressful and due at the very beginning of class, but would get you the code minutes before. Not taking him again.",0
"His accent is extremely hard to understand. I understand he is extremely smart and willing to help, he just doesn't understand how to teach or interact with the students. He has his back to the class almost the whole time writing problems on the board. It is extremely hard to pay attention and I would recommend finding another professor.",0
"Sociology of Aging. I did not like the way the course was set up.  We had to read 1 chapter and write a discussion each week during the semester so there was not much thought going on in the class.  Also, beware that your final may be given to you during the last week of classes and need to be completed within 5 days so manage your time.",1
Tim is an excellent teacher! Highly recommended him!,1
"Professor Baumgartner went above and beyond for all his students in Anatomy 101. Be ready to pay close attention to his lectures. If you plan on not going, plan on failing. He works with you and for you. He's also a great lab instructor. I just wish he would teach 102 and 201 :( ",1
"I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket",0
Very nice professor and has super entertaining and relevant lectures. Took this class in pandemic and he handled adjustment very well. he is unresponsive to emails outside of class and will often play pre recorded lectures rather than cancelling. Tests are challenging but doable if you rewatch lectures and take notes. Overall top 5 prof hes great,1
I took a course that was taught by professor Sinha and two other professors and her part of the course was the most confusing and least informative. I can see her efforts but I honestly did not think it worked out in the end and a lot of people I know struggled through the course because of her.,0
"If you just take notes during his lectures, and follow the objectives in the syllabus, you are pretty much guaranteed an A in the course.",1
This class was probably the worst class I have taken at CSUSB.,0
"If I could give her 0 stars, I would. I'm confident she grades with her eyes closed as she is consistently late to all meetings and only ever complains about her second job. Doesn't bother to give feedback on tests/assignments and avoids emails and texts. My worst teacher and will be yours too. I can't describe how horrible she is in 350 characters",0
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
The best professor you can have.,1
"I love professor Ball! He's the best!!! If you need Math 0308 Please do yourself a favor and pick his class. He makes everything so easy, he's funny, he cares about our time, he has lots of patience, and makes everything easy and clear for you.",1
"Mr. Robinson is a good instructor. You do have a lot of group work to do. However, I guess that's what social work is about. If you come to class, you will pass. He doesn't take late assignments at all. I enjoy talking to him outside of class. Very knowledgeable. People need to stop hating on him...period.",1
"She is just amazing. Her instructions are clear, and concise. She knows her subject well. I truly enjoyed her class. I never wanted to miss class with her. Great professor.",1
"His lectures are great and easy to understand, but his grading criteria is illogical. Take him at your own risk. You will learn the material but can be stressful",0
"Autumn has a heart of gold. But she tends to let the class dictate what is taught and expects you to do a lot on your own. Exams are extremely difficult, but she curves them decently. Takes forever to put grades in.",1
"My 8th online class-4.0 GPA. Worst prof. by far! Description of 8 wk online course: Step 1) Read the book. Step 2) Take 4 exams. Step 3) Write 2 papers(7+ pgs each) AND 8 pg group project AND write & give 5 minute speech. She told you which book to buy, graded papers & then zip. What about using the internet to show exs/clarify topics? AVOID AVOID",0
"Do NOT take this professor if you do not like harsh/uncalled for feedback, lots of assignments, very little time to do each assignment, and a bad attitude towards students. She does NOT care that you have other courses she treats you like graduate students. She is so anal about APA and every detail it'll drive you insane. BEWARE OF HER AT ALL COSTS",0
"She really sends you out of the class if you are 5mins late.I narrowly passed this class,before every test she gives a handout of what would be on the test. but don't let that fool you,if you do not answer in her own words she marks you down,so you are basically studying to fail. I do not recommend her at all. I felt like i was still in high school",0
Took her during the summer session! She gives a lot of extra credit so it makes it possible for you to pass. She does go off topic a bit during lecture but she teaches well.,1
"Dr. Dewald is an excellent professor. His readings and discussions are more thought-provoking than in any college course I have ever taken before. You will always leave class with your mind spinning, and educated convictions on the topics. I definitely recommend this course to anyone looking for a mentally stimulating and fun course.",1
"this man is the best teacher i have ever had, not the easist, but the best. this subject is not easy, he gives you the skills to find the answer through thought if you have a hard time thinking i dont recomend him. or this subject for that matter",1
Really enjoyed her class! I would take it again just cause its so interesting.,1
"Great professor, great lectures and if you pay attention to what he says, there is very easy to get an A.",1
Rachaels History 150 course was rather easy as long as you go to class and read the book. Do the work and its an easy A,1
"He is easy. You will pass, but he is EXTREMELY rude. If you are in the class to actually learn, forget it. He will tell you the answer and if you ask why, he will say don't worry about it. If you just want to pass with an A or B, take his class. If you actually want to learn, don't.",0
"i just dropped her class. she is completely useless. she doesn't actually TEACH. i have not learned a single thing other than she is a high class,condescending person. i have emailed her dept when she felt the need to degrade a student in front of the class. do not take her. do not waste your time.",0
Roopa does not provide as much help as other professors do. She dont lecture enough and many students were failing/failed her course. Do not take her unless you want to fail.,0
"I would suggest any other professor for this course. Ridiculously confusing, and as someone else stated, it's more about writing styles of papers. I didn't learn a thing. ",0
This professor is not truly professor I think she bought her degree. She avoids teaching because she does not know. I think she is getting old and start losing her mind but she still comes to FGCU. Avoid this old hag and take it with someone else,0
"Excellent teacher. He explains everything thoroughly, is excited about what he is teaching, and never boring!",1
"Very demanding, but if you listen closely to his instructions, you will learn alot. Bring your papers to him to look over before the due date.",1
"take him,u will not regret b/c he is the best lab teacher. willing to go around the room to tell the parts of the organism models when u want him too. quizzes r a lot easier than the other teachers'. he doesn't look good tho.",1
"There is a lot of online homework. The course structure was a bit unorganized at times. It took a long time to get any grades for assignments. Feedback was very minimal. Replies to email was spotty at best. It is a huge class, so perhaps the professors just could not deal with all the students. Be prepared to read and do a lot of writing.",0
"Professor LeFlouria is awesome! She helps you with your essays, she engages the class during her lectures and she shows interesting documentaries on the time period. You have to study but this professor is one of the best I've had so far at FAU!",1
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
"Hiking class; be sure to check dates of hikes before starting class. First class is about 2 hours of lecture and you wouldn't want to sit through that if your not available for the hikes. Also, hikes were said to go earlier and past the actual listed class time. Most hikes you will need to drive to and can carpool. Teacher seems really nice!",1
"This class was horrible, and this teacher was HORRIBLE. She isn't helpful or clear at all, and makes no attempt to respond or help out when a student is in need. Her grading criteria is weird and stupid. The material is USELESS. There's no reason an Intro to Research class should be harder than an Advanced Research Writing class. She is just awful.",0
"he is a very tough grader and he posts reviews for exams the night before, and also teaches you in a very confusing way",0
"He is a horrible teacher, he doesnt try to help students. His grading is very harsh, i would suggest a different teacher",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN. She is super nice but when it comes to teaching, she is no help at all. Not a very hard grader on the lab reports because she does not teach anything. Lab protocols are a mess and have a lot of typos and she leaves you to deal with that by yourself. No point in asking her a question because she does not answer.",0
"I took this because I am a nurse and feel it's important to be educated on social problems. He only focused on the perspectives of sociology, never actually ""taught"" anything. Discussion boards were all opinion based, but still never able to get full credit. Unless you are majoring in Sociology, I would steer clear of this professor.",0
He is less than mediocre.  Avoid taking the class with him if at all possible.  He appears to grade papers by the seat of his pants.  He is unresponsive (or slow to respond) to questions.  I was pretty excited for this class *before* I took it.  He seems to have a knack for taking all the joy of writing out of writing.,0
"Danny is the best acting teacher. He pushes every single student to give their best. After you reach that mark, he pushes you to be even better. I'm grateful for having had him as a Professor. Great scenes too. My class was full of amazing talents.",1
Lousy...,0
LOVE LOVE LOVE him!! He is a great teacher and will help in whatever way possible!! I don't get algebra but he works with me lots in class till I get it! You will have a quiz everyday and you better NOT be late!! oh and don't talk in class to anyone but him!!But trust me if math's not your thing take him and you will learn lots!!,0
"For an art teacher she does not promote artistic writing. She is judgemental and taps into students personal affairs, not only must you teach yourself the material she grades easily. The woman is very one sided and not interested in her students ideas.",0
"If you naturally struggle with math, Professor Guetter is not the best at explaining things. He explains things way too fast and in little detail. If you don't have a strong foundation of mathematic understanding, his classes might be hard to understand.",0
Jeff Allen is the grand master of PPS! Take him.,1
"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class",0
"He might know the subject but has very poor explanatory skills, with a strong Greek Accent that you would barely understand what he's saying. NJIT has no other professor teaching this class so you are out of luck. My friends took this class before me and told me about but NJIT doesn't give a choice when it comes to his classes (696&647)",0
"Readings are interesting! Be prepared with questions and comments, so you can contribute to discussions, as participation is significant part of grade. Most of your learning will happen there, rather than through Prof. Tone. She's very strict about deadlines. Course had potential to be amazing, but Prof. Tone was not very present nor compassionate.",1
"Dr. Baltodano was by far my favorite professor at FSW. Not only did I learn more about American Government, but I left feeling excited about things like voting. He genuinely cares about you and your grade. If you can, please take his class!",1
"I was lucky that the majority of the class was online. She ""taught"" in class but all of the homework, quizzes and tests were online. I only went to class once a week because we had a lab. If it were't for the class being online I would have failed miserably. I do not recommend her unless you want to teach yourself.",0
"Dr. Mark is very straight forward with what she expects from you. There is a quiz and journal entry due each week, along with group activities for points during class time. Participation is required. There are a few major grade assignments and tests throughout. Overall, she provides a lot of insight to working as a human resource professional.",1
"Its obvious that Mr. Mock knows a lot about government, but he makes it very difficult to learn. Its a very lecture heavy class and he doesnt give much for notes so you have to write what he says and half of what he says isnt relevant. Minimal grades, only a few tests and two papers. He also makes students feel stupid and is extremely rude.",0
Really helpful...lots of extra credit and study sessions. Fair...patient...helpful.,1
"You must attend your lectures in order to get a good grade in this course. She tests on pictures and maps, however she does not post pics/maps on her slides, so BEWARE OF THAT. She posts lots of slides and you have to know all of them to write the exams. It is a difficult course but if you have a great memorizing skill then you will do good.",1
"The class was super easy. As long as you check canvas regularly and keep track of your peer reviews, you'll be fine. The instructor was a different story. When I would email him with questions about assignments, his tone was very rude and condescending. I would take this class again, but with a different instructor.",0
this had to be one of my worst teachers. she doesnt help and expects you to know everything. she makes a simple subject very difficult. i would never recommend her,0
"I took this class as an elective to expand my knowledge base and was told the course wasn't too hard. The online grading components of the class are not hard, and the project was really interesting to do. The midterms seem to grade on things which are unimportant, memorization-heavy and don't match with the reading sections. Beware stupid course.",0
Awful experience in the course,0
She assigns a TON of readings but I never read them and they are really just for background. She lectures well but a lot of the important information is not on the slides so you need to pay attention in lecture. The 2 tests are stressful but are based off of a list of 100 vocab terms she gives out. 2 tests and 2 papers plus recitation attendance.,1
"Hardest class I have ever taken, period. I am a Engineering Major, and this is the worst class i have taken. Teacher is rude and negligent, gives zero warning on Exam dates, gives zero feedback on discussions, the list goes on. I wouldn't want my worst enemy in this class. If you are looking for a easy class like I was, STAY AWAY PLEASE.",0
"Dr. Green is one of the best professors I've had. You WILL grow as a writer in this class. There is a lot of reading (expected), but he paces it out really nicely. Lots of participation points. Great feedback on essays, and many chances to submit drafts for early feedback. Allows rewrites. Also, a chance to write your own fiction. Take this prof.",1
"Though she was a sweet professor, many of her lectures are very unclear. Even when I asked her for help via email, she did not clarify any of my questions. Going to office hours didn't help too much either. Hope for a good TA and go to them for help.",0
The first thing I will say is I felt like she was not present at all. She either wouldnt email back or it would take her a week which makes it hard when you have a question about a quiz with a due date. I passed the class but I dont feel like I learned anything.,0
This class was tough because it was half online and half in class so you had to teach yourself a lot. The material is tough but he tries his best to explain it. He knows what it's like to be a student so he is pretty easy on the class and offers curves. If no one else is left take him he's not bad,1
Expects a lot out of you. Need to pay attention and know what you are doing in class to pass assessments. Study groups didn't seem to help me at all.,0
"Our class gave him the nickname ""Swag Master Jones"". He is really quirky and funny, but you get used to it. His lectures are really interesting and easy to follow. Just don't interrupt him during a lecture. He hates that.",1
Must take for speech communication. You will not regret it.,1
"Professoressa Miller is one of the most enthusiastically passionate and caring professors I have been privileged enough to meet and learn from in my entire academic career. She definitely makes you work for it, but the challenge is inspiring and helps to build confidence in your own abilities. She goes above and beyond for her students. Recommended",1
Super helpful and nice. Very cool. Love this teacher.,1
"Absolutely horrible teacher, worst I have ever had in my life I dreaded going to her class every day. She grades the first two pages of an essay and then doesn't read the rest if she doesn't like what she has read. Also on the day any major essay is due no matter the excuse she will mark you down 10 percent on the essay if you are a minute late.",0
"She assigns way too much work. Her discussion boards and current events are fine, but her worksheets are awful. Even with the textbook it's hard to find the right answers because she changes the wording and makes the questions confusing. I will be getting an A in this class, but it was not easy. I wouldn't recommend this prof if you want an easy A.",0
"no syllabus to follow, everything that is assigned is just thrown at you at the last second and she expects all of your work to be perfect. if you do not agree with her opinions then you do not do well. she has her favorites in the class and only those people do well and she is rude to those students who are not her favorite.",0
One of the best professors I've had in PCCC. He takes time to make sure you fully understand the material before moving on to new subject. Reviews before exams are always a giving so you're not baffle comes test time. He is one professor who truly cares about the students....,1
"Wendy very obviously wants her students to succeed. She expects a lot from her you and comes off a bit harsh, but you will realize that it is because she truly wants you to succeed, and the work she expects really is necessary to be successful in the class. ACC2020 is a lot of work so you need to keep up with readings and practice Qs",1
Prof. Buhler is one of the smartest guys you will ever meet.  His classes are hard but he will teach you what you ened to know.,1
Great teacher! Fun class and he gives study guides! You do have to work for that A. I would take him again! He usually gives a extra credit opportunity.,1
"I think the curriculum for SPAN302 is poorly designed, with too much busywork, both in class and for homework, and not nearly enough opportunities to have conversations and actually learn Spanish. With that said, Professor Newall did his best to work with it, and he is a very caring professor, so I'm sure he will improve, as this was his first year",1
"She needs to find another profession because she sucks at teaching. Does not communicate or grade anything. She will say ""these are tough times we're going through"", and literally assign a 400-500 point essay. She cancels classes frequently so there is no point to the class. She fails at doing her job correctly so trust me do not take her class.",0
"Online classes beware- You can tell immediately that the online classes are neglected as he is too busy to be engaged. Emails were responded a week and a half later . Poor English and grammar, how is he a grad teacher? His criticism levels are unprofessional and unhelpful. One of the worst professors I've ever had in my academic career.",0
"After every stupid quiz you take of hers, you hate her even more. I don't think she wants you to do well. She also talks too much. We have to go over an entire chapter by ourselves because we didn't get to it in class for a test. Avoid taking any of her classes",0
"It was an interesting class that covered interesting topics. Gildenhuys is a little hard to follow at times, but has interesting ideas as well. Definitely must stay up on the readings, and although most people didn't attend the second class of the week, you definitely should.",0
"Professor Whitney is a very good professor and I highly recommend her. Sure, she goes off task a bit but in the end if you read and follow your notes you will make a good grade. Other than that she will help you with anything regarding psychology you need even after you're done with her class. One of my favorite teachers I've had at HCC.",1
"Test is very Tricky, and very nit picky when it comes to homework. I wont recommend this teacher at all",0
"Well if you have to choose between Macintosh and Majumdar...haha enjoy your semester! lol This guy goes through the book. He gives notes, but if you pay attention you can just follow exactly what he is doing in the book. And his examples come from the book...doesn't add much. He is boring and sort of weird.",0
"I'm three classes into the semester and I already know this is going to be the most draining class I've ever taken. There's 100 points total in the whole class, so every single point really matters to your grade. He's very intimidating and demanding and has so patience for questions. He teaches the course like a high level MBA class, which is scary",0
"He knows his math, but can't teach students. Most of the time it seemed liked he wasn't even aware that he was teaching a class. He just went up to the board and did math. He pretty much tells you what is going to be on the exams, and he drops the lowest exam. If you already know calcus, he is fine, but I wouldn't take him if I didn't know calculus",0
Mr. Fultz is awesome! He is always willing to help with any problems you are having. He is very intelligent and he definitely knows his material.I absolutely recommend him to everyone because he is amazing!!! :),1
"Did not enjoy this class. I thought the subject was interesting, but his presentation was so boring and uninteresting. We only had one paper that was not clear on instruction, and then he graded our rough draft extremely harshly, saying I did not follow the (non-existent) guidelines. Upon asking to meet, he never answers emails and is not helpful. ",0
"Dr. Lim is a terrible teacher and horrible lecturer BUT, and hear me out on this one, he lets a lot of things slide, especially when he forgets what he was supposed give you (happens a lot). I would reccomend this class if you are good with computers and don't mind learning material yourself...",0
"Great teacher, but not easy. Very motivated. Cares about students. She does expect student to make an effort and grow. Moderately heavy coursework load. Requires coherent, thoughtful answers.",1
"I absolutely loved him, fav professor at ucr by far!! hes so passionate and makes lecture fun. Extremely down to earth guy. Just do your readings and you should be fine. he clearly states midterm/final prompts in advance and you get a notecard to write whatever you want for them!!",1
terrible. rude and goes way too fast on the power points. expects way too much out of you.,0
"Although she is really entertaining, she chats too much about random things and not so much about learning French itself. You'll get a good grade for doing the bare minimum, but you won't be learning much French.",0
"This man changed my life. Not a day has gone by that I havent used something in his class, mainly with contracts. I see things in a whole new perspective now and it is such a blessing. Hunt is a fantastic teacher that everyone should be required to have... I ACCEPT!!!!",1
"I had him for dual credit History 2nd sem. of high school online. I work diligently and yet..on one paper I received 3 pts out of 40. The tests were on Sundays at 8pm and you had to rush to finish them. He didn't give that many assignments, so each low grade pulled you further and further down.",0
"If I was told I was allowed to slap one person without consequences, it would be this damn woman. Her class is boring, she doesn't teach, and she doesn't care about her students at all.",0
"She is strict when it comes to grading. Syllabus was confusing, had to buy a whole textbook for an online code. Didnt use the physical textbook at all. Didnt really like the online program, either.",1
Class is a lot of work. 3 Exams no final (last exam is final but only covers material since 2nd exam) If you take good note and do the HW you will be fine if you are good at blue book exams,1
She makes things unnecessarily complicated. Be prepare for more peer discussion and online resources to understand what's going on.,0
Great teacher.  Love his stories which actually help you remember the curriculum.  One of the best at ACC.,1
"I took psych 2301 with professor Whitney and Im so glad I chose her as a teacher. You can tell she loves what she does. Class if fairly easy, just do the weekly assignments and youll do well with the test and quizzes. Make sure you do extra credit I missed out on an A by .9% because I did not give myself a cushion which sucks b/c I was so close",1
"Easy Homework. Lengthy Tests. Classes are SO much fun, he is always joking around. Cancels class often and/or lets out very early. DEFINATELY take for Computer Science 201!",1
"Knowledgeable and passionate about history, but she assigns TONS of readings that are usually super boring. The lectures are just her talking, but once in a while she'll ask about readings so be prepared. On her essays, she expects you to basically repeat what she says in class and if you disagree with her, it shows in your grade.",0
"This class was awesome. The lectures are so interesting and he's good at ensuring you understand the material.  His test format is great - you get to take the same test three times and he gives feedback each time to help you master each topic. Due dates did change a bit, but wasn't his fault and was always to give us more time. Def take this class!",1
"Jill was by far one of the greatest teachers I have ever had. She was so encouraging & a great motivator. She wanted to make sure when her students walked out of the class room,they had a clear understanding of the nursing concepts. She made sure it was a stress free & relaxing environment for all. It was a tough course, but very fun & informative.",1
"Brandon Huff was one of the best math teachers I have ever had.  He goes over things mulitple times, tries to put it in simple steps, and is always reasonable with assignments, tests, and quizzes.  He always gives you a week to complete the homework assignments and understands how difficult my math lab can be so he often addresses questions in clas",1
"DO NOT take this class if you expect to learn anything. I took A&P 1 with him...Very good class if this is a repeat for u and u only need the credit. self taught students should b fine. Dont email or call him, he wont answer. He will lower ur grade for missing classes, study and memorize ur practice tests and u will ace this class.",0
"She isn't very helpful, and (in my class at least) often refused to explain problems or questions because she was always in a rush. She would write it out but never explained how she DID the problem. Very frustrating. She grades fairly harshly, but she's a pretty friendly person to just chat with after class.",0
"I loved the fact that we watched films that I really hadn't heard about, but were really good. Our second essay was hard, but somehow I loved it. Honestly, the semester was EPIC!",1
"He is a terrible prof.  He may know the subject well but portraying it to students with very little mathematical background in the manor he did was horrible.  He has no control over the class, his accent is very thick, his exams are very hard which are multiple choice with no feedback.  The hw is online which makes it difficult to learn.",0
By far the worse and meaningless class so far. He spends 60% of time talking nonsense and inappropiate things not related to class. Then rushes 10 mins before class expecting us to know all the info before exam in next class. Expects us to read the chapters byt vaguely discusses them in class. Long study guide with short and long answers required.,0
Dr. Brown is a great professor. He made sure everyone understood everything. I am extremely lucky to have had him as a teacher because I suck at math.,1
This teach is a NO GO.  If you do not score over 80% on any test he makes you drop the course or does it himself.  Def is not someone to give help.  I can honestly say out of every teacher I have had he is by FAR the worst,0
When I took this course I didnt know I was expected to already be an expert. His teaching is rare. He judges you from day 1 based on what you look like. I had to get my own help and avoided him as much as possible. I tried reporting him several times but soon found out that its no use. They dont care. Very Sad for SMUs CSE Department.,0
I took this class asynchronously and it was mostly about getting your work done. She waited until the end of the semester to start grading everything but is an easy grader. When you sign up for a group at the beginning of the semester you will be doing several assignments in that same group. Start the assessment assignment early it is a long one!,1
"awesome teacher, dry sense of humor and makes class interesting. He relates class lessons to every day life and makes students leave better critical thinkers. Encourages and pushes students to do their best.",1
"Extremely poor class planning. Will make up useless activities just to fill remaining class time. Doesn't discuss texts adequately. Tests are fairly easy, papers graded easily. Most boring class ever.",0
"Pros: Knows the content, Good at giving lectures, Replies to emails promptly. Cons: NO STUDY GUIDES! NO FEEDBACK ON EXAMS! (i.e. missed questions), 20%+ Fill-in-the-blank on all exams (Better know how to spell all your enzymes!). It is just cruel expecting a student to be able to do well in a medical-based class with those 3 cons combined.",0
"You will learn more about colonization from reading Bartolome de las Casas' ""Brief Account of the Devastation of the Indies,"" than you will from this entire class. He spends about 90% of the time justifying the European colonizers and how it wasn't that bad. Only refers to native/aboriginal/indigenous people as ""Indians."" Calls slaves ""workers.""",0
"Don't take her, If your a good student. The best you can expect to get is a B or C. She has ridiculous styles when it comes to writing, and if you don't do it her way, she'll sure tell you. Your first paper she won't even read it. She'll Just tell you its not an A paper and prob give you a 80%. She doesn't like male students (Guys don't take her)",0
Honestly I think I would rather watch paint dry then listen to this profs lectures. Workload heavy even though it is a required course and half the students do not want to be there.,0
"Professor Rezk is a great professor. He explains things very clearly. He moves and speaks quickly, and you have to try hard to keep up. Homework grading is brutal. However, if you show him you care and you work really hard, you will receive a great grade. He will judge you by how well he thinks you are are doing overall.",1
She was the most horrible teacher she doesn't allow you to make up work and also doesn't allow you to turn online she also do petty stuff.,0
He wrote everything that was going to be on the test on the board in in an outline format. He was helpful and friendly with the students. He treated every question as if it was of utmost importance. He eve looked something up for me that had to do with a health issue my grandfather was having. Great teacher!!!!,1
"Before I signed up for Boydston I looked at the reviews, they were low but I kept an open mind that I had to work for my grades regardless who the professor was. But this professor designs everything so you can fail, she goes beyond measures to make sure her exams difficult. Either than that I see no effort from her in anything else. DON'T TAKE",0
"She may be good in person but not online. She caught a student cheating and punished the whole class by not allowing us to backtrack on the test. She would also make the test on Sundays at certain times such as from 9 am-12 pm. Also, all the negative comments have been removed for whatever reason. I did all her homework and still got an F.",0
"horrible teacher. if she doesn't like you( your grade will suffer. being forced to listen to the non-sense she spits is not worth 3 credits. plus she was the dumbest person in the room but it gets worse,boring classes, biased teacher,unorganized,dont take",0
"Don't get me wrong, it's an easy class worth an easy A, Especially if you don't have much of an issue with speaking in front of people. Wolfe is a great professor, and he has the best interest and intentions for all if not most of his students, and I appreciate that. My only criticism is that his his assignment structure is a bit unorganized.",1
"As lovable as he is effective, Morales teaches Japanese from its foundations and has the experience to answer just about any question you could have. Classes are densely packed with information and timed perfectly, and homework is picked down to the individual question to help solidify learning. I eagerly look forward to JPN 2.",1
"This woman SUCKS!!! All she does is talk about her kids and let other illegitimate classmates distract her from the course. I got an easy A in this class from doing my homework and showing up to class. Eventhough attendence is not required, it is very helpful when she stays on track. She has 4 kids and constantly talks about them...annoying.",1
"If you are terrible at math, avoid this class at all costs! She barely knows how to speak English. Her explanations just leave you more confused. You are better off watching Youtube videos for an explanation than listening to her.",0
Mr. York is one of my favorite professors at Ivy Tech! He's very kind and willing to help in any way. I recently got a new job and he has been nothing but understanding and is very good about checking his email. I'm in his Capstone course for General Studies this Spring and it's been a great experience so far! I'm going to miss him when I graduate!,1
Dr. Grover is the best professor in the entire university. He knows how to teach students in a fun and enjoyable manner and his lectures very easy to understand. He is a unique professor who likes to make sure his students understands the lessons being taught in the class all the time. Do all the design challenges and you will surely get an A+.,1
To pass this class you have to be willing to put in the work. Professor Wood wrote a lot of notes ALL of which help you get through the semester. I looked back at the notes while doing on-line quizzes and it was very helpful. She was good at responding to emails and would spend extra with you if you need it. She is very intelligent and helpful,1
"Wasn't clear with the other instructor on what she wanted in answers. Marks the whole question wrong if you leave out one Sig Fig or don't label something. She isn't easy to talk to, every time I tried to have a conversation with her she put the blame back on me. Wasn't able to do problems the way I was taught in High School without it being wrong.",0
Great teacher. Shows you real life experiences not the boring textbook definitions.,1
"Bad instructor, way to fast. I want to say something nice about her as an instructor. but I can't. she is nice as a person though! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
"He's young and a really nice guy, the amount of assignments are moderate but definitely not too hard of a work load and he gives great feedback on essays. i definitely recommend taking this class. i had him for EXP 101 not math.",1
"Erin Griffin is hands down the most incredible professor I have had.  Always helpful, extremely brilliant, and knows exactly how to articulate complex information in a way that anyone can understand.  Her exams are taken directly from her power points and she is extremely organized in lecture, and the lab.  I highly recommend this professor!",1
Do not take his course please. It is terrible! Tough grader,0
"Do not come into this class thinking you will be debating ideas. YOU WILL NOT! You are not allowed to express your personal thoughts or beliefs in this Ethics class, Confusing!",0
"If your looking for a class you can pass by paying close attention and taking lots of notes, turn around. Wells was very nonreceptive to questions and clarifications at the beginning of the course, and her teaching style is very ""if you dont remember something from a previous math course im not going to help you remember"". Iook fora different prof.",0
This class is an incredible amount of work for what it should be with not a lot of notice in between assignments. Mandatory attendance and participation and on top of that the professor is a little bit harsh so it doesn't make for a comfortable leaning environment. You don't learn any valuable programs or anything the work is all busy work.,0
"Prof Enright was a super sweet and funny teacher! If you reach out to him, he WILL get back to you as soon as possible. Don't be afraid to ask ""dumb questions"" either. His quizzes & exams are open for 24 hours giving you all day to finish! I'm super grateful for that not gonna lie. However, be prepared for a lot of homework problems.",1
"Very nice, will work with you on absences. Jumps all over the place during lecture, making it hard to follow. Tests are from the homework, quizzes, and labs. Labs are simple if you really try. Frequent quizzes. She let us take a whole test at home using respondus browser. She lets you retake one quiz at the end of the semester, it's the exact copy.",1
She was super nice and friendly to start but then after a few weeks she became really strict and classes were boring and tiresome. Lots of information in the notes that if you don't get you won't do well on the tests. Do bad on the tests and quizzes and you are done for. Best of luck!,0
"Does not have the student in mind, not sensitive to lab conditions, short times to complete assignments (3 days sometimes), harsh grading practices, recycles the same two examples, overall poor attitude for a learning setting. Pose a problem- he basically shrugs his shoulders and says you’ll have to figure it out. Worst class experience to date.",0
Professor Willmore is a great teacher! She really wants you to succeed and learn the language. She does everything in her power to help you. She is understanding and fun. I would definitely recommender her to anyone wanting to learn Spanish. I only wish she would teach Spanish from beginning to proficiency because I would take all classes from her.,1
I'm not a science person. Anthropology was the toughest class for me. Her online class is set up so you have spend a substantial amount of time reading her notes online as well as reading the textbooks. ,1
"She is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. I had to switch majors and I was not looking forward to the classes I was required to take; she made me love my new major. She brings in her own real life experiences and you never want her to stop telling her stories. She makes you work hard, but it will helps you become a better doctor.",1
"Professor Miriam Keller-Perkins is a nice teacher, but she doesn't know how to teach. When I take her class, only 1 out of 7 is passing her class. She said she won't fail you if you fail all her tests or quizzes, she will give you a D ( a passing grade). If you want a better grade, I hope you don't take her class ever again.",0
"Aucune explication, aucune notes de cours. Pendant le majorité du cours il parle d'écologie et après c'est un travail en équipe sur la matière qu'on a pas vu et il ne répond pas au question.... Je considère avoir fait ce cours sans professeur, le prof c'était mon livre.",0
"Dr. McCartney was a WONDERFUL teacher! Sweet lady, really knows her stuff. If you're looking for an easy gen ed, this is NOT the class for you. If you're looking to learn/ challenge yourself, the class is great. Lots of reading, weekly 2-3 pg journals, map quizzes at end of sem, one current events pres., midterm, final, and 12-15 pg research paper",1
"He is a very tough grader, and it is impossible to get an A on the homework and in the class. Would not recommend taking him",0
this professor yells at you if you sneeze or cough or even if you try to bless your fellow classmate.,0
"I don't like thw fact that he uses a website through a website for the class just stick to one. The subscription for the second website is not free and students must pay for it on their own. I have not struggled to figure out what was going on using the canvas website until this class, every other class was clear and straight forward.",0
Grades are based on tests but if you study you will pass. Professor Bronie makes sure you understand and is tough sometimes but is caring.,1
"Dr. Kenzig provides feedback on assignments, but it is vague and not helpful. The amount of work each week is overwhelming, beware if you work full time. I would not take another class with this professor as she is a lazy professor with a completely chaotic and unorganized course structure. 10/10 DO NOT recommend.",0
"Not the worst professor, the accent can be a bit hard to understand at times, especially since lectures tend to move fast. I sometimes struggle to listen to what she is saying and write notes down. Sometimes I end up just doing one or the other simply because you have no time. Office hours with her are almost a must, they have helped me a lot",1
Staples is a nice guy be expects way too much. Multiple assignments will often be due the same day making it a heavy workload. Lectures are incredibly lengthy and would be a lot shorter and more bearable if he didn't talk about himself so much. The midterms are actually pretty hard; they consist of one essay question and a multiple choice section.,0
"Professor Dunham is quintessential of what an instructor should be. FSCJ has indeed strengthened its faculty with him as a member. He is ready, willing and accessible to assist the student with questions or concerns. He gives a positive direction for the student to obtain satisfactory results. Simply put, Professor is truly a real gem, awesome.",1
"offers a max of 5min office hours. timed quizzes, hw doesnt match the youtube videos he post on weekly canvas, so your own your own relying on classmates for help for all hw cuz he is extremely unreliable and terrible. awful, dont recommend at all unless u dont mind learning on ur own and spending hours asking classmates for help",0
"I just got an A in the class.  Your entire grade is basically her **** project.  She even dropped the final exam, so there was no point in even going to class after the midterm exam besides group meetings for the project.  Whether or not that's a good or bad thing is up to you...  avoid if you can",0
"Wonderful teacher. She clearly knows what she is teaching and is very helpful! At first, I thought that fresh. seminar would be boring, but there are many activities Dr. Michals have conducted. Reflection papers help you become a better writer, and she wants the best for her students. Wonderful, and by far, one of the best teachers at CSUS.",1
Very kind and caring professor. Take her class ! You will enjoy it !,1
"She does not care how well you adapt to the class or not. She does not care how busy you are with your life. Her grading is horrible. In the last week, she decided to drop ""points"" from my weekly quizzes which brought my letter grade down from B to C. She could care less that I tried hard to study and to pass her 20 question quiz in 20 mins. Avoid!",0
GREAT PROFESSOR! LECTURES COULD GET A LITTLE BORING BUT I LIKED HOW HE NEVER FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE USA IS GREAT. GRADE DEPENDS ON CHAPTER BOOK QUIZZES (3) AND 3 EXAMS.,1
"Hilarious. Kept class interesting. Tests weren't easy, but they weren't hard either. They were fair. If you study, do the homework, and go to class, you'll do fine.",1
"I had Dr. Irani for Abnormal Psych, she was super easy and a very sweet professor. Very helpful and understanding, keep up with quizzes and readings and you will do well. There is one exam, the final and  her exam almost  70% pulled from the quizzes you take all semester long. Great class. ",1
The people that left good reviews are just trying to make prospective student suffer just as they did. DO NOT TAKE ORALCOMM WITH SARALINA It is impossible to get an A in her class. She is unresponsive to emails and is very condescending.,0
"To be honest I had no idea what to expect but Dr. Carter is genuinely a good guy and probably after he handled my personal crisis with empathy and concern I would take another course with him. There are weekly papers and two 5 pagers for midterm and final, but he will give you feedback to improve your writing and it atually helped me.",1
"Prof. Tolichs class was well-organized and well-run. Online lectures were clear and useful, and he was very accessible outside of class. Made PHYS 123 tolerable.",1
Great guy. Cant say enough good things about him. He really makes class interesting. Really knows abnormal psych. ,1
His class is useless. talk about things he enjoys talking about not what students need to know. One of the worse prof I had.,0
By far the BEST english class I have ever taken. I look forward to taking classes with her in the future. She is passionate and inspires her students to be the same. Definitely a teacher you want to learn from.,1
"It could be because of the online format, but I do not like the way Professor Rao organizes her class. Lectures are asynchronous and pre-recorded videos are to be watched instead. This makes it hard to stay engaged, and makes the class feel much more like busy work. There are a lot of small quizzes, seemingly due at different random days each week.",0
Terrible teacher. Does not answer emails and is very unclear. Her online videos do not make sense and uses YouTube to teach the class instead of her making an effort. Want to know your grade? You wont. She doesnt grade anything till last minute.,0
"Dr. Meche is a great professor. All you have to do is show up to class, and youll pass. A day before essay due dates, hell ask everyone to show up to class, and let him read your essays. Hell tell you your mistakes, and correct them for you. Show up to his office hours, and hell answer any questions you have. I would recommend taking him.",1
He is a great person and teacher. You will enjoy every single class.,1
Every class period was the same and he never seemed enthused about teaching us the material. I was eager to learn about International Economics but having such a disheartening teacher made me resent the course. He's a nice guy but if you want to learn do not take his course(s).,0
He is an awesome Proffesor who is extremely fair!,1
"Marchetti's ""flipped classroom"" is the worst. She doesn't teach, and you're graded on the precision of your labs. Aweful class. Avoid at all costs.",0
Test are long and difficult. He'll provide the information but it's a lot of it and he crams it all in instead of spacing it out.,0
"Organized & knowledgeable, provides you with a study guide & replies to emails FAST! If you are driven & really want to learn the material he is your guy. If you reach out, he'll ALWAYS HELP you but he can't help you if you slack. He's a tough grader & lectures can be LONG but so worth it. Physio is hard, but you'll be a better student after Pentek",1
"I took T.Flowers class, he has a different kind of sense of humor, works well with students,helps alot, offers extra credit if needed. Go to class is a MUST! he is watching you!!!!!",1
"His class is useless! You can get an A even if you don't show up - He does not care... - as long as you kiss up...BUT his students do not make it to med school!! (except csun visiting students, of course) if you are pre-med and need the mcat STAY AWAY form Dr T & CSUDH, or ""You"" will be labled a ""dummy"" - thanks to Dr. T",0
Mr. Randolph was extremely knowledgeable and helped us understand the content. He's reasonable but doesn't like you to not pay attention or be on your phones-typical professor. You'll enjoy his class.,1
"You have to get past his French accent. Once you get past that, get ready for confusing teaching, 0 clarification, lots of homework (online quizzes graded on accuracy) and a few pop quizzes. He doesn't explain things very well and is quite confusing.",0
"Will is so awesome! I didn't love the LFS core series classes, but he is really passionate about the subject and it shows. He really challenges your perceptions and gets you to turn your beliefs on their head. You have to critically think about topics and collaborate with other students. This type of work is really useful in the real world.",1
"I personally would not take a class with this professor again. Very heavy on coursework and little instructions on assignments. I found it hard to communicate with her sometimes. There was A LOT of reading 60+ pages of textbooks along with some videos and discussions, papers, quizzes, and a virtual child simulation.",0
Couldn't understand a thing he talked about all semester. Doesn't help his students. Horrible. He will let you out early but thats about it. You can go to all the tutoring in the world and show up to his classes. Even when he clearly sees your trying he wills till fail you. Avoid.,0
It'll be a disgrace if he is allowed to teach at SMU again next year.,0
Very enthusiastic. I very much enjoyed his lectures. His 5631 covers most of the contents such as concurrency and multi core from the text book. The section of memory management is not covered and replaced by cloud virtualization. I like this change.,1
"Dr. Li is a sweet man, however is not the best professor. He tends to explain things that are not presented on the slideshows, which makes it difficult to grasp concepts since he is often hard to understand. Labs are generally easy, though I don't feel like I retained much knowledge from them.",0
"Very nice teacher. I have been enjoying this class. (I am a sociology major,) and recommend taking her!",1
"With out going to class you will fail. And study by going over the homework not reading the book. I really enjoy Dr. Steward, he is a good prof",0
Great professor...not the most exciting class due to material. Got an A by going to class and taking notes bc he tests on a lot of what he says/draws. He uses a clicker system but not often. Tests on concepts and not memorization. Drops your lowest test. Textbook is not necessary. Little curve (2%) so don't depend on it. Not a bad class!,1
"Did you know he won a Grammy? Don't worry! He won't let you forget. Great producer, awful teacher. Good luck learning anything from him! Try to find online resources or friends because he won't be any help. Nice guy though. Funny sometimes.",0
"Took Calc 1 (MTH 207) He explains the easy questions well, but leaves the harder questions for you to solve by yourself. Difficult daily quizzes. Ignores questions he doesn't feel are worth his time and has a pretty high opinion of himself, for example, refusing to accept emails if you don't refer to him as ""Dr."". If taking 207 AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"Professor Kiesow is simply amazing. I was able to contact him both over the phone and email and he was extremely helpful. He also gives good comments on submitted papers. In some cases, just when I thought I was not going to do to well on a paper, he comes back with something very positive to say and I ended up getting all A's. I recommend him.",1
"Honeslty she is very disorganized, she is a nice teacher though. Now, the lectures are very different than the tests, which throws you off, she is also a tough grader on lab papers, will take points for everything.",0
legend!,1
Difficult to say the least. Nice guy but not clear about what he wants. Super hard for a core class. I've had A's in theology previously and it was really really hard to get a B. He's definitely not easy and has ridiculously high expectations.,0
"Heather is really kind and cares about her students. I was not looking forward to public speaking, but taught different techniques to help with nerves, and it made it a lot less stressful. I would actually call this class fun! There was lots of creativity allowed for speeches. Impromtu speeches were my favorite. Take her class!",1
"The guy is a total scatterbrain, he lost several of my assignments.  He mostly follows directly from the readings but the prompts for the papers are often vague, confusing, or just poorly written/worded.  Overall, he has a very dry and far from engaging speaking style.  I would NOT recommend taking this class with this guy.",0
"a very artistic person, but at times he was extremely snappy. He did not like if I disagreed with him about my own art. I did all the work, worked hard, but he was argumentative at  times. Other times he was perfectly pleasant, and I can't say he was an unkind person. But his tendency to snap at students once in a while makes the class a but tense.",0
"tests are extremely hard-the average on test 1 was about a 50. study like crazy, because she picks the most random and picky stuff to include on the tests. doesn't use any visuals during lecture, so it's hard to pay attention. however, nice teacher & helpful if you ask questions. final project sucks-it's a 10-15 pg paper, but it's in groups.",1
"Very good proffesor, I totally understood her and very helpful. I recomend you take her classes. I had a very good experience with her and if you try to attend classes and be active you will get what you want. Easy to talk to and an open minded person for many problems.",1
Gives 4 Essays and 1 final exam hes a very hard grader. All we talked about were poems hes mean and out of 30 students 10 were left at the end of the semester and max 5 passed the class. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS,0
Greenberg is a professor where you can tell that he'd rather just do his own research than teach. He was a pretty confusing lecturer and it was also difficult to read his handwriting on the chalkboard. He also didn't answer emails. The textbook is your best friend.,0
she may be a brilliant playwright but she is far from a brilliant teacher.,0
Mean. Gives contradictory feedback. Not helpful.,0
"Overall she a good teacher, but she typical college professor. very boring and dull. she very nice, but the way she teach is confusing.",0
"Prof. Dhar, is honestly understanding, helpful and gives reasonable work. If you're confused all you have to do is ask and he'll walk you through the problem. I took him my second time taking this chem because the first time I wast completely lost in the class and got a D. Would definitely take him again, and recommend taking him.",1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich reminds me of a teacher running down the clock til he retires. Communication took FOREVER, and when he did resopond, he just reworded the syllabus without clarifying. Test questions were overly detail driven. Only take if you can teach yourself and memorize well.",0
run away from this teacher arrogant,0
Great person... tough grader,1
"Professor's reading assignments mostly consist of his own writings that summarize thinkers like Hegel, Locke, etc. in a few short paragraphs -- so this course doesn't really teach you about sociology or how to critically analyze texts, just parrot back his own ideas of who these people are. Seems very self-indulgent.",0
"she is very unclear, very unorganized and sometimes has an attitude with students after they dont understand her. she likes art though, and it shows. if you like writing and unclarity, take her art criticism.",0
"If you are serious about getting ahead in the Illustration industry, you will be as disappointed with Dennis as I was. I was uninspired by him, got no portfolio pieces from his classes, and was wholly disappointed with the number of assignments we were given. He will push you into painting instead of letting you explore your own methods.",0
"Professor Paige s one of the best professors at lehman, she understanding and straight forward with what she wants. highly recommended",1
"Class was 1 hour credit Backyard Physics. Prof is fun, entertaining, easy to contact and communicated very well (and respectfully!) via email. His lectures are TERRIBLE. Some are so bad I literally could not tell what he was saying. I expect he's a lot better in a classroom than online, and probably easier to understand if you're a science major.",1
"If you take intro or her gender and sex class, then you will have a blast. But if you take any higher level courses with her be prepared. She never actually teaches the material, it is up to you to learn it. Basically I learn more from the books she assigns than her in my other classes.",0
She is not helpful at all for a graduate course I had to take.  Does not have the  SME of anything but very good at shuffling paperwork required by the school.  Provides very harsh comments in an untimely fashion.  She assumes you will fail from the beginning.  You are better off to go to any other online schools for your graduate degree.,0
"Make sure to at least look over the readings, and show up. If you do both of those things, you'll be fine. If you're struggling, make sure to reach out to her early in the semester and she'll work with you, especially if you show genuine interest in the class.",1
way too hard and hes super picky about grammar,0
"Honestly and sincerely one of the most rude professors I've ever had. His teaching assistant, Kelly Budesa is just as bad. He had 'okay' insight but it felt as if they were only teaching because they needed to. In no way did it seem like they wanted to teach the course and if you asked them, they'd probably admit it. One of the worse profs I've had",0
Easily the best professor I've had. Made the content seem simple. Good guy in general.,1
"Dr. Raja's class isn't that hard, but be prepared to be talked down to a lot...I just kept my head down and surfed the back row.  Not a lot of busy work outside of class at least.  You can pull off a B in her class relatively easily if you just study a bit and show up, but I found her sense of humor and attitude toward students really irritating.",0
"While I have a rather large disdain for all Humanities classes, this class in particular wasn't all that enlightening.  It was really specific in the opinions and bias' we experienced as a whole throughout the class and it seemed like the holistic view of the class was trite and redundant.  Nearly worthless class.",0
Not a fun class,0
Mike does not like his students. He acts as though students are idiotic unless they know what he is thinking and he is incredibly disorganized. He has no idea what he wants from his papers and gives grades seemingly randomly. He has ruined my love for literature this class. Discussions are bland and boring and he gets annoyed easily.,0
"Not friendly at all, very unaproachable. Can't use the required book for reference, because when you are in her class you are in ""SHAMANE LAND,"" therefore you do things her way. After 19 classes at LCC, she is definitely at the top of my worst list.",0
"Prof. Rafferty is a good wake up call for an 8 am class. She's funny, extremely nice and helpful, and makes learning fun. I've found a great kindred spirit to come to for questions about any kind of physics, and she's really lenient with some grades. She's always willing to help, and I would absolutely recommend taking her for PHYS101.",1
Great CF teacher. Take her class if you get the chance. Lots of reading but interesting texts,1
"Don't take him .This class was  stressfull, difficult  ,and boring , with no help  .I was studying so hard , and at the end I got   a C  but for a moment a though I will not pass this class .I'm not going to see this professor  again .",0
She is way too excited--treats her 101 class like high school students. Too much work for an intro-level 101 class. Doesn't know how to discipline a class either.,0
"The teacher gives NO feedback. Do not expect clear instructions or responses. Poor communication for a communications teacher. Other than that, the class is an easy class as long as you participate. Also, when you try to find out information about your grade, you will receive an extremely rude response.",0
I took this class online and barely passed and I'm an honor student.She did not explain any of the work.She would post the assignment and give vague instruction on how to complete.I tried to set a meeting with her and she wanted me to drive to Springstead High School to talk about my grades.,0
Great teacher. I took this class in the summer and still learned a ton.,1
"Best professor I have had thus far. HE IS AWESOME. Super interesting and his grading is very fair. Great teaching style, very understanding, and I had zero complaints.",1
"I signed up for an in person class, but everything is on MyMathLab. I was sceptical at first, but it was actually pretty easy. Only needed to go to class for exam days and the final. Very few people show up on any given day so if you need one on one tutoring with him, he is able to do that and is good at it.",1
"Frank is the bomb dot com. His lectures are rough, and exams are definitely tough, but his class is one of the most inspirational.",1
She is incredibly unorganized. I will not take her again. She grades very strictly but does not teach very detailed. I never know what to study,0
the average class grade on his exams is ALWAYS failing and he advertises a 20 point curve in his syllabus. The fact that he HAS to give a 20 point curve should tell MTSU that he can't teach and no one learns anything. Avoid this professor.,0
"The most arbitrary grade I have ever received. Most of the grade is his opinion on your ""participation"". I learned NOTHING in this class. The material was basically pop psychology. To hammer the point home again, Meyer and his class was useless in every sense of the word.",0
"Mr. Hensen is a great instructor  . if you were having a problem with anything you could ask him for help during and after class. he has great ways to make class entertaining and interesting. i always looked forward to his class, not only because i like biology. doesnt give much homework..if any at all!! lab practicals are a breeze and tests. easy!",1
You have to read the book or you will not pass. Simple as that and if you don't take well to sarcasm beware. But truly he is a really sweet caring professor who engages with his students .He gives EC to those who participate and he really strives to not only help you learn but learn from you as well. IHe rewards effort,1
"Very laid-back professor with so much knowledge to offer to the class. His level of experience is impressing and helps keep the class interesting. Take him, he's very generous with extra credit and his tests and quizzes are easy! PLEASE teach Research Methods and Senior Sem!!",1
"Absolutely wonderful professor. I learned the most from her in one sememster then i have from the other professors i took italian with, (and i took 3). She taught from the heart and really cared about her students and genuinely enjoyed teaching!",1
We had 3 papers 2 of which were about the 2 books we read and the third was a research essay. The midterm and final is just an essay and short answer. She had us do Canvas discussions so don't neglect those they really matter! She cares about you the student more than anything so if you have an issue getting an essay in or something just email her.,1
"online literature set up clearly.  Assignments due every two weeks.  No tests except exam.  Had to post journals, lengthy unit discussions, 1 short research project. Good readings.  Must meet deadlines, but very fair professor if you read and do the work. Summer online lit. is only 8 weeks long,not 15, so only serious students should attempt.",1
class is definitely challenging. you have to buy a piano to practice otherwise you won't do well on exams. i do recommend the professor. if your serious about learning she will teach you.,1
"Ali is one of the best teachers York has.  I actually looked for his name when choosing my classes this year.  He is so helpful and approachable, he genuinely cares for the welfare of his students.  He makes the material interesting so you hardly notice that you are learning - but you learn so much in his classes.",1
"Great professor, he gives weekly assignments but they're only 150 words and they're easy. His lectures are all online so it's easy to follow along, and he tells  you exactly what's going to be on the test. He has experience in the field, and he knows what he's talking about. He's leaving to go to Worcester State next semester, I'm happy I had him",1
If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
In terms of workload its not hard at all. The 3 agency reports do not have a due date so just get them done when your free. The quizzes and test come directly from his notes and if not in the notes you can just find the answers online. He gives plenty of time for the quizzes and is very understandable. Do the extra credit it helps a lot.,1
"Probably the worst prof at OU. Flies through lectures with little to no practical explanation of the material and expects students to retain all the info (even skipped a chapter that was covered on final). Quizzes are 10 Qs that cover 5 chapters of material. Pretty much need to teach yourself with the textbook, and even that can only help so much.",0
"I really enjoyed Dr. Lewan's class. If you participate in class and act like you care, you will do very well in her class. You will learn a lot and your writing will definitely improve.",1
He did not seem to care about the class. Was always late to class. Very unorganized.,0
Well-organized syllabus & lectures.  Really knows  subject (Med Anthro) & challenges students to think critically about material.  Generous in pointing out areas where students could undertake further research. Communicates clear expectations re: exams and papers & gives very specific helpful feedback about student writing on same.  Excellent prof!,1
"I love Parkhurst, he is the best professor I've had at SFA. He is very caring and passionate about his work. While there are only 2 tests and an essay, the class is still pretty easy. There are quizzes pretty frequently, but he always lets you know ahead of time. 10/10 professor. He is funny, smart, kind, and just all around great. Highly reccomend",1
Really tough Professor. Not reachable by email which is the only way to communicate now.,0
She is the hardest professor I have ever had. Friends at large universities ask me why this professor is so hard on us at a community college. I have asked her for help over e-mail and a couple times she did not bother to read what I asked and responded rudely without helping me with a personal question about an assignment.,0
"Dry sense of humor, but the good kind. Makes it possible to get that A, but only if you deserve it. Put in the effort for this class and you should be fine. She provides you readings and has a question or two about them on her exams. Study guides are provided so use them. Loves what she does and it is pretty obvious. Overall great lecturer. ",1
"I really liked Ethan. A lot of people dont, he just takes some getting used to. pretty young & incredibly extra but its nice to have a professor like that. gave like 100 extra credit assignments, theres no reason anyone shouldnt have an A. Hes pretty new so still working on finding a teaching style that works for him. cares about his student A LOT",1
"Ms. Short is extremely smart and knowledgable. I loved learning from her, however her tests are near to impossible to pass. The test cover things barley covered and are not similar to the homework. Also they are usually 10 questions or under :(",1
"THE worst. He is so unprepared, inconsistent & unorganized for every class. The syllabus he uses is from about 10 years ago and never matches with whats actually going on. He has high expectations yet doesn't teach the information well, and makes it like his job is not a priority of his...very disappointing all around",0
You won't be graded on your knowledge of economics in this class. You're harshly graded on your ability to make pretty data visualization and your ability to summarize book chapters/articles that incorporate little to no economics. I would not recommend this class to anyone. Dr. Wooten made an interesting topic (crime economics) pretty boring.,0
No visual aid. Hard to hear her lecture. Description of the class is very misleading. Only focused on a very specific vein of activism and movements. Does not always respond to emails. Do not take it unless you are prepared to read numerous several hundred paged books. Absolutely hated this class. This professor is not good.,0
"Terrible teacher. Very unclear. Even though she is kinda helpful, doesn't know what she is talking about. In all honesty i could teach this class myself better than her",0
"Learning statistics was very challenging, coming to her made the different from failing to class to an A. She explains the material so well in class, it sticks to you. She is very lenient in grades. She wants you to take your time and slow down, that is why understanding the material with her is amazing. The other Stats class are far behind. ",1
"You have to write, take, and then grade your own tests, FOR A GRADE(This will take you hours). Not to mention the numerous progress reports you have to send her just to tell her you completed another assignment. Do not take this class if it is given online. It will be the most stressful thing, especially when you have to write your own final",0
"First off, this guy can't use a computer to save his life.  Watching him trying to make one work in lecture is painful.  His lectures are dull and dry, this was a pretty disappointing class considering how interesting the material could have been. The midterm was ridiculous too! It was so hard he had to scale it so something like 6%(SIX) was a C-.",1
"Best math teacher I've had at SFSU. Teaches the material clearly in class, and the exams are based on exactly what he teaches. Just pay attention, put in the effort, and it's an easy A!!",1
"horrible class. DONT take it.  dan doesn't talk about anything real during class, just rambles on about his opinion on stuff and then will give you random facts to write down so you can write the essays well. paper due every week, do all of them. and id write all the essays so that you can get a good grade. go to class because of random quizzes.",0
"Holly does not teach the class. She spends the whole class talking about her personal life and will spend 10 minutes at the end of class barely teaching coding, and keeps us 10 minutes late after class because she doesn't want to teach during the actual class. She doesn't care about shy people and grades extremely hard. Lynda will be your friend.",0
1. He does not understand a thing about what he's teaching;    2. He does not understand your codes either;    3. Constantly asks for help from the student next to him and 'his old friend'--google;    4. Takes points off for no reason he could explain;    5. Read directly from class notes he posts;    6. Can't prepare you ready for anything.,0
"I would absolutely NEVER RECOMMEND this professor. She is the WORST TEACHER I have ever had. She want's people to fail. She grades extremely hard and hates to answer your questions. I didn't believe the reviews until I saw it for myself. I have a GPA of 3.6 and barely passed this class with a c. Students beware, RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!!!!!",0
He creates a very unwelcoming environment. There's two professors who teach this class and both do a terrible job explaining the material. Hough doesn't even teach the class yet he's considered a professor. During office hours he comes off as very rude and makes you feel dumb for asking certain questions. He does not care about his students,0
"never on time, sometime strays off into a rant.  easy to get along with, helpful, lets you express your thoughts, caring, knows his stuff.  not like any other professor i've had, cool dude.",1
"Dr. Searfoss thinks she is the only one that is right. I never want to talk in this class because she never accepts anyone's answers, even though everyone is just giving their analysis of a reading. I am not sure why she even wants the class to participate when no one is right but her. I would not recommend her if you want to feel respected.",0
"No, this professor is not funny, he's cringey. Quiz topics are to vague to predict for any of his classes, and will not provide you with any review whatsoever. You just have to flatter him to get a decent grade. Don't believe the positive reviews they're very misleading and understate his very apparent flaws as a professor, probably the him tbh...",0
"Great professor! You need to attend every class if you intend on making an A and do his assigned readings. All test information will come from lecture so you need to make sure you take good notes and keep up with him. Not the easiest class, but one of professors you will ever get.",1
Dont be fooled by the fake charm. Mean in her core.,0
I loved this class. She was very nice and helpful . I learned a lot of ways to better my studying skills from her. Easy A too!,1
She is the head on Information Systems in FGCU. She is lazy does not want to teach. She is unethical and uses her power to control students. She even creates conflicts in the schedule for students drop her class. She refuses to help and she gives projects with very little clarity. Out of 8 chapters she only talked about 20 minutes about 2 of them b,0
Great teacher! Will help answer questions and will help you get a good grade if you try hard. I would spend 6 hours before every class in statistics working on the home work and studying and would come to class with a ton of questions. He typically comes to class early which is nice if you have any questions and gives occasional extra credit assignments,1
"I took Botany, Plant Bio, and latin and greek scientific terminology from Christine. She is a tough teacher if you don't have any interest in the subject. She is an amazing teacher if your are interested. Sharp as a tack, witty, and just sweet and caring. She doesn't have patience for slackers though!",1
"He is a great professor that is very passionate about what he teaches. He uses clickers to take attendance during class, but it only counts for a small percentage of your grade. A lot of the material covered for the exams can be found in the textbook.",1
"She really does know her stuff but her quizzes and exams are pure torture. She makes things harder on purpose. Almost as she is trying to have you fail. Recently she gave as an exam and right before it began, she said she added something we haven't studied. She spent about 5 minutes going over it, then gave us the exam. She ruined my GPA.",1
"How should I commence with the wonderfulness of this professor? This site wouldn't allow me to type more than 350 language. I would have penned a novel. Take as many of his classes as you can, absolutely astonishing!",1
"He is extremely old fashioned but also very thorough with presentations and papers. You'll learn a lot. However, if I were to take this class again I'd 100% take it from someone else. Some of his grading is a complete joke. I feel like if he decides your a B student, you'll be a B student for every paper/assignment. Very nice guy though.",0
he is an extremely tough grader for a level 100 class. he wont hesitate to smack you with low grades every time u have a slip up.,0
"I don't recommend him, but unfortunately he's the only one who teaches this class. Rarely comes off as friendly, is quite intimidating, and refuses to answer assignment related questions 99.9% of the time. He also rounds the final grade down instead of up. Um, didn't we all learn the basic rules of rounding in 3rd grade?",0
"Prof. Easterly knows a lot - he's an accomplished and knowledgable professor. The issue is, he's a horrible lecturer. He's incredibly slow and uninteresting in his presentation style, showed up late to class each week, sometimes did not respond to emails, and did not engage with his students. His material isn't horribly difficult to learn.",0
"Dr. Weston is a great prof. You need to know this class will probably be one of the most time consuming classes in your program. Research Methods isn't hard, but it is very in-depth and will require a lot of work and time, especially if you take the 7.5 week version. The hefty final project is due in the 5th week and there are badly worded exams.",1
"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",0
"Prof. Rich is such a lovely person, who understands her students. She works hard to make things interesting, and her cute and quirky personality just adds to her thorough and helpful power points. She obviously puts a lot of work in, and her exams are not too hard if you study. As a psych major, I'm happy to have started well :-)",1
"She was a great teacher. Very well prepared for each class, and even used problems from homework on the tests. All she asked was that you try and she will help you along the way. Great teacher, I do recommend taking her!",1
"All she ever does is read off what the questions will be on the test and on the days she doesn't do that, she has groups right a paper using 5 vocab terms, and the papers can be the crappiest and she doesn't care. I didn't learn anything from her class and it was such a waste. I would never voluntarily take her again. Great class for slackers",0
"I took this class online. I believe that Professor Killough would be a good professor in a different area, but not in Into to teaching (edu 200). She runs blackboard in the most unprofessional way that I have ever seen and when I told her I didn't understand it she laughed sarcastically. She gave me 2 0's for no reason and I had to correct her. ",0
"Prof. Joyal is a great professor who gets to know his students, especially in his Ancient Greek courses. He is adamant about grammar and syntax, but revisits concept often to help familiarise them. His feedback on assignments is valuable and constructive. Make sure you prepare for the class, because he will call on students to translate aloud.",1
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
"I've taken two of her classes and really loved them both, but because she runs her class with a lot of small group discussion, its really important to be with other people who have done the required reading otherwise you'll be very bored. she offers extra credit on both the midterm and final so if you read and go to class, you'll do well",1
"Did not show up for our final speech.  E-mailed us 15 minutes before the final that she would not be there.  We turned in these speeches as essays in a box in the journalism office, and she never gave feedback. Did not give clear feedback for earlier speeches.  When I asked her what I could improve on, she gave vague answers.",0
"Goodwin is an amazing teacher. The chemistry series is by no means easy, but Goodwin is always available and willing to offer help. If you are hardworking and do all the work and a bit more, you'll do very well in this class. Would definitely recommend!",1
"took for texts&contexts-not the easiest grader, but not the hardest.he's probably a secret genius.he knew everything about everything. kind of scatter-brained though and often went off on tangents-especially about birds.he's a nice guy though.if you're willing to put in some effort a B+ is definitely attainable.not sure what he expects for an A tho",0
"Prepare for a heavy dose of ""Ok, Ok...""  and ""Shift to the Right, Shift to the Left...""",1
"Super full of herself. First class she said ""Don't pay attention to RateMyProfessor reviews."" Thinks she's the greatest teacher ever. Super condescending and rude. VERY clearly favors students for non-academic reasons. Whatever you do, avoid at all costs. Seriously.",0
"She is one of the most wonderful professors or human being I have ever met. She is hilarious+ a great lecturer and teaches you not only what's in the textbook but also teaches you what's outside the textbook, a real-life lesson. She really cares about students. If you reach out to her for help she would make herself available for you.",1
"Taking Prof Walker's Physical Science class is rough.. She gets side tracked, or teaches us material that won't be on our quizzes. Her lessons and the study/homework material don't match up. Before our exit exam she crammed Geologic Time into one lesson, and the rest we had to ""master on our own over the weekend"". I don't pay to teach myself.",0
"Professor Landrum is an amazing professor. He teaches you how to truly view a film. However, be forewarned, you will read an entire book each and every week. You will be quized twice a week. You will also watch the novels adaptation every week. An 8-10 page essay along with a group adaptation is due right before your final. Do not fall behind.",1
"Dr. Kiesewetter is very organized, and gives good examples for students to study with. The only issue with her is that she WILL NOT scale. I took Chem 101 with her, and she would not scale anyone. She is very good with office hours, she's very nice and has great powerpoints, I would recommend her but get ready to work.",1
"*This course was taken during the Spring 2020 Covid-19 pandemic* Prof. Davidovitch would be much better suited to teach graduate level courses than a second-year physics course. His lectures were confusing and too fast-paced, assuming students already knew more than they did. A great person, but made the course material too difficult.",0
"Read a Ch. a week and do 15 T/F questions a week. Quiz every few chapters on all the HW questions. One Paper. Discussion Boards an must participate. Interesting reading, although, instructor has his own beliefs and the reading shows that. Entire text is on different philosophers beliefs which was unexpected to me. Do work get an A.",1
She is a very hard grader. My team and I received and F on our report. She has her own vision of what a paper should be. Be prepared to not receive the grade that you want.,0
"She is the sweetest professor I have ever seen. Easy A. Just read the materials she hands over and participate. Try not to skip the classes because she delivers amazing lectures. She is super accessible and replies back real quick. If you have any problem, just discuss with her and you will be fine.",1
"Had Dr.K back during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008.  Awesome, awesome prof.  Do the readings, and you'll be golden.  He has a hilarious sense of self-importance.  Ended class 60 minutes early one time to bitterly complain to the tech people about the faulty projector.  After all, he did want to give a Renaissance Art Lecture LOL ;)",1
"So unclear, like Jesus. How are you a math teacher?",0
Horrible professor. Might as well just be a full online class! i just found the class unorganized  and felt lost throughout the class. thankfully i passed.,0
You really will work for your grade more than any other class honestly. Try Not to take her class if you have a lot of other classes as well her class requires a lot of time. Studying is mandatory as well good luck youll need it.,0
He keeps telling me that he's going to steal my tears.  I will never let him.,1
"This AN101 class is treated like an upper level elective for juniors or seniors. Her lectures are long, she posts readings that are 50+ pages, and is beyond boring with no interactive. By far the worst class I have taken at QU and a waste of a free elective.",0
VAFI IS HERE - Sunny is one of the best instructors I have had in the Langara Nursing program. I had her for term 6 clicinal and she is a very supportive instructor. She understands that a 6 - week rotation is TOO SHORT for students to know everything unlike some instructors. She also gave lots of good feedback which supported my learning.,1
"3 texts required for the class (she assigns a ton of reading). Need main textbook for required papers. Canceled class multiple times an hour or less from the start of class. Attendance ""not mandatory"" but she gives pop quizzes. Never seemed to be prepared. She made up for most of her slacking with extra credit and study guides for exams.",0
"Professor Ratner has dry lectures if you are taking the hour long 3 x a week class. His presentation notes are helpful and necessary for tests. He is strict with cell phone use and computers are not allowed. He insists every student is on time, attends every class, and pays attention. His sarcasm is dry and somewhat insulting, be aware. He is ok.",1
"Sister Kirkham is a phenomenal professor. This is my 5th semester at BYUI and she has been my favorite teacher. She cares about you, and she shares stories about her personal life that will strengthen you. All of the material that I learned in her class will help me in other classes as well.",1
"Carlton is an AWESOME professor! 135/136 is taught differently than his other classes, more laid back but still gives you lots to do. He encourages you to submit your work again and again and is very thorough with feedback on your piece. I don't think I took a single test, just wrote all semester long, and it was things I actually wanted to write!",1
terrible dont go to class the test is so easy and you dont use your lecture notes.,0
The most BORING DUMB class I've ever taken.. This man is so boring his class will make you fall asleep especially if you have him for almost 3 hours he don't teach anything you can learn yourself if you read cause that's all he does I would never take him again and u shouldn't either.. You've been warned,0
Only took the online finance course; but my experience was a bad one. This is one of the poorest quality professors I have had a the university level. Outdated lectures/ practice problems will not help you prepare for the quizzes and tests. Quizzes and tests are given with a strict time limits and can be hard to complete. Lucky to get a C.,0
"She's young, but she's great. Awesome non ppt lectures. I was fortunate to have her for my class. Our average was very low (I don't know why), but I'm pretty sure it was my cohort's fault. She was always there for us and offered PLENTY of extra credit for us to earn.   If you are in trouble, GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. She'll help you succeed.",1
Best teacher I have ever had at Valencia College if you know what I mean,1
Every class was spent going over the previous class homework which took away time from the lesson.  No work sheets giving which I would have liked.  Overall she worked with you if you had problems.,0
"Way too much reading for a graduate class; lots of readings were redundant.  Piled on a major paper during spring break which is really bad because by then I needed a break from his class.  Avoid this guy if you want the usual graduate reading level that allows you to read, understand and MASTER the material; that's what Masters means.",0
"Paje is a good professor. No tests at all! If you want an easy class for GEL 101, then this is your class! No textbook needed! Only few readings but you don't really have to unless for discussion questions (They are online btw so it's very easy). Show up because he grades on attendance and participate because it's an easy class! quizzes were easy!",1
"Not to fault Prof Dynes, but this class was painful to get thru. Very long lectures covering boring material. Very hard to make it thru a full lecture while actually paying attention. GO TO THE TA EXAM Q&A SESSIONS. If you go to those and take good notes, you should pass no problem. Open notes, open internet tests which was also helpful.",0
"""This class is designed to stress you out."" Those are the words that Anne told us at the start of the semester, and I didn't think she was serious till I was crying every other day near the middle of the semester. Simply put, there's a lot of unnecessary work and assignments are designed to trick you. I gained nothing from this class except stress.",0
"Stuffy, puffy and full of himself. A joke, really.",0
Professor Tavss is the sweetest professor I've ever met. He knows his stuff and gives practice problems that will help you succeed at Chemistry.  He is very approachable and helpful. I highly recommend taking him because  he wants you to do well and you will do well with Tavss.,1
"Horrible teacher. Took him for eth hack, and it was clear he has never done it in the field. Could not bring any real world experience to the class. Many students walked in knowing more than him. All of his labs could be found online for free. Doesn't use updated material. Tests have nothing to do with the material he covered.",0
Avoid unless you know VHDL. Won't assist you past the first part of the project. Everything else is easy but you will only get a C if you can't do the projects. You will not learn anything.,0
She is very nice and she loves what she does BUT prfessrs should know how to convey what they're saying properly and half the time I ask her a question I have no idea what she is saying All of the prelab quizzes have had AT LEAST one question that wasn't in the lab and had to be online and isnt whats in the lab reading thats right its what she says,0
He called the feedback insulting in class but he needs to listen to what we are saying. This format is not working for most people. He needs to change his grading scale & curve. Not a bell curve just a normal curve that all other teachers do. My last chem teacher added 5% to each test but he waited to announce it until the final. He should do that.,0
I have never experienced such a rude and unhelpful professor here at Miami. I was very disappointed with the way she handled situations via email and during discussions. The class is easy but is also easily one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. I loved anthropology before her class. I seriously suggest against taking any class with her.,0
"I decided to take David's class because of the fact it was an evening class that worked with my schedule. That was a huge mistake, he seems incredibly unorganized, doesn't care to make things clear, teaches as if you learned this 4 times already, and just doesn't care. A student in my class had a concussion and David deemed it not excusable.",0
Do not take any of her classes. I am in FAMS 160 with her and she is so unorganized and never gives clear directions. She never tells us ahead of time when we have projects or tests and does not follow the syllabus. She also does not have any clear grading criteria and her tests are horrible.,0
"Save yourself and do not take him. Its art and you will fail. He has these things called dvd, watch a movie have a quiz straight after. Those were easy. The test were the worst though. He gives a study guide with the paintings names and you have to memorize all you can for that painting. Keep in mind there are like 30 paintings and vocab.",0
"the 2 main projects are inventing a game and playing it, and writing a book as a class... both projects were awesome, even though the book was really stressful at times, but it came out really good... theres no hw and no tests, just a final, and he wants the class to think for themselves and not rely on him which was interesting.. TAKE HIM!!!!",1
Sheila is fabulous! I took an accelerated online class. It was so easy! You get 5 assignments and 2 exams. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. My only complaint is I wish I hadn't bought the book. Her notes and resources are certainly enough to get an A on the exams.,1
Great professor but she spoiled the Lion King for me,1
"I took 1 a and 1b with him, he was one of my favorites. He was so kind and the work was fair for 10 and 1b. He works on a newspaper now.  Glad I had him for a professor for a year with my neighbor.",1
"I love her sense of humor!  She is a riot...if you have the opportunity to take a class w/ her, you definitely should!  She's a bit too much of a feminist, but if you can see past that, she's a wonderful professor.",1
"Really great professor. Cares a lot  about students and sociology. Only two papers all year, a midterm and final. No homework ever. Lectures are kind of boring but always lets us out 30 mins early. Strict about no cell phones other than that so amazing.",1
Nice but personally thought it was a difficult class.,1
"At first Dr. Gamble will seem intimidating and condescending. Go to class and keep up with the material. If you can move past his rude remarks, you will learn a great deal. He is very knowledgeable, although he will never remember your name!",1
"Ms. Battista is not a fair grader. The online quizzes constitute a large portion of your grade; however, they are on material that is not covered or provided. Essentially, you are walking into the dark with no preparation or access to information, while being graded. The only way to do well on these quizzes is through luck.",0
"If you take her class, you'll learn a lot about literature, but at the expense of having to endure her constant humiliation of everyone in the room, her obnoxious rants about ""bozos"" ranging from political leaders to the college staff, and her viciously mean-spirited remarks carried under the banner of being ""frank."" I heard she made a Marine cry.",0
I'm maybe not the biggest lover of math so math courses aren't my favorite thing but great teacher for this course for sure.,1
"Shes such a sweetheart! If you do the work, youll be fine. Shes very considerate and loves her students. I wish i could take her again lol!!",1
"He almost never had class, but when he did all he talked about was Carnegie and social mobility. Then he would give us online quizzes worth 100 points that were impossible to pass, and I ended up getting a C because he never actually taught but still gave us the weekly quizzes. His tests are all essays and he never gives you your grades back.",0
"She's not a bad teacher, but she's really weird and intense, she makes me uncomfortable. If you work hard you could probably manage a B+ but if you kiss her butt you can probably get an A",0
Worst professor in the school.  I hated everything about him.,0
She's extremely critical of everything you come in late you will lose points for your assignment. Very tough grader for a beginner college english. Would NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!,0
Falk makes his class unnecessarily difficult. He gives homework on topics that haven't even been mentioned in class until after the homework is due and these topics are not in the textbook he recommended. He runs the class like a graduate class and will spend all your time on his class. He is very understanding about life circumstances though.,0
"It was an online class but recitations with him were mandatory, normal amount of work but the professor wouldn't give clear grading criteria and will mark off for things that weren't listed as required. When he made mistakes he wouldn't own up to it and almost failed the entire class.",0
Yemut gets frustrated when students ask questions... rolls eyes and goes fast when going over the material. He will ask if anyone has questions but expresses irritation if a question is asked and has a strong accent. I used to love math but since i've taken his class i now hate math,0
Class is essentially at your own pace. Easy A with minimal effort as long as you try. Content is not hard and you probably won't ever see/hear Squire now that the class is asynch. Great elective to take with harder CS core classes.,1
"DO NOT take a class with her online. The course is extremely disorganized and she doesn't ever put grades up, so you won't know how you're doing. Also, she never answers e-mails. Although you'll end up getting a good grade if you do the work, you'll feel as if you learned nothing.",0
Super cute. Super nice. Lots of boring text book readings but if you do them you'll get an A. Saw him a lot for office hours and he was very helpful.,1
If you're taking this class for a gen ed then don't take it because it is a lot of work and projects for a gen ed. It's an interesting class and I would recommend it because it's enjoyable but it's a lot more work than I expected.,1
When he teaches he just stands there and reads off the powerpoint. doesnt do many examples to actually teach you the material. No extra credit. Does not care if most of the class if failing and does not do much to help. Would not take again and would not recommend. Tests are majority of grade (75 percent of your grade including final).,0
Mike is one of my favorites professors in umich. He cares about students and willing to help outside of class. This course really needs hard work especially do a lot of practice questions. When you stuck ask for help right away. Go to the help room! Mike is an amazing professor. Take it with him! Less pain!,1
This class is the reason why I am a better writer than I was in high school. Tom cares so much about his students and truly wants them to succeed. This is by far one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I wouldn't have wanted to take it with anyone else.,1
really hard class. lectures are irrelevant to midterms and final. midterms and final contain unseen problems,0
"Lots of enthusiasm.  Excellent knowledge of subject and examples given are awesome.  The only professor that graded things quickly.  14 easy, 10 point assignments to help your grade.  Offered extra credit.  Made classes fun.  I would take her again.  Best marketing instructor at EMU.  Stellar",1
yes take hipp good teach yes,1
"Dr. Everhart's lectures were always interesting and engaging. He has a passion for teaching and it shows. Though he can seem a bit distant in 1 on 1 communication, I always felt that I got what I needed. I really got a lot out of this class largely due to the quality teaching provided by Dr. Everhart. I would love to take another class with him.",1
The test was irrelevant to both lectures and labs. Try to avoid.,0
"De Vos is a very smart person, and likes to make jokes in class. However, this actual class was completely useless. Called ""Sex & Gender"", he mostly talked about his personal life and told stories. PowerPoints were taken right out of the book. Open note exams, so it wasn't very difficult. Get points by being in class, although they were useless. ",0
"She sets her deadlines for 10:00pm instead of 11:59pm. She won't accept ANY late work even if you have a legit reason and proof. Hands down the worst instructor I've ever had. She also requires sources for trivia? Don't bother taking her class, you won't actually learn anything anyway. She just posts tests. Listen to all these bad reviews, all true",0
"Is way too personal in lectures, treats us as if shes at the psychologist. Gives extra credit but you have to pay $15 for the app. 3 exams are 75% of grade and homework (that she says helps pay her bills) is 25%. Would not take again but it is an easy class if you prefer a teacher who gives out way too much personal information.",0
"She used to teach in Elementary school, and she runs her college class that way. She definitely cares for her student, but more in the ""overbearing mother"" kind of way. You might have to swallow your pride in order to pass.",0
"Have problems? Talk to him. Basically spelled out how he wanted his essays to look like, and even when I didnt have a whole lot of time to give to an essay I did what he said and got a B. ",1
"Taking Spanish 204 with Profesora Sánchez is like taking two classes at once. In the first class, you complete predetermined online assignments that relate to the textbook and have casual grading deadlines. In the other class, Sánchez just lectures on certain legends, history, and musical stuff that she finds interesting about Bolivia and LatinAme.",1
Dr. Sikora does not know how to teach Calculus. I have already taken Calculus in high school and the credit would not transfer to UB. He will not accept on tests the way the book explains or another equally right way. His lectures are repetitions of the reading and he is completely unorganized and hard to follow.,0
Horrible Instructor. Does not communicate whatsoever. Pretty much getting paid for setting up blackboard & leaves you on you own afterwards.,0
"Class participation: mandatory. More writing than Ive done for any English class. Weekly articles & book Q&A to be submitted online/in person. 2 major written projects. Tests: pretty tough, even if you studied. Actual core info was super interesting learning about why people believe & do what they do, but I was constantly stressed out all semester",1
Class could of been more about what I was expecting to take other than something I was not even expecting to take,0
"He truly cares about the students. He wants you to succeed and grow especially with your speeches. He focuses more on the speeches over tests/homework. I would take him again if I could, just a good guy!",1
He is unable to actually teach anything without having the book to tell him the answer. He looks to the students for answers to the problems he is supposed to be teaching us! he is not organized at all and comes to class unprepared. Do not take his class!,0
"I had english with Dr. Stephens this spring, and she's ok.  But make sure you hand in all your work, because she has a tendency to forget things and blame you for it.  Her midterm and final had nothing  to do with the classwork tho...",0
"awsome class, awsome prof., no text book, no final. learn a lot.",1
He is a very hard teacher. His notes are a very dumbed down version of his tests.  The tests are all 2 or 3 questions.  I never used the textbook because he gave us all his notes and we were allowed to use them on tests.  Do not think that the notes will help and make sure you study to pass. HUGE curves on tests and quizzes.,1
"I learned so much not just about drawing, but life from Prof K's class. what a classy guy. as long as you put in an effort and challenge yourself a bit, you'll do fine. usually just one homework drawing a week. nothing too crazy. no midterm or final. just some one-on-one crits. COMPOSITION, QUALITY OF LINE, and PLAY OF LIGHT. that's it. rock on.",1
"Dr. Rumenik means well, but sadly, she misses the mark on being an efficient professor. She knows Psychology material but is not great at teaching it to others. She takes ridiculously long pauses in between sentences, takes an excessive amount of time to answer emails, and goes off on tangents constantly. Also, she lacks up to date tech knowledge.",0
While I won''t deny that I think my writing improved from taking this course I would never recommend a Nelson class to anyone.  He''s very pretentious and he addresses his classes with such an air of superiority as if we are simply lucky that he''s letting us in on his insights about literature and the English language.  I would avoid at all costs,0
"If you have to take a literature class, take this class!! He is really reasonable and fair. there are short quizzes(5 q.)and you get 2 trys, there are papers but there not bad. If you just do the work every week you will get a good grade.The way he has everything set up is really organized and clear too.The class is not hard, and hes a good teacher",1
"I took this class for fun. It was more work than I expected. We had to write 3 papers for our discussion section. Tests were not easy, but fair. Clickers are worth 10% just for responding to the questions, you can get all of them wrong. I doubt that many freshman could pull off an A in this class. Really good teacher, nice guy.     :)",1
"god this lady is the devil, simon cowel of the speech word. everything you do is wrong, even if its right. NEVER take this lady.",0
"She is an amazing teacher and her class is not hard. She takes attendance, but only to learn your name. It is not for a grade. She does a lot of fun activities in class. She was seriously one of my favorite classes to go to. She assigns kind of a lot of group projects, but they are not hard. I would highly recommend her!!!!",1
"This was the worst prof I ever had. Don't bother taking her. She is so rude, very un understanding and extremely tough grader. You have to do everything exactly the way she wants it or you will fail. Her lectures are also extremely boring . Also make sure you're never late because she will take points off.",0
Mr. Schultz is a great down to earth instructor. His lectures are short and to the point. I would extremely recommend him as he is one of the best instructors in the program. Wish I would have found him sooner in the program.,1
"Please try to find a better english teacher. Professor Hetrick loves the sound of his own voice and will talk for an hour and a half straight about his job at USD and the drinking age. I went in for help multiple times and emailed him repeatedly to get almost no help on improving my essays. I wanted to improve my writing, but I learned nothing.",0
He gets frustrated when you try to ask questions. Wouldnt take again,0
"255: rizkalla will spew HUGE amounts of equations that are HASTILY derived, you will have to memorize or derive(impossible) these on a test. The textbook is useless and there are little to no resources to use to study his material because he teaches it his way. AVOID.  311: can be passed by just reading the book, tests are a little tricky",0
Greatest professor I ever had!,1
If u r taking this class read everything in the sylabis! You will need it! if she gives u notes b prepared to take a pop quiz next class. Her notes are all over the place bring a recorder. Her tests are hard. STUDY THE TIME LINES! and yes she has favorites.,0
"She does fly through the problems without seeing if the class understands, but I really don't think it's totally her fault. This class covers A LOT of material and has to be crammed in somehow. That being said, I still wouldn't recommend taking her class. She just isn't a great teacher. She's not good at conveying information.",0
Great professor. Lectures are fast-paced and carry a lot of content. The exams have a written section which tends to be the most difficult. Amazing lectures and teaches economics with real-world examples and show clips. Entertainng class.,1
This professor is challenging and most times confusing.  Most of the semester I spent teaching myself because she did not give good lectures.  She is confusing and unorganized.  She sometimes seems aloof and doesn't know how to answer questions. She is tough; nice person- but not a good teacher at all.,0
I took her class over interterm and she is the best Spanish teacher yet. Even though the class is very fast paced she does and great job and the tests and quizzes are very easy. She is also the sweetest and is willing to help with anything! Not to mention she sometimes bring food/candies to class!,1
She made me want to drop out of college and move to another country.,0
"Have 4 exams and 1 cumulative final. One note card per exam but you can use 4 notecards on the final so save all of yours! Do the practice problems and look through the powerpoints to help. See his office hours to check the work  and you will do great. If you do this, no need to go to class. Attendance is taken but no points awarded for it.",1
"Chandra is the worst professor I have ever had at umb. Physics is a difficult subject to begin with and 90% of the class are not physics majors yet his expectations for us are ridiculously high. 2 midterm and a final, midterms consist of 2 questions, so if you get one question wrong you fail. Endless amounts of homework not even related to lecture.",0
"Wouldnt suggest him. Very absent minded and unprepared for class. Also pretty unclear about what he expects for case studies and other projects, which makes the class way more challenging than necessary",0
"He's a very entertaining and smart guy, and if you listen to him you will learn a lot. Quizzes and tests are unbelievably easy. Pay attention in class and take decent notes and you'll ace them w/ no problem. He digresses and tells stories a lot but it won't hurt you or your grade. Just be respectful, listen, and participate.",1
"Besemer seems cool at first, but she's actually just rude and should not be a professor whatsover. She also showed up about 15 minutes late to every class.",0
"She's straight forward, comes off a bit intimidating at first but don't let that stop you from asking questions about the assignments. Be ready for to write papers, present a lesson to the class, reading, and participation is a must, she will call on you. Overall she's a great professor, very knowledgeable and passionate about education.",1
So attendance is not necessary all the powerpoints are online but she does take into consideration your attendance and participation. If you were smart you would come to class she has a very clear way of explaining what the powerpoints are about. Each of her exams and quizzes have opportunity to gain extra points. She makes psych interesting!!!!!!,1
"Mr. MacCabe is an amazing teacher. I was nervous to take his class because of the other reviews on here, however, I am SO glad I did. Very understanding teacher, helps you out personally if you do not understand something, and will email back right away with scores and responses. Such an amazing teacher and a very interesting class.",1
Seminar on Internet and Politics.  Great class.  Highly recommended.,1
"Great professor would finitely take him again & would recommend him. he was an easy professor/class you do have to read the book you will need it for the Test. you do 3case studies and he allows you to do 2 & the 3rd one is for extra credit you take Test 50 questions each multiple choice T/F you have 1 hour to take them. EASY class, do work on time",1
"I found this course very hard and I regret take it because my GPA went down after taking it. The material is very heavy and hard to understand because its not clear about whats the course is! I am in a program of the education department and the course is EDUC, but it doesnt have anything with education. Do NOT take this course, VERY HARD!",0
"fels does not know what she is teaching, our class average for midterm exam was 45% while other classes had 60%. for the final, she put a short answer while no other class had it, she also made us watch 2-3 hours of youtube videos and study all case studies and noother class had to. she also counts 5% of participation mark for tweeting",0
Lazy Professor! All she does is giving you a load of readings and then have the class talk about it while she just stands there and literally nods to everything. It is honestly pathetic! There is only 3 assignments that make your grade or break it. All based off a book and articles. It is really annoying & there is no real class engagement!,0
"Good teacher! 3 steps to pass the class 1.do the work on time, 2. dont miss class, 3. dont be late for class.  And you will get an A",1
"Very good. Provided a lot of real life examples. It was very helpful. But I was in a large class, and hence it is little difficult to participate, otherwise good.",1
"Too many pointless, time and paper wasting assignments. Boring class which is only offered for 2 hrs and 45 min",0
This professor is impossible to please. I have never had a professor at ASU grade papers the way he does. He is a stickler for EVERYTHING. I am an A student on the deans list and have written A+ papers for over 3 years at ASU and never have had a professor treat me like I know nothing. Do not take him if you can avoid it.,0
He attempted to teach us more material from Calculus instead of applied math. I went multiple times to ask for help and all his response was to look at the homework. The tests were nothing like the homework he assigned and the tests are the only grades he gives. He is by far the worst professor I have had and I would not recommend him to anyone. ,0
"Mrs. Mattox is a really nice lady who has loads of experience in the subject she teaches. It can sometimes feel like a high school class but that's what she's used to teach. She does ""reviews"" for the test that are usually all of the test questions so if you memorize those, the class is a super easy A. SOOO many group projects.",1
He's literally just an audiotape of the words on the slides. He also will just have 2 midterms and a final for his classes. He gave us practice questions (just pulled from textbook) and said (after the average of the midterm was extremely low) that you shouldn't expect the questions to help you on your exams. Finals are cumulative.,0
Professor Brown really engages the class and knows what he is talking about. I loved every moment of my course with him.,1
"Dr. Tim Cook is by far the best teacher. He makes a hard lesson to be something fun to learn for students. I could not thank him enough. If you have a chance to enroll in his class, you are going to have a great time learning Japanese!",1
"He is a very good professor. He is very polite and he likes to give his opinion and advice. He will try to help you out as much as he can and he will reward teams for their hardwork.   The course itself is not easy, because you will need to have a good team in order to deliver a good product.",1
"Dr. O. is a tough professor, but she is accessible and clear.  If you have a question she is quick to respond.  Her responses on discussion posts are thought provoking and you learn from them. She includes comments for improvement on the CT assignments too which is very helpful in such a tough class.",1
"Although I enjoy writing, I tend to doubt my abilities. This course being an upper division writing course made me anxious. Dr. Lorimer's syllabus was clear from the start of the quarter. She is direct with her expectations, but is also clear that she wants each student to be successful. You are expected to write at a high level. Use the resources.",1
"The class itself was very easy, I ran into some issues with the SAM site and when I asked for feedback it never came.  Overall the class was good but I had absolutely no interaction with the professor on her end. ",0
Tons of readings that were only useful half of the time. The lectures didn't include that much participation from the students and he had a tendency to trail off on tangents and lull you to sleep with his voice. He is a great guy and if you're somewhat engaged as a student you'll pass. But not as enjoyable as it could have been.,0
"Funny guy, is good at what he does.  Test are pretty easy, except if you have him more than once he is kind of repetative",1
"Dr. J is extremely intelligent and kind, she is the only professor who knows how to work with students with special needs. I have never had a professor who understood my learning difficulties, she works with me instead of awkwardly ignoring me. I am SO shy and bad at history, she encourages me to do my best and has helped me to speak up in class.",1
The class is very easy if you buy the textbook and follow the powerpoints. She does a good job explaining the material but kids don't pay attention because she is kinda boring. But she gives a lot of extra credit on each test - a 70% or higher was a A. If you put in a little effort and pay attention you will do fine,1
"General Physics at Umass Lowell was hands down the worst educational experience of my life, the professors are inept and incompetent. The lectures don't match the recitation, which doesn't match the labs. The Umass Physics department is the biggest sorry excuse for higher education I've even had the misfortune to be a part of.  F's across the board",0
She was very helpful and wanted everyone to succeed. We were able to complete all of our modules early. She responded to emails pretty quickly. I would most definitely recommend her. I took her for a 5 week course and would do it all over again. Do the work and youll pass with an A !,1
Overall decent class.Lets you out after about 1.5 hours most days.There are 3 tests that he allows you to use notes on plus the final. Assignments are 3-1 page gang articles and a 4-page essay on a gang of your choice plus a presentation. Relatively easy to get an A or B. I would recommend him for any AJ majors that want a somewhat easy elective.,1
"Dan is amazing, he got me my first internship based off of one assignment. He is inspirational and insightful, his courses are tough, but you just have to talk to him about what your doing. He does talk a lot, but it's always useful information or amusing anecdotes. TAKE HIS CLASSES.",1
"Beginning and advanced students are allowed in the same class, so some are bored while others are lost. Homework is returned without corrections and there is not much feedback from the teacher. Grading is harsh.",0
"He is a great professor. He goes through the material at a slow pace, so I always felt prepared for the exams. There is a slight language barrier, so sometimes the wording on the exams make it difficult to understand what he is asking for, but otherwise the exams are very straight forward. He won't try to trick you. I would recommend his courses.",1
"One of the best courses I've taken at TC, one of the best teachers I""ve encountered at TC.",1
She extremely cares about her students. She's always there to help you and she will find a way to help you achieve your goals in life.,1
Taking this class made a significant positive impact on my life. Thanks Dr. Barrett :),1
Great class. Lots of reading but not too difficult,1
Of his 5 exams expect to spend 5 hours on each exam. Be happy if you get a 50% on the exam because that wont happen very often. Your grade is weighed 90% on the 5 exams and you will not remember anything from this class when your done. Dustin is nice and can teach but nothing that he teaches will resemble that which will be on the exam,0
"I thoroughly loved his class. He's funny and enjoys teaching. His lectures require a lot of notes which he doesn't post online so don't skip. The aerial project was time consuming so don't procrastinate, but it's a nice grade booster. His tests are easy if you pay attention and take notes, so if he draws something you should copy it.",1
Dr. Cox is an incredible teacher and really cares about her subject matter. She is also very caring and was very understanding of both medical and emotional issues that affected my ability to do school work. I took another one of her classes the next semester because I loved her teaching style so much.,1
Great at making lectures interesting. Genuinely cares about her students. Put forth a little effort and you will succeed. Great for both science and arts majors.,1
"it was an easy class. i didn't do well on 4 exams and i passed with a b ,and he is very helpful. the class was never boring because he gets the entire class talking in spanish",1
"GET READY TO TEACH YOURSELF. Her powerpoints are just pictures and graphs, there are no explanations when she gives you the slides, you will most likely leave the class extremely confused. The only work she gives is Chem 101 (the online homework) and tests, so there are no opportunities for extra points to boost up your grade. She's nice at least",0
He is nice and a good teacher. Two big group projects but they are really useful if you are trying to be an entrepreneur. The tests are pretty moderate,1
"Nice guy. However, if you take no other warning take this one. When he says that ""if you are able to do the homework, you will do fine on the test."" -- Just know that is a complete and utter lie. The tests are 50x harder than anything he gives for homework or does in class. If you have not had calc before I would recomend another prof.",0
"ECO300 Lecture was online while there was an in person lab component. The class consisted of not a lot of effort from Bremer. You basically read the textbook then did a module which ended up being 4-8 pages, and they were due every Sunday. He would then give exams maybe once a month online. The exams were given without feedback from the HW",0
"She is a great Professor. Clear on what she wants you to do for homework. She checks your homework and returns them with corrections if any. Her  exams is exactly what is taught in her class. If you do your homework and participate in class, you will do fine.",1
"Worst teacher Ive ever had. His study guides for the tests are 17 pages of stuff listed that you need to know. Jokes around about failing and says there is always next semester, good luck passing his class with a C. You can study and work your ass off just to barley pass. Hes a dr so expect to have as much knowledge as him and retain everything.",0
The best psych teacher at ELAC. Very approachable and very understanding. Great lectures and notes. She really likes group work. Makes psych fun and easy to learn. Highly recommend her class!,1
Awful. Seems to think their class is the most important or something. Doesnt seem to realize there are students taking 5 classes and still assigned a 10-12 page research paper. Wish I never took their class.,0
"This class says it is synchronous but the Professor operates as if it were asynchronous. Only requiring that we be present on test days. So that means little to no lectures to explain the work you're expected to know. HW is provided weekly. Test are VERY difficult. 12-15 answers per question on test to choose from, instead of normal 2-3 options.",0
"Not too bad of a class. I already knew most of the information, so that made it easy. It was incredibly boring, though, and my head was constantly dropping down because I was falling asleep every other day. She definitely saw me lmao! Tons of extra credit, though. Final was only over three chapters.",0
Her test were way to hard and had tricky wording. Her study guides were not the best either so that was no help. Wouldn't recommend her if you have a busy schedule!,0
"Very good, kind teacher.  The class was super easy, 5 or 6 papers throughout term, hybrid course.  Hardest thing was research paper, but relatively easy if you put your mind to it.  Would recommend her highly and take her again.",1
"Overall, I enjoyed this course. It was interesting and relevant to my field of focus. Dr. Gilbert was helpful for me with responding to emails fast whenever I had questions for him and was always willing to help. The only big critique I have is his lack of uploading grades on Blackboard to allow me to see my progress throughout the course.",1
"Completely uninspiring and reads pre-prepared notes when lecturing, the lecture lasts about 30-40 minutes. The exams are extensive so just writing down notes will not be enough to prepare you for the exams. The lab consists of her telling you the page in the lab manual and you figuring it out from there.",0
"Each class is packed with information from the moment class starts. Professor Romani is not a bad professor, but the class in itself can become dull after doing the same exact thing every day. Same thing different notes. I would take her again for a class like health, she really does know what she's talking about.",1
"He seems so nice at first but grading is very harsh, answers to the CM Exerc can be correct but if its not what he is looking for, well too bad he aint giving you a point! Class was via Zoom,he requires cameras and mics at all times for attendance. I dropped after two weeks,it was too much work. PLEASE dont take this class, there are other options!",0
"He is an alright teacher, giving it was his first time teaching here. Exams were a bit tricky to me, but I probably just haven't studied it extremely well. Covers a lot of material in this class. His writing on his notes is bad, but legible to an extent. Do well in your lab reports and you will do fine in this class. ",0
"She is the only instructor that teaches ICS 129 and ICS 270. Also she gives us a lot of assignments, test, and projects w groups. I say it too much information and work to be teach, especially only meeting up once a week. She is a tough grader, so make sure you don't miss any assignments, quizes, test, or projects or else you won't pass!",0
"Steve is a nice guy and although he  often asks very broad vague questions, he just wants to hear your opinion and have you expand on the material. He is all for allowing the class decide what to do and how to do it. Really liked the choice of a blog or story at the end. Lastly he brought coffee for us, so he warranted a good review.",1
She's a sweetheart and wants everyone to succeed. She will give you a review for quizzes and exams. She's usually always available and willing to help. She also does open labs and will help out with anything you need. She can get a little crazy sometimes but Karen is a gem.,1
great prof.   lucky if you get him,1
"Syllabus says he wants you to be a great thinkers really, only if you think like him. This class was mundane. I didnt do my best work, and wanted this class to be over. Great thinkers get there points across with less words then he does. The syllabus was 20 pages for only half the semester. I did not learn anything from him. Waste of money. ",0
Dr. Gordon is one of the best history professors I have had. He has a good sense of humor and he makes the lectures fun and interesting. If you show up and take notes then the tests are easy. I would definitely recommend him if he teaches again!,1
"I had Dr. Li for bio 150 lab and you cant understand what he says, he  doesnt teach very well. Also for the lab assignments he doesnt actually grade his own students work. A grad student does and that same student also gets all other lab teachers assignments to grade. He hurts you because he doesnt teach you what you need to know for the papers.",0
"She's an amazing professor even in her first year. She helped me out as much as she could this semester, including meeting with me outside of her office hours multiple times. We moved the schedule around to make sure all our readings were clear and took less time on the things we didn't enjoy.",1
"Easy class, easy tests, but extremely scatterbrained professor with poor social skills, who loses students work.",0
"Terrible teacher. Didn't grade any assignments until the middle of the quarter. I didn't know I was doing a bad job, so I didn't know I was supposed to improve. I had to drop out because of this. Very late grader, insane amounts of reading and participation. IF YOU REGISTERED IN HIS CLASS, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Especially if you're a freshman.",0
Excellent Teacher,1
So uninspiring. So boring. It was torture being in his class. He humiliated students whenever they asked a question. He offered absolutely no guidance. He speaks in a low soft voice and has major problems hearing. Avoid taking his class!,0
"Best teacher so far. You will have to work in this class but you'll also learn.  Very willing to help if you're willing to work.  Responded to emails in timely fashion.  Lets you submit work early for critique so you'll have a chance to revise before final submission.  If you fail this class, it's because you don't listen to what he says.",1
"Steve is alright.  He will lecture, but does not seem confident in what he is teaching.  He sometimes got confused on what he was teaching, and didn't really seem to care if you understood the material.  His tests were really easy though.  I did not really feel like he taught me a lot, and that I did well because my HS calc teacher was 100x better.",0
Great class.  Knows so much about Computer Science. Will help you out. Nice guy.,1
"I took her during the summer mini semester. She has clear instructions on what she expects. 3 exams (2 attempts), 1 paper, 1 final. She drops the lowest grade of the 3 exams. I would recommend doing each chapter review to study for the final and her tests. Easy class but theres a lot of reading. Dr. Cirillo wants her students to learn and pass",1
I recommend taking her Global Women in Leadership freshman seminar. You read 3 books (very easy). No tests or quizzes. No homework assignments. One group project. She is very sweet and friendly. Easy A. My class was all girls and we all got very close and could talk freely to one another. Very positive environment!,1
She speaks too low,0
This is the worst teacher I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"Class is smarter than she is. You can argue your answers and get credit for being wrong pretty much as long as you have a good arguement. She moves off topic a lot and is easily distracted by student dicussion. She also favors to a degree. Easy to make her favor you, sound smart and outgoing. I prefer her class over any else because she's so easy..",0
"Daigle grades on a very high curve, probably because everyone would fail the tests if he didn't. Tests are really long, especially for a 50 minute class period. He is SO boring and I can't even stand to take notes. Hard to study for tests, and there are only 3. Very unclear and hard to follow his lectures. Good luck if you take him...",0
"Dr. Taylor is an amazing professor! He's super funny, tries to connect with the class and will answer any questions you need help with. You can go to him during his office hours and just talk if you want to (or if you need help). He's super chill",1
"Professor Jaja was always available after class when I had questions that needed to be answered. You need to pay attention in class and study a lot. Its not an easy A , but if you work for it and asked questions you will do fine. She is very kind and approachable if you are respectful to her as usually expected by any professor.",1
Bunch of busy work so much effort required for basic grades. Way too cheerful. Definitely has favorites.,0
"He was very unhelpful and doesn't tell you what he expects of the essays. On the first one, I got an A and the second one I got a C. When you ask him for help he disappears. Apparently, medievalists are very busy living in their parent's basements doing jack****.",0
"Exams are fair and straightforward with no trick questions but you must learn ALL the material if you are aiming for an A. Matt is very approachable and thorough if you need clarification. Lectures are easy to follow and engaging. Time management for memorization is key in this course, it is not too difficult if you stay on track.",1
Professor Kroll is great! His lectures are very easy to follow and as long as you take the notes and study you should pass. He usually has one homework and one a quiz a week which is great for grade boosters so just make sure you study for those. Also go to his office hours and he will help with anything you don't get!,1
"This guy is useless. I took his online class and he never helped you and was a real jerk. He felt as if he was invincible when speaking over e-mail. Oh well, what else do you expect when a coach teaches?",0
"She was a very passionate professor, you can tell she loves teaching race and ethnicity. You have to go into the class willing to let go of things you've known as true your whole life, especially about Native Americans.",1
"I didn't put hot because i dont really care about my professors looks, she's cool and fun ive taken her twice already for spch 121, and spch 120.She's also the debate club cooordinator and she rocks!",1
Professor K is great. He grades based on your skill level and he understand that everybody is not a great drawer but still tries to bring out each student's greatness. He's very entertaining and passionate about art. I really enjoyed his class.,1
"Mesozoic Era, but went far beyond, and too much detail. She inherited this huge course, so can't blame her. Summer course REQUIRED >= 50%, else fail. One of the lowest final class-grade averages of all my 35+ courses. Open book/notes quizzes fairly easy, but final closed is hard to study for because of the text: NO lecture notes, just text-book.",0
Bus 101 has a free online textbook. Somewhat strict grader.,1
"I don't know what these other raters were smoking, but this professor is terrible.  If you want an easy A take her class, but you wont learn anything substantial.  This class is all business buzzwords about ""synergy"" and ""social responsibility.""  Also, the project is ridiculous and she centers her class around the project, rather than the book.",0
"Can be very temperamental in class. Not clear in his instructions or essay prompts, which causes confusion. I would not take another one of his classes. ",0
"BE PREPARED TO READ A LOT! I understand this is college and there will be a lot of reading, but the amount of reading he assigns is crazy! He had us read about 6 articles 20+ each for an essay, and at the same time he wanted us to read 4 other articles 30+ pages each for our discussions. I've done more work in this class any class I've taken. ",0
"The material isn't too hard, it's just that professor Hallet isn't that helpful. If you ask for help she won't really help you. Also, there is homework every week. Don't bother asking for any extensions on HW or quizzes, she won't give it to you. Make sure you understand the material and you'll be fine for quizzes & HW. Cheat sheet for final.",0
"He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting.",0
"Awesome professor, 10/10 would recommend. 1st half of semester is mostly lecture, 2nd half is mostly group projects/studies. Grades based on several quizzes, a couple tests, and 3 papers. He makes the class really fun and enjoyable and is happy to talk with or help any students if they need it. One of the best professors at Palomar",1
"His English is not that good and he can't really explain well, he mostly reads from the slides and the lectures are sooooo boring!!",0
"This class was a great experience. Not too hard, but challenging. She gives many examples of what she wants and is generally passionate about what she teaches. I recommend Zuidervaart.",1
I had him for recitation...he's so boring!  He just rambles on and on..maybe he'll be better in anthropology since it's his topic..,0
"Arts and crafts for babies was the most difficult course I have taken at MacEwan university. I took Gerard's class becasue I heard he was inspirational and it would be a GPA boost, but instead I just found myself up at 2am gluing googly eyes into a scrapbook in order to explain my life story to my classmates in picture format the next day.",0
This guy is horrible teacher and never replies any question or an email at all.,0
"He makes you go home and watch videos instead of lecturing. You have to write a reflection on each of these videos, and each are around 10 minutes long (some days you have more then one video). You have to do this everyday on top of the homework online. It makes the class very difficult.",0
"Good teacher for an online class with the exception that she was often short in her emails and seemed to. It always read them correctly when she would reply with a completely irrelevant answer. However, she was very helpful and did repost quickly. Truly cares about students grades. Assigns alot of homework but it is easy and provides a lot of bonus",1
No interest In teaching and not available outside class . Always speaks about his child and his new car ! I won't recommend this instructor .,0
his class was ok. I like the fact that Dr. Thompson is fair. I took his class during Covid-19 so both the class and the lab was online. On a quiz we had to name the bones of the cranium and for a particular section it was very difficult to label without being shown in person. He understood this and graded the quiz accordingly with a curve.,1
"The professor had many students that found the material challenging and does not try to explain the material thoroughly. I attended his office hours and even that was useless. He told me because Im not doing so well, that I should try again next semester with a smile on his face. I would not recommend taking his class unless you already know the m",0
"She is a really nice person if you're nice to her... she loved me but still graded me hard so if you think being friends with her is going to help you you're wrong!!! You just have to actually do the work, kind of a pain sometimes",0
"This is by far the worst mathematics teacher I ever had. Although this teacher is super sweet and really cares for her students, her teaching style will leave you completely confused. I spent more time on her class trying to re-teach myself material she already discussed in class than focusing on my other classes. One tip: Beware.",0
"Very few examples are given in class. You need to read the textbook prior to the lecture to make the most out of the lecture. Dr. Wang is very informed and will answer any question you have,  so come prepared! Homeworks are assigned every week and it's not something you want to do the day before, unless you want to spend 8-10 hours working on it.",1
"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",0
"Professor is nice and understanding. Expect a pretty full (but bearable) work load, but she gives great feedback and makes the class fairly interesting.",1
"I have his class, I have used the notes he allowed us to use on the test. I used the formulas but I ended up bombing the test. I am retaking the class with someone else.",1
"Easy, puts all the notes online. Just show up for the tests because class is boring and he doesn't take attendance. Final is same questions as chapter tests.",1
This guy rocks.,1
"If you don't like to talk in front of a class, don't take him. He gives over 100 problems for homework and the only way to get credit for the homework is if you go to the ""homework days"" in which everyone, one by one, has to read the question and their answer. If you get it wrong and/or don't fully understand how to answer it correctly he gets mad.",0
Attended 3 weeks of lecture and then resorted to the homework website to learn everything. Reads out of the book and is very hard to follow. I took this class online and his hand writing was unreadable.,0
Gives you many opportunities to be successful and to pass the class. You must do the work and you will pass. He is always available to answer your questions and help when you need it. All you need to do are his assignments!,1
"Jill is an amazing teacher.  You can tell from the first day she loves teaching and being a nurse.  She's always willing to help if you need it, will tell you when you do or don't need something, and will explain stuff in ways that will just make sense.  I'd pay extra to have her teach every class",1
"For starters, I had no interest in this class and I still don't but he made it bearable. He uses powerpoint which tends to be interesting. The tests he gives you are all take home so thats a plus. He assigns about 3-4 major papers and grades them liberally. Not a hard class. Just do the work you're assigned and You'll be fine.",1
"Ms. Forth is a great prof to listen to. She engages her audience through the use of technology. Also she is a fair marker, having all exams (two mid terms and a final) in a multiple choice format. I would highly recommend this prof for this course",1
"She was ok. I felt that her direction was not very clear in the grading and course work. She did more english than history for the most part. I felt she got thrown into this class because they needed a professor. We watched a lot of fictional movies of World War 1, though nice , completely irrelevant.",0
"She promised practise questions for Imin, delayed them week after week and then never gave em. Inconsistent",0
"Dr. Xing was helpful and was honestly one of the reasons I succeeded. She seems to appreciate it when students take the time to visit her outside of class. While there was a language barrier, the material is organized if you approach it critically. She's smart but sometimes has difficulty being transparent with her explanations. I'd take again.",1
"Professor Kanchi's Cloud Computing class is awful. The lecture material doesn't cover the topics you need to know in order to succeed in the lab, she frequently doesn't respond to emails and has difficulty picking up on questions. Much of the material she provides for the lab is both erroneous and out of date. To do well, you need to find a student",0
"This professor is sweet and nice but very confusing when giving lectures. Exams are not what are on the objectives, very extra when giving quizzes and lecture outlines dont help out at all. Drops one exam out of 3 but does not drop final, lectures too fast & doesnt explain her logic well. If you need this class dont take Rodgers,",0
"Knows the subject and explains it very well. Grading ambiguous in the beginning of the semester I took this class. It felt as though you had to write EXACTLY what he was looking for--not an easy task due to the expansiveness of the tax code, but he lightened up as the semester went on. Very sarcastic, but you quickly learn it isn't personal.",1
"Whispers during lecture, have to read the entire book to study for a test because you can't understand a thing he says.",0
"Great professor, great guy! Dr. Cogan loves sharing his knowledge on cinema. He teaches Irish cinema, Eastern European, and Japanese cinema.",1
"He gives extra credit for attendance/in class assignments, and i mean like 100 points worth so go to class. Also, do yourself a favor and use MINITAB instead of R. It isn't free, but much more user-friendly. KNOW THE BOOK DEFINITION OF ""P-VALUE."" It will be on every test. I never missed lecture & still had to do lots of reading outside of class.",1
"A very good professor. Anyone who can't hack-it in her class is a joke. Easy class if do your part. Just show up on time, be respectful, and do your work. Compared to the demanding math and science faculty, though not her field, here at ccp, she is one of the easiest professors.",1
"Take him is you have to. He is a kind person, but very very very boring. It is very lecture heavy and he goes off on tangents that do not pertain to the subject you are learning about. He quizzes you every class and the quizzes do not correlate to the chapters that you read outside of class. He is nice though.",0
"Really confusing, disorganized, no leniency, makes interesting subject matter boring and almost incomprehensible. Self study, show up, easy A.",0
Dara is the best!  She is so helpful!  Her lessons are clear and precise.  Her tests are hard but fair.,1
I don't understand what he says half the time. He looks like he knows his stuff but he does not seem to be able to teach us the material. Disorganised. The lectures are difficult to follow.,0
"Paul Mueller is an excellent guidance counselor. He simply puts students into groups to complete a workbook, sits back and refuses to answer questions. Tests are a serious struggle, due to the lack of preparation in class along with the grading period wich seems to be a semester-long process.",0
"He was extremely hard, I have no idea what anyone here's talking about",0
Actually said maybe statistics just isnt your thing after i went to his office hours to question the amount of points he took off for small math errors.,0
"Dr. Everhart is amazing! He helping me lout a lot and was always willing to do his best to make sure we had the best experience. Tests are a breeze if you pay attention and study! If I was not graduating, I would take a class with him again.n",1
Fun class. Hard assignments. But he encourages you to get good grades. Recommend if you like research though.,0
"He wants to help students learn, but expects much too high a level of understanding for a 100 level class. The exams are VERY difficult (average student getting under 40%)and require a much deeper level of understanding than the homework. Harsh grader. I would avoid his class at all cost unless you can do vector calc in your sleep.",0
"Olsson had the potential to be a great teacher but unfortunately, she was not super accessible. She would not respond to emails nor the discussion board she put up for questions. Her grading is very arbitrary and often would not give feedback. I would have learned more if she cared more about her student's learning experience.",0
"She is very flexible . Do all your assignments on time ,but if you happen to be late on an assignment talk with her .Lots of group projects and slideshow presentations. Pick your group wisely.",1
"She missed a field trip and made the students do it again to make up the work. She talked about herself a lot, too. Generally speaking, I found that the best way to learn the subject was to ignore her. The class itself was easy (especially since she has 60-79% as a C, with A and B being normal), but not because of her teaching by any means.",0
"Not sure if it is the online format, but from what I hear from past students nothing has changed. Grading is terrible, this guy is arrogant and condescending. Please save your money and stress on another professor. Ignore old reviews, I am sorry but I do not think he should be teaching anymore.",0
"Attendance is not mandatory - as he podcasts everything. The class is graded on one midterm (30% of your grade) and one final (70% of your grade). Both are in class assignments, short essay form, where you answer questions based on hypothetical laws or legal arguments. They are open book and open note (no electronics though).",1
"I had Professor Whitney for Psych Lifespan and Social Psych. She is a great professor she really cares about her students. She can go off topic from the lecture for sure, she post her powerpoints so it really helps for test. Great teacher but if you can't handle her going off topic or pushing due dates for test and papers back at times, don't take",1
I loved Sondra's class. It was set up to be perfectly asynchronous. She would post modules with lots of videos and texts about the timeline we were observing (it was an overwhelming amount). But based on the modules you didn't have to spend 10 hours reading every single one - you could be picky! Discussions were interesting! Took for UCSD hum.,1
"Shara is a great designer and you can tell this by her passion for the craft, shes a wealth of knowledge of you know what questions to ask. Shes always open to talking and bouncing ideas off of",1
"I'm in Dr. Hauck's class right now and it's my favorite class. It's an 8 am three days a week, but it's not that bad at all. He's funny and very specific on what he wants, but he also makes himself a good resource to pass the class.",1
"The worst professor I have ever had. If you ask a genuine, logical, question he makes fun of you in front of everyone. At one point, my class didn't understand a difficult concept that he was (poorly) explaining, and he told us to ""give up on tutoring"" and to go to the hospital because if we were really ""that stupid"" we ""need medication"".",0
"Randal seems shy and has a monotone voice. Thus, if you're taking his 6:50 am class, you'll find it difficult to stay awake. You'll have a reading assignment and a quiz due each week, along with a project relating to the topic. The final is a combination of the quizzes (mean 123/150). Offers XC. All in all, loved this class, fun & creative.",1
"Kim's lectures are not mandatory. Most ASA classes, if not most classes at Davis, are synchronous and mandatory. I suggest emailing a professor before you take their class to see if their class is mandatory or not. Kim is very caring and understandable and will grant an extension if you need one, whether it's mental health-related or COVID related.",1
"By far the worst instructor I've had in my entire scholastic career. Read out of the book during ""lectures."" Attempted to cover the entire text by racing through it, never focusing on any rule of evidence. Failed to teach how to apply evidence to the real world. Last class threw NY exceptions at us in 45 min. Ridiculous exam. Avoid at all costs!",0
Being in Matthews class is like watching paint dry. Half the class dropped him after the first week. If you like condescending professors that treat students disrespectfully then this is your guy.,0
Attendance is mandatory. She used to be the director of ESL 1450. Its ironic for an English Second Language instructor to be a racist.,0
"Natalie is the best! I love her presence in the classroom and she is wicked smart and passionate about anthropology. Show up to class and take good notes, her tests are manageable and she lets you have a sheet of notes! I would for sure take her class again.",1
"When I first took this course the set up of his website was confusing. There will be times where you'll need to email him. He will reply, but he'll have an attitude in the email, so if you like rude professors take him. I felt like I learned nothing after this course. I'm usually an A student too.",0
I question how much he really knows about organic chemistry. He doesn't do a good job of explaining the material and if you ask him for help all he does is tell you to refer to the book or he PP usually neither are helpful. Buy the Chegg homework helper you get more help from that than Luttrell,0
"THE MOST HORRIBLE CLASS EVER TOOK. He's really boring and doesn't help you on the quizzes, and makes you do a  useless group projects. He reads off the power points. He doesn't use  Canvas to grade the work, but it is through SAM.  Answers from the quizzes are not from the book so wouldn't recommend to read the book look it up from a different sour",0
Dr. Miura did not give a single lecture during this COVID-19 pandemic and was extremely hard to reach during these hard times and during the normal semester. He is not specific nor clear in his grading criteria and when asked for feedback he takes very long to give answer back. Lectures are long and boring! Do not take his class!,0
"He used a graduate level text for an undergrad course.  Highlight of the course: ""This is a very important theorem that we will use a lot"" followed by, ""I am not sure it's true"" when after about 10 minutes he couldn't prove it.  I think he used that course as a vehicle to get paid to review group theory for himself.",0
"The best experience you can have learning a foreign language. If you're seriously interested in learning the language, his class will be the favorite part of your day. Highly recommend - no question!",1
WORST professor I had at BSU. Had to leave a 3hr lecture 10 minutes early for work and she called me out in front of class. Not accepting of non traditional students. Emailed her privately about a pregnancy that I wouldve liked to keep private but she talked loudly about it immediately after class in front of everyone & asked if it was planned.,0
"She is an amazing teacher. I looked forward to going to class each day. There are 3 question quizzes almost every day, so reading the textbook is important. She is quick to respond by email for questions and is very understanding if you have something going on. I really liked her and she truly cared about each of her students!",1
"Terrible, rushes through each section. It's like he's talking to himself when he's teaching, he does stop to ask questions. On top of it all he has a thick accent and can be difficult to understand.",0
Dr. Meade has the chance to teach a very interesting class on ethnicity in literature and yet even to someone who is passionate about literary analysis this class bores me to tears. He keeps discussion superficial and the chance to delve deeper into an author's intentions are overshadowed by discussions of formatting. Easy A if you read,1
"He sat on his computer the whole class and when you asked for help, and didnt understand the way he explained it, he just got annoyed. He told me that if I was too stupid to learn it in high school, he couldnt teach it to me now. It was a really upsetting experience.",0
Great stats class with an enthusiastic and supportive professor.,1
"Dr. Bailey is a tough professor. His lectures are very organized, but he goes back on his word a lot. He printed out notes for us, but he would skip slides during lecture. There are no extra credit and the test are pretty hard. I recommend doing the practice problem over and over again until you can do them in your sleep. I zoned out a lot in class",0
"Terrible prof. Can't understand her English. Had to do difficult calculations, but no one in the class had a clue how to do them. No textbook use, just her lectures. Like a lot of other people,I dropped. Don't take her, and especially not for this class.",0
The worst experience I had so far at Hunter!,0
"While Dr. Leflouria is a good professor, I felt as if her class was overtly opinionated. I thought I had signed up for American history, but the class I took should've been more appropriately titled American History (of slavery). The subject matter was interesting &you will know ALOT about slavery at the end of the semester. Not an easy A ",1
"Doesn't help you learn the material, she just teaches it one day and moves on to next lesson. YouTube and math lab was the closest thing to really understanding the material. Doesnt have extra credit and doesnt allow make ups on quizzes.",0
"Class was pretty easy; exam questions were right out of the book. Bi-weekly reading responses were very open ended and were basically completion grades. The only tough part was putting in the time to do mandatory research, which you're a test subject for a grad student's psych experiment. The experiments were fairly interesting though!",1
"Very laid back course. He is very interested in the material that he teaches. However, you're only graded by the 3 in class tests and a final exam (which thankfully is not cumulative). If you go to class and take good notes you should be fine.",1
"DO not take this professor she is rude and does not care about students doing well in her class. She is not helpful and gives you homework every week, TAKE another professor!!",0
This course is good. you will learn many thins about Object Oriented programming out of it. There will a project work and midterm and fnal.,1
I advise only the people who are ging to devote their lives to Bio to continue with it. I got an A in Evo and am now in danger of getting a D in this damn class. Very vague about what's going to be on test and expects you to know EVERY DETAIL. It's a shame 'cause they seem like good people too.,0
I took his class 171 for elementary teachers and im taking 172 next quarter. He is a nice guy and has a fun sense of humor. works at a quick pace but will answer questions and provide more examples. he collects homework but only grades 4 or 5 random problems out of it. short quiz on each chapter.,1
"The worst Professor on Earth, not only is he a tough grader hes also highly inconsiderate. If you have him just consider dropping out.",0
"Grading criteria was not clear. Gives extra credit, but she won't post it online. So, it is hard to tell if she's really applying them to your grade.  Not very helpful. When explaining something, it was confusing.",0
"Very enthusiastic about his lectures, making the course relatively easy to understand and fun.",1
Zein is probably the worst grader I have heard of. She shoots down questions in class and often rushes through classes in order to finish her lecture. Avoid getting her at all cost.,0
"Ouyang is nice, but a really difficult professor.  He reads straight off the slides, offers no real explanations, and the project work is insanely difficult.  If you take this course, pair yourself up with someone strong in accounting, especially if your new to the topic.",0
"She yelled at students when asked any questions, and always had mistakes in her quizzes and practice problems she went over in class. She was not clear in lecture, would rarely respond to email. She only let us see some quizzes and because she always made mistakes it left us wondering if our grades were correct. only take if ready to teach yourself",0
Overall a good teacher.  However I did have some difficulty understanding some of his instructions.,1
"Incredible professor. Really helpful for the exams, gives extra review before the test. Really funny. Good at explaining material.",1
"Great professor very easy if you show up to class , reviews are just like the test so study them!!! She's very nice and helps out a lot !!!easy A",1
STAY AWAY!,0
Best Professor ever! Would give all the help you need from him! His class can't be boring.,1
"This the worst teacher ever.  She talks like she makes a lot of sense but unless you are a research expert, you will never understand what she is saying. If you ask too many questions in order to clarify her teachings, she gets upset and is either rude or disregards what you say. In the end she did grade on a cruve but the stress doesn't compensate",0
One of the greatest teachers I've ever had. At first I thought she was going to be one of those type of teachers that make classes hard and boring for no reason but I was wrong. Dead wrong. She is incredible and has such personality. She makes the class engaging and always makes me think twice about stuff. She is smart.. Extremely smart.,1
"There were a few Mastering assigments, along with 3 tests. No final exam. Gave extra credit questions each class period that would be added to your test. Overall she's a great teacher and the class is ran in nice way!",1
He's chill and soooooo easy. 4 tests and 3 projects. He's always willing to meet and talk. Great professor for an intro course,1
"He's a good teacher. He will help you, although sometimes it seems like he doesn't really like you. Definitely don't go to class late. He hates that, and he makes sure you know. He really knows CAD, and is a great resource. I would recommend him.",1
"When taking this class, you would have to be prepared to teach the material to yourself. He does not use any power points. You must read the textbook chapters, which are extremely long. His test are impossible to pass, even though they are multiple choice. Additionally, you have to read two long novels outside of class. If you don't, then you fail",0
A very tough grader.,0
"Great dude, focused on helping freshman adapt to the engineering environment.",1
"Tests are pretty tough, but if you show up for class it should be easy. ",1
"Popcorn reading from textbook with the whole class like its 5th grade and her lectures arent so much discussion as her telling you what she thinks you should think. Also no work 90% of graded work assigned in the last 2 weeks of class. Its a joke class, she doesnt teach you anything a few hours of wiki and google wouldnt, save your money!!",0
"Everyone on Dr. De Vos' profile seems to think he's a terrible professor but he is actually quite caring, and his lecture/exams are NOT difficult. He gives you the exam items far in advance and he is very thorough in lecture. If you need help, ask. He is very approachable. If you take accountability for your own education, you will be just fine.",1
"1. His slide decks are awful - paragraphs c&p'd, reads directly from, few in-class examples, no excel use, no computer lab classroom 2. Projects were good, but all self-learning, easy grader 3. Final is egregious nonsense. Took full 3h for 30q, and I wasn't alone. Most material not covered, you need to self study book. Take CFA instead.",0
Best BU Psych 101 professor,1
"He is a great guy and seems to really care about his students, he really wants people to do well and succeed in this course. His notes are pretty easy to follow and he tries his best to explain questions to make them easier on us. If you study and pay attention in class it's not a hard course!",1
I have Holliway for Sociology although he teaches anthropology and psych. He is a super easy going great guy who brings great topics to the class and makes it interesting. I plan on taking his psychology class. participation will get you a long way with him. not much homework or tests.,1
She is not helpful at all. She is picky with who she helps. ,0
"Cool Prof...deserved the grade I received (not a bad one though but could've been better)Overall listen, take notes and express your concerns with him, he does listen and tries to help",1
You never put a first year teaching in such a serious class,0
She is never clear with what we are suppose to do and she could basically care less if you pass or fail. She is always saying follow directions yet her directions arent even clear. NEVER GET HER!,0
"He teaches with no structure , expecting you to remember what he says word for word. There is literally nothing to study off of. No textbook, no slides, just the words that come out of his mouth. The man is a genius, but incredibly lazy.",0
"prof gilbert is awesome at what he does. not only is the topic interesting to begin with, but he makes it come to life.. he really knows what he's talking about. more importantly, what he talks about really makes you think. and isn't that what higher education is all about? but be prepared to do some MAD writing for the exams!totally worth it tho!",1
"i just ended my semester in her class. Let me begin by telling you, biggest mistake i made in college so far. I knew i should have dropped with a W when i had the chance to. But i believed she would see my effort and perseverance but no, it didn't matter. First day is 40 people, ends with about 12 people. Final group project, everyone got a D or F!",0
"Dave Barrett does not know how to teach this class. Every year he teaches it, he changes the format because it never works well. The homework assignments can take anywhere from 6 to 15 hours yet they are weighted the same! His explanations don't make any sense, but at least he is nice and grades very easily. The worst class in the MBA program.",0
The single hardest and most rewarding thing I've done at KU. I apply dense feminist theory from this class to real life. We had a group project on human trafficking policies that we literally presented to her personal friend at the Department of State. Brilliant professor and person. My friend cried in her office hours and she was nice about it.,1
"He's very willing to help students, and go out of his way to do so. Everything you need to know is in his lecture and the WebWorK. The tests can be challenging, but let's be honest here: it's calculus. I'd definitely take his classes again.",1
"Great professor. Her lectures are easy to understand and clear, making her testing very fair. She works with the class if most got an answer wrong she will throw out the question.",1
"Dr. Searfoss is a nice lady, but this class is hard if you're not an English major! She assumes you already know a good deal of the material and some of her examples are hard to follow. There's a lot of homework and the tests are hard, but she always encourages us to go to office hours if we need more help. Thought I knew grammar before this class.",0
"Took Engineering Mathematical Analysis with Dr Gueye, and he was absolutely useless. Constantly did examples incorrectly in class, never answered student questions properly and provided incorrect solutions to the lab work. He also planned and marked exams so you would be rushed to complete, make small errors and get 0 for the whole question.",0
I couldn't imagine a more self-congratulatory professor. How could you screw up craft of fiction? Use it as your podium/back-slap/let me tell you about me and the writing process therapy session.,0
"Provided online lectures during the pandemic, but they were extremely long and forced you to remember a lot. Only get one attempt for homework. Gives you a study guide, but pulls the ""not everything will be on the test"" card. Unrealistic student expectations and difficulty, especially for a low 300 level class.",0
"NEVER answers her emails. which is very unprofessional to me, really hard to reach her. However, good professor easy class just unorganized.",1
"Do not take this class. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video and discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and it doesn't get easier. He's a nice guy, but a harsh grader. I am a strong writer and managed a borderline A in the class. This is a GPA killer unless you are dedicated!",0
"Jamie is unlike most professors at UVM, she is very cut-and-dry, to the point and will cut you off if the questioncomment does not have to do with the in-class discussion. She does this for a reason because there's so much material to cover in only 15 classes. I liked the way she lectured and she's very fair with grading. overall, A-",1
"By far the absolute BEST prof I have had! He easily ties things together to make the material quite understandable. He is extremely effective with his lectures, so do NOT miss them! He will always hint to you what is on the exams. Extremely easy to approach and you are always met with a smile. Best course hands down I have ever attended!",1
Extremely difficult exams. If you want to do well you must come to every class and be ready to write down every word he says because it could be on exam that makes up more than half of your grades. Difficult class for a non-bio major,0
"Professor Caldwell was a good guy, but man this class sucked. He did not give prompts for any essay assigned and offered little advice as to how to write them. It was impossible to know what exactly he was looking for. He was a very harsh grader and lectures dragged. Would not recommend.",0
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
"One group project that takes up the whole semester. Pretty easy as long as the group stays on task and keeps up. Discussion boards for each chapter and one research paper but have the whole semester to complete. Only one test, the final, but gives a study guide with answers and the final is very closely based off the study guide.",1
"As a freshman, I had to take Sociology from Mr. Darman and it was a pretty terrible experience. The class could not be more dead. This guy is the biggest liberal I've ever seen that loves to make up stories that interest almost nobody and talk about his personal life for 2 hours straight. The only learning comes from the text book. Terrible grader.",0
"professor Wallace is funny and friendly, I really enjoyed his nerdy jokes. he's great at breaking down complex concepts into easier things. he is always willing to help. go to the Friday Q&A sessions, take advantage of his office hours, he really does everything he can to help you out.",1
Racist towards asians. Ruining people's dream.,0
he is great but really hard. I learned a lot from him.,1
"First of all, Pannell seems like a great guy and will respond to you if you have any questions. The way he lectures is a little tough to follow. He will kind of bounce around and fly through powerpoints. He does give decent study practice tests for the tests. Overall not a bad guy, his teaching style just wasn't for me.",0
she is a good teacher but she is kind of crazy. It is hard to understand her because of accent. but she Is pretty good,0
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
"She's an extremely flexible and understanding professor in terms of accommodating the students. As long as you make sure to communicate with her, you are sure to pass the class with a good grade. On top of that she's very enthusiastic and jovial about her lectures which keeps it from getting boring.",1
Full of herself and embellishes her accomplishments. Very arrogant. Not a good teacher at all.,0
Jessica is why I'm a sociology major! Her class is the best and every day is interesting and I learn something new and relevant. If you get the chance to take one of her classes I highly recommend. She is passionate about her students and cares for everyone. Her grading is very straightforward and she tells you exactly what to expect.,1
"The worst professor I have ever had at SMU. He doesn't respond to emails, does not post grades online, and rarely gives back tests. His handwriting is at a 6th grade level and he ridicules students in front of the entire class to the point where multiple people have dropped because of it. 46 people have dropped from my class if that says anything.",0
Deborah is absolutely amazing! You get extra credit for coming to class. Not much work at all. She truly is the best math teacher Ive ever had.,1
Good professor and more than fair. Discussions are clear but you have to pay attention. What you get out of this class depends on what youre willing to put in,1
"Fortunately she's often busy talking about things off topic rather than assigning class work. This class is very simple. Dr. Pittman should learn how to take advantage of the use of the online assignment submissions to avoid so many printed paragraphs throughout the sememster for, it is 2019 and printing every assignment is no longer necessary.",0
"Awesome, awesome, awesomeeee!!! He loves math, it's his passion. He's funny, understanding, and knows what he's teaching and helps the students 110% HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!Not too bad to look at either",1
"About 45% of a math final made up of impossible T or F. Comes to class with no preparation. Most of the time students finish the problem for him. Never explains any terminology, yet expects us to know it for the exams. Likes to put on tricky problems. Won't take the time to answer questions. Kinda cocky in the British way. I def wouldn't recommend.",0
"The topic she's covering is cool and all, but her lectures are really boring. By the half of her course, I haven't found a single person around me who were able to keep up with her lectures. This is just a warning, make sure you know your shizzle the dizzle right before taking this course.",0
she is a nice lady but her directions are often unclear. Her tests are all online but have a short time limit and sometimes the material on the tests is not what was covered in class. There is one speech during the semester. You can manage to get an A in this class especially since she gives a lot of extra credit but i honestly didn't learn much,0
"Thick accent, he reads off the power points, gets frustrated when students ask for help, he tries to squeeze in chapters together regardless of the time he has, test are over 125 questions long EACH! Overly obsessed with attendance, if he makes a mistake with your grade he will not change it even on McGraw hill connect. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!",0
"Very friendly, intelligent teacher. Has you write 3 major papers and the other minor assignments are pretty easy. He explains things very well. I wouldn't say he's an easy teacher, but as long as you hand things in on time and do what's asked of you, you'll get a very good grade.",1
"Had him for helping relationships and Diversity.  Awesome teacher, but not an easy A.  He expects you to do the work, so that you can discuss it in class.  He does not require busy work.  All homework and tests are to further your knowledge.  One of the best teachers I've ever had, but expect to read a lot!",1
I was able to understand his lectures but his labs were pretty difficult for students that just learned about operating systems. His tests are extremely hard and based off only on lectures so take very good notes. Grades hard on labs. Overall just study your butt off and you'll pass the class.,1
"Fun and easy class, great teacher.",1
"Cupani is honestly one of the nicest people I have ever met, and she will never cease to surprise you. But, she reads the power points for her lectures and doesn't really teach the material. The only thing your grade comes from is tests. They are 15-20 questions with multiple parts, and if you miss one part, you get the whole thing wrong.",0
"At first I really enjoyed the class , but it went somewhat downhill. I learned a lot from the class, but felt that the teacher was judging what people said, even though it is supposed to be a share zone. She also grades papers very hard based on APA and wording, not so much content. I would rather not take again. I dreaded the last weeks of class. ",0
"I took this course as a post-bac student and I just don't recommend to take it over the summer, much less with him.  As others before me have said, yes he does have a DEEP accent.  Yes, his tests are hard.  Yes, he goes through his lectures WAY too fast (which is why you NEED the textbook).  He is not great at scanning the room for raised hands. ",0
She is super dedicated and easy to pass as long as you do the work and dont slack off.,1
"His lectures are typical to that of other professors. He is a tough grader. Have to work for an A in this class. I would recommend, with a extra effort it is possible. I took him for management cluster.",1
"Great Professor, she transformed an online class by including lectures. Interesting assignments, you have to work for it but you can get a great mark if you are engaged and do the work. I hope Professor Keefer drops the quiz which had confusing instructions. Otherwise this was a perfect course.",1
"Liz is not welcoming of perspectives that are different than her own, and makes this clear both during seminar discussions and in her comments on essays. Don't expect to do well with her grading your papers unless your ideas are the same as hers, any original thoughts or ideas on the students part are ""invalid"" and will get you a C- if you're lucky",0
"Her directions are unclear and almost rude. be ready to spend some serious cash on makeup. $80 for the makeup set then another $25 for the ""Lab fee "" when there is not a lab. Required book cost over $200 because it's out of print. Only uses that book cuz friend wrote it.  If you miss a day she will call you out in front of everyone. Horrible teach",0
"Fun class, she is an excellent teacher and really encourages students to particpate and learn about french culture. It is not overly difficult, but you must study outside of class to retain the material. She truly cares about student progress. Wouldn't be difficult without previous French, but any experience prior to the class is helpful.",1
"Unreasonable amount of work. Don't take online with this professor, the amount of useless work I had to do took up all of my time for studying for other courses. She makes you write, review, take, and grade your own short response tests. The course isn't even about ecology content because she makes you focus so much on test writing skills.",0
She acts like everyone in the class is a CPA. Unfortunately she does not take into consideration that everyone is not an accounting wiz. She is very tuff and very unreasonable. She teaches only through PowerPoint and make other people feel like they are stupid. Her final is so difficult that you cant even finish! NEVER TAKE!!,0
"Even though I received a C, it was not her fault.  She is very helpful and very kind.  Good teacher.",1
She is one of the best professors! She is very helpful and adorable. Do your outlines and speeches on time and you will get an easy  A. ,1
Such a sweet professor. She takes time out of her evenings the day before a test to give her students a practice test and go over it with them. I really recommend taking her. She calls on you but its okay as long as you pay attention. There are 4 tests and a final. If you put in effort you will do great. One of the best instructors.,1
She is a very enthusiastic interesting teacher. I loved her teaching style. Very unique compared to other teachers that I have had.,1
"Amazing professor. Her homework and class work is harder than the actual tests. She gave 4 tests and a chance for extra credit. The homework usually took me like an hour or so but definitely do it. I learned a lot from her. She doesn't ask trick questions, tests are straightforward. The final was the easiest test out of all the tests.",1
"She does not provide study guides. She is always late to class but requires her students to always come to class and be on time. She lectures to us as if we have a degree in Biology already. Every time you ask a question her response is 'Well, what does the book say?"". She is a nice lady but a HORRIBLE professor. Please do not take her seriously.",0
"I attended Prof. Ross' class in 1994 and I have never been as engaged, reflective and verbal in class. He is simply the best teacher I've had and our discussions continued on train 4 downtown after classes. Since then I've taught and become a professor myself, but I'm nothing like Prof. Ross in class. I wish to thank him and recommend him.",1
"shes nice but her teaching is bad, she's also hard grader, don't take her if you don't like math coz she doesn't know what she's teaching and IDK why GGC has someone like her",0
"Besides the fact that he is a little unorganized, he does let you turn in major writing assignments late. He does go off and talks about random things in class. MAKES you get involved. He tells you that you need the book when I have never actually opened it my entire semester. Tests are difficult as he marks answers wrong that you know are right.",0
"I could go on and on. First day of class she claims she doesn't have horns growing out of her head, but I quickly realized that was a lie. She is soo rude and expects so much out of you. The quizzes and exams aren't bad but the paper that is worth 30% of you grade is ridiculous. She expects you to be a damn architecture. Strongly DO NOT recommend.",0
"My days are good until I walk into this class. Unnecessarily rude in emails, expects a lot out of students for it being a 101 class. Readings every night, pop quizzes usually the next class. A bit sarcastic, which I didn't appreciate. He knows the material, lectures are decent, but if I could go back in time I would take an easier core.",1
She was always giving us homework at 12 at night and expected us to complete it by the morning 8 30 class. Dont take her class at NJIT. Not worth the time.,0
"One of my favorite professors by far here! He is so energetic, young and caring. He relates to everyone in the classroom and brings humanity into learning. He gives minimal work, and what he does give is so easy to finish. Not a tough grader but makes you think, which I loved. Take him if you get the chance you will not regret it!",1
"The reason I transferred.  Ruined my first year of law school, and I got absolutely nothing out of it.  Learned a lot about fetal death cases in Rhode Island, and that's about it.  Useless comments, contradictory advice.  I feel bad for Japan, she is going to set their legal system back 100 years.",0
10 AutoCAD drawings are due at the end of the semester. He'll walk you through the first 2-3 with pretty clear instructions and then you're on your own. He ended up changing the 10th drawing one week before finals. There were some quizzes and a final that were conceptual questions. I made 70-80 on all of them but an A in the class.,0
"So disorganized. Everything she knows about culture is just spilled all over the board and in lectures, and her powerpoints are so messy too. She gives you too many homework assignments that she probably doesn't even look at. This semester, she also wanted us to go to 2 events outside of class for credit, which were pointless.",0
"she cant even answer questions off her own study guides, that she creates without googling it, and you still can't guarantee the answer that she gives you will be correct one. 90% of all her lab test will be on powerpoint slides, and 90% of the pictures she uses on her test will be terrible quality, and you're never quite sure what your looking at.",0
"Nicest professor ever! You learn a lot of useful relevant information in his Social Media class. He isn't a tough grader, if you put in effort you will get an A for sure. He really cares about students. He is willing to go out his way to help students understand the material. Responds fast. So nice and caring and too pure for this earth. TAKE HIM!",1
hard but great at explaining,1
My absolute favourite prof at McMaster! Her lectures are great and she speaks about concepts so clearly that helps everyone understand. Love love love this prof.,1
"Coop is a great guy. He knows what he's talking about and wants you to succeed. However, he is not clear with where he is going in the lecture sometimes and he also does not do a lot of examples. If you do all of the homework it will help with your understanding, but just be prepared for having to teach yourself some things.",1
"Awful lectures, waste lots of time waiting for students to answer his questions, such as ""good mornings"" and ""have I lost anyone"". Every class, the same speech. Sometimes he is rude. He assigns people to group for major projects. He is not open to feedback. Playing music during the classes doesn't make a teacher ""awesome"".",0
"participation matters, and you MUST show up to EVERY class. if you dont you better have a GOOD reason. he cares about his students and will help you if you need it. brings out the best writer possible in you. only downfall is that he lectures a lot in a monotone voice. this can be tough if you havent had coffee.",1
For a gen. ed course this was probably the hardest class I've taken at BU so far! She expects wayyyy too much out of her students when over half aren't majoring in ENVS! She doesn't give study guides you are just suppose to look over the notes and her exams are ALL SHORT ANSWER! I was happy when the class was over,0
"Overall a great, passionate teacher. Good sense of humour. A LOT of reading (like 1 book +short stories per week). Grades fairly, and is the first teacher who actually caught me on some grammar mistakes that I overlooked! Grammar is usually my strong point so I'm impressed! Knows his stuff",1
This teacher is unprofessional and rude when you ask for help. Makes fun of students and talks down to his students. Should NOT be a teacher.,0
awesome prof. my inspiration. ,1
"Absolutely aweful. the comments I've read so far are SPOT ON. I was kicked out of his class this semester because I'd finally had enough of him being so disrespectful to not only me, but my classmates. Always bringing up the subject of abortions and how ""if you don't want the baby, you can give it up for adoption.""teaching strategies were confusing",0
"I understand that there are professors that give pop quizzes, but this specific professor takes off points for the little things & that really affects your quiz grades and also test grades. You would need to study really hard for this class or you will not pass. Many people have failed her class last semester. Be ready to study hard if you want it.",0
I wish I could take him every semester :),1
"Colleen is an absolute angel!! I wish she taught all of my classes, she really is the best. She's very hilarious, caring, and she'll like you if you participate. She makes the lecture very interesting and engages the class to come up with ideas on each topic. I would come to class as she doesn't upload grades/slides and she's heavy on the quizzes.",1
"Had to drop this class after a few weeks. She gives tons of homework for little credit. Homework is worth 5 points only and thats only if she collects it. She does some mistakes on exams like marking an answer wrong when its correct so you have to look out for that. Whole grade is based on tests and final, does not count homework or attendance.",0
I'm getting A's in all my other courses but did terrible is his. Class is 2 midterms and a final and he's a terrible and unfair marker. He'll only accept the answer he is looking for and will even give 0 on questions out of 10 if you don't write specifically what he wants (even if what you say on the topic is factually correct and from the notes).,0
Only have 4 in class essays to do and 10 optional experience points. Attendance is mandatory you can not miss one day or your marked down. Also a very hard grader! the average grades are C+ on papers and thats even when you write a thesis with 3 examples and a conclusion with a so what.,0
You dont learn anything about epidemiology and he makes you write 11 page papers weekly.,0
"Han Park is a very hard teacher, this class is also just hard in general. After class I recommend making notecards or quizlet for that lecture or you will be screwed when the test comes around trying to prepare. Her class is very boring, its just reading off of slides but she makes comparisons to try and help.",1
"Hardest professor I've ever had. I would not recommend taking him. He lectures straight off power points but flies through them like you already know the information. I didn't learn much from this class at all. Quizzes are hard. Tests are hard too, but are communulative throughout the semester. ALOT of studying outside of class. DO NOT TAKE!",0
"I took Political social thought with Prof G. Be ready to read and analyze things like The Federalist papers, which is very boring. Also make sure to understand the concepts talked about, his exams are questions asking about these concepts and usually require about a page for each question. Overall good prof. He is also very kind on the eyes",1
"His class is definitely not an easy A but  he will help you however he can if you ask for it. Study hard for the first test, it's the hardest. The other two aren't bad though. there's also a lot of extra points on tests. Get in a study group ASAP and GO TO CLASS.",1
Avoid! She's a nice lady but the class is the hardest thing I've ever taken. She expects you to learn everything before you come to class. She spends both lab and lecture reading off of a power point. There are very few times where anything is hands on. She is VERY unorganized and bad at communicating so it's EXTREMELY easy to miss an assignment.,0
Teaches straight from the book. Doesn't write anything on the board. Not easy to take notes to refer to later. He was OK as an instructor. Glad I don't have to take anymore of his classes.,0
"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",0
David is an amazing teacher as well a cool person.  His lessons are all from experience and he tells real life stories.  His test are a little hard but he gives you everything you need to know for them.  I highly recommend taking a class from him especially if you are thinking about owning your own business someday.,1
"Dr. Palmer is clearly passionate about his field, but sometimes he struggles to convey it to the students clearly. While the material taught in Sensations and Perception was very intriguing at times, this class requires you to do all of the readings and come prepared for frequent pop quizzes. Pop quizzes, midterm, and final are your entire grade.",1
"Steve is a great guy for culture heritage, I had him for 1 & 2, he truly cares about his students and wants you to succeed. He has high expectations for you, but he just wants the best for you. There is a decent amount of reading, but usually it is interesting. A lot of group stuff, usually discussions. No final exam, test or quizzes. Just papers.",1
"He makes you read novels that have nothing to do with sociology. Class was basically created so he could tell you about his life. Hated every minute of this class. I could write an bio about this man and probably get 99% of it right. Avoid taking Maril if you can. If can't avoid, expect a B or lower. He thinks an A+ or A is perfect so wont give out",0
"Took MTH200 over the summer. She talks really fast when she's giving the lessons, but if you're confused, she slows down and explains for you. Very lenient grader for tests and goes over every homework problem. Courseload is very little, just study for tests, and you pass. Her accent is a little hard to understand at times, but you get used to it.",1
"Johnny is easily one of my favorite professors on campus! He makes the lectures interesting by tying the material to real world examples. Not a lot of homework other than just a few problems out of the textbook, which can be found online. EXAMS ARE HEAVY. Not necessarily hard, but very time consuming. He usually adds a decent curve.",1
"Terrible professor. Only professor that offers the management specific courses, and they're all online. I wanted to take in person. I know what you're thinking, online is easier right? Absolutely not. He makes them so hard in that he grades everything so tough. TONS OF WORK. Then he gives exams that are so hard and cover 4 chapters at once.",0
"You have to teach yourself and do homework before class THEN he'll go over the homework and kind of lectureteach.  The class bore me to tears and honestly can't say that I learned and retained anything that was ""taught"" in class.  I need to retake the class and saw that he was teaching again... Yeah. I'm heading to another campus.  ",0
Mr. Sweeney is an outstanding teacher! His lectures are super interesting and he tells hilarious stories regarding his own experiences as a psychologist!!! There is a ton of reading and he has powerpoints that are super detailed do you will pass with an A!!! Wish he taught more psych classes because I would take him again a second!!!,1
DEAN DOESN'T KNOW HIS RED PINE FROM HIS SCOTCH PINE!,0
"Night classes can be very difficult to stay focus but not in her class. The lectures are entertaining and informative. You must read the book to answer the chapter quizzes. Group work will be assign so make sure you get a good group. Also, the extra credits are awesome. I would definitely take her again!",1
You definitely need your lab book. Make sure your always on time for class!!!,1
"He is way too into the subject which makes the class more difficult. He wants everyone to enjoy the class as much as he does, which is very difficult considering many people take this class as a pre-requisite as an easier math class. He does not use the book except for maybe one or two assignments. Tests are not like study guide. Would not recomm.",0
Clover Leary is an amazing professor. She's very supportive and organized.,1
"she is very bad, class is very boring. Too many works have to do, at least 2 journal every week.class writing everyday. DON'T TAKE HER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
AMAZING,1
"I took this class (Law, Politics, & Justice) in Russell's first semester teaching it, so it wasn't very organized yet--but  it was super fun and low-stress. She picks hot topics to discuss each week (ex. gun control, death penalty) and you read and then discuss & write a short reflection paper. Most fun political theory class available.",1
"Vraiment un cours chiant, le mieux c'est de lire le manuel (lui la structure de son argumentation est complètement désordonnée). Pour sa défense, il connaît sa matière et ça l'intéresse... mais il arrive pas à intéresser",0
"Worse 101 to take @ NYIT. Do not take this professor, she gives at least 4 pages of notes per class. Makes you write essays from a book with garbage. Her mid term and final are stupid, you won't learn anything here. You be better off in a English class than her trash class. Oh yeah btw she has a project which is stupid along with final so GL.",0
Thornton is overrated as a professor and other professors like Pattis are way better. His projects take way too much time and when I went to his office hours he kept being rude to people who asked him questions. Such temperamental people should not be teaching.,0
"She is a wonderful professor. Policy is a lot of material to cover and she goes at the pace of the students so that everyone understands the material. She is really helpful and understanding that we have other classes also. Three tests that are heavily graded, lots of studying needs. A few papers, but overall easy class. Just read chapters.",1
"Such an amazing professor, textbook not needed, 1 discussion board 1 quiz and a short answer assignment and gives you 2 weeks to complete, very easy A. and the final is over  the quizzes so print out the answers to use. Take him you will not regret it.",1
Cool guy but he rushes through the lectures and expects you to know what you're doing.  Gives a lot of extra credit and assigns little homework. The test are basically the study guides he provides you. Does not prepare you for final. Don't take him if math isn't your strong suit. *heavy accent*,0
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
Boring but easy. Class usually ended early. Majority of the class was him demonstrating how to do things that later helped with the website (main project). Lectures were a short part of the class but was the whole content of the final & quizzes which made it hard to get an A on them. Could have gotten an A in the class if it wasn't for the final.,1
"Two things wrong.  1) Her lectures are confusing. They are not well connected and the slides are not made available to students. 2) She is very rude. She asks questions of students in class and then cuts off their answers. She occasionally commands students to stand up and move about the classroom, as if to show she is in charge.",0
"If you're going to take chem 101, take it with kieswetter. One of the hardest classes at this school, but she explains everything very well. Very caring and accessible. Pay attention during her lectures and do the homework and you'll be fine.",1
"The lectures are booooooring, all she does is read straight from some powerpoints that come with the book. The class is easy and so are the test just learn the vocabulary. She is a nice teacher but needs to make her lecture MORE interesting.",1
"I HIGLY RECOMMEND DON'T TAKE ANY CLASSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR YOU MISS A SMALL DETAIL YOU WILL RECIEVE A BAD GRADE, TEACHES NOTHING about THE REAL WORLD, BORING RESEARCH PAPERS, FOR THE course evaluation she said she doesn't care about our feedback. obnoxious individual, with no empathy for her students. Rough grader, grammer is her only friend!!!",0
"Taking a class (505 or 524) with Rachael is one of the most beneficial things you can do if you're going into this field. Not only do her classes get you great real world experience, but she will help you outside of class whether it's applying to jobs, internships, grad schools, networking or literally anything else you need help with!",1
"By far the funniest teacher I've had at DigiPen, and the best at keeping classes relevant on the topic as well as interesting. Some people dislike that he's a comedic teacher, but I believe it helped me as a student pay attention to the subject matter more. I only had him for a third of the semester, but I'd definitely take him again.",1
He has a nice personality one-on-one but he doesnt really converse with the class as a whole about anything other than history. He doesnt exactly create a comfortable atmosphere where people look forward to talking and answering questions.,0
Death by Power point!!!All he does is read the power point for 2 hrs. This is an intro- class! this man thinks we are 4 year med. students.,0
"She was expected you to know everything in class. When you visit her office hour, she just shows you the rubric she gave, and let you read about that. I would not recommend her unless you want to write discussions (600 words) + survey per weeks + weekly quiz, and 12 pgs (2800 words) for midterm and 24 pgs (4500 words) for the final+final exam.",1
Ryburn was by far my favorite professor my freshman year. She makes the content easy and understandable and will slow down for you if you don't understand the material. She should be a role model for professors.,1
"If you ask anything other than an amazing question, he will publicly fry you in front of everyone. There might be 1 or 2 homework assignments in the semester. He assigns a 5 question essay quiz every Friday to be completed online by Monday. You will have 3 online exams and one final exam in class. Hes not horrible, though. I got a good grade ",0
Professor Wellborn is a fantastic teacher. I wanted to go to class and looked forward to the way he was going to present the material. I recommend him for all types of students just because of how vast his knowledge is of history and his passion for the subject. Extremely approachable and wants to see his students succeed.,1
"He isnt as bad as people make him out to be but at the same time his in class teaching isnt helpful. Your grades in 3 tests, a final, and homework. I passed by working in the homework until I got a 100 and I took time to learn the material outside of class. I was 1 of 2 people who passed my class",0
"He is a really good professor. He teaches the basic skills needed based on the section and all those skills are easily used on the exams/quizzes. If you have any questions, ask. Overall he is a really good professor that made the class interesting. Ask questions or get help if needed. Pay attention, and do your homework to easily pass.",1
"Lectures are very long, get ready to take some notes. Midterm was pretty easy and the quizzes are not hard either. Final was multiple choice study words and definitions.",1
"The content he has to teach is very difficult, and he doesn't make it any easier by assigning tons of mandatory homework every week. He does not engage class, in fact he hates when he has to stop the class to answer questions. Very difficult to approach outside of class. Exams are very difficult, know what you're doing and study hard, don't slack.",0
Cool professor. Helpful.,1
"Great class, all material was relevant.  I use everything he taught.",1
very fun class. makes learning biology fun.  wants to get out of class just as soon as you do.  tells u exactly what is going to be on the tests and all the tests are essay ( u have to write the answers out ) as long as u study you should do great,1
Never responds to emails. You can miss one or two classes in the beginning. But do not miss in the end that's when the big assignments are. The final and the midterm are fun. you get to design them yourselves. If you miss too much class she is not very helpful and does not care whether or not you pass.,0
"Prof. Rodgers is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic when it comes to biology. The subject matter is tough, but she's very detailed and always willing to answer questions during class. She's a lovely person who cares about her students, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from her.",1
Not such a great experience. Dont recommend,0
By far one of the funniest and most engaging professors I've come across - you will not regret taking a class with Matt Rand.,1
Diane is extremely nice but I would not recommend her if you're looking for a professor who will help you out. Tests are basically all she relies on for grades and she doesn't give any extra credit out. She talks about her kids a lot so she gets side tracked and then starts rushing through sections.,0
"ce prof la est malade je vous le conseille vraiment, tres exigeant avec ses eleves mais c'est pour votre bien passe sa vie à aider les etudiants par courriel si vous avez besoin! il est marier haha:P",1
"this is a tough class, you really have to be dedicated in your work to pass. Getting an A isnt impossible since i surprisingly got one. LOTS of hw. She talks fast in lec but go bc participation points could add into ur final grade as EC. 4 lab and lec tests. final isnt cumulative. study guides dont really help. good luck!",1
"Terrible, Does not want to help you.  He talks down to you if you don't understand what he is teaching.  He goes around in circles and forgets what hes talking about.  Save yourself from this class.  I should have.",0
"I am an A-B student, but this class was the hardest class I've taken at UCF so far. I was not prepared for the content of this class. I would recommend this class if you have previously taken physics, ad I had not and it made it very difficult for me to pass. Every student did poorly on each test, and the curve is the only reason I passed with a D.",0
"Nimrod Segev made me love macroeconomics, a feat that I thought impossible. He is an incredible teacher and is truly dedicated to teaching. During finals he stayed in his office for 12 hours straight to help anyone who needed it, whether they took his class or not. I want to have him as a teacher again, and I hope you do as well.",1
Excellent teacher and advisor. Extremely helpful and willing to go the extra mile for students. If I could take this class again I would! Attendance is mandatory but class is worth attending!,1
As long as you show up on time and/or early to class you shouldn't have a problem. She thoroughly explains things and really shows you what to do as well as giving great and lengthy feedback after speeches. Do your assignments and show up on time and you'll do just fine.,1
He's horrible. Tough grader. Not clear. Not helpful. Don't take his class or you will fail.,0
"Professor Liao was very helpful this semester, especially with the craziness of COVID going on. He was very clear, thorough, and would go back if needed. He will answer any questions you have, and would definitely recommend taking him.",1
Very good professor who cares about his students.  Makes this sometimes complex subject understandable.  Recommended professor.,1
"ALL THE TESTS are based on the models available in the lab, but he doesn't use the models to teach, ASK HIM to explain the models & take pictures to practice on your own. Tests are fair & straightforward. Read & do the homework, use review sheets to study. He doesn't use blackboard or power points, lectures are boring, not helpful in my opinion.",0
Thankfully tests are open book. All of class is spent reading power points. We work in groups in a lot for participation grades. She does count points off if you are absent.,0
"BEST PSYCH PROF AT PACE- knows his stuff, fair grader. wants you to get an A. goes out of his way to make sure you understand the material.",1
"He is really smart, but does not know how to get across the information. He expects memorization over over 180 pgs of text for the first test-- and this is 100 level!!  I am a good student, and probably will not pass this class.  Wish he had a teaching mentor to help him decrease content and make it LEVEL-appropriate.  It really is too bad.",0
"The best teacher at Algonquin that I have ever had. Most understanding teacher of all time and truly wants you to learn and on top of that makes the assignments fun. He knows what he is talking about, and doesn't go overboard to make your life painful with difficult assignments or tests. They are just the right level so that you may learn.",1
"I never want to take a drawing class at Bard again after this. The assignments were reminiscent of high school, and sometimes too vague and sometimes too restricting, but never in the middle.",0
"I tried giving Professor Saudino a chance throughout the semester even after many people were telling me how awful she was. Believe me, Developmental Psychology is an amazing class with so many interesting concepts, but Professor Saudino is rude to her students, makes the class difficult for no reason, and has ridiculous policies.",0
"I wouldn't take her again if she was the last professor on campus. If you ask her a question, don't expect her to answer it. She is extremely unclear, unhelpful and quite confusing. Felt lost and in over my head all semester. To top it off, she can be pretty unnecessarily rude. Take someone else.",0
"Ok, I have NEVER done a professor review. But Guetter is that bad. He is the worst professor I've had in my entire schooling. Get ready for LOTS of mathematica & nothing that expresses your Calculus knowledge. Get ready to be laughed at, belittled, & mocked for trying. I did well in the class, but I can't believe hes still employed. -stars for him.",0
You wont learn anything and score low on the exams because of it. Hes so rude and not responsive via email fast. The whole transition to online was horrible and he didn't really care of any personal issue due to the pandemic. Do your self a favor and take another professor. No curve btw.,0
"Professor Freed is a really nice person, but her grading is unbelievably hard. Assignments were unclear and difficult. I liked her as a person but I wouldn't recommend her class! Expected more on the papers than what she mentions on the assignment paper itself and in class.",1
"Mixed feelings. She has days where she's really helpful and then days where you're better off on your own. She's very nice, but tends to speak too quickly for comprehension. Work is easy and straightforward, moderate amount. As long as you finish two assignmnents and a quiz/ week, you're in good shape. Be prepared for major disorganization, though.",0
"Loves to teach 5 minutes before the bell and 5 minutes after. I admire the fact that he wants to show nearly every proof in the book, but it takes away time from actually showing a little application. Tests are hard, but curved. Very ambiguous about the grade you are getting until the very end. Occasionally assigns an absurd amount of homework.",1
Class is too hard. Exam questions are undoable unless you have access to the questions ahead of time. The labs/assignments are irrelevant to what you actually need. Avoid if you can.,0
"He class was interesting and I had a lot of fun. He is definitely one of the best instructors I had. His class was always well organized, which I really like. He cared about student's performance in class and always gave feedbacks to our assignments. Be sure to read the material in advance, it will be easier to participate in class discussions.",1
Super interesting lecturer,1
"Wonderful professor. Extremely helpful and clear when talking. He makes a lot of great jokes, which makes class fun. Would take another course taught by him in a second.",1
"One of the best teachers I've had regardless of level. He makes class a joy to go to. Flexible on when the midterms are and he really encourages class discussions. He's also funny as hell, not a class goes by that's not entertaining. Very quotable too.",1
Dr. Viola is the BEST teacher for a core science class. There is no reason for any grade below a B. Along with all the jokes he makes a 3hr lab (which never is 2hrs) very entertaining. His ability to help students as well as make them laugh results in a good learning enviroment whit little stress and anxiety.,1
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! She took forever to put the syllabus online. We were in week three and she still didn't have it up until the day of our second lecture. She expects you to read the book to find out all of the information you need. If you ask her a question she is going to tell you to look in her book. She expects you to self teach.,0
"She doesn't mind helping students during her office hours, however she made a lot of mistakes when teaching in class which then will confuse you a lot.  If you want to do well, attend her office hours, she might give you a hint what will be on the mid term, which happened to my friend. Overall, not a great prof. Come on U of T!!!",0
"I would for sure recommend Hartman and his his136 class. he's funny and fair. I enjoyed listening to him lecture and his take on social issues are very interesting. he is a very obvious democrat, and he makes you buy his book which is also completely left sided. besides that, he's pretty cool and a great history professor. 4 sure show up to class!",1
"Devoted to helping her students succeed. She would stay after lecture and help students identify and look at fungal structures during lab. Anne is always willing to stop in lecture and answer questions as long as needed, never worrying about falling behind on the material. It is clear that she wants her students to truly understand the information.",1
"Not good in teaching. Book won't help much, you will have study from the lecture. If you get average or above average in the exams you will be fine. This guy doesn't care about students. but he curves at the end.",0
Clas is easy if you keep up with weekly work. Lots of flexibility.,1
I really enjoyed SPAN 225 with Luna. She had us to presentations a lot (great way to practice speaking) and always let us pick our topic. She also connected the class to the real world.,1
"She has been changing assignments dates and adding assignments. She will say things like ""I don't want to overwhelm you..."" then proceeds to go overboard with what it due. She is incredibly rude and if you don't do it her way then it's not any other way. She also asks students to share private health information for a grade, which is terrible.",0
This is the worst professor I ever had.  Does not answer questions.,0
"Prof. Powell is an extreme grader and does little to help you if you have issues or questions so be ready to do everything one your own. Even if you do everything right and follow all the instructions and answer every question you will get points off. For what,you will never know. You couldnt pay me to take one of his classes again. Not even nice.",0
"Do Not Take!! Professor is VERY work heavy. I had more work for her class than for both my major courses taken in the same semester combined!! She is not very friendly towards make up work or absences and is very critical with the grading system. Unless you plan on only taking her course alone, you'll need maximum effort to pass.",0
"I had an amazing experience taking Conservation Biology with Prof Cardelus. She is a passionate, thoughtful professor who goes great lengths to give students the best possible education. Reading the textbook isn't necessary but there are many assigned scientific articles and you should definitely read them. Grade wise I did better than expected!",1
I had professor Mathis for poetry and I had a solid B the whole semester(because only grade were the daily worksheets ) until our first test 12 weeks into the semester she grades unrealistic on the paper I got an F because I didnt meet the page requirement. When I went back to redo it I was literally 2 sentences away getting an A in rare,0
"This teacher has got to be the worst math teacher I've ever had. All of the lectures are on powerpoints- learning math through powerpoints is not ideal and makes things unnecessarily complicated. When she writes on the board, she writes so small that you can't see what she's doing. Save your GPA and choose a different professor.",0
"Easy A if you do the work. We had to do 3 practice interviews, a personal interview project and interviews at the radio station. It was really cool to record at coyote radio and do audio editing",1
i loveeeee him,1
"Professor Rodgers is amazing!! She is always willing to help out and wants you to succeed. Organization and time management is key in this class. Her learning guide, learning objectives and homework help a ton. Literally the nicest, sweetest, most approachable professor you will ever have! You will not regret taking her.",1
"Tricky as a clinical instructor.  Assignment instructions unclear, and clarification is lacking even if you ask questions.  Requires in-depth detail when it comes to all 3 long group projects, plus a group paper. ",0
"This is the best professor I have ever had. He is tough, but is one of the most interesting people you will ever meet. Make sure you pay serious attention to detail, I cannot emphasize that enough. Don't be discouraged by bad grades at the beginning of the semester. Keep pushing and you will become a better student for it. I highly highly recommend",1
"no in class instruction, but will help.wants students to work in groups to ""help/teach"" each other.  dropped him right after first class meeting",0
"Professor Nelson is absolutely AMAZING. She lectures exactly what will be on your assessments and provides a clear study guide for each. There are multiple extra credit opportunities, and if you follow the rubric on assignments, there is no reason to not receive an A.",1
"Professor Varnell is pretty difficult. She is not going to baby you, she is not going to give you extra credit. You earn your grade you. Study several hours every week. Read that again. STUDY SEVERAL HOURS EVERY WEEK.",1
Very awesome prof. Makes going to class totally enjoyable,1
Comes off as a cool professor but expects us to just understand the material from the get go. He doesn't clarify when we have questions and gets mad when we don't understand. The course itself was very difficult to understand.,0
he is good at communicating the message.  He does a good job presenting the information.  The only challanging portion would be when he expects you to apply concepts to live senerios otherwise the class is fairly easy.,1
You can tell she loves history but she was not good at teaching it. I have always liked history but not her class. She is very vague on the lecture outlines she gives and what she tells you is on the test. I wish there was a textbook that was required for the class to make things easier. Most of your grade is on participation.,0
Jason has become one of my favorite professors ever. I switched into his class last minute and I'm so glad I did. Stats was my favorite class this semester because he taught it so well and made it interesting! He was very accommodating and understanding when it came to the COVID situation. He truly cares about statistics and his students.,1
"He gives study guides, but the tests also have a lot that isn't on the study guide. Sometimes it feels like he doesn't teach you what you need to know. Lectures can be either really entertaining or super boring.",1
Worst teacher I have ever had. He does not help much when asking for feedback. The test a very difficult because of the abundance of information needed to learn in a short period of time. Very wishy washy with extra credit and quizzes in between other Chemistry class.,0
"I wouldn't recommend signing up for this challenging course unless you're willing to put hardworking efforts to stay up longer hours every week typing on the computer and reading plenty of information from your textbook, therefore watch out for attendance and tardiness policies on syllabus contract otherwise stated then turn in homework ON TIME.",0
Excellent professor. Really understands you and actually wants you to do well. ,1
"By far the funniest professor I have ever had. His class is enjoyable, but make sure you pay attention. He will notice, and he will not like you if you don't. The midterm was a little difficult, it's not what you would expect, but if you go in for help, you can do  really well in the class.",1
"Great teacher; I really enjoyed my time in the class. Although I only received a B in the course, that had more to do with me than her. ",1
"I had him for USI, I am taking him again for USII.
 He is a nice guy, very knowledgeable. Two tests, goves a very good review before them so it's easy to study. Current events are good, I wish he did them more. If you study hard and do the small amount of homework you will get a good grade. Only problem was his lectures are boring.",1
"I took Prof. Carlton for Stats and was really worried but he made the subject tolerable. He wants you to succeed, so he encourages feedback and is always open to question. You'll need the textbook. Homework, online quizzes, team quizzes, a midterm and a final. Extremely lecture heavy so GO TO CLASS! You'll regret it if you don't. Great professor!",1
"Don't expect to know your grade ever. He is usually all over the the place and always cancels class. He grunts a lot too. But if you are struggling, he will help you, but only if you ask him for it. He gives a lot of extra credit though.",0
DO NOT TAKE HER! She makes you buy an app and has in class quizzes EVERY DAY and she starts class on the dot and ends on the dot. She will not let you leave and takes attendance before and after class. She words the tests / quizzes in a really uneccesary difficult manner. She is also really rude and her lectures are super boring.  Tests are hard!!,0
"Love Dr. K. She is very knowledgeable and has lots of experiences. She is very helpful and always available. She knows when you're BSing, so some effort has to be applied in class, but she's willing to answer questions and offer guidelines for expectations. Wish I had her again!",1
Don't waste your time if you actually want to learn.Very unclear and does not grade assignments for a long time and no feedback whatsoever.A shame he's the only social work teacher there because people are forced to take him.,0
"This is my 3rd class with Dr. C, so I'm a little biased. Her teaching style speaks to my method of learning, though, so it's a good arrangement. Lots of extra credit. Gives all that you need to know on Powerpoints, but be sure to bring your book to class! Sad that she isn't teaching 142 next quarter.",1
Easy - just do the work and take time to read feedback. Quizzes are open book/note. Essays can be challenging but hell answer any questions along the way. Answers fast.,1
I had Bohu for Graphics II and was a bit nervous to take him. But he is a passionate individual. I learned so much and gained a lot of knowledge.  He teaches you the basics but leaves to to learn the rest and small problems you come across.  After that experience I'm definitely choosing him for my Design III. Just take him.,1
"Took his hybrid class tests are difficult and attendance is not required since they are online. However, tests are important and are based on the overall grade of class. A research paper 6 pages and online discussions is also the assignments in class. ",0
I loved Doug Bous as a professor. He always challenged me to do so much more than what I though I could do and pushed me to be a better 3D Visual Artist.,1
"The guy is funny ill give you that,but he already expects you to be almost perfect in GRAMMER.He calls his class ""grammar land"" fun right? His teaching method is horrible..The final was on a regret we have, I should have wrote about the regret i have for not dropping his class. Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)",0
"Stagg was a really straightforward guy. I think he was intimidating, but he gave really good lectures. I chose tough grader because he is very specific about how you complete your essays. Other than that, I learned a lot and I learned helpful/important strategies I still use to this day at SFA.",1
"Despite what everyone else is saying about prof. Dewan, you can do well in his class if u make an effort. Make sure to read every chapter bc he is not good at explaining concepts. Also, memorize the samples questions even if he says not to bc they are word for word on the test. I am not saying he is a good teacher at all but u can do fine if u try.",0
He was one of my favorite professors at SFA. He made class that enjoyable and really wanted to teach all his students. I was devastated to hear of his passing a few months ago. It's hard for me to think of a teacher I would have recommend more to anybody going to SFA. Having him this spring during covid helped keep me sane. Thank you Dr. Collier.,1
For humanities she never ever lectured. The whole class was reading and then taking notes to present in a group discussion. We also watched documentaries that she herself had never even seen. When grading she was kind of unfair about it. I had an A in the class the whole time then with the last essay on the final she screwed me over with a B.,0
"I'm in Dr. Thomas med surgepharm class. It seems like she would rather teach her students how to fail, then about nursing. I feel like her whole teaching method is based on telling you how much she knows, and how little you know. If you want to know what it feels like to put all you have into a class, and barely pass take one of her courses!",0
LOVE THIS TEACHER!  He the BEST!,1
"He is overall a pretty good professor, but the class would be a bit challenging for new coming freshmen with a little experience in Python. I did learn a lot from this class. No tests during online class, only programming assignments (not very hard), five projects (take time), and a final project(It is basically a large programming assignment)",1
"I've gone to several office hours to ask more specific questions, and I found him to be rude and condescending. He will help you, but be prepared to feel like an idiot for asking. The first test was similar to the homework problems, but the final was unnecessarily difficult. Find another teacher, if you can. He was awful.",0
She is Awful! She told our class that we could not ask questions during class because she had to many slides to go through. She mows through 150 slides on average a day. Rediclous,0
Worst experience in NJIT! Avoiidddddddddd! A lot to read! Boring lectures! Do not take her at all!,0
"Her test are HARD!  I made 100 on ALL of her assignments, which are a breeze, but the test are crazy hard!  And if you take the online class be prepared to have to come in for EVERY test...kinda misses the point of online classes!",0
"Dr. Zbeida is a very good professor. She is caring and generous in her grading scale. There is alot of reading and writing essays, but then again, this is an English Comp class. It's to be expected. I would definitely recommend this professor. She is funny,lighthearted and accessible outside of class. Very approachable.",1
"Zamora is a great professor. He's passionate about the topics presented in class and wants every student to succeed. There is a lot of reading that you'll learn a ton from. Don't expect this class to be an easy A, but if you do the readings, assignments, engage in class, and be there you'll be sure to get the grade you put in.",1
She doesn't clearly explain the assignment and grades extremely harshly. My friend took the same course with another teacher and I have been helping her quite a bit. She has managed to ace the course. I have put in a lot of work into my assignments and her topics are extremely boring and there isn't much room for brainstorming.,0
Wasted class time on random presentations and then would tell us to read 7 chapters for the exam. When I took the exam that material was not on it.I felt I was wasting my time in her agonizing 3 hour class. Weekly assignments and annoying group project. I still don't know where I stand in the class and I graduate in 2 weeks. Please do not take her.,0
"Brooke is AWESOME!  Explains math techniques thoroughly, in the best ways! Very passionate professor, cares about ALL students, really takes the time to make sure everyone in class is understanding the material (thats key!!) Always offering to help outside of class/give you the 1 on 1 needed. Couldn't ask for anything more in a math professor!",1
"Her lectures were okay, but not very logical and were extremely repetitive. I would definitely have had trouble making an outline of her main points throughout the semester. The material was interesting, though Sometimes her obsession wight he entire lecture hall being completely focused on her was obnoxious and came off as arrogant.",0
Great professor and amazing lecture! You can really learn something from his class! Extra credits are very helpful which will boost your final grade a lot.,1
The best proffesor at UW I would say I was scared of coding but he made me like coding very apporachabke resubmission saved me the quizzes you could retake them as many times as you want before the deadline cant give me enough rating since 5 is too small. So sad for him to leave UW and take his career else where rare proffesor you would ever come,1
"Going back to school after 7yrs, I can say that Ms. Slate was probably one of the best English teachers I've ever had. She goes over the basics that you've probably learned back in HS which I find really helpful. She helps you with your writinggrammaretc. Very enjoyable class. I am a better writer today because of her. THANK YOU MS. SLATE!",1
MUST do all of. the homework to pass. She use Hawkes for homework and test. The test is online but you have to take it at the school. Homework will save your grade and always do it on time plus the discussion board. If you do the practice test you should do good on the actually test because its similar. She will go over questions if you ask.,1
"You definitely NEED the textbook- each week you write 350 word summary about a section in the book. There's 4 open-book timed tests that you take through Blackboard. There's also about small 3 projects throughout the course. Overall, Robbins is a great professor with clear instructions and is a very very lenient grader. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"Professor Gibbons was very hard to reach beyond class; she seemed to always have an excuse. Readings were a bit dense and lengthy, but were always discussed in class. On paper assignments she was a tough grader. When I finally meet with her to discuss the papers, she tore them apart and offered no constructive criticism. Would not recommend.",0
Terrible Teacher. This is a computer programming class yet we did zero programming. The class involves doing journal entries on the chapter and occasionally we have to do assignments. This doesnt seem bad but the problem is he expects you to know code for the exams which by the way are impossible. The highest grade on our midterm was a 73. ,0
"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",0
Very unclear with explanations. Teaching methods are way too fast. Does not take his time to slow down and explain material. ,0
Professor Piel has been great for all four years of my college experience. She assigns very interesting books for the course and the discussions and powerpoints are always fulfilling.,1
"Super confusing teacher. Very intelligent, but her directions are scattered and messy. Lots of reading, but no tests or quizzes. Really nice, but wouldn't reccomend her class or take it again.",0
Very nice and peaceful lady. Gives wonderful examples and makes straight forward exams! Would def take her again.,1
"Not bad, not great. Lectures are just cut-and-paste PP presentation's of the readings. Class is an easy A if you go to class, take notes, and write a good paper. If you need an easy GenEd, take Olsson. If you're looking for more in-depth study of the subject, look elsewhere.",1
If you're paying out of pocket then don't take his class. I promise you it will be a waste of your hard earned money. Doesn't explain properly and horrible with his communication skills. PERIODT!,0
He doesnt answer questions when things are unclear. Gives unrealistic time frames for homework when you also have 14 other credit hours to take. He also points out when students get failing grades on homework,0
"He makes some materials easy, and he shows them in step. Sometimes I felt like he assumed that we already knew how to do certain things. If we didn't understand anything, he would say ask, but sometimes I was scared to ask because he would say, it's easy, you guys should get it. Practice the material that he teaches on your own, and you'll get it.",1
"He's an old man but loves teaching. I took accounting 1 and 2 and highly recommend him. He knows what he's teaching and has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. His examples are very thorough and helpful. No quizzes, just midterm and final which is open book and open note. Just pay attention, ask questions and copy down the examples.",1
"he was a terrible teacher. honestly worst i've ever had. leaves you to teach yourself the course. he would overload you with homework and never even went over it and was always in a bad mood. he told my class, ""guys i could be doing something better than be wasting my time here"" but isn't it your JOB to be here??? definitely do not recommend him!!",0
This class requires you to read everything that is assigned for class discussions and for midterm and final. You also have 2 papers,1
Very difficult class. Lectures do not help you on tests or homework but attendance is taken. Be ready to teach yourself.,0
"Tough grader, doesn't follow her own rubric. Disorganized use of Canvas. Assignment HEAVY, get ready to feel overwhelmed. Do not allow this class to discourage you from becoming an educator. Teaching is not like she presents it, she is not encouraging. Go into the class with the expectation that you will have to fight for your grade, power through!",0
Tough grader but only because she expects you to learn the material. Great lecture and teaching style with lots of good labs. Tests were hard but contained material we had practiced and reviewed.,1
"He's easy just take him, nice guy too...",1
"Dr. Buchoff is by far the worst professor I have ever taken at UCF. She grades very harshly but does not give clear expectations in class. Every time I asked her a question she had an attitude and just told me to go read the textbook. She requires few assignments but they are each weighted heavily. Her lectures are pointless, I learned nothing.",0
She is a very lazy and boring professor. Her power points are packed with information and it is nearly impossible to remember everything for exams. She does allow unlimited notecards on the 2nd and third test. Despite being difficult she took our input into consideration and tried to make the class more fair after the 2nd exam which avgd in the 50s,0
"Magic and the Supernatural was arguably most interesting class I have ever taken. Prof. Spaeth knows her material and presents it in a fun and engaging way. This class was a lot of work, but when you're studying witches, ghosts, and demons, it doesn't feel that way. Two exams, weekly blackboard posts, a presentation, and a 12pg final paper.",1
If you are looking for a challenge and want to become a math pro make sure this is the only class you are taking because he will throw every trick problem on the test in fact he will determine if you pass his class or not on the first test. Do not go to office hours as he is on his phone and not very helpful with feed back. Expect no mercy.,0
"I feel like marketing could have been an interesting topic for me if I only had a different professor. He relies mainly on a marketing simulation group project to teach you the concepts, but I learned next to nothing from it. Not a great teacher, and I he is often quite rude as well.",0
"Assigns online homework on this program mymathlab. It is horrible. I did really well on the my math lab assignments, however once he decided to give us assignments that were 4 sections of the textbook and 90 some problems a piece. absolutely ridiculous! also gives you weekly quizzes with like 8 mins to do them. Completely outrageous!",0
"Gives a lot of assignments that can be subjectively graded. Made the final non-multiple choice with certain questions that were very ambiguous. Seems like a nice guy, but the class was quite disorganized and poorly formatted.",0
"Nice and semi entertaining. BUT, she is very difficult and gives hard quizzes and exams. She always says she will never do an easy quiz. If all you're taking few hours, you'll be fine. But I would not recommend taking her class unless you can put time into it. If I could do it over, I would have picked someone else. If you take her, study a lot.",0
Bruh.,0
"Good guy, bad professor. He asks very passive aggressive questions and makes students feel bad when they dont have the same political views as him. He cancels class a lot, and his lectures are very long, boring, and repetitive. Easy grade for busy work and can find answers because he doesnt teach what is on the tests.",0
If you care about your GPA and your mental health do not take his class. he is very rude and random with his attendance by asking a random question to a random person out of the blue. Only grade is midterm and final. Speaks in a low monotone voice and just rambles for three hours  & doesn't cover the material he expects you to know to test over.,0
"I'm not a history person and this class was easy, tests are only on vocabulary words that she gives you- lectures help but not a lot. Attendance only on Fridays.",1
Prof. Vitz is amazing. He cares about the students and respects all opinions. I learned a lot and more important he made me think about many important aspects of environmental issues. We need more professors like him!,1
"one of the worst classes I've taken. For an online class, it is all busy work. They're a multiple videos to watch that take up 1-2 hours a week. The quizzes are so specific to the videos and the questions on the quizzes/exams are all very challenging.",0
"Took his phil1301 class and we were behind all semester. 4 reflection papers, 1 page each, super easy and based off of readings. Lectures have nothing to do with readings/papers, but he takes attendance. It's not for a ""grade"" but uses it to determine bump grades. Super scatterbrained & drags on topics. Maybe his higher level classes are better tho",0
"Professor Rogers was one of my favorite professors! He takes the time to make sure students understand, and after class takes a little time to go over assignments due. He was understanding, helpful, and is an effective teacher. There is a big research paper due at the end of the semester but you turn in sections throughout the semester.",1
I really enjoyed this professor. His lectures were lengthy and can get boring if youre not super into soil science but he is hilarious and keeps things interesting. His tests are not easy and a lot of questions are from lecture. Attendance was not mandatory but not sure how you could pass without attending most classes.,1
"You learn more in your sleep than you do in this class. This man doesn't know what is on his homework, and can barely do it. Expect to correct him at least three times a class on how to do middle school algebra. Spends most the lecture telling you how the equation originated and not how to do the homework.",0
"I have never spoke to her in person, but the lessons and comments she makes seem extremely passive aggressive.",0
Me. Nelson was really nice and he was very respected by students. He understands you're situation if you're late and his class lectures are interesting. It was a pretty easy class and I would definitely take his class again,1
She is AWESOME!!! She will take her time to make sure you understand. She is student focus and she make you appricate the class.,1
He is a very nice professor and tries to be fair to everyone! He is one of the most responsible professors I've met and the topics we learn are fun!,1
very tough grader. She knows the material but doesn't know how to teach it to the students at all. Not very helpful when it comes to exams. Her exams are impossible to pass with a a decent grade.,0
Do not take her speech class! She is a really hard grader! You have to dress up for the final and it has to be 13-15mins long or you will fail.  Avoid her at all costs! I passed with a C.,0
"He is seriously the most unfair grader I've had in college.  His exams test reading comprehension and whether or not you know WHAT he's asking, not whether or not you know the answers and have covered the materials. His TAs are unhelpful as well and if you ever have Kassuhun, your grade is seriously doomed, no matter how much of the work you do.",0
"She's not clear in grading. Seems to take points off for no logical reason, even if you have fulfilled the rubric requirements completely. Takes points off during assignments that are based on opinion... Very critical - but doesn't really give any useful feedback. No way to please her. Avoid her if you want to enjoy the subject and not resent it.",0
"Dr Hart is so smart at cellular biology, but she is the worst at teaching to students. She is very scatter-brained, talks very fast. The labs for this class took a lot of outside class time, including going in on weekends.",1
She is such a sweet person. Her class was pretty easy and she offers extra credit. She explains everything and stays after class for students who need help.,1
Look at it this way - everybody in GSB needs to take accounting. Its a tough class. John Shon is by far my favorite and the best professor I've had at Fordham. He made it fun and much easier. You obviously still need to put in the work because the final is departmental but he provides the best notes and practice quizzes. Very smart and cool guy.,1
"Professor Foster was great to have and I wish she taught French 102! There will be homework everyday, but it's definitely worth it. She had fun exercises and games that helped with learning the material through out the book, which you will definitely need! Attendance is also extremely necessary to be successful in this class!",1
Scott is a great prof. His class is enjoyable! Although he is a very tough marker! Be ware you must put in work in order to do well ! Seek clarification when needed and ask questions in order to improve,1
"She was a fantastic professor who always ensures a good laugh and lots of smiles during class. Very friendly and helpful, and teaches mostly off her powerpoints.  Overall pretty easy course if you show up and pay attention.",1
Worst professor in the world!!!! Do not take her or you will fail!,0
"She is not clear with her instructions at all. She looks at you like you are stupid when you are answering a question.  She does not listen to your answer even if you shout it, like i have multiple times.",0
"super approachable, I like his teaching style cause he keeps the class listening and doesn't bore you. Very flexible with syllabus, and knows what he is talking about.",1
"He might come off like a jerk at first, but honestly as long as you treat him with respect he will treat you with respect. He is very specific with his syllabus and he has a midterm and final based ONLY on his lectures, and they are worth 50% of your grade. The other 50% is based on Learnsmart activities online- super easy but a bit time consuming.",1
"DURING COVID Prof Wu was very clear from the start with his syllabus. We only had 2 test (mid term and final) and a project that you work on the whole semester and turn it in at the end. Does have a heavy accent, but he tells you exactly what to do for your projects and powerpoints had all the answers for the quizzes so study those. Great class!",1
"Seems like a nice guy, but good lord, he can't explain things to save his life, and when TA's would try and explain concepts to students that he hadn't conveyed well, he would actually get them in trouble because he was the course chair. Terribly run class, do not recommend him to anybody.",0
"Tara is a nice person, don't get me wrong but her requirements are way too demanding. Each minute late to class is 10 points off the homework turned in that day and she doesn't post the lectures online if you happen to miss class. Class feels like a college level course taught by a high school teacher; I don't recommend.",0
Taking this course online was rough. Prof Ferguson seems like a lovely woman but definitely struggled to teach this course online. She gave vague directions and nothing she said during her lectures ever made much sense. Would not recommend this course (online at least maybe she is better in person).,0
"There is so much reading required for this class, but it ends up not counting for much.  You write two essays that are not necessarily related to what we learn in class, and you take two tests.  The tests are too simple after all the analysis you do in class and discussion.  The professor is very unclear and hard to understand.  Frustrating class.",0
"Don't ask questions unless you like looking stupid in public and being mocked.  His examples in class are all explained in the text making attendance pointless, but he grades on it.   The online homework bites, and his hints don't help.",0
Lectures are interesting but can be boring. He's very knowledgeable but for a class of mainly first years his style and vocabulary while teaching is a bit tough to follow and take notes. His voice is super soft and may put you to sleep but if you pay attention you'll actually learn critical analysis strategies which is awesome.,1
"Tests come from the HW and class examples.  The homework is sort of difficult, but he is always willing to help.  GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!!! He really cares about you making a good grade, and will see that you do so as long as you come to class and give your best effort!",1
"Class with Professor Perkins was a disappointment. He is knowledgeable about the subject, but he is so blinded by his own political views and biases that he cannot cover it in an appropriate way. Easily triggerable. I wasn't upset with my grade - just with Perkins's hypocritical views that found a way of targeting particular students.",0
"Dr. Feagin grades incredibly hard for no reason. Like it's history class? Relax. She doesn't give a rubic for her ""activities"" or assignments, but takes pts off for my bibliography not being in abc order???? If I would have known, I would have put my sources in abc order. Nevertheless, do not take her class if you're looking for a easy hist class",0
Your best bet is to use Khan Academy or some other online resources and just use those over relying on the book or lecture too heavily. He says the book isnt student friendly then proceeds to read directly from the text. He took an hour to do 4 examples and a quarter of the class left after the following 5 minute break.,0
Thinks he's smarter than he really is.  Not impressed at all.,0
Prof. Jackson is the best! She was very encouraging and helpful. Whenever I had a question for clarification on an assignment she would never make me feel stupid for asking (unlike some professors at GCC). Definitely recommend!,1
"Cohen is new teacher from California. I still got a B, but I scraped by- my lowest grade that term. Every other teacher for this class will present tests that are extracted from in-class quizzes. Cohen on the other hand would rather torture you (even if you study) with difficult tests. Just take another teacher; they will make this core class easy.",0
Tries really hard to be funny but she's just trying to make you interested. Tricks you on quizzes and tests so be careful. But a good teacher who knows what she's talking about,1
Helps you out Chemistry is a very tough subject and he understands that,1
"When I read what the other student wrote and was in the program and in the class, I understand that the student did not belong in that program and it was probably one that failed out. This is the most amazing teacher ever and her passion for her profession is evident.",1
"One of the worst teachers i've had to deal with during my educational road. Seems unprepared during class, does not know how to lecture either. Constantly goes back on her examples saying forget this forget what i said this and you never get through anything. I suggest studying the material to understand it, because exams aren't math heavy at all.",0
"Dr. Keralis has a very laid back personality, & seems easy going. His weekly quizzes however are a joke, never stating the quiz questions could have more than one answer until a student pointed it out in class (halfway thru the semester), which he shrugged off. If you don't read & beat the material into your skull, you won't pass. DO NO TAKE!",0
Terry is not the player that should be holding this position.  There are far better teachers in Boston who play better and are better teachers.  Choose someone else if you really want to be a trumpet player.,0
I just finished calc 2 in the first half of summer so i thought i would relax a bit and take intro to russia online for the second half. I'm spending double the hours per week on this class. It's insane. she is crazy if she thinks this is an appropriate amount of work for a intro class like this. I'm doing like 8 hours/day minimum. DO NOT TAKE HER!,0
Falola's class is really boring. His accent makes him difficult to understand and most of the lectures seem to be the same thing said in different ways. His TAs do all the grading and are really annoying. Attendance is mandatory but everyone just scrolls through FB during class. Really hard to be motivated to do the readings. Would not recommend.,0
"Dr. Maida is awesome! No question of if she loves her students or not. This is my second class with Dr. Maida and I still love her. She puts a lot of thought and effort into her lessons. She prepares us for tests, but most importantly she dives into material so that we really understand what we're learning. 10/10 recommend, she really cares.",1
Took Issues in Contemporary Art w/ her. Syllabus and blackboard assignments do not match up. She will not correct these even when told. Lecture based class. Make sure not to miss any or you may fall behind because she tends to add on to the already Very difficult grader and will call you out in front of everyone. Would not recommend her classes,0
"Physics is hard in general. Although it was hard to understand in class, you can't expect to learn everything from him. If you were to take him, be mentally prepared, view his powerpoints. If you really try you can pass with an A",0
"I literally learned nothing in this class. He only talks about himself and is very narcissistic! I got A's on every quiz,essay, and the final and yet he gave me a B! He makes up his own grade for you. If you're major involves social work or sociology do not take him because you will not be prepared for other classes. Easy but does not grade fairly and you learn nothing!",0
"Mr. DeFoe is the greatest English professor I have ever had! If you can, take him! He is a really understanding guy who works with you and not against you. ",1
"I haven't seen a single ""funny"" thing about Prof. Gaidos. He basically calls his students idiots, Ie. Announcement he made saying most of the students posts are ""completely outlandish"". You ask him a question, and he responds in a disrespectful manner. I will pass this class because I will do the work, but I don't recommend taking him!",0
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
"Patterson was an amazing professor, he responded to my emails very promptly, and the coursework was very clear. I will definitely be taking him again! LOOK NO FURTHER!!",1
Life changing.,1
"I took this professor a year ago in a full semester length class, and I learned absolutely nothing. He is a great guy, but cannot teach. Especially if you are not like everyone else in your class and know Spanish already. He tries to help out with grades at the end, but by then I did not even want to try. This is a great class if you are fluent tho",0
"Professor Jackson or ""MJ"" is a perfect teacher for history. During the online summer course you will need to do reading, reading questions, lectures, discussion questions, & 4 exams. The readings & lectures will be on the exam. Exams are very specific so follow instructions & take advantage of the study guides. He is very accessible through email.",1
"Everyone loves Deb. She's an amazing professor. Put in the work, do the readings, and participate, and you will do very well. I learned a ton and my French definitely improved. She is a fair grader and is really out there to help you. You would be a fool not to take a class with her. Makes a fifty minute class seem like thirty.",1
"Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself. You won't understand a lot what he is saying. I don't know how MCTC hired him.",0
"Professor Zamora is a good professor, he is very dedicated to the studies of this and he is well aware of what is going on around the world. The class is really interesting for those that want to know the past of Indigenous people, when it comes to homework that is a must and also attending because he does give out quizzes based on the reading.",1
He believes this is the most important course. Throws things in that are way above the norm for this course- I say this since the exams reflected VERY specific information while lectures were broad or covered something specific that was not on the exam  SO SPECIFIC! You can avoid by taking Kai at Extended learning (more $ units  through EL) READ!,0
"Teaches the things you need to know. Works for the student to be successful. Always available through email, if not in person. A lot of homework, but I recommend him for anyone willing to put in an effort.",1
We did labs every week. The final was worth 42% of the grade and that was the only test. She let us use a cheat sheet,1
Super cerebral. ,1
"boring course,too many things need to remember. don't waste your time.my GPA is 3.5 and got a c in his course.worse grade i ever got. don't expect he will curve Hundreds of slides notes. if you want to suicide, take his ee333.",0
The best!!!,1
Dr.Z is not responsive to any emails outside of class. I would not take him ever again. His tests are not hard if you attend lecture. He needs to do a better job at replying to emails,0
"This is a good class to take if you have others you want to focus on during a semester. She just gives you the answers the class before the test and you write an open book paper every other day. However, if you desire to learn anything your better off with someone else.",1
Professor Thomas-Reid is one of my favorite professors yet at App State. He does not give tests and we only had to write easy 250 word reflections throughout the semester. He is accessible outside of class and really cares for your education. He is always looking for ways to improve himself which shows what type of educator he strives to be.,1
If he likes you you'll do ok. No clue how things really work in business but he spent all his time in the navy.,0
Prof Gartland is a sweet lady & a very kind professor. I took her fall of 2016. She lectures the entire time every class. She also gets off topic sometimes but pay attention these are her extra credit questions!! Attendance is not mandatory. She also provides you with study guides for each exam that are basically the exam lol.,1
"This was my first online class and it was very easy. Although, you did have to write a lot. Every week you would type 600 words and 10 sentences to your peers. You also had open book quizzes every Monday. The professor always leaves comments and grades fast. This class was a easy A.",1
Dr hauck was very clear in lecture and encouraged interactions outside of class in group sessions (even on Sunday afternoons). An A is very very possibly with Dr Hauck if you review notes outside of class before quizzes and exams.,1
"Teacher was difficult to work with, test are timed and designed not to be completed in given period.  Capstone project can be easily gamed, just google it (in the end no point and it is the bases of the class).  Text is out dated and very boring.  If you can avoid this teacher do so (and you can).",0
"Ridiculously unreasonable rules that do not apply to favorite students a/k/a female students who share her propensity to chain smoke in the ally or parking lot. 5 minutes late to class?  That's an absence and counted against your participation points - unless you are a favorite.  Forget freedom of speech/expression.  Makes her ""grumpy"".",0
MR. ZAMORA is always crystal clear in all his requirements. He is one of the best professors we have at the college. He is very helpful and inspirational when he tells us stories. I really learned a great deal about communication from him. Now I want to minor in communication. He is an excellent teacher! Take him if you truly want to learn.,1
"This class had an extremely large amount of work to do for an elective. It is very difficult to do well as it has to be perfect and exactly what he wants to hear to do well. There are 4 weekly assignments ( which you have to buy a $100 textbook for) and also a weekly live video session. On top of this there are 3 major assignments, midterm+final.",0
"Teaches from pictures from book. Not very helpful, hard grader,must read the book to pass.",0
"Worst class I have ever taken. Terrible communicator. Asked point blank if something would be covered on an exam, was told no and was covered on the exam. Hard to understand. Will teach information incorrectly and will not be corrected or questioned. Avoid at all costs.",0
Really enjoyed this class and Ms. V as a professor. Really makes you think outside the box and allows your opinion to be heard and considered.,1
"He teaches an online Leadership and Vocation class. Miss a single comma in a paper and you lose 8% of your grade yet his posts are poorly written, grammatically incorrect and often have spelling errors. He also likes to play devil's advocate with posts which is ok, if they make sense but usually they are outlandish or foolish suggestions.",0
"She really truly care about everyone in her class. Some of the projects are hard to really get into because its just basic foundation. If you turn your projects in on time you will get a C no matter what. She is very nice, but sometimes hard to understand. You can only miss up to 3 days in this class. Very helpful teacher in the long run.",1
Blurry slides cost me a lot of points on Lab exams. Horrible teacher. ,0
"Good prof for Religion.  Took online, quiz and writing assignment due each week.  Midterm and Final are both essays, which combined make up most of your grade.  Reasonable grader, and pretty clear on his expectations.  I would recommend taking this class with him.",1
"Though I have a bit of an interest in Dr. Jacobson's class, I honestly just took it for the credit. Regardless, her lass was the most enjoyable I've had so far at YC. I definitely would recommend taking any of her classes just for the chance to be there.",1
One of those unfortunate instructors that doesn't care whether you pass or not.  She is very critical and strict/excepts no excuses.  Depending on her mood at times she was funny but she clearly has an issue with equality and brought it up over and over and over!!! I got an A but had to cross my fingers til the very end!,0
I'm taking Dr Mukherjee for Calc 2 and he is one the worst professors I could ever have. Only 1 week left in this class. He doesn't offer to help students and never goes over homework or tests so you wont know what the answers are for exams. Blames students for not knowing certain material and he wont teach students. I'll never take him again��,0
"The easiest math course I've ever taken! Go to class, and I highly suggest doing the practice problems. Those questions are similar to the exams. He doesn't give quizzes nor graded hw, no extra credit, your grade is strictly on how well you do on the exams. Best stats prof, highly suggest taking it with him.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had; doesn't know how to teach; you will learn nothing from him. Just stands in front of the class and mumbles incrompehensibly. The class is so useless; less than 20 usually show up out of 140. He is also very mean and not willing to help students either. If you have to take this class, please find a different professor.",0
prof experimenté et maitrise bien la matiére,1
"Professor Shapiro is too easy on his students.  Our assignments can be pushed back for weeks, he cancels class often, gets off topic very easily.  Seems to genuinely care about his students but just not a good professor.",0
Took this class online and i suggest it. Class was very easy and well organized. Homework was very easy only one or two assignments a week. The paper is not a big deal you can pick the topic and he is very relaxed on grading. First test is the hardest not knowing what his test were like. Found an app called quizzlet that had almost every question.,1
"I wasn't specifically into the Criminal Justice area. However, her lectures were very interesting. Even with a silent class, she gave her best potentials and characteristics to allow the class to follow up with her knowledge shared in her lectures of Criminal Justice. She's a brilliant professor and opened up to all students.",1
SHE DESERVES A RAISE!! super understanding she cares about her students and is very passionate. I'm not even in her class anymore but we still keep in touch and she offered so much help. Need an extension?? ASK HER!!!!,1
"She is a very nice lady, but I would NEVER take her again! Totally disorganized and barely teaches! I was excited to take this class & learn some new skills, but instead I wasted a whole bunch of money & time on nothing. She would come in, take attendance, tell you to look at the posted assignments & then leave her student assistant to do it all.",0
"Only use one of two textbooks, attendance is mandatory but participation is not; editing days for essays are also mandatory for credit so have the work done; days that are only for working on the essay before it is due are sometimes not mandatory and can be skipped. If the class is going good sometimes food is brought in.",1
He goes to fast and it's hard to follow. He seems more like an honors math teacher than remedial. Only take him if you are good at math.  He gets really intense when he is working on problems on the board. Nice guy ,0
"This professor did not make Canvas announcements or update the syllabus when important date changes were made (including test dates and assignment due dates!!!). He also decided to cancel class without making an announcement. Talking to him is difficult, asking questions doesn't work, his exam review doesn't truly prepare you. Teach yourself.",0
Prof Taylor is an excellent prof! His expectations are clear and the feedback he gives on assignments is constructive and very useful. He is a good lecturer and really knows the subject matter. I would definitely take another course with him again.,1
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
Professor Mukherjee is very arrogant and condescending in his class. He assumes you know everything and will take as much time ridiculing the students than he could just be explaining. Super test heavy and a quiz every week. By far the worst professor I've ever had.,0
Marek is a terrible teacher. He is very hard to understand. His lessons do not make sense as well. I think he just wakes up and teaches on the fly. Ridiculous how Humber College still has him hired.,0
"Very difficult to communicate with.  Didn't repsond to email. Cares about students in class, but hated our daily discussion groups.",0
Don't take this professor. He is unclear on assignments and is one of the toughest graders I've ever met.,0
"Gail does not take the time to to listen to her students. It is her way, her schedule, all the time. Don't expect her to get help from her.  Instead, she will pawn your need for help onto someone else. If you have a specific way of working she will ciriticize you for it because it is not the way she does it. The Gail way is the only way.",0
Very helpful and nice lady. She really enjoys what she teaches. Her tests weren't too difficult. If you study and pay attention in class her class will be fairly easy.,1
"My 4th class with Mike and nothing has changed. Lacks details in lecture topics. Assignments are not as rigorous or technical as I expect. He should cut down on the total assignments and increase the difficulty and quality expected. Currently, the TAs have admitted they grade easy as Mike does not set high benchmarks from students. PS:Lab is a joke",0
"Avoid her!!! She changed her style on every course she taught now!(After 2012 summer term)!!It was so hard for quizzes, and paper!! She marked so hard. Although she is a nice prof.Not recommend her at all!!",0
"Great prof just not very clear grading scheme. No tests or final and the term project is super easy and only takes like half an hour. Assignments are based off the lectures so if you miss a class you can't do the assignment, but you get 6 freebies that you don't have to do. I loved being able to finish the class early and focus on my other exams.",1
"Holy mother of god her lectures are dry. She goes through millions of powerpoint slides and just endlessly reads them. And if you are waitlisted, you will NOT be added no matter how many empty seats there are. She said she tried to get bigger room? (why? half of class is empty) and because dept turned that down, she couldn't add WL ppl.",0
"Paula is a professor who I liked as a person but her class wasn't my favorite. Her tests are based on the book, which is rarely (if ever) mentioned in the class. Her lectures barely skim the material she tests you on. No reviews for the tests, she just posts on BB chapters to read. Still, for the speeches she is very supportive and helpful.",1
"his class is horrible. He just uses textbook powerpoint and extremely hard tests. I thought marketing was be a bit easier, but this guy took to another level. You dont have to read the chapters 3 TIMES to pass, just go over the powerpoint slides on MindTap. Good luck if you have him!",0
"Tough grader, Little feedback, and has no filter",0
"Some student really like this course, find him easy to understand. Unfortunately, I was one of the many that had a hard time following his lectures. He does provide online recordings of his lectures, that saved me. Every quiz, homework, and test is online. He provides a ""study guide"" that is actually does not follow through with the exams.",0
 GET BOOK ONLINE.  Many assignments.,1
"Completely missed entire units we were supposed to cover. I had her for ENG2 and wrote TWO papers. In ENG1, I wrote 6 papers, that says something. Also have never received a B on a paper until her class, only ever A's. Unfair grader, let's the class take advantage of her, not very helpful/seems annoyed with helping. Unclear expectations. Nice lady",0
Great class,1
Couldn't in anyway explain the marking system that he utilized in attributing grades for mid-terms. His entire process smacks of the arbitrary.,0
Brother Dalton is a great teacher who really cares about his students. His dedication to the language makes it easier to learn and he explains concepts in a clear way. I highly recommend this class.,1
Impossible,0
"She is very smart and quite demanding. The text is hard even for native speakers (I met one on an airplane and asked for help interpreting). There is a lot of writing, like 3-5 pages, in french. Her english communication is not great so it's hard to ask questions for clarification. She'll never remember your name, even with only 8 people in class.",0
she wants all of her students to pass the class but she doesn't really teach. You MUST learn from the online homework or you wont do well in this class but she is  very helpful if you don't understand.,1
"Nice guy ! very helpful, just go to class and you'll be fine. if he repeats solving any problem, it's on the next test or quiz. weekly quizzes, will tell what exactly on some of them. VERY fast and easy grader. Would take him again for sure. ",1
Easy class as long as you keep up with your work.,1
Grades like an English prof. but he makes class interesting and keeps everyone engaged.,1
"Devey doesn't seem to be able to apply the educational principals he is teaching. Though i was well prepared, i barely survived the first exam- got an A, but scrambled to understand the questions. When I tried to contact the prof he ignored my emails and discussion board posts, and doesn't hold office hours. This class was a major bummer.",0
"This class will impact so much! You will come back to see her after you are done with it. She is an amazing teacher, and helps you become a great writer and a great disciple of Christ!",1
"He is the worse you can get in Nova. All my projects were working though I submitted late. I had 90 on all my tests. But he end up giving me less on my finals , I dont know how. And I got a B. PEOPLe who copied from me got an A. I learnt nothing the whole semester. Never take him. Its a waste of time and money",0
"Awful, awful, awful, awful. She goes off on tangents more than teaches the class. I've never had such a terrible professor in my life. All she does is read her ridiculously wordy powerpoints instead of actually teaching, and lectures you on how you should know the material as much as her. Stay away if you can, she enjoys making you feel dumb.",0
The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,0
"Worst class I have ever taken. Professor is unorganized and does not follow his slides. I can honestly say I've learned nothing in this class. Tests are multiple choice, but don't follow what he *attempts* to teach in lecture at all. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
"She is frustrating to say the least. Her grading is entirely inconsistent and arbitrary. She will leave you contradictory remarks on your drafts, and will mark you down a grade without explanation. She has her favorites and for some reason refuses to grade anonymously like most law schools do. She made me want to transfer schools.",0
If you're not already good in math don't take him.,0
"Very kind person. Very inspirational. She makes me want to achieve the most out of life. Thank you, Alynn !",1
"Love this proffessor. Extrememly interesting, and fairly easy. Funny dude who will often joke around. Uses great examples to get his point across! LOVE THIS CLASS",1
"Professor literally lost one of my quizzes and gave me a zero, when I never missed one class and took the quiz. Incredibly disrespectful to students. She tells us to ask her questions and email her then she does not respond to emails. Would never recommend this professor. Many people dropped the course halfway through the semester due to her.",0
"Did not like his lectures, learned on my own. ",0
"He was very truthful in his syllabus. Every due date and exam date was presented at the very beginning of the semester. He was very willing to work around circumstances and very nice. He also curved every exam and had office hours for students to come by to get feedback on papers. Only thing I didn't like was his lectures, put me to sleep...",1
"Very nice lady, but for the most part she was unable to remain on schedule with going through materials for lectures. Dropped her class after the first test; 85% of the class failed because she did not grade in accordance to the book, slides or study guide she designed herself and told/made us use; was unwilling to discuss why she graded that way.",0
"This professor expects wayyy too much out of his students for a 244 class, I bought six different books for this one class. It's unclear and difficult how to achieve an A in the class as all the guidelines only detail how to achieve a B in the course. If you aren't a kiss up, it's going to be needlessly difficult.",0
"Such a handsome, hot guy. Makes me go crazy everytime  I see him. Wow makes my heart melt. Easy grader, wonderful dude and just an awesome professor. I recommend him. Makes my moo moo go wild.",1
"Camarena is super laid back and funny. Gets off topic sometimes, but in a 2-hr math course it is refreshing. Cares about students passing and taking school seriously. His lectures are straightforward and takes the time to answer student questions.",1
This is my 3rd year of post secondary and he's by far my favourite prof! He really cares for his students and always willing to help. Everytime i visited his office it was like i was going to a friend for help. Hes a funny and nice guy to have a chat with. And he always you to redo 1 question after each exam! Got an A in the course,1
"Terrible. Exams were extremely difficult because the lectures involve no actual learning. His lecture style is very dry, unfunny, and not helpful at all. His accent is sometimes incomprehensible. The other instructor for this class, Dr. Storch, was much more organized and presented the material in a very clear and understandable fashion.",0
"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors! He teaches it as if you need physics to succed in the world, every class there's a quiz and you have to read the textbook to do well on them but even then the textbook is hard to understand. Goes on tangents a lot and he will always keeps you until class has ended.",0
I took Professor Errico for Accounting during Summer A and I regret my decision. There are MULTIPLE times that Professor Errico did not have a clue how to do the problems and students had to correct her. I recommend going to her youtube channel BEFORE choosing her class to see if you can handle taking her class. Maybe this was just a bad semester?,0
"The professor gets very political in class and it's annoying. Too many readings, no laptops in class, you need the hard copy of the text. Lots of HW. Don't take this class when you have other important classes that take a lot of time because this professor seems to think she's the only professor we have.",0
"I had few expectations prior to taking this class, yet int the end I came away with a much deeper interest in the subject and tools I will use in the future. John was clear, interesting and fun. I really enjoyed class discussions and his lectures were jovial and informative.",1
We read through slides everyday. You much read your book or the test will be difficult. She is nice and clear. The test are very hard. ,1
"Lectures were a big waste of time, had to buy 5 different books - all of which were poorly written & uninteresting",0
I wish i knew about this website before taking his class. I recommend not taking this class unless you're looking for failure.,0
Dr Delius is one of the best professors I've had at Fordham. Her assignments are actually fun to do and her lectures are very interesting. Participation matters a lot though and can seriously affect your grade. Highly recommend taking Urbanism with her.,1
"Comes from the real world of business. Most knowledgeable professor that I have ever had. His knowledge and experience in Senior Management is incredible  i.e. CEO jobs, President of a Fortune 50 Company, sits on several Boards of Directors. If you are serious about pursuing a Business career, this Professor is unmatched in business management.",1
"Dr. B was a good teacher. He cares for his students and wants them to all succeed in his class. He always makes time to help his students out whenever he can. His class is challenging but manageable if you work for it. Overall, Great teacher for the difficulty of the material.",1
This class is SO much work. There are 3 tests and a cumulative final which is optional if you have the average you need to not take it. There is a financial report that is submitted in 2 parts which is VERY time consuming and he doesn't help you on it at all. There are hw's on MyFinanceLab for each chapter. He doesn't explain concepts very well.,0
"I am impressed really nice guy, tells funny stories those stories are very relevant to the tests and help you remember just review the notes read your text book let him know u are making an effort and you will get a good grade",1
"I really liked him as a person and a teacher. He taught me more about grammar than my high school teachers had ever taught me (and I still don't know much) He is funny and really wants you to learn. I took an online class with him, but the in-person one was much better! ",1
"Decent professor. explains things well and easy to talk to. wants you to succeed, you just have to put in the work and go to office hours. His lectures aren't the most interesting and he speaks in a monotone, but if you pay attention and engage you'll be good.",1
I hated this class the first day I walked in she gave us a huge word bank and went through her powerpoint in lab she said ok now learn that 200 vocab what they are and do because we will be working on some different ones next class. It was crazy!,0
"Kathy is a wonderful professor, I would say one of the best here at CMU. All you need to do is attend class, which isn't a difficult thing to do as the lectures are really fun, interactive, and easy to sit through. She's really kind and will listen to student's opinions with no judgment. I would recommend her to anyone.",1
"Don't take her Comp class unless you want to hear about politics all class period long. If you include something about politics in any paper you write, you'll be good. The focus of the class seemed to be world politics, especially Middle Eastern areas, instead of actual English related material. She also gives a ton of homework.",0
"He was okay. Based on these ratings I was looking more forward to this class, but was disappointed. Class got a little boring because I don't have that much interest in the Bible. But he seems like a nice enough guy.",0
Petty work load.. Busy work,0
"It is difficult to teach the skill of legal writing, but professor Henricksen does a very good job of teaching new students the basics. He will almost write an entire paper with the class so they can see how it is done, then when you have to write your own he gives great feedback on how to improve.",1
Hard grader.  Often goes off on a tangent and wastes class time.  Would not recommend.,0
"BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! He is funny and completely had me changing my major by the end of the class. He is the deal. He isnt easy, but his class is not impossible. He genuinely cares about his students understanding.",1
he talks a lot with topics that not related to the lecture.,0
"Dr Li's teaching methods are unorthodox at best and impossible to get perfect at worst. His lab section will really try your patience as he must correct every minute detail of drawing from lab samples. He also gives out random quizzes while still teaching using clickers. Know the study guides he gives well, they will save your life on exams.",0
"Yes, you have to teach yourself and a little more work than what you would expect from a 100 level class but overall if you do the work there's no reason you can't get a B or higher. Uses old exams by copy & paste and once you get a feel for the class not too bad. Usually gives extra credit for tests which help out a lot.",1
"Professor Davis is an excellent teacher and does a good job of making dry material somewhat interesting through hands-on examples.  He also has a (dry) sense of humor, which keeps class entertaining.  Highly recommended.",1
"The course is not an easy bird course to take because the content is quite hard to understand if you have no previous science background such as physics and biology. He will post readings before lectures and slides after lectures, as well as review guidelines before exams. He is a nice person and he is alwasy willing to answer questions.",1
"I took Professor McLawhons 5 week online summer course and it was a great choice. His instructions are very clear and he is a fairly easy grader. There were a lot of assignments per week, but none of them were hard. The material he has you read is very informative, and his discussion board questions really get you thinking. I highly recommend.",1
"Took this class online as a deceivingly easy Gen Ed and that was not the case. He didn't include any of his own teachings - we were entirely dependent on the book and the powerpoints, which came from the book company. For anyone who isn't ecstatic about economics and wants a helpful teacher, this is not the guy for you.",0
This course needs to be revamped prof anikovsky needs to learn to teach stuff more throughly and test stuff that he actually taught us. literally buddy goes and tests on stuff he skipped in 10 min and is amazed that we did so bad. I am so happy to be done with this course.,0
Prof Davis is awesome... easy A if you participate each week.  Pay attention to the grading rubric on the 3 writing assignments.  Mid term & Final are open book.  Take Prof Davis if you need this course... always responds in forums and emails.,1
"Good online class, if it is a 7 week course expect every week one or two easy assignments will take you no more than 1 hr and 30 min to do it. Then every week you get a quiz. ( take your time on the quiz because she gets little specific things from the book) plus quizzes are not timed. You definitely have to get the book just for the quizzes.",1
"Great course, I highly recommend taking it online! She was very caring and quickly replied to emails. Tons of extra credit opportunities. Weekly quizzes that were easy. Exams were long but she posts recaps on chapters every week that have almost all of the answer in them! Textbook helped a little on tests but rarely used. Only 3 discussion boards.",1
"He's a little bit awkward, but you could see he tries his hardest to prepare us for the realities of the Music Industry. Not really the most interesting and engaging, but there are some important lessons to take away, especially with Copyright and Contracts. I probably wouldn't take him again though.",0
"Took him this past fall semester, no pop quizzes, no open book tests. Test are 2 questions, but thats all you really have time for tbh. Equation sheet allowed. There's homework, but only for practice because it's not graded. Hands out his notes which is helpful so we can focus on the lecture better. This is a tough class in itself, tough material.",1
"Great professor that offers clear guidance, good feedback, and more concerned with the content of a paper or essay.  Would not hesitate to take another class with this professor!",1
She is an AWESOME teacher.. makes class fun and ineresting!! Easy and FUN!!!,1
Super boring lectures but super easy grade. I barely showed up and didn't get the textbook and only used the workbook and Khan Academy.,0
DO NOT TAKE. I repeat: do. not. take. 90% of our class is struggling big time. I am a straight A student and currently fighting to pass... The material is hard enough to understand and his lectures are of no help. I have never experienced something like this.  ,0
He is a great professor although you can not understand when he lectures. His classes are very chilled and laid back. He is also a very intelligent man if you talk to him outside of class.,1
"Professor Washburn is an excellent instructor, having a broad base of both theoretical and practical knowledge. The class content was a great balance of individual and group work. The class culture was based on mutual respect and participation was highly encouraged. The class materials were great, excellent textbook and video, while dated, valuable",1
"There is no science in this course, which remains superficial and descriptive. The teacher is still interesting and cares about what he says. The calm of his voice and the lack of structure of his class and PPTs unfortunately don't keep us interested very long. You will easily pass the exam without attending class, or without reading the book.",0
"Where do I begin with poor miss Thompson... Boring lectures, shes always complaining about how hot the classroom is, too serious, and she doesn't like when you ask questions during her lectures. TAKE ONLY IN MAYMESTER OR SUMMER!!!",0
"very caring about students, but the class covered the very basics, not difficult if you do the work, which is quite little",1
worst teacher ever...if you ever get him drop. Good thing he is retiring soon. Biggest mistake was to take his class,0
"I took 2601 with Dr. Isley and she made such a huge impact on my entire class. The curriculum was awesome, we gained hands-on, real world experience and went in-depth into theoretical aspects of features writing. Since leaving her class, I have not had a better journalism professor. She is so caring and resourceful. Wish I could add more.",1
Easy A- just show up and do your assignments. Lectures were boring but she has a great personality so it was okay. Met at the gym every other week but she doesn't pay attention to see if you actually worked out or not. Never kept class the full time and the only test was the final. Overall easy class and made me like fitness a little more,1
he is the worst,0
"Good Prof, especially as far at the 201 classes go.  Fair grader and very smart and articulate.  Sometimes class discussion can get a little sidetracked by she is sympathetic, approachable, and reasonable.  I would recommend her.",1
"He got phone calls in the middle of class almost every time. He would ignore your questions. His TA didn't know how to complete most the HW questions. Would go through examples in class that had nothing to do with the HW. He seemed out of breath most days. But I guess he knows R pretty well, if that is what makes you a good teacher.",0
"Very disorganized, wastes class time on pointless things that won't be worth marks. Very non-specific about what he looks for. Goes into detail about one essay then tests you on one you have not gone over. Pointless class, taught myself more than he taught me. I always did very well in my other classes and English, I feel dumb in his class.",0
"Literally just show up for a good time, super great personality, and entertaining lectures.",1
Very funny and clear teacher. Teaches very well. Assigns a lot of readings but you don't have to do them. Gives a study guide before the test and a question session. Tests are relatively easy. ,1
All you have to do is take notes from the powerpoint lecture and then he'll give you a take home test at the end of every week. His tests are not hard if you take notes. He will interact with the class by asking questions and sometimes tell stories. He also has an extra credit question every day if you're on time. There is only 1 APA paper due.,1
"Literally the worst teacher I have had at Providence College. Her lectures make no sense whatsoever because she doesn't understand what she is teaching. Her exam questions do not reflect what she has ""taught."" You will receive nothing from lecture and you will have to teach yourself everything. She will kill BIO for you if you take her.",0
"Professor Gill definitely makes you do more work than any other professor that offers this course. Offers some extra credit opportunities but the bottom line is that if you take her you have to struggle to get a B, where if you take anybody else you can coast by with an A. Only saying this from a STEM major standpoint and this course is required.",0
"Horrible professor! Doesn't care if you learn. Messes up in lectures, says he'll start over next class and ignore the day's entire lecture. Minimal partial credit on exams. Went to his office, he said I just needed to practice more, that I didn't need a tutor, & wouldn't suggest another book to learn from. Withdrew, will NEVER take him again!",0
nice prof,1
"Heavy on homework load, but clear on expectations and approachable. Start on homework assignments ahead of time if possible. This is an easy to manage class if you stay on top of the homework assignments. Make sure you make time to read!",1
"Very hard to hear and understand in class. Gives you the option to view the course online instead of in class, which is nice. Homework is not turned in or graded, so its only tests and quizzes for your grade. Homework does not match what is talked about during lecture. Seems to be more of an into to using Excel course",0
"His class is not easy, but hes a good guy and cares a lot. Show up and study and youll do well.",1
avoid at all cost.,0
"Well, come the final, half the class is failing, and Kari made a whole spreadsheet about it, while instead, she could be using her time to try and make her students be successful in the class. Yes of course some of the students are failing because they are slacking, but, if half the class is failing, maybe the teacher could do something different",0
"DO NOT pick this professor!!! Nothing is organized, she is extremely rude and hard to work with. She reads from powerpoints for the whole time you're in class, even the lab is just another lecture of something so unrelated from regular lecture. She's VERY unreasonable and says community college students are spoon fed. DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"very clear and pretty cool! a good teacher, very nice and caring also.",1
"She sets a very distinct criteria from beginning of semester. Tests are hard&worth a lot. She curves down for her tests so if you get a 100 on the test after the curve it will be significantly lower if the curve is large. She did not seem understanding when I emailed her about a personal issue, hw on mindtap for every chapter. Not an easy A",0
You must be involved and participate. Dont let his priesthood fool you. He is a cynic and not as friendly as you would think,1
"Very wishy washy. He will decide one thing one minute, and change his mind the next. Makes you participate in a Global Business Game, impossible..then tests you on it. Even harder. Try to avoid taking him. Pretty nice guy, just not the greatest teacher.",0
"If you are looking for an easy language class stay away from ASL. Instructor is passionate, and works with the deaf community.Practice, practice and practice. You have to make time for this class because there are events to be completed and test to study for. This class was a lot of hard work but I enjoyed it and learned a lot.",1
She was all over the place!,0
"Prof Wright is an amazing teacher, and she cares so much about her students. She uses iclicker and Aleks. Aleks is time-consuming and a lot of work but it is a departmental tool, not specific to this professor. I took it online so tests were on Aleks, which once you are familiar with the format of the questions is pretty fair. Make sure to study!",1
"Extremely dry, makes everything unnecessarily confusing, and does not adequately prepare you for tests. She turns an interesting subject matter into pure torture. Does not care about student success. I didn't understand a single thing happening in this class.",0
"Mr. Daigle is very confusing while lecturing. His lectures do not match with the information in the textbook. His tests are not consistent with lectures. He has a bad attitude towards students, he cusses, and disrespects students. He shouldn't be teaching at all. Do not waste your money on a class that he teaches.",0
"Class consists of 5 exams, 1 final. And APLIA H.W. He drops the lowest two. Curves good. Had an average of 64% on exams and 88% on APLIA. Got a B- after the curve.",1
Professor Hersh is very unorganized and doesn't respond to emails on time or forgets to open your emails. She was funny at times and I really enjoyed the readings from the book. But when it came to the essays I was lost and didn't know exactly what she wanted but she gives it back with feedback to resubmit again. PAY ATTENTION,1
"Dr. Brown is a life saver. If he had not spoon fed us then one would not have such a broader understanding of Industrial Hygiene, Air Pollution Controls, and just how the industry works in general. Doc knows how to dumb it down to students who are trying to actually understand the world of EHS. Very knowledgable and paitent. Trinadad brother!",1
She is an easy professor with a thick accent. Runs through the powerpoints quickly and her test are timed online. Strict on attendance. Had to drop this professor because she would not let me miss class for a family matter. Was very rude to me and hard to contact her through email.,0
"This teacher is very difficult to get along with.  She is very demeaning to students and does not seem to want to help students learn.  She is a very hard grader, to the point I would say unfair.  If a small aspect of a lab write up is not exactly how she feels it should be, she will gouge your grade severely.  If you can avoid her DO SO!",0
Dr. McMahon is the best professor i have ever taken. He has so much knowledge that you just want to get all of it. He's hilarious. His lectures are never boring.,1
Her grading is out of three exams only. She does give e.c. but she is very strict on the way she wants it. It's her way or the highway. The first few e.c. assignments majority of the class received no credit. Attendance is mandatory and no phones allowed. Doesn't return exams. Btw 365 is based more on marriage counseling than family psych.,0
Her feedback is precious. Awesome lectures. Hard grading but valuable.,1
It's impossible to not understand what she is saying. She is plain awesome.,1
"Nice lady, not a very good professor. For Asian Art she blows by things so fast and goes off on tangents so when you leave the class you're thinking, ""what just happened"". Do not take her writing intensive classes.",0
"She is honestly really sweet. If you miss less than 3 days, you don't have to take the final. I have to teach myself the material. She speaks really fast and gets confused. She expects you to already know what she is teaching. She does a few examples in class but hw is online. In order for you to take the tests you need to have done online quizzes.",0
Ms. Lee motivates students to achieve the highest results. She really cares about each student progress. If you are interested in course there are no doubts that she will do her best to help you. This proffessor is the most student orient on the course. I am really happy to be a part of her class.,1
"One of the absolute best professors I ever had. Runs rings around the ""tenured"" faculty. Professor Solari knows his subject matter, is able to engage students and makes the material very interesting. I learned a lot that changed my view of things from when I came into the class. You need to do the reading to get the most out of the class.",1
She is very hard to get a hold of and if you have questions about any assignment she takes about 24 hours to respond to them. Her instructions are not very clear especially with being in an online class that makes it pretty hard to know what to do and turn in.,0
"In short - extremely easy class, do the online homework, go to lecture, and do the EASY extra credit he gives you and you should have no problem getting an A.  Love this Professor and would definitely recommend!!",1
She has no idea what she is talking about sometimes and often relies on outdated information. Tests are quite unique and are fairly simple.  Very condescending with no good reason and students have even shown to better comprehend the textbook material. This Prof was the very reason I switched institutions.,0
He is on the short list 'Great Men' that I've learned from in my life. He possesses a tireless work ethic and an enthusiasm for academics that is contagious.,1
"She is so sweet, like a nice grandma. As long as you do the work you won't have any trouble. The reading notes are a little time consuming, but she grades pretty easy and the presentations are all done in groups. She tells tons of silly stories and shows some old fashioned teaching/parenting videos so be ready for that.",1
"Only a ""good"" teacher if you already know the material, which defeats the purpose. You have to buy the $90 MyMathLab access code to do homework, and the program is terrible and frustrating to work with. On top of that, she has a hard to understand accent, likes to randomly yell at the class, and only gives extra credit to her favorites.",0
"He has amazing lectures! I took his night class and he kept me learning, entertained, and awake the whole time! His class can be tough at times because you really have to remember all that he told you but since he speaks so well it's not too difficult. He also has a couple papers that are super easy and flexible. Just hit all the points he asks.",1
Solid Prof. Lots of reading and decent amount of writing/discussion. Is able to make dry topics engaging. Great class if you have a decent amount of B.G. info about the bible.,1
"There are a few essay tests, but they are not difficult. Tests aren't too hard if you study the study guide. Overall, pretty good professor. I definitely recommend taking her.",1
"Worst class i have ever taken! tests were something else than the course material, tutorial was like being back in grade 6, the essay was out to trick students. Take her tenure away!",0
"only take this class if your hands are immune to muscle cramps....because you will be taking notes non-stop and you won't be doing anything else. she was unhelpful and boring. she knows her history well, but she has no teaching skills and isn't very understanding of different learning styles.",0
"This professor is way too hard to understand. He has a heavy accent and also goes way too fast for the average person, sometimes he even loses his self in the midst of the lesson. I do not recommend anyone to take this class. There is a good chance for an A if you can actually keep up with him, but other than prepare to fail.",0
"She's really nice. Sometimes gets carried away with her rants but don't we all? She is very personable as well! She treats everybody equally which is nice. MUST not miss her class more than twice because after that 50 points will be deducted for each absence. If you do the work and do what she says, you will receive an A!",1
He often makes mistakes and speaks very unclearly. I honestly believed I was good at Math but the way he teaches confuses me.,0
"I had him for I.O. This is a class you must take notes for. He is hard but very clear on what he wants, and will help you.",1
"Went into this class regretting taking him. He grades HARD, but tells you exactly what he expects. He gives feedback if requested, but after the assignment is already due. Class got easier half way through. Final was a joke, it's his reward for making it through his class. if you don't like work, don't take him. But he notices who tries.",1
"Great professor! Easy-A! Graded by a few things, 3 exams (open book take home online tests), discussion board on an online budget simulation. He gives everyone extra credit to replace the lowest test grade. Literally no way to fail this class unless you are a complete and total failure!",1
Dr. Smith is BY FAR my favorite professor Ive ever had in terms of being inspirational. She definitely made me so excited about education! She is fantastic. This is the second class Ive had with her and I wish I could always have her as a professor!,1
"Prof. Haidey has an excellent teaching style. However, I wish that he had gone through the suggested problems list for FNCE 3227 BEFORE the Fall 2016 semester even started because the list has problems that test concepts he does not even want students to worry about.",1
"Had difficult class concepts that he explained poorly, reads off of his slides, awful spelling/grammar on slides and on tests. However, very receptive to feedback and trying to help you understand. Loves Warby Parker.",0
"Dr. Khadka is a great professor, he is very smart, and it can be seen from his teaching style. his lecture were great and his structure of teaching was excellent and helped me thrive in this class.  Everything was organized and was easy to follow for the most part!",1
"I have never had a teacher that grades so ridiculously, she has no clear rubric for how she grades at all. I wholeheartedly believe when grading she takes into account if she likes your or not (your attendance/attention in class). She try to make it near impossible to make a high A, only allowing a 95 as highest grade on discussion boards.",0
"Kathy is a tough grader. She refuses to give out A's even if she loves your papers. I didn't learn anything in her class, yet she expects you to be an amazing writing. I want to be taught, and she isn't doing it. ",0
"I took intro to Journalism thinking it would be he basics in journalism, it was the farthest from that she acted like we already had a background in journalism which many of us did not, I endned up dropping the class. do not go into her class expecting to just learn the basics, and she is very particular on her editing, she critiques too much!",0
First day I was scared because I didnt know much about networking. Now I can say I know a lot more than the first day. Make sure you come to class everyday! Tests are taken every class day but its nothing to worry about. Test grade doesn't count much. Major grade is the project and skills exam. He gets you ready for both. Made an A in the class.,1
"I took the half semester option for this class. He is an interesting and nice guy, but different when it comes to grading. He is very inconsistent and tends to take away major points if your paper isn't exactly the way he would have written it.",0
"Horrible professor for PSY200. Not helpful, confusing, and boring. She isn't willing to give extra credit and her tests are impossible even if you can do the problems in class or homework. (She likes trick questions). Do yourself a favor and take someone else before you put yourself through this torture. I would of dropped the class if I could.",0
"Sanchez is really nice and teaches alot of interesting material but in the end, you'll feel as if you've learned nothing. This course doesn't help at all with speaking of the language. Tests are a joke. They're online and basically a google scavenger hunt with a time limit. Grades pretty fairly but takes forever in doing so.",0
"She is very clear when explaining questions in class, and cares if students are actually learning. She is helpful and when there is clearly a problem fixes it fairly for students. She also is refreshing and easy to pay attention to. Classes are important to attend :)",1
"Professor Corona was a very sweet teacher. She has very clear grading criteria, and as long as you participate and show effort you should pass with an A. The textbook is important for quizzes (which I might add, the quizzes can be confusing, just cuz of wording) but it really is an easy class, and you can tell she cares for her students.",1
"Although he was very intimidating at times and the majority of his test questions were a bit hard, I would absolutely take Dr. Nguyens class again. I must admit, I slacked on studying since this is a gen ed, so thats why I didnt do great on exams. BUT the class was worth it! If you genuinely take his ideas to your heart, youll be fine.",1
"Excellent professor! Has a passion for math that is contagious. Very understanding and willing to explain any/all questions students have. Didn't use the book, only the access code that goes with it (can be purchased separately online). Do the homework assignments (only a few examples per unit) and study.",1
"Honestly the easiest A i have ever gotten. Attendance is not mandatory, showed up to less than a quarter of classes. All powerpoints are online, tests literally straight from slides. Cheat sheets are allowed as well which makes things super easy. Easy 3 credits, take her class.",1
"You have to work very hard to just pass this class. It's hard to understand her and she is very particular about your work. Doesn't help you out very much, but she will push you to do your best.",0
Great professor! I took him for ENG 1101 and 1102 and passed both classes with A's. He's very professional and passionate about the subject he teaches. He has the entire class outlined day-to-day so you know when everything is due and what you'll be doing in class. I also feel he's very generous when it comes to grading papers.,1
"I took her online Adulthood & Aging course. She is very straight-forward, so as long as you are organized and do the chapter tests there shouldn't be a problem. The tests are not easy, but not too bad either. She gives plenty of extra credit opportunities to make up for points lost on the chapter tests.",1
"He made me laugh at least once every lecture! He seems so interested and happy to teach.For this class we just had a midterm and final and one paper. For the test, he picked one essay question but gave you a list of 6 to study two weeks before hand. Pretty much come up with the essay on your own and memorize it and you'll do fine for the test :)",1
do not recommend her,0
"If you take Mathi for a higher math you will struggle all quarter. She doesn't care if her students are struggling, horrible unclear lectures, and grades attendance so you will have to show up to her lectures that make no sense. I had to teach myself from the book the whole quarter, putting in so many hours of studying for the exams every week.",0
"There were weekly readings/homework assignments, 1 MC midterm, 1 8-10 page paper, and 1 essay question for the final. This course requires lots of reading. All his exams/essays required pulling quotes from the readings. Lecture was a waste of time. Do the readings, go to your TA for the essay questions, and you'll be set for an A.",0
"Robert Ruder is the worst professor I have taken at Gonzaga. His classes are so boring! Sometimes he'll lecture on and on without making a real connection to what we are learning in the class. Also, this is a class on business information systems, but you don't even learn how to create one! He doesn't even teach, he assigns readings and that's it.",0
"I took BIO203 with Professor Ba and he's an excellent professor that will give you the tools to study hard and his lectures are really worth paying attention to when the first exam is coming up. His exams require paying close attention to details and knowing and memorizing the answers, there is no room for cheating and skipping class.",1
I took her online class. They layout was very unorganized and confusing. the dates are wrong in the weekly assignment folder so I got a few zeros cause she never changed the dates from her previous classes. ALOT of reading. expects you to know everything already and if you dont expects you to learn it on your own. if never taken anat before dont,0
"Overly anal with grading labs. Cares mostly how organized everything is/how neat it looks. Always finds ways to mark you down,even when tons of effort is put in.Almost impossible for an A out of lab.Partial credit not given on much of tests.It brings your grade down quite a bit. Handwriting very sloppy & fast, makes it hard to get problems right",0
"He has no tact. When questioning him, he gets very defensive and is ready to attack you left and right. Very unprofessional. Very obscure grader and mediocre at best.",0
She has a thick accent but she is a caring professor. She will always encourage her students to learn and study for her test. She will give the review that will be exactly the same as the test. If you practice the problems you will be fine passing the class with an A.,1
"This teacher is the worst one I've had in the Comm Department so far. Her practice tests online are super easy and then when you get the in class quiz, they are much harder. This course is only two credits and she makes it way harder than it should be. Impossible to get an A. ",0
"Dr. Clementz is clearly very passionate about neuroscience, but because of that he spent a LOT of time going into excruciating detail on minor topics. He also went way over 50 minutes every single class. Never responded to emails either. If you thoroughly read the textbook it isn't very hard to do well, but these things were pretty annoying.",0
One of the best professors I've had. Quite understanding when it comes to assignment . Have to experience this professor for yourself. Don't listen to other students that spread false rumors about him. Once you enter the classroom you'll realize that those individuals were the problem. He provides additional teaching aids to students.,1
"A pretty good teacher, better at 450.  Was not there for every class and takes an extrodinarily long time to grade exams.  He knows alot and is glad to pass it on. Not sure how much I can take away from the class to use in real life.",1
"If you study as days go by as how he throws questions on his exams. You will be just fine. Some of his questions on his exams are repetitive, but different numbers as you take next exam, especially piecewise defined functions. If you don't pass his exams, you'll have a chance to correct them and math center will help you if you don't get it.",1
I had her for my Advanced topics in Cognitive psych class (Spring 2018). Homework is pointless busy work. Group projects that she expects perfection on. More pointless memory journals. Final paper is expected to be like a PhD thesis. Feeback very unclear. No tests. Attendance not mandatory but participation is a huge part of grade.,0
"She can seem a little intimidating at first, but that's just because she knows the material so well. She's friendly and approachable. I would have liked to have study guides for the first three exams, but if you show up and listen to the lectures/take good notes/study, you will do fine. She will go out of her way to help you if you are trying.",1
Professor Burman is hilarious and helpful. She is easy accessible outside of class and always shows that she cares about you and your learning. Show up to class and do your work- attendance is not mandatory but it does reflect on your grade in the class.,1
Favorite college professor thus far! She is very helpful and entertaining.,1
"Really enjoys the subject matter. Very difficult grader, and not very helpful for improving. Tends to keep all of her grade the same so it's really tough to improve once you're locked in to a certain grade.",0
"Professor Herz is great! He gives the impression of being very experienced despite being a fairly new professor, and he has a lot of knowledge to offer. He is a very friendly and helpful guy and a great person to have a conversation with. In class, he really values participation, and will help you as much as you need in order to get a good grade.",1
She is really difficult to achieve. I sent her 3 emails and she did not respond any of them. You will not expect to get any help from her. She gives too much reading. More than 20 pages each every week. Very long boring lecture. She does not put her presentation on sakai.,0
"A few of the reasons why I enjoyed her: her feedback on papers was super detailed, she allows rewrites on the first essay (but not the second), she is super helpful in office hours, and her reading quizzes aren't that hard even if you didn't fully understand the reading (not to mention she often gives a heads up before a reading quiz). Great prof.",1
"I took Dr. Snaza's FYS Politics of Sexual Education class and it was super interesting. He is the type of professor that really just wants you to think. Because of that, he will let you rewrite ANYTHING you are graded on. He's super funny, insanely smart, and a great person to get to know on campus. Would definitely recommend taking his FYS.",1
He is very nice and knowledgeable about the subject.,1
Very rude and sarcastic ... IF YOU HAVE DREAMS PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS PROF. She will make you feel stupid and that you are unintelligent. She is literally the worse and wont help anyone. She does not deserve to be a professor if she keeps acting like this. She is extremely careless and doesnt teach nothing ... do your self a favor and skip her nam,0
He was a very helpful teacher. I can definitely see the changes that he made on my writing until today since the class tow years ago!,1
"Great professor who cares about students. This is my second time taking Micro because I didn't well the first time, but my fault. Pay attention in class and study.",1
"she doesn't care if you can keep up with her teaching or not. She is the most subjective teacher I have ever seen. Once you know you are not her type, better frop the class ASAP because no matter how hard you try, she will still give you a low grade.",0
DO NOT TAKE. The only reason why he has so many good ratings is because he spends every living minute looking at this page. I wouldn't be surprised if he uses another laptop and writes these anonymously. He is a very conceded person and an extremely terrible teacher/grader.,0
"She's a really good teacher, just go to class take notes and you will pass easily. You get a study guide and a lecture guide that are both super helpful for the tests, there isn't much homework but you must attend the lab or you won't pass. Overall its an easy and interesting class as long as you put in a bit of effort.",1
I should have gone to this site before I signed up for this class. This professor was very difficult. He didn't explain things very well and made you feel super dumb if you didn't understand something and tried to ask questions (even though he encourages questions). I understand A&P is hard.. but he was RIDICULOUS! Threatened extra credit too much.,0
"I have had Dr. Maida multiple times throughout my college experience. In my opinion this is the one professor I have had that genuinely cares for her students. She has met with me late at night to make me feel better about situations. Her class is easy if you put in the work, but she is an extremely fair professor.",1
"Nina is sweet and caring, but clearly favors philosophy students. Tough marker and not the most interesting.",0
Reads off textbook entire class & takes too long to explain things and everyone in class is falling asleep. Everyone just does training on SAM since he opens it when class starts and he's wondering why nobody is paying attention to him.  Make sure you sit beside people who know what they're doing or you're either gonna fail or do really bad,0
"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",0
He goes very quickly in lecture but will stop to address any questions or problem areas. He is kind of awkward but has good math jokes. All test questions come from the review questions he gives you from the textbook so there is no reason you shouldnt know something thats on the test. He gives a nice curve that benefits the people at the top.,1
He is an absolutely amazing professor. He knows the material well and is passionate about it. It's pretty easy to do quite well in his class if you just do your work and study for the exams. Plus he is SO HOT.,1
"great teacher, great adjuster, Best Gonstead...",1
"So Luttrell is a nice old man. He has become the butt of most of our jokes though. He would be great teaching toxicology I'm sure, but O Chem is definitely not his strong suit. However, he is the only O Chem professor at OC. Just READ the book, get labs and homework done (easy grades), and good luck learning.",0
"Awesome professor, he teaches by his whole-heart support. He alway does his best to help you get knowledge and experience. You should be thinking different and extend more your lecture, if you can not or stuck, ask him. He will be really welcome to help you. and the finally you will get an unbelievable result. take him for your knowledge.",1
"I have always struggled with math, but I ended up with an A in this class because she was easy to understand and gave many examples. She was very kind and worked with me. I have never had a professor as patient as this woman. I really enjoyed her class. Do your best to show up to class. Be sure to walk in with a smile. :)",1
This is my second year in college and I have never been so excited to come to class! I wish she had more lecture classes I could attend. She is super helpful and full of energy. She was always ready to help her students and gave reminders on papers and exam dates.,1
"Just don't go to the lectures. You won't know what he is talking about. Read the powerpoints and maybe textbook by yourself. You could get a nice grade if you know when to use those formulas (don't need to know WHY the formulas could solve the problems). Anyway, don't go to the lectures to waster your time.",0
"By far, Francine Dagenais is the WORST professor I've come by at UOttawa, and that's saying something. First off, if you miss more than 2 classes, she will prevent you from doing the exam. Second, her exam requires you to memorize 64 separate pieces, while the final essay is only worth 28% of the final grade. Dagenais is evil. She hates students",0
"She is very detailed on the work she goes over in class, but her exams are much harder than anything she covers in class or on the homework. There are quizzes regularly, about 2-3 a week, but they aren't worth too many points. If you're going to take her, just make sure you do the homework and then some, because she's a very hard grader.",0
"He's tougher in this class than the medieval colloquium, so it is easy to be discouraged that you are going to receive a worse grade. Stick through it and they seemed to put a nice curve on the final grade.",1
Dr. Houston is a fair teacher. If you don't read and study the class could be hard. Her test aren't easy. They require a lot of reading and studying. She's not as bad as these posts make her out to be. She is a very friendly professor outside the classroom but she is strictly about business when in the class. Just be prepared to work extra hard!,0
Questions on exams and hoemwork seemed to be worded to confuse you or required that you had prior knowledge of an unrelated subject. Gives few if any example problems. Most people did poorly on the exams yet he did not take responsibility for it. ,0
"Do not take him!!!! He dose not know how to teach. If you take him then basically you are on your own, he will not help you to pass the class.",0
"He is awesome! My favorite quote from Gary May ""If you don't want to be here, then sign the role sheet and haul ass. I don't really care."" HAHA. He's very laid back and funny!",1
"I never ever want to have him again and I recommend that people don't take him. If they  take him then they are wasting their time and money. This guy does not even teach, all he does is keep talking about different topics.",0
"she is very nice and cares about everbody learning. if you have a problem she doesnt mind explaining it. she does use the textbook but as long as you have the study guide and look at the pictures she puts up, you can easily pass. she is awesome",1
"After reading some of Kari's reviews on RMP I was slightly hesitant to take her class, but she was an awesome teacher. She was super caring, took time to explain the concept until we all understood, and made her lectures interactive. I have no complaints from taking her class. She is a solid choice for a math teacher!",1
"She'll make you feel horrible! She will insult you. You'll feel like you don't have what it takes to become a teacher. Honestly, the meanest teacher ever. She made so many people cry. She's the hardest person to please too.",0
"Puts a lot of effort into presenting the material during lecture, but assumes that students have mastery over the basics. Problems on quizzes are straight-forward; problems on exams make you apply concepts in new/different ways. Very helpful at office hours, but make sure to bring questions!",1
"The most annoying human being. She has a nervous giggle after every. single. sentence. No help at all, requires enormous amounts of reading between classes and unclear in assignments.",0
Expect homework every week. ATTENDANCE is very important. If you come late on the day you have your weekly quiz you will not be given another chance to take your quiz. But he usually drops one quiz at end of the semester. Good professor just dont skip class this is a class you must attend or it will affect your grade.,1
"Not good. I would understand everything and be able to do the in class problems, but then would get to the test and the problems would be nothing like what we did in class. The test material was always unexpected no matter how much I prepared for the exams.",0
Shes a good teacher very laid back.3 exams and one 5 page self paper with inventories included...,1
TAKE HIMMMMMM!,1
She is nice and funny but doesnt email back if you email her.  sent multiple emails and still waiting to recieve a response....,0
I cannot begin to express how amazing this professor is. She was truly one of the best professors I have ever encountered. Super understanding and motivating. she makes her class fun and I actually look forward to doing her assignments. She is truly a gem. You will not regret taking her. The material is so straight forward and she is super organize,1
"This professor is one of the worst Ive had. Professor Smith has hardly done any of the work herself and leaves it up to her Sophomore TAs without a set grading scale to grade a majority of your assignments. While its and easy A, its if she actually grades your paper in a timely manner. Im still waiting on a huge grade and its been two months.",0
boooooo brian,0
"One of the most challenging classes I have ever taken, and it was only a first-year writing seminar, yet, I've increased my writing skills tremendously. Prof. Qualls may be cutthroat policy-wise, but he's actually very friendly and approachable outside and inside of class. This man can teach you a lot, but you'll have to put in the effort to learn.",1
"Michael is a professor who not only cares about the material, but about his students. He comes off as super strict at first, but he's also very flexible, and as long as you don't make stuff up or say what he wants to hear and you're original and thoughtful, he'll be more than happy to work with you. I work my schedule around his classes. Love him.",1
"She's really good. She does give a lot of homework, but if you pay attention in class it's not too bad. Her slides are straightforward and not complicated. She uses iclicker and it might get a little annoying but it's just to see if you're paying attention/do you understand. She explains things pretty well and once in a while she's humorous",1
"Professor Reznitskaya is very intelligent, therefore, she expects a lot from her students. Her class isn't extremely hard but it involves a lot of reading and a lot of work.",0
"He gives terms to look up, these terms are never on the quizzes.  For mid-term study guide he gave a list of 75 terms, not one of them was on the test.  It is hard to know what to study for this class because there is so much information and the ""study guides"" that he gives are misleading since none of the information is actually on the exams.",1
"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading. The study guide that is provided is no help. Whoever is a history major please avoid taking this class. This isnt high school where you can't use the bathroom either during lectures. NO",0
Very good teacher.  If you work hard in his class you will do well because he wants you to earn your degree.,1
"Gerard's class ended up being one of my favourite classes. It takes a lot of work and a lot of creative thinking, but it felt like it was worth it. While you will need the short novel, the textbook is unnecessary. If you do the homework, you won't get below a B- in the course. ",1
"He's really nice and takes 5 random attendances for 5 points each, which is the only thing that is annoying. Take his class.",1
"Do not take this teacher. Extremely unorganized and never responds to emails, also barely puts work up on time for online class until half the class emails her so she has to extend the deadlines and make assignments due in 2 days rather than the week. Many long, pointless assignments 10+ pages that she won't grade until 2 months later. Just don't..",0
"She's a genuinely a good person. If you go in after class to ask for help you can tell she really wants to help you . However, this means nothing since she is not a native speaker; you literally cannot understand her. She is also unforgivably strict on assignments, and will not accept anything from you if you are even five minutes late to class",0
"While Palmer was somewhat approachable during his office hours, the completely disorganized and unstructured format of his notes, tests, and his class as a whole left much to be desired. I learned very little from his class and would warn anyone considering his class to consider your interest in and dedication to the subject matter very carefully.",0
"He really thinks the material is cool and ties it to real world tech. You can tell he is passionate about getting his students a job as well. That being said, his class is very difficult and he is not forgiving when it comes to late work or grading. Hard but if you do well in this class you can expect good resume building.",1
"Amazing person. So interesting and insightful. I took his class and enjoyed it a lot. Fair grader and not a whole loe to homework. Very smart guy, cool to talk to about anything.",1
"This class was definitely enjoyable. Lectures end up being pretty pointless because lecture exams are based off the practice test that he provides the answers for. Labs are fairly easy, but you must attend all of them if you want to pass the lab exams. No homework ever. The presentation is easy and easily graded. Overall great professor. ",1
"Dr. Weiner is a tough guy to figure out. He can be totally charming and kind, but with the flip of a switch, he can be a real ass.I got stellar grades in his class with the exception of one grade and he failed me because I didnt ask him about the status of my grade (even though it was all on blackboard). Stay as far away from his class as possible",0
"Chris is a born teacher.  He's very helpful and down to earth, and he's also very funny.  He goes slowly and breaks down the way to write a paper into clear steps.  He also teaches grammar in a interesting way and shows how to apply it to writing papers.  I want to take him again!",1
"Good teacher, don't bother with the textbook unless you are big on doing practice problems for tests. His class is pretty boring, but if you are willing to study and do all the work then it's a relatively easy A.",1
"Overall, he is great! He explains the reading well in his lectures, so it is simply recommended, not necessary, to read before class. Make sure to make an outline for the tests, and you'll be good. He is very willing to help outside of class, and is beneficial in preparing for tests and the paper. The grade is spread out among different aspects.",1
"She acts nice on the outside, but in her heart it has a duty to shatter every students' dream. Every week, she post practice quiz online and hands the real deal when we meet and all the questions doesn't make any sense. For the exams, they are roughly 70 questions and she expect us to know this. She doesn't even help her students at all.",0
"Incredible! She has so many experiences with advocacy & law. Her ''quizzes'' are more like tests, and are very detailed... but she prepares you well. The readings are lengthy, but she goes over them in detail in class, and is approachable in regards to confusion. Easy A if you participate, do the assignments, & multiple extra credit opportunities!",1
"Lectures are very straightforward and clear but they often cover things you will never need to know. A lot of this class is just being good at math, but it is a light work load and the tests are reasonable",1
"Awesome class, glad I got the chance to meet her.",1
Easy class.  the professor knows his material and makes it understandale.  you must read the book to pass the test.,1
took in the summer.3 tests. 5 essays. no classs on friday! He gives review with terms to know  before and gives the question and answer when you ask. I got an A.,1
"Dr G has one of the best personalities in a teacher Ive ever experienced. He is very sweet and down to earth, he also provides cookies and coffee every class. However, he isnt the greatest at explaining the material and labs are usually very unclear. I feel like tests and quizzes have a lot of questions that we never touch on.",1
"I had Ptak for intro bio and really liked his teaching style. Very hands-on. Rather than lecturing the whole time he will often have objects to look at and manipulate so that you can figure out things for yourself. Attendance is non-mandatory, but he doesn't put much on slides, so it's important. Sometimes leaves too much time for discussions tho.",1
"A really good professor with a ton of knowledge. Extremely easy course if you follow his syllabus and write notes. Your hand might get a little bent out of shape from writing so much, but the tests aren't too difficult. You'll never get out early, but you should be able to do very well.",1
"Ms. Benton is a great person and has a great sense of humor as well. However, as a professor I didn't quite enjoy her. Lectures can sometimes be all over the place and she isn't very clear on what she expects. There were some assignments I had to do multiple times and her feedback can be difficult to understand. Stay on top of things & you're fine.",0
"Midway through semster, our class was changed to a hybrid format. no more lectures. we would show up to class for 30 min. very pointless. seemed like prof lost interest in the class altogether. we stopped receiving study guides for exams and he never went in detail over any chapters.",0
"Dennis is a fun, hilarious professor who takes his work seriously. Taking his class was just such a delight!",1
"Clawson is really caring and interested in his students so it's an easy class to pass, although there is A LOT of reading which is important to quizzes (a pretty big part of your grade) and the final exam. There's a big paper but its very doable and Dan is very easy to work with. Lectures get a bit tedious but can be though provoking",1
I do not recommend this teacher at all. I took the online course and she is very bad at responding to emails in a timely manner. She does nothing to help the students and grades unfairly. People who do horrible on their speeches seem to get better grades than those who are actually good at public speaking. DO NOT TAKE HER if you want a good grade.,0
Best professor ever! I wish she had a part two to some of her classes. I looked forward to this class every day and never wanted to leave it.,1
"I loved Erika! She is so funny and really seems to care about her lectures and her students. She made the long lectures easier to listen to. The tests were eh, and there are NO study guides so you really have to know the material to do good.",1
"Padgett is really knowledgeable, but she's hard to parse. I took ENC1101 and 1102 with her, and while it was one of the hardest things I've ever done, I came out better for it. Papers are now easy. She tends to drift off topic in class, and if you listen to her and can write with your audience (her) in mind, you'll come out with a pass grade.",1
Very bad.,0
"prof maizel gives WAY too much homework (expect to receive an assignment EVERY class). if you SKIP, your grade will be determined based upon your PARTICIPATION, so DO NOT skip class. he has a HEAVY accent, that makes directions UNCLEAR, and RARELY responds to emails (if he does, expect to reply back the way he expects you to -- CORRECTLY).",0
"For a level 100 gen-ed class , she treats the class as if it's a level 400 class. I had more work in this class then in my upper-level major courses. There is little to no clarity on what is expected from you and the materials that are needed. If you need help, don't ask as you will only be ridiculed for asking. Godspeed to all who take her course.",0
"Prof Hart wants you to learn but is very unorganized, if you can stand hearing the word ""um"" 10000 times then its the class for you, dont even bother printing the handouts because you cannot follow them! The readings are pointless n mean nothing. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
I took for Texts and Contexts: Major Writers..A midterm and final along with about 5 essays... He is a difficult grader.  Very enthusiastic. It is impossible to read his comments on the paper so good luck learning and getting good grades,0
"Britten seems to genuinely mean well, but the woman simply wasn't called to teaching. Doesn't actually seem to care and is not particularly engaging. The text is useless but mandatory, and the lectures are meandering and poorly created. She also has far too many guest speakers and decides not to show up on a whim. If at all possible, do not take it",0
I was very interested in this course but I did not like her style or the lack of clarity from the teacher. I would not take a course with her again,0
"Ghent stood up in class one day and said that ""immigrants and women have no place in geology"". 50% of the class was female; another 50% was visible minorities. We formed a study group and all aced the class. Avoid him or make human-rights complaints - the guy's an ass.",0
all you have to do is show up one day a week and spend maybe 30mins-1hr in the lab he helps guides you to what you need to do and just take little quizzes each Friday and you'll pass!,1
Dr. Ortiz' course offers a very comprehensive study of the challenges facing a growing ESL population in our classrooms. She offers a wide selection of readings and discussions based on a multitude of approaches used to foster the inclusion of second-language learners; her course is a REAL eye-opening experience.  She is remarkable and brilliant.,1
Luckily the concepts were fairly easy to grasp. Just basic math problems you weren't allowed to use calculators. The tests weren't difficult but if you mess up on something she treats you like you're mentally challenged. She wasn't very understanding when I went through family issues and told me the wrong time for the final. #neveragain,0
Arevalo is a very temperamental individual. She doesn't like to be challenged and doesn't explain anything well. She runs through slides like its sometype of game and doesnt explain anything. She crams in material before exams and excepts you to guess whats on her mind. She is not considerate and not very present. and loves to single people out!,0
"I chose this class as an elective to finish my Masters Degree and just dropped it because the required reading was insane. I was sick the first two weeks of the class and got behind in reading and was never able to catch up. I took notes and highlighted and when it came time to take the test,nothing I had read was on there! I do not recommend.",0
"He is not nice with students. When we ask something, not in the class, but when we're doing the exercises, he is rude.",0
"knowledgable on the subject of econ, but is a terrible teacher. She is extremely disconnected from the class. She is open about using trick questions in her tests. Online assignments are hardly ever assigned, but worth 20% of your grade. I missed 2 on the first day of class and my grade has suffered 18% (86%-68%). Mid semester and still recovering.",0
"I dont know what to say about this course... It was DECENT but her Case Analysis and Reflection papers were RIDICULOUS beyond disbelief! Also, not to mention the quizzes she gives are HARD, like who gives 25 minutes for 25 questions!!! You cant even refer to the book or anything because her exams and quizzes are done in lock down browser. She OK!",1
"There is not much homework, but there are a few short papers. You do need to put effort into papers in order to get high marks. I found his lectures to be fairly boring, but informative. He does send out a ""what to know"" list before the exam, which is very helpful. This class is not an easy A per say, but it would take work to fail.",1
"Seemed like a nice enough lady but has no clue how to use the moodle system based in MSVU, only teacher at the mount that doesnt follow guidelines to post on moodle. Difficult marker when you do all your work on time and try your best, unclear about her expectations and expects you to read minds... would not recommend the course.",0
Casey is an amazing teacher. Instead of telling you to memorize formulas he actually shows you how and why they work. The grading in this class if very difficult. 55% of your grade is just chapter tests with no retakes. 30% is the final. And 15% homework. Attendance is not required but if you dont go you will not pass the tests.,1
"In this class I read an ""article"" of sorts and review a power point twice a week. The power point was super helpful and I probably wouldn't have done well without it. If you put in the work and turn things in on time you should get a good grade.",1
Dr. Mark is the worst professor I have ever had. She grades based on her personal feelings towards you and provides no clarification. There's a group assignment nearly every week. Any positive review on here is either written by herself or a student that she really likes somehow. She gives the most boring videos to watch and it's all horrible.,0
"The only teacher I've ever had that assigned a paper as ""read the book and write about anything""... and then counts off for not writing about the right thing.  He also said the word ""what"" out of context over 70 times in a 50 min class",0
"First two weeks was terrible but after the first Exam it got easier and easier. Prof. Simona gives a lot of Extra Credit. She is heavy with lectures. It was hard to listen to her long lectures at first, then I got used to it and was able to get a solid A.",1
"I will never again take this teacher again. Yes he sounds positive and I can tell he has passion for his teachings. BUT he canceled his class TWICE!!! YES TWICE!! (One for a whole week, and did I tell you? This was on a mid term week.) This professor has the audacity to go to JAPAN on our mid term week. I wish to God i have more characters to writ",0
Most unorganized prof i have ever seen. Makes it very hard to follow notes. does not prepare you for midterm/final at all. Labs dont make sense and not even the GAs know what theyre doing,0
"She is the most amazing professor that you will find at Sheridan. Her energy is so positive and she makes you want to go to class. She makes herself available to all her students and helps them succeed in class in their own ways! She takes any and all feedback, passing on information to her superiors that will help the students learn better.",1
"She's a great professor and if you're in college to learn, you'll find yourself loving the class. The course materials are not hard, yet you have to pay attention in class and do homework! She has her own textbook and it's a great resource not only for the class but later if you have to take the MCAT or PCAT also. Overall, she's really awesome!",1
"I've seen alot of negative comments on this site about this professor and feel I need to give him some props. Michel is an extremely hard working and dedicated instructor who is truly passionate about his profession. He won't let you slack off for a second, but if you make it through you'll realize how lucky you were to have such a great teacher.",1
"Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"inaccessible, disorganized, avoid at all cost. you will not learn anything from her class anything.",0
"Claudine is super sweet, and caring. She's always wiling to hear your thoughts and help you out.",1
This teacher is tough. Be prepared to learn everything on your own. She is an NP and expects you to know everything. Half of the things she teaches in class don't be on the test. She brags about herself and has a million and one life stories to tell you. If this class was not required for me to take I would of definitely dropped this class.,0
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
"Took Beba for 20th C. Fashion, Art & Culture. A really good class. I knew next to nothing and learned a lot. All papers (creative writing, midterm, final) have correlating PPTs. A brief quiz. Finding primary sources, especially for earlier decades, can be a bit of a pain, but it's doable. Check your grammar on your papers!! Def recommend.",1
VERY attentive and kind teacher.,1
"This guy doesn't cAre about the students, he doesn't have a heart and he will fail you if you don't pass his horrible class. Waste time, waste money he doesNt teach at all. He just read the slides. Don't take him if you wouldn't like to lose your money.",0
"Great lecturer. Class is pretty much from the book. Easy quizzes on assigned reading by contemporary author. However, I went to talk to him during his office hours. Absolutely rude and disinterested. I found him to be enjoyable in the classroom, but absolutely impersonal otherwise. Easy A, if you work for it on your own.",1
"Carageorge only cares about her opinion, and is a super hard grader. Yes, critique is important, but when you pour your heart and soul into a film and are pretty much told that it is garbage, that's when you start to lose hope. That's what happened to me. Not giving up on film school yet but boy was I close with Carageorge. Don't take her.",0
Dr. Lewan is one of the best teachers on campus at ACC.  She's a genuinely nice person and will be happy to talk to you during office hours about improving your writing. I took her english 121 class and enjoyed it so much I'm now taking 122 from her.  She'll definitely make you a better writer!,1
"grades heavily on attendance, and gives no extra credit, and your final grade is a 12-15 min group presentation. other than that shes a good teacher and lectures are meant to keep your attention",1
Very clear and easy to follow. Classes were easy but if you need more help Dr. Jon doesn't mind answering questions after class.,1
Was the class difficult? No. Was there work involved? Yes. Was it an easy 'A?' No.,1
Long chapters to read in a week's time yet quizzes have 10 questions over all the reading and there's review or a guide beforehand. Questions are also tricky. Does not give any lectures. Discussion participation is a must. This class made me feel incredibly jaded. There's no lectures or learning from the teacher it's just research and reading.,0
"Must attend classes, but lectures don't help much as he reads off a Powerpoint. Ignore him and read the textbook. Overall not a good teacher; he gets angry when you ask questions and his attempt to answer math- related questions only causes more confusion. Avoid if you can",0
"The amount of papers came in at about 1 a week but with three textbooks with multi-chapter reading, its easy to fall behind. And then when feedback is given its not as helpful as youd think. He knows what hes talking about but hes fully disconnected from a students schedule and ability to write a perfect paper, read everything and come in.",0
She is a great professor that gives you clues on how to remember the material. She gives extra credit which really helps boost your grade. She is more than willing to answer any questions. I got an A but I did have to study for it.,1
"""If you don't pass this class, you'll end up working at McDonald's for the rest of your life."" - Prof. Dewan There's 3 exams for the class, the final is 45% of your grade, that's huge! Prof. Dewan isn't the best a motivation so expect a daily roast when you come to class. Although, I will say this, if you work hard for your grade you'll get it.",0
"She doesn't know how to explain her assignments correctly. She expects her students to only work on her assignments and forgets we have other classes to work on. She also doesn't grade her assignments until the very end, so you will never know where you stand. Drop this class if you can.",0
"I had selected this teacher for my ECO 2023 but, the first two classes with this woman were enough to realize that she was a lost case for the class. She is rude and arrogant. I'm glad I  trusted my guts and dropped the class. After reading this reviews, I see I was not wrong.  Avoid her as much as you can.",0
"If you have never had any PR writing experience, at least you learn something. But if you've done an internship or been involved with Cardinal Comm, you will be told you're doing everything wrong if it's not ""her way"". Also she changes the assignments at the last minute and you want to smack your head on the table repeatedly every day. Good luck.",0
"Professor Higgins genuinely cares about her students. Although this was a large lecture class, she always did her best to greet students at the door and get to know our names. She is very passionate about women's health rights and makes sure her students know that she is there for us if we need her... for anything.",1
"He makes sure you know your material, but sometimes he is discouraging. I think his goal is to be the next Dr. Miller. He has an ego problem, and wants things his way or no way, Especially when it comes to senior seminar. His way or your grade will suffer",1
"Talks about the same things over and over, but has a exit slip each period over a chapter in the book so you cant skip all the time, otherwise I would. Unnecessary lectures and lots of class participation where everyone around the room says their answer.",0
Shes a nice teacher but overall very hard. The exams for this class are 50% of your grade!!! which is absurd. All exams are 85 minutes which is not enough time for some people. You have to keep track of 3 websites for her class.,1
"Henry is one of my favorite professors. He is friendly, humorous, and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend!",1
She was my best professor this semester. She is really funny and helpful. Would take again!,1
"Took this class online over the summer at community college for an easy gen ed.  Figured this would be a cool class to take and easy.  No.  Doug takes this class so seriously - like it is the most important thing in the world.  It is a summer class, at community college, and photography.  Complete waste of time and way more work than it should be.",0
I liked this class.  It was easy and had hardly any take-home homework since we did it all in class.  Final exam was super easy.  Friendly guy.  Definitely take him.,1
"Great teacher. The more you prepare and participate in this class, the more you will get out of it. Really opened up my way of thinking in regards to school law. Tough class, a lot of work, but I learned so much.",1
"Don't take him!! It's difficult to verbalise just how tedious he is-like a recording of an unfunny Mr. Rogers narrating lectures in slow-motion. Very unclear about requirements, however he spends 20 mins at the beginning of each class repeating the date of every quiz and assignment. Treats you like a child-don't get caught doodling or looking away.",0
"If you know how to write a paper then you will do very well in this course because its not college level material. A month into the course we learned what a topic sentence and what a thesis statement were for a whole week. She also says ""pacific"" instead of ""specific"" which makes me not take her opinion on how to use the English language seriously.",0
Tests are rough but gives you a lot of ways to bring your grade up. as long as you attend class you'll do fine. she can be difficult to understand sometimes but just ask her to repeat herself and shell say it clearer. she also writes everything down so you can read clearly what she says. always willing to help and really wants you to do well!,1
"scary class at first, you must work hard, but Prof is very fair - you will learn a lot in this class. There's never a dull moment in this class either!",1
This class was ridiculous! I am a senior and a psychology major and this is by far the most difficult and boring class I have taken at UT. I highly recommend not taking this class!!!,0
So far the class seems to be not difficult. Participate a lot and youll get an A in participation. Did not do any readings and so far I have an A in the class. Some writing assignments but its easy. Only one real test. Used her power point slides and got an A. Would deff recommend for a GPA booster.,1
"My experience was that there was too little clarity or teaching of concepts. Again again we had to struggle on our own and a lot of students just ended up failing because they felt disconnected and could do nothing about it. He picks his favorites and assumes others too lazy or and do not want to put in the work. Its not hard, its the teaching.",0
i would not recommend taking this class if you are new to writing or not very good at writing. he provides very little guidance and does not like to respond to emails. His lectures were just him giving Purdue OWL links and expecting you to figure the rest out. all of his assignments were for completion and he provided little to no feedback.  ,0
awesome! my kind of professor! she makes a difficult subject very easy to understand,1
"I know the class is not easy for some econ students who don't not have enough background in claculasbut Pro. Sethia tried her best to review the material students need to know for the exam. She is really nice and if you go to class, take notes and finish your homework, you should be fine with this class.",1
"Caldwell is a super interesting professor if you yourself really care about literature. He uses the readings to talk about almost anything that comes to his mind: science, politics, gender relationships, etc. His grading of papers can be confusing sometimes, but if youre a good writer, you can easily get anywhere from a B to an A in his class.",1
"At first I hated this class, but he actually grows on you.  It has been an interesting class, and I've learned a bunch.",1
Take this class to get credit for a plan letter knowing we signed up for a introduction class. Then he says if you have a brain youll get b or better and talks politics half the time. He grades and talks to us like this is a class in my major and I will be taking religion for the next 3 years. Hes got to understand were taking it for a letter.,0
SO. MUCH. CONTENT. You are essentially teaching yourself with this online class and in my opinion this class is probably better taken in person. Reaching out for help does nothing and feedback is very generic. The only positive is that Prof. Kumari is an easy grader on discussion posts but that only helps so much when the tests and quizzes are hard,0
very unprepared  and doesnot no how to teach he maybe very knowledgeable on the subject but doesn't know how to give us knowledge on the subject,0
"Pas assez interactif. Très linéaire. Il me semble très passionné et crédible, il a également un bon vocabulaire mais n'est pas capable de nous faire participer et s'intéresser a la matière. J'ai l'impression d’assister a une messe...",0
After reading reviews on here I was scared to take his class. Glad I took it though. He's an amazing professor. Read syllabus before asking questions. He responds quickly. 3 assignments each week. His quizzes are based off his videos. His videos are extremely helpful. He's smart and knows what he's talking about. I would take him again.,1
"She is a great person, don't get me wrong, but she is way too harsh. She is accessible outside of class and is very personal with her students. She grades you on things you don't think you're being graded for. For example, a group evaluation. She will doc points off for grammar when you don't think she is. Just always be cautious of everything.",0
DONT TAKE IT WITH FOWLE..SHE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR!,0
"Never considered myself a history person, but Dr. Kuss really made it interesting and made me want to learn more. I have read several books that he suggested in class and have really enjoyed learning more about history.",1
Class was boring. I felt like I was having to teach myself the material out of the book,0
"Amazing,best teacher I've had in UWF!",1
This class has been relatively easy and enjoyable. I would highly recommend taking Professor Hippensteel. He gives great feedback on assignments and the workload for this course is very fair.,1
"Scheduled another prof. and got Nicastro. If you want to get yelled at and feel stupid for an entire physics lab take Nicastro. As the chair of the department, he was teaching a very low level physics lab and was taking it wayyy too seriously.",0
"Extremely unclear as to what he wanted from our papers, would routinely give out low grades without explaining why, in class reading assignments made no sense as they were all from Victorian England. In asking us to write a research paper he made it impossible to change our topic even if we wanted to early on. ",0
One of the best professor's I've had so far in college. He's a hoot and will keep you paying attention during lectures even if they are over an hour long.,1
"Would not ever recommend. He knows his stuff but he expects everyone to get it as easy as he does. Gets upset/irritated when you have questions and dont understand. He will mock you or try to belittle you, Im a good student come to class every day on time and hes still a pain.",0
He is a very very tough grader. You need to figure out what he wants. Even if you ask him he will say the same thing over and over again until you basically give up and just do what you understood. Horrible at giving directions on papers. He never gives As. If you get a B+ in some of the papers you are lucky. DO NOT TAKE HIM. KILLS YOUR GPA.,0
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
This class was one of the most disorganized classes I have ever been in.  She tells you one thing and does another or marks in another way.  I don't recomend this class to anyone.,0
"Professor Stewart truly cares about his students, if youre struggling just ask him for help he wants you to learn. Theres a lot of homework and assignments and such but it all helps you learn the material.",1
Trust me. AVOID. Worst experience ever.,0
"Benny is a wonderful professor and if you put in the time and ask for help, he'll make sure you're not left behind. He helped me immensely throughout the course. PHYS282 is hard by nature, but Benny made a serious, ongoing effort to help his students learn as much as possible.",1
Karen Dendy is by far one of the best English teachers I have ever had! She is very organized and teaches the students well. She is very understandable to international students who don't have the English experience American students have. She will help you and check over your grades with you throughout the semester. PLEASE TAKE DENDY! I loved her.,1
Mr hoover is GREAT!!! he is just a down to earth guy that just sets things out for you in layman's terms. has a very good way of explaining things and you can tell he cares about your success! highly recomended!,1
"His class is very enjoyable, interesting, and makes me want to learn about history. He's a very likable guy and is really funny. he tells the wildest stories that tie into the lesson. The exams are posted every three weeks and the reflection papers are easy if you pay attention and take notes. great guy and great class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Even though he has 40+ years of experience he is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He goes too fast, doesn't care if you get it or not, is demeaning, and DOES NOT know the definition of a teacher.  He is one who thinks just because he gets it everyone should.  I had to practically beg him to explain (teach) me.  I hated going and cried A LOT!",0
"Takes points off for the wrong hue of yellow. If creative choices do not align with her own, points are lost. Spent most of class on non-class topics. Breaks lasted upwards of 45 min., covering new topics with 5 min. left of class, running over. Welcomed outside students into her class to interrupt lectures. Take with someone else.",0
he is annoying and doesn't care about anyone opinions,0
"Not a fan of this prof. He rips your papers apart, and gives you a ton of homework. All he does is lecture and laugh at his own jokes. Choose a different prof to fill your requirement.",0
"This is probably an amazing class in person. Online it is pretty bad. First off, she used someone else's video lectures and worksheets. She didn't teach a single thing. We had mandatory group meeting in place of class. The actual work is very easy except on Sunday's expect to have 6 or 7 worksheets due. This makes getting the work in difficult.",0
You gotta WORK for your grade in this class 3 midterms and a final. Prof has at least 1 essay per test and final is cumulative. Difficult class but if u do the work u can pass,1
She is an amazing professor and teacher. She truly cares for her students and wants all of them to succeed. You do have a few speeches as well as several test but the test are easy as long as you study. I wish I could take her again!!!,1
He gets us,1
"Tom is a really nice person, though he may come off strong at first. If you want to do well in his class, you have to participate in discussions, but as long as you back up your answer with evidence, there is no wrong answer. Lots of reading but the tests directly cover what you learned. I learned a great deal and it was a very interesting class.",1
"the professor doesn't put much effort into her pedagogy and did not organize her class very well. the whole syllabus didn't make sense. she's not incredibly helpful and doesn't provide students with much evaluation. did not engage students but talked at us in long monologues and then expected a good discussion. overall, not a good teacher.",0
Very rude teacher. Never gives a direct answer when you ask a question.  The work isn't hard but I don't like being treated like a 16/17 year old.  It's a lot of work but not hard. She gets really mad when you don't attend class. Not worth the stress for me.,0
The class is very irrelavent to English and Literature and the professor also uses biases in his teachings and towards students. The class is very boring.,0
"I took her for bench step aerobics and she was great!  Very encouraging and she is great at teaching the class.  She is lenient about missing class, but don't abuse that luxury because she will lower your grade by letter if you miss too many classes or show up late too many times.  She's awesome! No book or any extra purchases for this class.",1
"I loved this class. Danish is a difficult language to learn, but he teaches it in a way that really makes sense. He made me look forward to come to class every day & speak, even though it's a hard language. He made the language exciting, and really helped us fall in love with Denmark and the culture. Plus he's hilarious, so that was fantastic too!",1
"This professor is awful. Her lectures vs. her homeworks/worksheets vs. her textbooks are completely off. She teaches you like she expects you to know what is already going on, and she can't be bothered with questions. The only good thing about this class is that it's a ""free class"" meaning you don't have to buy a textbook.",0
"He takes this course way too seriously, the TA's are super strict on grading. I took this course simply to fulfill a summer credit and it will most likely bring my GPA down which is not what I wanted. I got a better grade in Managerial Accounting, rather than this course.",0
"Horrible professor. I would say in my 5 years at WestConn that she is the second worst professor I've ever had. Her lectures give NO information, her exams are not even based on her power points. Out of the entire class, on our exams, the highest exam grade was a 73. Also, she is very rude and judgmental. No information learned. Horrible.",0
"Nice teacher, but make sure to join every class. She takes attendance at the beginning of class and it does affect your grades. Tests are a bit heavy for the hour given, homework is a decent amount on the textbook site. Many group breakout rooms each class along with projects. Always asks for volunteers so be ready to speak",1
I have always been interested in history due to my professors and he fits the bill perfectly!  He is a great lecturer and keeps class light and always upbeat.  I recommend him to everyone.  Just pay attention to his lectures and you'll pass!  Good luck!,1
"I think pollack was great.  I enjoyed his class and the discussions.  His class does require you to write a couple of papers, but that is what you do in college.  I also don't think Pollack's class was that difficult. I earned an A.",1
Dr. Nussbaum is an amazing professor! Extremely helpful and nice. I wish he taught more then this class!,1
Best professor I have had at UCSB. Yes it's a hard class but that's because you can't just memorize slides anymore to receive a good grade. Sears emphasizes the application of what you learn and your analytical and logical problem solving skills. If you understand the concepts you will do well in this class.,1
"he's an o.k. professor. not much work but quizzes, and they're pretty long and timed. u can search up answers but it doesn't always help. extra credit is offered.",0
"Professor Girgis is a very nice lady, but lectures were boring. Attendance was not required, but if you watch the lectures you will be fine with the weekly assignments. Exams are straight from study guides so it is easy to get a good grade. Also, group projects are a crucial part of the class and she makes the groups for you.",1
Do not take this class,0
"Pire proff que j'ai eu a l'université!!!! Si tu vas au cour ta un point de participation par cour (10 %) il explique vraiment mal. Melange les conceptsn, ne repond pas bien au question, parle toujours de son facebook pis d'écologie (voiture hybride)... Avec ce prof c'est comme si vous suivez un cour a distance!!!!!",0
no.,0
"Professor Tancredi is easygoing. There can be a lot of material to cover, but his lectures are very straight-forward. He usually gives extra credit if you see a live show that he recommends on the weekends. Attending class is not necessarily mandatory, but you may miss out on a lot of material. Only use pencil in this class. Seriously.",1
"If you think you'd struggle in  the intro to statistics course, I recommend you Mr. Tripp. He breaks things down so that you can understand. The HW and quizzes are online. He gives you 2 attempts for the quizzes and if you don't do well you can ask him for another chance. He gives plenty of practice in class to prepare you for the exam.",1
"I have to agree with some of the other students comments below me. Although the required text for this class was the 3rd (e) of Berk's Lifespan Development, some of the questions on the test were direct phrases out of the 2nd edition or from a chapter other than the one we were being tested on. Other than that, I was happy taking 118 with Dr. Orme.",1
"I dropped 2 classes and almost got fired from my job to study and STILL did not pass. ENORMOUS amounts of homework! I highly recommend taking it with a different professor. I was warned before class began and I stuck with it. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE! I hear the professor with the last name starting with a ""J"" is phenomenal! Get out NOW!",0
"I loved Emari so much as a teacher and as a human She was always there for you and cared about each individual in the course, and got to know everyone. even over zoom:) I guarantee that as long as you show up and attempt the homework, you will get an automatic A Side note, she goes by Emari and we can connect on that level, as she anyone u need",1
I took his psychology 100 class and it was amazing ! I missed a test and he allowed me to make it up. Just by doing the homework and the small writing assignments he assigns youre guaranteed to pass the class. He is really funny and shows some cool videos before class (:,1
"The class average for each of her exams was 80%, probably because 20% of the test material is not covered in class. There are a lot of preparation assignments for this class as well. She tries to be relevant and funny, but is still dry and boring in lectures.",1
"She said some inspiring words to me after class one day and it's the reason I am getting my masters 7 years later.  I admire her passion for what she teaches but she expects that same passion from her students. If you don't have it don't expect to slide by. Her classes are by no means ""easy"" but, I personally, learned about life from her.",1
Hes good people through and through.,1
"His English is beyond broken, so lectures are totally useless.  Overemphasizes pop quizzes (50% of your grade!) and I feel he enjoys to hand out extremely low grades.  His grading criteria is based on fluff - he wont be able to explain to you why he took off x points on a HW.  Overall a truly awful experience and you will suffer all semester long. ",0
"Professor Sgro was great! The lectures can get boring and feel dragged out, but I would take her again. She is always ready to answer/help clarify any confusion. You can tell she is passionate in what she teaches. No tests and she gives easy assignments that give many chances to pass the class.",1
He is my hero! He gets to know the students and adapts to their needs. He does not have a mean bone in his entire body. He is of spoken and adorable.,1
"Honestly just feels like he doesn't care about students and receives a lot more joy from getting to take points away from students than seeing them succeed. Terrible lecturer, decent slides, understood nothing from him talking, most things from the slides when he didn't use 500 slides to make a simple point.",0
"She is very disorganized that it just blows my mind. Gives lab reports like it's Christmas, like chill, your class is not the only class I'm taking during the summer and I have other responsibilities that are more important then her ineffectual labs.",0
"This professor is one of the worst I've ever had. Very little in class instruction, we were expected to teach ourselves while she sat back and recovered from her illness. So many assignments and so little time to do them. No instruction either, she expects great work and expects everyone knows how to do what she is teaching already.",0
The BEST teaher I have had thus far. He keeps yuou laughing the entire time. You will never become bored in this computer class. Just be sure to do ALL of the homework assignments and the majority of them are easy. Really enjoyed the class! Take him!,1
"ABORT! ABORT! Has made me work harder than all of my classes combined.  She's a nice person, but you don't want her grading you.  LOTS of graded homework questions every week that'll make your head spin after hours of doing them. Even if your time is well managed, you still wont catch a break. You basically self teach yourself  the entire course.",0
"I would not take her again for public speaking. She gets very political and judgmental if you do not have the same political beliefs as her. She should be teaching debate or political science. If you agree with her views you would love her but if not, it sucks. A lot of wasted time in class but heavy questioned tests so you have to pay attention!!",0
"Do NOT take this class online to fulfill any type of credit, USF offers this class with another professor who is a lot friendlier. The class has a very complicated set up where most assignments are graded via peer review. Theres no mid term or final exam but you do write multiple essays that are 40% of your grade, you peer reviewing is 10 points.",0
"I'm sure she is good at what she does in-person, but as for her online class, it's a disaster. I have no idea how to navigate the blackboard page for her class and even the syllabus doesn't match what she actually wants us to do. Just a lot of miscommunication and disorganization.",0
Do not take her.  Very disorganized and takes weeks to grade assignments.,0
"Do not take her, take another professor f possible. she does not even teach correctly, it is more of a self learning class",0
"Did not pass his class the first time, I got a D. Second time I got a B. If you dont attend class you will NOT pass. If you dont study hard for midterms or finals you will fail them. Take notes on everything and study them any chance you have. I never got 100% on my homework assignments, he would always dock off a point for something ridiculous.",1
"He gives a lot of tests, non mandatory homeworks and is a tough grader but he is a great teacher and is always willing to work with you",1
"Hellquist is the best. Every class was extremely interesting, the videos we watch in class/the ones he posts online will get you interested in topics you didn't even know you'd enjoy. Learned more in this class than all my college classes combined. Take it!",1
She was really good at explaining the problems and the material. She asks a lot of critical thinking questions.  Is was always available to answer my questions. I thought she was a great teacher! I would take her again.,1
"She is nice, but most of the times she would talk about the Cubs game. She tries to make the class fun, and time is not efficiently spent. At times she was not helpful, and would not recommend to everyone. ",0
Great Professor that you will learn a lot from especially if you are interested in a career in the medical field. I recommend her class to everyone. I got more out of this class than I did any other class I have taken while in my undergrad.,1
"I TOOK HER CLASS ONLINE. AS LONG AS YOU KEEP UP WITH READING THE BOOK YOU'LL PASS THE CLASS. THERE ARE WEEKLY QUIZZES, DISCUSSION BOARD POSTS THAT YOU HACVE TO DO, AND EXAMS ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE BOOK. OVER ALL IT WAS A TYPICAL ONLINE CLASS, I WISH I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR HER LECTURE.",1
"Took online course.  He outsources the lectures to videos someone did years ago.  His notes are horrible, terrible spelling, pieced together.  He gives little time during testing.  Impossible to get it all done. Doesn't respond to emails, EVER.  The only thing HE actually does is grade the exams and screw you on your final grade.",0
"Class was garbage just like the quarter before, just as unforgiving and overall didn't teach anything well. He graded the homework at the same percentage as the tests and the final was only 20% of your grade. Absolute joke, stay clear of this man.",0
Feedback is not helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking him.,0
"Sweetest person I have ever met in my life. Great, caring and loving teacher.",1
"For the first two weeks of class he rambled about non sense. Then for the rest of the semester he splits you into groups and you teach the class the book.  He doesn't teach anything. Each group has to present their chapter for two weeks at a time, and once you get through all the groups, you start over.  Huge time commitment outside of class.",0
I barely attended class and got away with it because I read everything she told me to read. I didn't know there was a textbook but I read all the articles she talked about and got notes from friends. She was hilarious and talks about pop culture a lot. This course is easy.,1
"Bruh I feel so played...I thought our average was low enough for her to change the grading scale, but apparently she didn't. Her class is easy enough to get a B, but you need to barely miss anything to get an A. Her tests are too tedious to get a solid A. Try to avoid her, but she isn't the worst. She's a nice and caring person though",0
"I found the class to be very monotonous and dry, but it had more to do with the material than with the prof. I thought sessions got repetitive at times and often went much longer than seemed necessary. The tests were more challenging than I anticipated, but I also scored better than I anticipated, so he seemed fair. Read your book/handouts!",1
"Just not an easy person to get along with, which is disappointing because she is a professor afterall",0
Hinshaw is extremely passionate about the subject he teaches and wants to transmit that passion to his students. His tests are easy and straightforward and his lecture style is unique but interesting. Great great professor!,1
"She is a horrible teacher. Not receptive to criticism at all, speeds through the presentations like a game, will have the biggest portion of the test (open response) about stuff you hadn't gotten to. If you attempt to push back on her she will talk to you passive-aggressively. I loved bio so much and she has left me hating it.",0
"Do Not! I repeat Do Not take this Professor under any circumstances! Please try to avoid him! His Syllabus is not clear, he does not give you extra credit, he has no compassion for his work or his students and he will give you lectures about how getting a degree dont matter when it clearly does! Because he wouldnt have one two Or three degrees!",0
"I don't know why so many people recommend him. He is a good teacher but not fit for me. His slide just the pics from book. Not help at all. And his test is really hard, tiny little things from book. U just need remember a lot of terms then useless. And his study guide is useless too. Maybe 20% is in the test. If you want to get A, self learning !",1
"Professor Calkins was one of my favorite English teachers I've ever had. Her homework is really easy and tolerable. Once it gets into writing the research paper, she assigns more writing assignments which is where time management is key. She wants to see her students succeed and will always be there to help. Gives great extra credit opportunities!",1
"Good professor. Material must also be studied on your own time as well, which may be why some people are giving negative feedback. Course is not that easy as it is and he can't really be blamed for that. Willing to help you, all you need to do is ask. ",1
"Very Good Teacher, Clear and Interesting! A good class to take!",1
Though he is a nice person I hate his teaching style. I prefer teachers to teach us the material in class and then go home and read over what we learned about in the book. He expects us to read first and then he skips around the chapter without really talking about any topic. He grades hard and doesn't give very good feedback either.,0
"Prof. Miura moved very slowly through lecture, so it was often hard to stay focused. He was a tough grader because he required all definitions and explanations to be exactly like his (oddly-worded) defs/explanations. Exams were conceptual and inconsistent with lecture material. It was helpful to read the textbook outside of class!",0
"You go in blind to all of the exams and final. There is no study guide. When asked, she does not even divulge how many questions there will be and if it is multiple choice. All she says is that whatever is in the book, lecture or previous courses is fair game. It is a incredibly difficult class and extinguished my interest in accounting. ",0
Extremely boring but also extremely easy. You decide if it's worth it.,1
"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!! Professor is very knowledgeable about Accounting but because it comes so easy for him he is terrible at teaching it to people who have never done it before. Half my class is confused & at the moment and I am having to pay for an outside Tutor to learn what I don't in class. He does NOT explain things well and goes very fast.",0
"Professor Killough is a very tough professor. I put lots of effort into her assignments and in return got poor grades with little to no useful or helpful feedback. She is also not easily approachable, as to when she responded to a question I had it left me feeling like I had no actual help, or I should have somehow known it already.",0
"DO NOT take any course with him like ever. In his own mind he thinks that we already know 80% of what is expected in this course. He do not really come prepared for the class and all he does is repeat Prof Michiel Smid's (the OG prof of 2804) notes in the class. He do not care about students, too cocky to reply to emails and not reachable as well.",0
10/10 would recommend. Really knew the topic and brought in guest speakers almost every week which was really interesting. Tests were open book - take notes on the lectures too!! Easy grader on the midterm paper,1
"I would highly recommend this class if you enjoy putting in quality work and do not mind getting a grade that reflects otherwise. She is a nice professor/person, but her grading is subjective. Her guidelines for essays/homework assignments are arbitrary. It is ashame that she grades in this manner because I liked the class, but became discouraged.",1
"hated her, UNCLEAR, pulls questions on tests out of her you know what. RUN the other way!!!!",0
"Professor Hill isn't the best teacher, her class is pretty boring, but her tests are almost all of the clicker questions from class and the online quizzes. If you study and come to class, you will do fine in the course.",0
He gives incredibly long lectures that are not engaging. NR001 was a joke. Not enjoyable at all. I would recommend that if you want to be in Rubenstein that you start freshman year as undeclared and then transfer into Rubenstein sophomore year. That way you only have to take one class as a transfer student as opposed to NR001 and NR002.,0
"Kathleen is a super nice women. She's talkative and clearly passionate about writing. She's very helpful with any assignments she assigns and clear about the assignment criteria. Resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, thank you emails, and job related documents are created and revised in this class. I would personally recommend.",1
He is a super nice guy! However his class was show up and do you lab that he posted. No real lecture time at all.,0
"Professor Wallace is great! He explains complex topics in a clear and organized manner. Tests can be tricky, and I highly recommend going to Wallace's office hours because he will explain any problem you're struggling with. This class isn't easy, but Wallace's manner of teaching makes it very doable and less stressful!",1
"Course wasn't that difficult, but it was really demanding. 5 projects, which are easy, but instructions are kind of indirect. There's rubrics, but they don't help much. Quite a talker, too. By week 3 I was really irritated with the aggressive lecture method. Extremely nice woman, just a bit excessive at times. Course does help in the real world.",1
I think most of these ratings are good because when he was younger he actually knew what he was talking about. This man needs to retire. He is a very harsh grader and can not be reached through email.,0
"Mr. Freda is the worst professor I have ever had. He is miserable. He will call you out if he sees your phone anywhere within eye range of you, he randomly calls on people just to yell at them that their answer is wrong, and he makes you feel dumb every time. His quizzes are very tough and the tests aren't any easier. Good luck, you'll need it.",0
"Ning is confusing and skips around from one topic to the next without continuity. He doesn't explain concepts in physics, just teaches equations. You'll be lucky if he understands your questions or even acknowledges that you have a question. The class is an easy A though-all in-class worksheets and one out of three tests dropped.",0
"Overall this class was very fair and very easy, you will enjoy the professors teachings as well as the topics you learn in class. There are 12 worksheets quite a few in class participation papers, 2 essays and presentations. For the 3 exams she allows you to use notecards on them and as long as you know the general information you should be fine.",1
Do not do it...Reconsider...Read All the literature on this site and share the information with other students. This class will ruin any semester. I would take a summer class before ever taking one of her classes. Seriously!!!,0
I think Mrs. Bowlin is a great teacher. I really enjoyed her class this year. She had us work in groups and I made some new friends on top of learning about Sociology. Thank you Mrs. Bowlin!,1
"Marketing 190 is basically like MKT 230 except for Marketing majors only. This class was a hybrid so half online half in class. Very easy to pass. The only thing that stinks is having to dress business casual but usually she doesn't care after the first few weeks. Over all, she's a great professor and class was fun.",1
"Took a Grad Assistant for pre calc and got a D, retook it with Mr. Justice and got an A-, took him for Calc I, got an A- again. I am going to keep taking him for every class I can. He teaches efficiently,  and is a very fair grader. He even gave us a take home exam. 10/10 recommend.",1
"Dr. Hart's lectures were awful. She went off on tangents that had nothing to do with lecture, and crammed whatever she could when she realized lecture was almost over. Textbook was online which is garbage in for a biology class. Disorganized with quizzes and test questions, including lab. Definitely don't recommend.",0
"Good luck with these tests. They are horrible and almost impossible to pass. The coding part is easy, but the multiple choice is hard. I definitely recommend you to NOT take this class. Choose a different class. Yes it's online, but it's not worth it. You're better off with audio production or something else. This class is difficult for no reason.",0
"She is a moody and nasty person.  She tells you what changes she wants on a first draft, you make them exactly how she wants them, but she corrects her own changes. She has her favorites and will allow them unfair advantages on other students. You never know what mood you'll catch her in, and your grades are basically prey to her mood of the hour.",0
Good teacher ! Very organized person who cares for his students. His lecture's notes are very important for the midterm and final exam. I would suggest him 100%.,1
"He is amazing and accommodating and he understands that students are overwhelmed so he works around that. His goal is to teach you and help you understand rather than just throwing work at you. He is a great professor and if you do the hw and the practice q's he send, you'll pass with flying colors.",1
"TAKE another professor even if you have to wait for next semester. I devoted at least 6-8 hrs daily on chem. You teach yourself. Tests are not similar to worksheets/quizzes as she says. Tests are specifically structured to confuse & throw you off track, no matter how much you study, even switches the periodic table day of exam.",0
Lectures seem are long but once the class gets involved time seems to fly by. Prof. Aragona is a great professor. I walk away from the class everyday learning something new every day.,1
"This class is not easy unless you pay attention to the lectures. Everything he says are basically the answers for the midterms & final. So if you really want to get an A, go to every lecture and pay close attention to what he says & takes notes.",1
Highly Recommended!! Love her teaching style. Lectures are very straightforward and interesting! She cares and wants students to be succeeded. Midterm & Final are easy if you truly understand the materials. She always responds to emails quickly so don't hesitate to ask questions!,1
"They made all the FIGs sound really interesting and geared toward freshmen, so I decided to take his class. Big mistake. Nothing he talks about in class is on the test. And the tests are ridiculous. Unless you have a pretty good grasp on politics and your own views in general, i would not take his class. Lots o' rambling.",0
Just took her History 102 class summer 2. She is great and very friendly.  Attendence is a must and listen to her as she reviews the hando. No books to buy!!! She is really good to responding to emais. Overall I think she is very fair with the way she runs her class.,1
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
"Very kind man. His lectures can be a bit boring as he can be slow, so expect the class to fall behind. However, his tests are not difficult as long as you know how to do recitation problems. His test problems appear to be taken straight out of the textbook problems. He even has extra credit, and claims that there is a curve.",1
"I have taken her three times now. Great lady, always brings treats to class. The classes she teaches are usually meant to be the ""easy"" classes but she expects you to work for your grade. I've spent more time and effort on some of her classes than I had in classes that I cared about. Many other professors were supposedly much easier.",0
Just No,0
"Ms. D is awesome! she rekindled my love for sciences. She's a sweet lady, she is very thorough and her tests are pretty easy as long as you pay attention to your notes and her lectures. Would def recommend !",1
"I took his gen chem class in fall of 2019. Im not the best student to have due to lack of motivation, but after going to office hours to get more in depth help, my grade started to go up from a low C to a high B. He was hilarious in class, always tries to include other students, and help everyone that WANTS to be helped.",1
"Mathi clearly knows how to do Calculus. However, her delivery is poor IMO. Her accent is heavy and makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. For example, when she says ""8"" she will instead say ""yayyyt"", or instead of ""A"" she will say ""yayyy"". This isn't to be rude, but rather totally honest about my experience with her.",0
His lectures are pretty good and he explains concepts well. Homeworks and exam questions can be tough and thought-provoking at times. He doesn't provide solutions but you can go to his office to discuss. Although not an entirely approachable guy... Exams are open-book and usually similar to questions on old exams. ,1
"He is a great teacher. However, sometimes his explanations can be overly complicated for the easy things. But for the hard things, he explains them very well. He did everything he could to help the students out (might I say even during a test)",1
"Brad is a good teacher. If you listen to what he says and follow along during the lectures and exercises theres almost no reason why you shouldn't get over a 90. He literally walks you through every task you need to do and provides great pre-exam exercises. The exams are straight forward too, he's not trying to trick you.",1
Not a bad teacher and was pretty easy. If you show any effort in the class you will at least get a C.,1
"Great person but terrible professor. Just comes to class and writes proofs on the board straight from the book, doesn't really care for developing intuition and big-picture understanding. Very fast-paced: it feels like she only teaches for the top 10% of the class. The class has no TA, no practice exams, no additional resources. Duke Math is evil.",0
"Maloy is a nice person who seems to mean well, but she cannot teach at all. Her exams are impossible. Sure, she curves, but if she was teaching properly she wouldn't need to. She doesn't update grades,ever. Still waiting on grades from 2 months ago :) she loves to give out homework but will not teach anything to help with said busy work. Enjoy :)",0
"She is a really nice person but as a professor she is not that great. If you have to take her make sure you study ahead. She is very disorganized and her test are really hard especially the multiple choice part, the essay part is pretty easy but multiple choices are worth more so make sure you study and read the questions and choices slowly.",0
Professor Delius is great and I'd recommend her to anyone who is taking urbanism for core class. She totally understands its a core class and keeps it interesting! Her exams are more fun than they are hard and this class went by teaching me without much work load! Take her!,1
"Absolutely Ridiculous. Way to much reading its as if she thinks that her class should be the center of our universe. We read 2 3/4 books, the whole books in one fricken semester. She is not helpful. I would never recommmend someone to take her. If you get her as a professor switch classes immediately.",0
"Maureen has a specific set of hoops that she expects her students to jump through, do that carefully and you'll be fine. Follow the syllabus schedule carefully, read her handouts, speak up in class and don't take things personally. Maureen cares a lot and wants all of her students to do well, she is more than willing to meet outside of class time.",1
The best teacher that I ever had in my academic life.,1
"You are expected to already know linear algebra, dirac notation and any other math required for quantum mechanics. He will half (at most) work through problems or concepts and then not understand why you aren't ""getting it"". He can be a nice guy and will take some extra time during office hours. He can be short and condescending.",0
He grades way to harshly for an intro class.,0
"He is a very good professor. He did not lecture in class but if you needed help he was super eager to help you. Since the class was online and let us have our space, he stays up front and his tests are easy. He's a great professor when you need help and when you don't. He did not take attendance but if you get too far behind he'll withdrawal you.",1
"His a good professor really funny, pretty chill and will help you develop your projects,really good feedback and is there for you to ask questions. Cares about your work he wants to see improvement and thought, and will call out if people are slacking. Feels a little useless to come to class sometimes but overall, great teacher, funny, good class",1
Don't take class with her. She was the worst professor that I had at foothill college.,0
"Dr. Brown is one of the worst professors NC State has to offer. His lectures are absolutely useless in which he emphasizes stuff that does not matter I would extend a whole semester than to take a class with him again If you are unfortunate enough to take him, I would suggest treating the class as an online class and learn the concept from YouTube.",0
"I have learned so much from this professor! She does an amazing job at making sure we all understand the chapters. Plus, she has experience so her occasional stories are always interesting. She also goes over the midterm and final study guides with us to help us study. She is very sweet and I enjoyed the class very much. ",1
Professor Keefe is an awesome professor. She truly cares about her students and she does amazing job at teaching during her lectures. Another perk is she gives an extra credit point for every class you attend so make sure to attend each lecture.,1
This professor is spastic and overworked. She does not reply to e mails and has no office hours. Her lectures offer no help on how to teach science and she is often side tracked with off topic stories. She grades hard on senseless things like reflections. Her assignments are not clearly defined. The class was not relevant. I was disappointed.,0
"very passionate about the subject matter, works in the feild so he knows what he's doing, very willing to help",1
Worst professor ever. He uses slides in his lecture that are dated 1999 and do not match up with his book which the homework and test questions come from.  He is arrogant and shoots down all questions asked.  Also keeps referring to taking Econ classes which I didn't and was not required.  He does not teach this as an Introduction to Finance.,0
"This class is a decent amount of work, very manageable, however the teacher is very rude.",0
"This class taught me a lot, but a lot of it was useless. It requires a lot of work outside of class, including several papers. You have to pay close attention to the lectures or you won't do well on the quizzes. Be prepared to listen to an hour and fifteen minutes of mostly uninteresting discussions.",0
He was a really nice person but wasn't a good teacher. He had trouble explaining stuff. Since this was my first calc class I do not have a good understanding of calc 1 and now am in calc 2 trying to play catch up. Test's are worth a lot of your grade and in calc 1 somebody else makes the test so he doesn't know what will be on them.,0
"A friend recommended that I take this class, and so I did and I do not regret it. He is an amazing and brilliant professor. The class owns you for an entire semester, but it is doable with the normal course load from other classes. If you are pre-law, then this class prepares you well for reading and critical thinking.",1
DO NOT TAKE GENETICS AT UIC. It is way harder than it needs to be and they make sure you don't succeed.,0
I had been a student of Marys over 15 years ago and have continued to find myself analyzing issues that may not have been possible without our critical thinking discussions and research. Its important to know the span of a semester does not contain what you can learn/apply; the class plants the seed. A prof I would be delighted to see again.,1
"Out of the three profs I had for bis 2c, she was the worst. She taught the plant section and made me hate plants. Her study guides are useless trash and she will test you on a detail that was not even emphasized during lectures. Her slides are often disorganized and makes things very confusing by using her stylus and writing on her tablet. AVOID.",0
terrible at giving feedback. do not recommend,0
"Dr. Miller was an easy A, but his class can be very boring. He tends to go off topic a lot, almost every week we would have a class discussion about President Trump even though it didn't have to do with the class. We watched two movies and some videos. One presentation on anything you want, and a 1 page final paper about the class. Easy A.",1
Native speaker. Upbeat personality. Very engaging. Uses Harry Potter and fashion shows to teach.,1
"very good professor, very helpful if you ask for help she will help. attendance is mandatory!",1
She is such a caring teacher. She does give a lot of extra points.,1
"Dr. Brown was an amazing professor. The guy is hilarious and will keep you entertained. The class was 3 hours long, but it went by quick. I took it for only half the semester as well. You have 2 test and they are very easy. Quizzes every class but it's extremely easy. He gives you handouts and there is 1 project. Take him at all cost.",1
"He's incredibly boring and the material was dry. Read off his notes most of the time and attempted to make it interesting sometimes but not very well.. Could have taught myself better. Tests were pretty straightforward. Makes you use Connect which sucks, but it's pretty easy. Probably wouldn't take him again.",0
Best teacher I have ever had. He believes in us as students; takes our art seriously. He makes me want to put 1000% into my work and actually exhibit it. Also a great sense of humour.,1
"Although you can miss days I wouldn't recommend it cause he tends to throw some curve balls in with the weekly quiz but he does do study guides for exams.  Overall he is an amazing teacher and has some interesting stories about his roses, and really gets you interested in plants in our daily lives.",1
I wouldn't recommend Coop for anyone who has never seen calc before. His explanations are unclear and the examples he gave in class were beyond easy compared to the problems on his exams. His exams have a generous curve because the averages are so low and he does very little to prepare you for the departmental final. He's a nice guy though.,0
Awesome class he is very knowledgeable on the subject and willing to go out of his way to help.,1
Wallace is an amazing professor. He's very knowledgeable and really cares about his students. He is great at breaking down hard concepts and goes slow enough that the amount of content is not overwhelming. He is also very funny and keeps class interesting,1
"AWESOME CLASS! Very helpful and interesting. Lectures using power-points and his quizzes are exactly from the notes and lecture, if you pay attention and write notes the quizzes should be a breeze!! Work-outs are great and very helpful, totally recommend him :)",1
His class was thorough and very easy to follow he explained everything perfectly and answered all questions when asked. He does have random quizzes Which threw me off at first and he won't announce test so check the syllabus in advance also on the Note of quizzes he allows you to partner quiz almost the entire quarter.,1
"Teri is an awesome instructor. She's very helpful. Also, helps her students. I remember taking a short quiz's in her class. There is class discussion and group work.",1
Professor Stevens is the best! If youre trying to take Math 80 look no further. She is super reasonable test grader and will always help you to get the most credit possible. Her lectures cover all the needed material and she hands out really good handouts that will help you study a lot. Homework is not that challenging and it is due every Sunday.,1
"Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"The class itself is interesting and Professor Carr is very knowledgeable in the subject. He is also really enthusiastic and prepared. The only thing that I had a problem with is the speed with which he speaks. Sometimes it is really hard for me to understand or keep up with lecture, and I end up losing interest.",1
"Good instructor all around. If you put in some work you should pass with no problem. Takes more work to get the  ""A"" though. Worth taking.",1
"This guy teaches for himself and not students. The class is devoted to his repetitive life stories. My class literally had to teach themselves. Leave during class he takes points off tests! How? He just decides to make questions on YOUR test worth less!!  O yeah, and he doesn't round up grades--I got a 79%. very unorganized for an accountant.",0
I have never got an A on a math test until this class! She is clear and really wants to help you understand the math. The note sheets are very helpful!,1
"The best lab teacher I've ever had. He's a cool guy and very helpful. Very thorough and makes lab interesting (which is hard to do considering I have no interest in this class, it's required.) More than willing to help you out on assignments and fast at responding to emails.",1
"Redding recommends we read all of the material he posts to D2L as well as the textbook which may seem like a lot, however, as long as you skim the readings and chapters you'll be fine.",1
"Brad is a wonderful professor. He truly cares about your future and your experience as a student. He wants you to take away more from his class than just what's in the book; He wants you to become a leader. He will go above and beyond to help you succeed. There is no reason why you shouldn't do well in his classes. Also, he offers a lot of EC.",1
"Seipp was AWESOME! she takes time to help you in and out of class if needed! she wants you to understand the material not just get through it. get used to my math lab. she posts the lectures powerpoints, she drops the lowest test grade and hands out study guides. if she sees you are TRYING and putting in work you are most likely going to do well.",1
he does NOT teach but super easy A. few journals in class which he barely reads. research paper which he barely read and book review which he did read but all very easy ,0
"I took this class online, and it is a big unorganized, the class schedule was out of whack. As I was preparing for a particular chapter the class schedule stated would be that week, it ended up being a completely different chapter. He took almost 2 weeks to grade discussion boards. And your grades are based on the test and the DB postings.",0
"I have always been a straight A student, and I wish I would've found the website before taking this class. Currently, I am in HIS1112 with Dr. Crews. He provides no help, ridiculous midterm and final, no study guides or preparation. This was my very first college class and thought it was going to be the death of me.",0
Awesome professor! Clear rules. Tests are easy if you do the homework.,1
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
boring,0
Made us believe turning in review packets would give us 5 points on each test that they were turned in for and apparently this is not the case because my final grade is 6% lower than it should be.,0
HORRIBLE TEACHER!!!!,0
"After reading good reviews, I was excited to learn about crim in a sociological context. LA's lectures are painfully dull and boring, you're better off staying home and reading the text and slides. Shes super dismissive and seems to revel in her white privilege. Always uses same weird anecdote about her being able to drink vs an indigenous woman?",0
Tons of work! She has misguided priorities about what is important to teach.,0
"She's not bad when you first meet her and if you show that you have a ""passion"" for the theater. If not, you're clearly just wasting your time. She can be rude at times and she wants everything to be about her and her ""directing"" passion but if you do what you're supposed to do you'll pass the class.",1
"Literally the BEST class and professor I have EVER taken. This class is a lit requirements for arts students which is why I took it and omg, not only is O'Brien the most caring prof I've ever had, your grade is based off of reading commentary, one creative project of your choice, and peer feedback. She wants everyone to do amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS!",1
"Professor Lewis is a fantastic lecturer. However, he is not an effective teacher. The information posted on Blackboard is very generic. As a result, there are no additional opportunities for students outside his eight exams. My advice is only to take this professor if you are using this course as a retake.",1
"tests were HARD but obviously doable, people were getting 100% on her tests. Very funny in class but I found her to be harsh during office hours which caused me to stop going, she made me feel less than and a bit dumb to be honest. Her class is hard, just do the work, go over lectures and you should be fine",0
"make sure that you do the worksheets before coming to class; reading the chapters in the book helps a lot. The final is cumulative so make sure you study everything in order to commit it to memory. He rants during class, youll just have to tough it out. Not an impossible class to pass; I have a 98% as of right now. Study & Do the worksheets.",1
"Professor Gerard is a very nice person, but she tended to get off topic a lot in my class and would go off and tangents and tell stories, which made the class seem even longer. I really feel like I didn't learn much taking this class.",0
Such a nice and caring professor. The material isn't easy but she prepares you well for exams and tries to make lab as enjoyable and stress-free as possible. Definitely take her!,1
He's a good guy. Show up to class and pay attention and you'll do fine.,1
"Dr. Autry is amazing. The passion he displays towards teaching shows each and every class period and if you don't allow yourself to get distracted you'll bear so much fruit from listening. Class is mostly quizzes, a paper or 2 and a few exams",1
"He is my absolute favorite professor at Mcneese. I have learned so much from him. His class is always so interesting and there is never a dull moment. However, you must be prepared to study. If you are willing to put forth the effort to learn the material the tests are not overly difficult.",1
"Dr. Hinton knows what she is saying, but it's kind of hard to understand if you don't know biology already. There are four tests and she curves them. She messed up reviewing for our final, so she doubled our highest test grade for our final grade. YMMV",1
I am in utter shock and dismay after the horrific events that occurred from January-March 2019. This class was absolutely horrendous. Where do I even start? She gives TONS of homework every single week. She even assigns it right after TESTS! Her tests are always the MAXIMUM level of difficulty. Please please please avoid this class if youwanttoLIVE,0
"It was unclear the amount of essay questions that were going to be on the test. After failing the first test, I went and spoke with him. He was helpful in that setting. The study groups he offers are helpful, GO TO THEM! The reading is helpful but I wouldn't focus just on it.",1
"Les examens sont supers faciles, mais elle est chiante sur la correction des travaux. Ses travaux sont d'ailleurs pas clairs. Elle parle très doucement et ne fait que lire des statistiques et ses powerpoints. On apprend pas grand chose, et c'est un cours super ennuyant.",0
This class material is hard to grasp BUT  Michelle makes it easy. I wouldn't take this class with anyone else.,1
Very Hard to Understand. Had to teach myself everything. Tests weren't like the problems we learned to do. Do not take!,0
"What an unbelievably disappointing class. She bases the entire course on class discussion, yet has us sit in lecture-style rows and talks for 75% of the ""discussion."" She's very easy, just don't come in hoping to learn anything like I did.",0
"Professor Nguyen is extremely wise and thorough with his material. Quizzes are fairly easy however the written assignments hold higher standards if you want to score a rough B or so. He is helpful and loves feedback from his students so don't be shy, especially when class participation is graded.",1
Took her class online. Her Instructions are not clear for assignments that are not pre-outlined by the book. I informed her I was struggling with the class several times. Her response was rude+unhelpful and very unprofessional.,0
"She is like any normal professor, if you repeatedly do not show up it affects your grade. You mostly get online work, which I believe is graded off of completion, however I could be wrong. You receive 3 papers in the class, which are not difficult, the textbook is needed. Overall she is very understanding as long as you do what you should be doing!",1
Great,1
"easy A, you have to be stupid not to pass.  shes boring but tries to make it fun. 4 essays little homework",1
"This class almost sets you up to fail. There is a review session for the midterm, yet not a single thing taught in the session was involved in the midterm. There really is no way of preparing for the midterm unless you know every detail of everything. Seriously. TA's are useless, they confuse you more than anything.",0
"Honestly, a great teacher. He goes out of his way to provide a weekly homework help section, and will also have out of class reviews for exams. Example problems are well done and thorough, and he teaches how to do the physics, rather than just to use the equations. HOWEVER, his exams are challenging, so be aware of that!",1
Worst Professor I've ever had. Makes you feel bad when you ask a question. Is very hard to follow. Homework assignments take hours and test are very difficult. Do not take him if you don't have to!,0
Aviod her this class is not worth to study that crazy shes super hard if ur study freak then take her otherwise D is for sure,0
When i emailed her my questions about course material i never received an email back.. and she went on rambling about side stories a lot.,0
"He is a very nice guy that likes lectures to be interactive. He likes to get people to think critically and this can lead people to feel that he doesn't give straightforward answers. His tests are a little difficult because they are all short answer, but not hard to manage if you read the book and pay attention in class.",1
I recommend taking his class. He is the bomb dot com. I took his class for 092 and math 100. Attendance is a must and you must do the work. He cares about his students and if you need help he will help you. I would take him again.,1
"Funniest person I've ever met. Takes time to explain things. However I don't feel like I am learning anything because lectures are very short. Quizzes online, final exam is field trip.",1
"Loved this class, one of my favorites! Take her, you'll learn a lot. She has a lot of experience and it shows in lectures.",1
terrible professor. doesnt help students with feedback or instruction for lab reports. would never take again,0
Andrea is literally amazing!!! I've taken Crim1208 with her and she knows how to make everyone in her class succeed! She is super kind and is very helpful. She emails students as soon as possible with answers to their questions. Her exams consist of M/C and 3 assignments which are a breeze to complete as long as you pay attention and have the text,1
"Dr. Ghosh is an okay professor. She puts EVERYTHING expected on the first day which is nice but she posts too much information. It's quite overwhelming. It'd be better if she made it to the point right away. Also, she says she will get to you through email.... which is not true. She responds late and doesn't fully answer your question.",1
"He's a really nice professor. I think he said he has emphysema so it's hard to hear and understand him through his thick South Texas accent. He has some strange stories, but that's just how he goes through his lectures. Tough subject to teach so he decides to bring his own ways of doing Statistics into the lectures. Works for some, not all.",1
"She is a great professor with a lot of knowledge, but GET READY TO WORK. Requires 2 discussion board posts a week and has weekly homework assignments and quizzes. I spent about 5 hours on each assignment. Her tests are HARD, make sure you know the material 100%. She takes a long time to grade and respond to emails. I would take her again though.",1
Your review is graded at the same time as your test so go over your review with a tutor to make sure you have something correct to look at for your test. Tests and reviews are only graded by percentage you will not know what you got wrong unless you specifically talk to teacher.,0
"She is the worst! A teacher should encourage a student to do well and motivate to accomplish his/her goals. This course should be fun and not a torture. Susan moss is one pf the worst teachers that ever excited! She discourages and takes points off your grade for spelling, or if your handwritting is not clear!",0
"Great and knowledgeable professor. Also can be a funny guy. If you ever have any questions, he's very approachable. Quizzes every class (once a week), three graded articles and a final. Quizzes are based off of the textbook, style guide and recent news events. The class wasn't hard, but if writing isn't your thing, it won't be easy.",1
"Loved this teacher. Very helpful, very thoughtful, and all around wonderful teacher. Highly recommend Mrs. Van Horn's class. Great Teacher!!",1
"Kim is a nice and down to earth guy BUT he never answers emails, he confuses himself when he talks, and he goes through the lecture so fast. The class is a teach yourself course and half online. There are three tests, 10 connect HWs (one extra credit), and different assignments here and there.",0
Great teacher awesome personality! If you take her and do your work like she says to do then your sure to be successful! Yes I failed her class but by all means it was my fault not hers because I just copied the work out of the back of the book and didn't really do my homework like she said to therefore I didn't understand things on quiz and tests.,1
"almost nothing but powerpoints, very difficult to understand, doesn't explain things well and skips a lot of material, overall too difficult to follow if you want to seriously learn in depth about databases. You are better of learning on your own.",0
Very disorganized professor. Made a lot of errors in the tests and her slideshow presentations. Unclear grading and did not teach the material for the class very well. Relied on the textbook heavily which was very poorly written. Take this class if you wish to self learn and watch YouTube videos to learn the material. Sometimes gave out pop quizzes,0
"Steve is a smart guy, but sometimes that means he'll spend 30 minutes of class time trying to figure out a difficult problem that we would never even need to know. It's difficult to try to put his examples/lectures into notes, and you'll probably have to reteach most things to yourself on your own time. But he's a pretty easy grader and a nice guy.",1
"Dr. Maher is nice, his class however, is the most unorganized, frustrating, and annoying course I have taken in all of my undergraduate career. His exams were all essay-based, taken in a lockdown browser with the only material to prepare about 100 pages of reading a week. He was not equipped for online learning. I paid three dollars for the final.",0
"this class is actually insane. I have taken 200, and 300 level online psychology classes so I figured why not take an easy 100 level class online. DON'T DO IT. This professor expects work from graduate students and will never ever give you full credit. One comment she gave me was ""You need to cite all of your work, regardless if it is an opinion.""",0
"She is rude and clearly has issues like previously mentioned its sad that she is the only professor teaching the course. She does not make the class interesting at all and can never give a full example. She begins explaining and is at a loss for words and just says ""YOU KNOW"" but never says anything.",0
He tries to make his class as interesting as possible. Just show up and study his notes,1
She has a weird grading criteria in which she gives a cumulative final and if you dont pass that even if you have a good standing grade she will fail you. She is awful at explaining and she even puts things on midterms that werent on her study guides and arrogantly tells you she knows it wasnt on there but you can atleast try for partial credit.,0
easiest A ive ever had with absolutely 0 musical background or knowledge. went to one lecture and ended up with a 100 in the class. there are only 4-5 quizzes or tests which are the only assignments for the semester which come straight from the powerpoints and lectures he posts on canvas. the final was super super easy. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!,1
"Participation is important. Reading assignments given for in class discussion and lectures. Easy group in class assignments, but you can also complete on your own for credit if class is missed. ",1
I took an Oprah class two semesters or so ago. It was a weird experience. I got the feeling that the class was offered to bolster falling enrollment in the English department. Since when is Oprah an arbiter of literary greatness?,0
"Horrible professor. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. She grades very hard on essay, and her intructions are confusing.This class was a waste of money.",0
It's true that 3140 is hard. But Dr. Swift made it even harder. He doesn't fit into the online course AT ALL. You were expected to do heavy quizzes and exams within an extremely short time. And he actually think the time was way too much for the students. It's very upset that a professor can be such detached to his students.,0
"Nixon was awkwardly happy all the time and was overall okay. Her office hours are the best way to get feedback. This class was writing one paper over the course of a semester, so the work load was usually either  a lot or none at all for a given week. You don't use the textbooks a ton but you should have them, check to see if there are pdfs online.",1
"she's a cool person, but she tends to ask for too much from an ACA class. Like its a 1 credit class and she doesnt understand some people's circumstances. So i'll be a tough rater, like she's a tough grader.",0
"Professor Gilbert was inspirational, and so good-looking too ;)",1
"SHE WAS great, the class was kind of hard but she really  helps you.",1
"I had Adam for Calc 1, 2, and 3. He is super awesome! His lectures are easy to follow, and he does lots of examples. Homework almost every night, test and quizzes are straight forward. He is awkward but funny, and always has great stories. I highly recommend him for any math class!",1
"Professor Perez is a great teacher, who is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. I would definitely take his classes again if I get the chance. His lectures are amazing and the readings he chooses are actually very interesting. All readings are posted, so no books necessary. He gives you the prompt for midterm ahead of time!",1
"Professor Hanson is a somewhat boring teacher in terms of note taking. He does have an intellectual sense of humor that rarely reaches the students. He is helpful with all his assignments and provides as much insight as possible for you to achieve the highest grade possible. Good teacher, but tough workload.",1
Not good,0
I took AC 101 at the beginning of the summer and he was just AWESOME. Super friendly to everyone in the class and respects everyone and always helpful. The material was taught very well and he makes sure everyone understands the material. I loved speaking up in his class because he just wants everyone to understand it and its a fun class.,1
"She is such a sweet lady and this class is a very easy A. She gives you a study guide for the test and the test is exactly like the study guide, just in a different order. It can get kind of boring at times but you can find ways to entertain yourself. She also gives extra credit for each test you take and that's the only time you need the book.",1
"I literally taught myself this class, no joke. I studied and read the textbook for HOURS daily and watched youtube videos. There might as well have not been a professor teaching the class, she reads the powerpoint slides in a monotoned voice, does not really teach. 3/4 of my class dropped and I was one of maybe a few to pass. Do not take her class.",0
"His assignment load is heavy due to 1 per week, but he actually takes the time to do similar examples in class lecture to help us out. The midterm and exams are pretty straight foward.. if you did your studying.",1
"This professor used class time for unneeded things. She was not helpful at all when students asked questions and graded unfairly. I would not recommend taking her, at all.",0
"This class is very writing intensive, but if you do all of the work and show her you understand the topic, you will pass. Every week we were assigned discussion posts and quizzes, which totaled over 1000 words, so I wouldn't take it again because it's a lot of work for a class I took just to fulfill requirements to transfer.",1
"BEST seminar, Dr. Tone has high standards but is a fair grader and gives you every opportunity to do well in class. Read, go to class, speak in seminars and you will not only do well but will learn valuable skills for academic research and writing. One of the best classes I've taken at McGill.",1
She goes way too fast during her lectures and is extremely hard to understand. She doesnt properly explain one point and rushes to move onto the next. Would seriously recommend not taking her.,0
"Interesting class and knowledgable professor. Dr. Browning was good with communication and showed flexibility for my special situation when requested in advance of deadlines. Classwork includes weekly forums, weekly quizzes, and 2 case studies. Quizzes are straight-forward but I felt the case studies could have used some more clarification.",1
"I took this class in preparation for my CGBP exams. Introduction to Exports is naturally a tough class, so i was happy to make a B.  Professor Chii is a nice lady, she really did her best to help.",1
"Very nice guy, but not very helpful. The other two portfolio professors Sean and Maria are much more productive with class time, and actually give helpful critique.",0
"She is a great professor she explains this very clearly and very well!! Any professor for a math class can teach you to crunch numbers but do you actually understand what you are going and why? Prof. Chambers explains this very well is is clear about how you will be graded she will actually say, ""here is how you need to write it for full credit...",1
"This was a painful class to take. His lectures are all over the place; he writes messily all over the chalkboard and jumps from topic to topic randomly. He also tends to focus on small details that don't really matter and won't be on the test. He didn't have office hours, instead we were told to ""find me at round table."" ",0
I'm currently talking his 100 level class and it is a wast of my money and effort. He give no slack and I'm trying my very hardest. They way he gives his test makes it very hard to pass. He teaches as if it is a 300 level class. I don't recommend him unless you are really into geology.,0
"She'll give weekly quizzes, and if she sees that majority of the class did poorly on a certain problem, she will stick it on the next quiz without warning.",0
"She is nice, approachable and teaches very well. I would recommend her for chem 111. She gives a lot of extra credits and if you go to class and take note form the lecture then you should be OK during exams.",1
"David is not a great lecturer he often goes off and does not stay on topic of slideshows. Lectures are very long and boring material, he has a very monotone voice making it nearly impossible to stay engaged with topic son hand. I would not recommend the class to anyone. Assignment given often are very vague on what they want it written on",0
"This prof is amazing. Exam was sooo easy. He told us what to study and let us take in formula sheets you can write anything on. All the questions were from the textbook. TAKE THIS COURSE. EASY A. Don't need to buy the book, just be friends with someone who has one just in case XD",1
"Nice guy, kind of a nerd, but funny in his own way? Tests are hard, but he is willing to help if you ask. Makes the topic interesting, and has funny stories to add and that do actually help. Take him if you want to learn, not for a blow-off class!",1
I think she make english easy and she lets you be creative with your writting. If you just need to get through english and it is not your fav. subject then this teacher is for you.,1
Not even worth your time,0
"Evan is such an amazing person and wants his students to learn. His lectures are extremely interesting and he wants you to benefit from the class. Takes time to get to know his students. 3 quizzes, you can drop 1. Not tough at all. One group presentation and final exam paper - not tough. Just put in time and care, and you're solid.",1
"Meilleur prof très très gentil . Toujours veut aider tout le monde, toujours presnet pour ses élèves.",1
Study guides are useless as tests are very different from the guides themselves. The fact that you fail if you get below a 60% in the class even though you have a good enough grade is just odd.,0
"If you can TAKE PARINEH!! One of the best professors here at SJSU. He makes class fun and finance simple, and really makes you want to apply what you learn into your real life. Truly cares about his students and if you go to class a study (not too much don't worry) you should ace the test, he gives practice test that are very similiar!",1
For online classes I took this teacher and she gave us so much work. Its all small assignments that arent to hard but they start to build up and there is pretty much something due everyday of the week. She makes her class it seems without having regard that any of her students are taking other course. 7-10 assignments due a week.,0
"DO. THE. HOMEWORK. The homework is ""optional"", but if you do not do and master the homework, you will not do well in this class. Those optional questions for 1.3? On test 1, study them the MOST. Do not feel bad about taking this class twice.",1
"Awful PHD instructor. This class is all about organization and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. Funny how that works, right? Her assignments make absolutely no sense and when you ask for clarification she sighs and rolls her eyes. On top of that, she deducts points for going above and beyond and takes months to grade assignments.",0
"Professor O'Quinn is an extremely knowledgeable professor who knows what he is talking about. However, I found his lectures very hard to follow & did not know what points he was trying to get across a lot of the time. His assignments are ambitious & unclear but he is very approachable and brilliant. Take a class with him if you want a challenge.",0
"Unless you are a favored student, this class will ruin your life. Professor refuses to assist struggling students both in and out of class. Will mark you wrong for getting the correct answer because he doesnt like how you did it, yet wont help you do it his way. AVOID",0
"great humanities credits. she's a little scatter-brained, but always good for a laugh. the topic is really interesting, and she loves what she's teaching. you never use the book and tests are outlined on review sheets that you get during discussion. if you study and give even a little effort, you should do well.",1
The class is easy enough and some of the books are actually interesting but the ones he focuses more time on are incredibly dull. The class overall is just boring and aimless conversation with no end goal. Would not really recommend taking unless it's the only IH section that fits your schedule.,0
Dr. Barnes is very personable and makes the class relatable. She talks about her personal life a lot which I found funny and helpful to understanding concepts. Group work is pretty easy but the chapter quizzes can be hard. Easy extra credit stuff too.,1
Amazing!,1
"Prof. Klaasmeyer is amazing! She wants to make you love art, and she is very passionate about her subject. You don't need to memorize tons of dates and names, just understand the main ideas and show your sincere interest. If you do her assignments (which are pretty easy) you definitely get your A.",1
"Honestly, this class was terrible. I did not understand anything and he went too fast to give me a chance to keep up. I do not recommend.",0
"She really is a nice lady, but I cannot recommend her online class as a full-time student. Extremely heavy workload. Final exam ruined my grade when I had been passing for most of the semester. Only half of the students earned a B or above, and the average was 71%. I felt like the course was way too challenging for an introductory language class.",0
"Very easy online formatted class. Weekly quizzes, 4 exams (all multiple choice), one research paper, weekly discussions, and a few fun ""lab assignments"". I highly recommend taking this online.",1
Zwier is the best Chem teacher at Drake. He is not a hard grader and actually cares about his students and how you do in class. If you get the choice pick Zwier!,1
"She's uninterested in helping students & ambiguous in all of her communications. She will berate you at her discretion without taking the time to understand your communication. She's a terrible professor who takes ""jumping to conclusions"" to a whole new level. She grades inconsistently. I learned nothing from her class; it's all busywork.",0
I strongly recommend NOT taking him. He is one of the most inflexible professors I've ever had. He preached all semester about how open minded he is and how he is willing to work with you but its all just facade. He calls people out in class for not talking but then bashes your opinion when you do. He's just straight up rude.,0
"Rita is a very fun and personable teacher, but makes sure you are challenged. If you put a lot of time and effort into her classes, your grades will reflect that. She is very fair in that regard.",1
AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS! Find another teacher if you have to take stats. His grading is very inconsistent and his self written textbook (which he makes you buy) is of no help. I felt like i wasted hundreds of dollars taking his class. He does not respond to emails and looks down on his students as if they are dumb. Worst teacher I've had in my life,0
If you can avoid him as a professor DO. I was miserable in his class. He loves theatre and I respect that but he is not cut out at all to be a professor. Big langue barrier and I found it hard to understand what he was trying to teach.,0
Professor Henricksen is a great professor that truly cares about his students. I had the pleasure of taking him for LRW I and LRW II. I wish he taught upper level writing courses.,1
She's a good teacher.,1
Very excellent teacher. Always friendly and very helpful.,1
"Dr. Brown was awesome. He really is passionate about what he teaches, and he makes his class easy to understand. Heavy work load but a lot of it is very interesting and he goes over everything in class. He really cares about his students and is a really great professor. I would definitely take him again.",1
tough,0
"terrible professor ever. Vague criteria, thinks shes a good professor, and ignore students. Let me just say this, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL REGRET JUST LIKE ME.",0
I took him for organic chemistry and I do not recommend! He goes by notes only and doesnt really teach you anything. One time during a lecture a classmate asked if he could go back a slide because she did not understand and he told her its on the slide show in moodle Also does not really reply to emails or sends short replies,0
"I came into this course very nervous, through what past students have told me. At first it was very easy and I thought I was getting the hang of it. She didn't tell me what I really did wrong on my essays and told me ""it was a good piece of writing"". She ended up failing my final portfolio, and told me I didn't fix what she told me to. Do not take",0
Cool dude. Sounds like Nick Cage. Easy Class overall. <3 Do the quizzes and the tests are easy. If you find this class hard you shouldn't be in the class. :),1
"He does in fact grade like a jerk. Ethics is more about perspective, except that his perspective is what will give you a good grade. If you keep to his script and repeat back his own words back to him, he will grade you accurately and this class will be an easy A. I recommend this professor if you're okay with always agreeing with him. 1/10.",0
Many of these comments on Professor Miller are based off the fact that Chem in general is a harder class. He is a great teacher that is willing to help you with anything you need. ALEKS is used which is annoying but a great tool for studying and if you get most of the topics done its worth 25% of your grade. Quizzes and tests are not bad at all.,1
"We did nothing besides go over slides, very boring and they don't help at all. The exams are the hardest exams I've taken because the questions are totally out of context and not like anything on the slides or in the book.",0
Did not enjoy this class at all.  Could have easily done it at home on my own.  She uses sparknotes!!!  Not a good teacher!  Did not help when asked.  Would never take her class again.,0
"I took this class spring 2020, so we switched online half way through the semester. He did an amazing job with switching to online and made himself even more available to help students. He would sometimes jump on zoom with little notice to help a student having trouble on the current assignment. He also has an amazing late policy.",1
I loved taking Professor Stevenson. She was always so helpful by sending her students handouts and lists showing everything you need to know for each exam. (Many of the other lab professors only gave their students access to powerpoints). Every lab class has 3 exams and mastering assignments every week. Take Professor Stevenson!!!!,1
Great professor ! I would take her all 4 years if i could. Shes very understanding & gives great feedback on your papers. Shes always in a great mood & her grading criteria is CLEAR the whole semester.,1
"This womans opinion is the ONLY opinion that matters to her. The more I BS-ed on the essays and reiterated EXACTLY what came out of her mouth in class - the higher grades I got, i'm not kidding. Easy class, but advice: Take notes during lectures and use things she says EXACTLY in your essays and you will get an A. No Conflicting Opinions Allowed!",0
"If chemistry and mathematics are not your strong suit, I wouldn't recommend him. He is very smart in his field, but with that comes skipping the work and math in problems. This course is very math based so it does take some patience and practice to get a good handle on it. He is very good at explaining reasoning and theory which is helpful!",0
Professor Eaton is one of the best professors I have had at this university. She makes sure you succeed. All of her quizzes and test are take home. She always offers help and is willing to work with students to help them succeed. She is always understanding and her lessons are easy to follow. Definitely would take her again.,1
"Awful teacher! Rude, unprofessional, & completely uninterested in teaching this class. No wonder people don't enter the field of sp. ed! Dresses in tacky attire. Does not teach, prefers to read from ppts. Makes Ben Stein sound like an awesome public speaker. Yes, her voice is THAT bad! Not clear in assignment expectations. HCC should be ashamed!!!",0
He is an nice man but not a very talented in the teaching department.I learned very quickly just to read out of the book and to show up for Friday quizzes.that's right he does a quiz every Friday and they don't help on the test. All in all you are stuck taking him for organic because oc only offers him.,0
"Dr. Nevil's class is always entertaining! You will definitely have fun in this class! She's very strict with grading and deadlines, but very easy to talk to, and very helpful!",1
"She is very passionate about what she does. I was very skeptical the first day of class because she was intimidating, but im glad i still stuck by the whole semester. Easy class if you show up and take good notes, study for tests, and complete the two easy papers that she assigns. Recommend !!",1
"He was a nice guy, but this was definitely my hardest class. Doesnt do much to help you. His class is super boring.",0
"easy but his structure of the class is confusing and unorganized. you literally are completing online h/w course on your own, it grades you automatically. Due dates to assignments were all over the place and he made it difficult to find them and just wants to look at the syllabus. Theres more to teaching than stating to look at the syllabus.",0
"Jenny is by far my favorite professor I've had at UW. She is incredibly professional and knowledgeable, yet so approachable. It's clear that she cares very deeply about students. Even tough subject matter seems intuitive when she presents it. I only wish she taught more courses so I could take them. This class changed my life, take it if you can!",1
Unable to understand him. I would say you should go to class because every once in a while you get important equations necessary to do well in the class. however most of the time he spends the entire class teaching the unnecessary theoretical ideas of topics. find a tutor for this class and pay attention to recitation otherwise will fail. ,0
"He is a great prof, keeps lectures interesting. He's also one of the most intellectual profs i've ever had without seeming like his knowledge makes him superior in any way. I don't usually go to every class but he keeps lectures interesting so I get mad FOMO if I miss one. Taking a class with him again next semester (by choice). ",1
"The course could have been structured better since 5 percent of your grade for each module was riding on a 20 question quiz. However, I feel like this difficulty is made up since she offered quite a lot of bonus marks (3.5%). The lecture notes were great but if you want a high grade (A or above) you will need to work for it.",1
"She is the worst. Lectures confuse more than they help. The quizzes sometimes contains things she actually said would not be on there. The lectures do not cover everything you need. Four of us work together on homework. My partner and I turn in the same exact thing as the second partnership, but they got an A and we a B. How is that even possible??",0
One of the better professors in accounting. I learned a lot from this class and passed with a B. Theres online homework and tests where she lets you use a notecard. I would recommend!,1
She is not very clear on her assignments. She has an enormous amount of work for the class and unnecessary citations for discussions. She required you to have two peer reviewed journals for your responses to your classmates. She is less concerned about the content and more concerned with the structure of the papers. Hopefully won't have again!,0
"Absolutely terrible. Gives little help on the massive amount of daily homework. Little explanation over topics expected to know without prior discussion. When he does answer a question is extremely condescending. On more than one occasion said ""If you don't understand this then drop the class."" Has knowledge of Spanish but doesn't wish to share it.",0
"He is very nice, love talking to him. He will never fail you if you put efforts. also funny. Will let you make up papers. usually 2weeks per an essay. He helps you with intro, body and conclusion. try to get all 90+ on his paper, you will not have to take the final. Very understanding, will not mark you late.",1
Very good teacher. I wish I could take more classes by her.,1
"Mike is by far my favorite professor at the University. His methods of teaching are amazing, he is a passionate and engaging professor, and he genuinely cares about his students. Not to mention his intelligence. He is the epitome of scholasticism and coolness. Love this class, I'd take it every semester. It's definitely a life-changing course.",1
Overall he was easily the nicest professor I've had. He was definitely willing to help when I fell behind. His grading contract is really easy to follow too if you just follow the guidelines. The only criticism I would have is that his feedback on papers isn't the best. Overall he's a great professor.,1
"A professor I can honestly say (without feeling cheesy) I am proud to be a student of. His oratory style tends to be sarcastic, but that's what makes his lectures great! After one class, you'll realize what a master he is at his craft(: Pay attention in lecture! I am a sophomore and I am so glad Professor Willoughby taught my first upper div class!",1
"Not a bad professor, grade comes from 4 tests. Attendance is not mandatory but it will help you pass the class to listen to his lectures. There was a textbook to read, and the tests had a few questions from the textbook",1
"Not an easy course if you do not have a basic grasp on algebra. He has a specific style of teaching that worked well for me. Just goes through how to solve the problem and that worked for me. The homework is all online and easy to do but there is a lot of it. His grading criteria is easy, fair, and he tries to give every opportunity for success.",1
"Jiming is one of the best ITM professors at CSUEB. His exams are tough, takes almost the whole class period to finish the midterm and final, but he allows you notes full page front and back which helps a lot. Show up to classes because he gives 3 quizzes unannounced and drops one of them which is 20percent of your grade.",1
the best history teacher when history is not your best!,1
Excellent Professor,1
"I think he's really sweet and caring, he tries to teach you as much as possible but really you could sleep in his class. He's totally fine but i just didn't learn anything in his class and passed regardless. I love him though and i wouldn't mind taking him again, 2 critiques & 1 experimental report & 1 take home final. He's nice though! you'll pass",1
I gave the review below. Meant to give her a 5--she deserves it,1
"MCOM is probably the most useless required subject. I learned how to mail in a cover letter and resume... Who does that anymore? Brother Miller is a good teacher, albeit boring and old fashioned. The homework is tedious, but I feel like he is a lenient grader compared to others. He had an easy final that no other professors had.",1
"She is a very passionate teacher. She is also very caring and respects the students. However, her exams killed my grade. They are based on the book and while I read the book and even took notes from the book, I did poorly on the exams. Many other people in class had the same problem. Many of the questions are trick questions.",1
"Easy but boring class. Just sit in the front, laugh at his jokes and act interested and you'll pass. Hes a really sweet guy, though he tends to go on and on about Ghana. His lessons can seem a little scattered but he always gives study guides. No reason to get less than a B.",1
"His class really prepares you for a career in reporting. The work load can be fairly heavy, since you are assigned stories that you have to collect interviews for and write an article. He is very accessible and helpful. His lectures can be a bit dry, but he can be funny at times. He really makes you a better writer.",1
"Everything about Winslow screams nerd and it's hard not to like him. Makes PowerPoints with wholesome but cringe memes accompanied by a dry chuckle. Gives tough feedback on your papers but isn't too harsh of a grader. Reasonable amount of reading, super nice and accommodating too, would definitely take again.",1
"Professor Bulriss was from Chandler Gilbert Community College. I dropped his OGL320 right after the first day. So, he basically gives students 2 essays (one of them needs 1200 words) on 1st day and due in 2 days. Then the syllabus shows that you got more essays to write with more words every week after, and don't forget about group project!",1
He will not curve the class. Made the course harder than it suppose to be. And does not want to help you in his office hours. Do NOT pick him if you can take it with someone else.,0
If you have to take computer science at USC Upstate I would NOT recommend Mrs. Con. She almost never replies to emails and when she does it is not helpful to you and is rude. She takes this class VERY seriously. She is a very condescending person. STUDY FOR TEST!!! They are incredibly hard.,0
"He's a nice prof but goodness is his class BORING. I took it during summer semester and I swear it dragged so slowly it was almost painful going to his class every day. That said the work is simple, he gives tons of extra credit at 5pts/piece, and his tests are very easy so long as you pay attention hard as it may be. No textbook needed to buy.",1
RUN!! Super hard exams for non-accounting students. Only covers 1-2 exercises in the review similar to the 12-15 in the tests. the fact that is fully on-line makes it so much more difficult. Do all the homework and you'll barely pass the class with some minimal luck in the tests.,0
Dr. Miravalle is simply an incredible man.  His holiness and kindness reflect in how he treats every student (especially those who bother to come to his office hours).  He was so helpful and understanding of a difficult situation I was in during the semester that I started to view him as a fatherly figure towards the end of it!  God bless him.,1
AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS,0
"Took History of Paper Structure in the Spring. Amazing class, not too much reading and you really end up with a LOT of handmade paper that you can do anything with! Great for printmaking majors. There is enough time to come in outside class and do more work if you really enjoy it!",1
"My previous comments have been deleted, but I dislike Denise so much I come back here and post again about how terrible that class was. Enough said.",0
"I love Dr. Scoville. He's not the most organized professor I've ever had, but he's very flexible and helpful when there's confusion. He really cares about all of his students, and is very passionate about what he teaches. Definitely one of my favorite Arabic professors.",1
Steinitz is a fine professor when she cares. I took another class with her that she clearly put more effort into. She does an acceptable job lecturing but it's obvious she doesn't want to teach Civ Pro. She does not care about finals or grading! She always does multiple choice and clearly does not spend more than a day writing the test.,1
"Very sweet woman but a bad teacher. I've found myself sitting in class looking at her with my mouth open and my brain being fried by the confusion. she understands that we don't speak Spanish fluently, so she teaches ONLY in Spanish. yea... not good. needless to say, i have 3 classes left and can't even imagine if Ive passed or failed. ",0
"Difficulty in class is due to material, NOT professor. During Midterm week we had 5 exams, the last Friday was capitalized by a Quiz none of us had prepared for. You could feel the mood of the room and asked if he could move the quiz. We were fried and he knew it. We reviewed the topic and he moved the quiz. I will always respect him for this.",1
"First online class during a pandemic, was very clear on requirements but honestly wasn't even remotely understanding to how stressful life outside of school is right now. Also made it a point to throw guilt when it wasn't necessary.",0
Don't even bother.,0
"I enjoyed Professor Casada and the way he ran his online Psychology class. There's an online book you'll need to purchase but no need for the hard copy unless you want it for reference material. Straightforward, lots of questions on hw & tests but you'll learn better for it. Interactive with class discussions to participate in & quick to reply.",1
"Higham was a very good professor. The homework load is relatively heavy, but it's within reason. His approach was very professional. He didn't act like a ""friend"", but he was very approachable. I personally appreciate that.",1
This teacher was not helpful at all to me. In my opinion she is not clear at anything she wants and has a hard time pronouncing words which made it very hard to understand her during lectures. I would avoid taking her classes unless you have to.,0
"Such a nice happy guy, always willing to help out a student and always replies to emails. However, his classes are pretty boring - he reads off powerpoints the entire time and puts on outdated finance tv shows on Fridays. The midterm and final were the easiest tests I've ever taken, he gives you a study guide, and most of the answers.",1
"He is the best teacher in TRU, my major is business, but I had so much fun in this class!",1
She was very helpful. Class was demanding and on par for a PhD level class. She held conference calls and watched our conference calls as well to ensure everyone participated and to get a feel for our understanding of the material. Weekly reviews and an abundance of feedback.,1
"he can be rude and if you don't understand something and ask a question, he often makes it more confusing for you. he randomly leaves the classroom (daily, MULTIPLE times per class period). the labs make no sense unless you've already taken classes before. he makes it way harder to understand then he should for a gen ed course.",0
Great class and great teacher! I could not keep my eyes off him. Sooooo Cute!,1
"Took her online class and had to drop it. She is a tough grader, work is worth two points, wants everything done correctly, very rude, expects a lot in discussion posts, is not clear in what she wants, work is due by 5, no late work, extra credit is impossible to do, and depends on the book for everything with no help if asked for some. DONT TAKE!!",0
"Inspirational professor. I learned to appreciate math in his class. He posts helpful practice questions, is reliably available for help, and is a comfort when you have a problem. Great at sarcastic deadpan.",1
class makes me want to change me major.,0
"Had her summer 2010 UE program, pretty weird but awesome prof.",1
I love Dr. Ortega! He is so nice and caring and you will learn so much from him. His accent is not difficult to understand and he is always there for office hours. He is an amazing professor that loves what he does and is very passionate. He is a caring person and will give extra points to help the class when they need it. Definitely recommend him!,1
"I took Landforms from Mary, and she's great.  She puts here heart and sole into her teaching.",1
I have never been so frustrated with a class. The quizzes she gives isn't over stuff that you have recently gone over. Doesn't do examples to completion. Treats you like you are stupid. Grades super heavy. She deducted points for something that wasn't in my final answer. Doesn't give partial credit. expects you to spend every waking hour studying.,0
"Dr. Harvey knows how to teach. She is patient and helps students whenever she can. Study her practice exams, they'll be helpful for the exams (4 exams including final). she drops the lowest grade if you do well on the final. Don't miss her lectures if you want to learn.",1
"Really good cut and dry Professor, you need to go to class in order to pass because, his tests are based off of his lectures not the book. The book for this class was free so i would highly recommend",1
"URGH! If you are taking this course as a pre-req for nursing, DO NOT BOTHER WITH HIM! He is a mess. His teaching skills are all over the place, he's' very unorganized and HE IS RUDE AS HELL! He makes you buy the book & connect and doesn't even use either! I unfortunately had to drop the class because honestly I just couldn't stomach him anymore.",0
Definitely recommended professor He engage the whole class in discussion and describe the concepts very nicely. Learned a lot from his class.,1
Lectures were fun and she definitely made the material interesting. Great teaching style and was obviously very knowledgable about the subject. She was very understanding when it came to grading work. Would definitely recommend taking.,1
"BEST CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR AT USC! Very clear, answers all questions, fair tests, and extra credit! If you do all of the homework, you'll make a good grade.  Very understanding and easy to talk to.  Don't take anyone else!",1
Professor Neva knott has time and time again has shown her inability to teach by not supporting her student when they excelled in something they previously struggled with. When you ever asked for her help she only responded with not only a rude manner but also more confusing then the prompt she gives. Do not take her class if you ever need help.,0
"A really hard guy, but clear and helpful. The best I had during all my years at university here in England and France",1
"Experienced, but sloppy & lazy at teaching. He reads off his many slides. Cuts off student questions and can't answer them clearly. Many errors on tests. Wording of questions are confusing & vague. Likes to be chummy with students. Material is tough. You will have to teach yourself from the textbook and put in A LOT of your own time to do well.",0
"Luna is really nice, and passionate about teaching.  She's kind of a pushover though, so not all of the homework assigned actually counted for our grade or even got turned in.  A lot of projects in presentation form.",1
His tests are very interesting as they're only short answer as in a few words and he really doesn't give much feedback because you don't see what you got wrong on the test and only post the marks,1
"The king of ambiguity when it comes to big project requirements- you'll fly without radar until the last couple days before something is due, when he tends to finally drop a big hint about what he wants. If you can live with that, he's a great guy and his lectures are very interesting and informative. Talking to him in his office will always help.",0
awful awful awful.  could not understand her at all. she goes way too fast. knows subject so well but does not know how to present it to students. DO NOT TAKE HER FOR FINANCE.,0
You have to teach yourself in order to pass this class. He communicates terribly and even his TAs have no idea what is going on. He only does two examples of questions during lectures that dont even make sense with whats going on. You need the book in order to teach yourself if you want to pass.,0
"2 tests, many quizzes, 1 paper, no final. Terry is extremely scattered in his lectures but he's a nice, funny guy. If you're good at memorizing experiments and their significance to psychology and learning material independently outside of class, this is the class for you. It's hard to sit through lectures most days unless you participate",0
"Lectures consist of ""learning"" terms and specific pieces which are just the quiz answers. No in depth understanding or outside example. Koehler rambles incoherently every single lecture as others have noted. Talks for mere minutes at a time about the class subject, elsewhere rants about unrelated and milquetoast conspiracies about society.",0
"This professor knows how to teach! Always willing to work with you on anything and everything. Super great mentor, kind and very passionate about his subject. I would take a million classes with him if I could. As long as you put in the effort you'll pass with flying colors.",1
"The semester, i feel, was not thoughtfully planned out...so much work crammed in at the end, pop-up assignments. Nice lady...wouldn't take her again if i had a choice.",0
"Easy A, don't buy the book because EVERYTHING is online. The downside is that he never grades anything so prepare for that. I think he plays the whole ""disorganized"" thing up. WileyPlus take a bit of getting used to but for not having to buy a book and just pay for this online and skate through his class for an easy A, I'll deal with it.",1
"Very nice and funny but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He will not let you make up for anything, daily quizzes and read one chapter (20+ pages) per homework.",0
"Will confirm your figures for your essays, goes to answer the exact same question but it's a different group and he'll say that it's absolutely wrong. Doesn't know what he wants. Has said ""i dont care"" and ""do better"" when people come to him for help. 80% of his neuro class have F's. Dont take him. You've been warned.",0
"The lectures drag on forever, and even if you can keep paying attention throughout, they won't help much with the homework or tests anyway. She clearly understands the material very well, but is either not good at explaining it or doesn't bother to fully explain it. Her accent is also very hard to understand, but you get used to that after a while.",0
"BEST teacher ever, actually learned something. Attendance not mandatory, BUT GO, it's super helpful and she usually gives a lot of test hints. Do the homework, it's not hard, use the workbook to study for the tests, the paragraphs are much more clear. Final not required if you're happy w/ grade, if not, final grade can replace lowest test. SO NICE",1
Really nice lab instructor. Marking is very picky and takes some getting used to. She's really helpful in clearing up any questions that you have during office hours and is super helpful inside the lab as well. Awesome lady. Awesome lab.,1
He is a very hard teacher to understand. He does not give you a study guide for either the midterm or final and does not tell you what is on either. He just expects you to study everything he's told you in lecture and material you have read. I barely passed with a C and i am an A student. Take a different teacher if you can.,0
"She should not be teaching. At first I really liked her because she seems really sweet, but then she turns on you. She definately picks favorites in every class, and I have had her twice. I had to take my Grandma to the hospital once, and she still told me that if I miss class I will lose points. She will never admit she is wrong. She is very rude.",0
Lombardi is such a sweet lady. Her classes are really long and boring. But she doesn't mind if you don't pay attention as long as you show up. She gives study guides for the tests that are exactly the same as the test. Just look over the study guide a few times. Would take her class again. Easy A,1
I really liked her class . I could tell she likes to teach. She sends out weekly announcements. The course is straightforward with about 12 quizzes and 1 tests online and 4 discussion papers. There is only one project to do which a lot of work,1
"She made computer hacking boring.  She has no idea how to teach, nor does she herself understand the course material.  She made this so awful I have decided to change direction and avoid the reset of the LAN classes",0
Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce prof enseingne encore. il est vraiment sans compétance aucune... oh qu'il est médiocre ce type ....,0
"Great Professor. Easy to understand and responds to email quickly. Took a World Religions class and I'm glad I took his class. He used a variety of material and would make the class fun. All in all, I would recommend him to anyone taking any philosophy or religions class.",1
this prof's #1 goal is to make his students life a living nightmare. avoid at all cost,0
"Great professor, willing to work with you if you're taking the class seriously.",1
"If you don't take notes fast, you probably won't get all of them. The lectures are long and if you miss one class, it's like you missed three.",0
"Not much things from lectures got correct on exam. I literally recorded his lecture. If you fall behind people in areas where others did well, you will regret it. Don't waste time to do better than others. Don't confuse him on projects by sorting things differently from others. He wouldn't ask questions and makes bad judgement. No one copies exams",0
She was a really great teacher. I will be taking her again for ENG 112. Loved her class. It was a Hybrid!,1
I like Dr. Bryce's teaching style. She teaches you to think and do a big project. It was the first class that made me like my major.,1
"Dr. Hernandez is a great professor. His methods of teaching an online calculus class work wonders! A 5-week course is tough, but his syllabus makes it possible to pass and learn a lot as you go. Follow his directions, do the assignments and ask for help early. He does an amazing job explaining concepts in ways that truly help! I recommend his class",1
"She's really nice and helpful but definitely a tough grader. If you do your best, you'll probably be just fine. ",1
"He seems kind of funny when he makes jokes in class, but he's terrifying. He calls on you in class so pray he doesn't know your name. He doesn't give clear information about what is going to be on tests/quizzes. He expects you to know the lab manual by heart and doesn't go over the theory in them. He will grill you during lab presentations. BEWARE!",0
Felizzi is the best professor I have had at MU. He is a fair grader and takes an interest in getting to know his students. He is very personable and always found time to answer my questions or help with providing useful feedback on my papers. If you have the opportunity to take him do it. You will be glad you did.,1
She is the best psych professor! EASY A and easy test! Take her seriously. Shes great!,1
"Fun class with awesome materials. Nice person, but grading (in absolute scale, not curve) makes this class very difficult. Take astr323 when Gelco(Zeljko) is teaching.",1
Recommend,1
Honestly this professor seems very good at first. I grew to find that your success is not her top priority.  She is very very strict with criteria and is unclear with instructions. She will kick you out of lab for very minimal things like forgetting to retype a revised procedure. Personally I would avoid this professor unless you are perfect.,0
TAs did all of the work on grading. Class was pretty basic and only discussed problem issues in forensic science. Timed exam (60 mins) on over a thousand plus pages of material and articles. Not a PhD instructor which really takes away from the quality of education at ASU. Did not comment on any assignments but did offer help when needed/asked.,0
"Professor Farrell is great, she gives extra credit on discussions, and has a clear syllabus. I recommend her Marketing class.",1
Reads off slides and does not help students at all with questions. I learned more about accounting with help in high school then this class...,0
"At the beginning of the semester he seemed really tough, but if you work hard and get your stuff done on time you will do fine. He really helps during his office hours and he wants students to learn!",1
Great at explaining complex ideas one step at a time so they are easy to understand! Also very helpful in labs. Beware the final exam is quite long and difficult but for some reason you only get 2 hours for it.,1
"Olsson is very nice. Know the powerpoints and demonstrate an understanding of the concepts, and you'll be fine. Discussions can be a bit boring but her humor makes up for it!",1
"Very fun and intriguing class. The videos made this much more interesting than just listening to a teacher drone on. Would take again, even though I have way too many communication classes.",1
"Take her you will get B- on papers but you can get an A in the class, just do all the journals and you should be fine. she is really caring and not anal about the work you give her.",1
Great professor. She was super helpful and seems passionate about Geology. She tries in different ways for you to not just learn but understand the material she's teaching. She understands students work and are trying to go to school. This was the best science class I've ever taken.,1
"He's not difficult. The problem I had was his inability to communicate. I would wait many weeks to hear back on emails and phone calls. He grades slowly. By the week of finals, he had not posted some grades from the first weeks of school! I had no idea where I stood in the class, grade wise, and it didn't help that I couldn't get a response",0
he's nice and helpful. the subject itself is hard but u'll do fine as long as u READ the book and do the exercises he assigned.,1
Its a really tough class,1
"Hands down worst professor I ever had, talks down when people speak up in class ""The class room is a place to learn, not a place to ask questions"". Very unclear as to what is being taught during class, 1/2 of the content she lectures is about china and nothing to do with the course outline. Highly recommend to NOT take a course she lectures.",0
bruh this is by far the worst teacher i've had in my life. she doesn't know how to teach. yeah shes nice but she doesn't help us learn the content. she is unclear on assignment requirements. half the stuff we learn is barely on the exams. she dont gaf about her students i swear she wants us to fail. dont take her PERIODT.,0
"Currently in his PHY125 class. He has an unrealistic expectation for Non-Science majors. Talks to no end during class, not requiring feedback. A lot of his opinions infiltrate the lesson plan. PROCTORED Quizzes and Tests. The theme is that he simply can't teach. He is smart no denying but doesn't make for a good prof. Get ready to teach yourself.",0
I loved this class.  I found it super easy to follow...call me a nerd but I really liked the formulas :D  He is super helpful and really wants his students to succeed.,1
Easy class I guess... but he gives a ton of homework and kind of a picky grader..,0
If you need help she will help you out. Use her office hours they are very helpful on the exams! overall GREAT teacher,1
"Ning is a horrible teacher. I dont know why he is there. I ended up dropping his class, if you dont understand math very well, do not take him. Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself.",0
"The entire class is based on 4 papers.. 25 points each. She's very helpful and makes the class interesting. I recommend taking her if you want to get an A grade, But she DO NOT accept Late work.",1
"Nice guy, lousy teacher. Get ready to fly through powerpoints, watch a bunch of JMP tutorials, and do random assignments and busywork.",0
"Really enjoyed this class! Super well structured and the tutorials are actually really helpful in understanding reading material. We covered LOTS of content in lecture, however there were podcast lectures available to help incase students were absent or needed to review a slide for their notes. Overall a very encouraging prof and great experience.",1
"thick accent, what she would teach had nothing to do with the test, she was nice but a mess, don't recommend at all. if you can choose someone else.",0
Extremely personable and very relaxed.  Tests follow consistent structure.  She has a good sense of humor.  She's a cutie too.,1
"I wouldn't advise taking this course online unless you're taking few credit hours or are very dedicated. I had a little too much on my plate and found it difficult to keep up with the assignments due each week. You have to do a lot of discussion board posts, and none of them can be on the same day. I was expecting end of course due dates.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A BAD GRADE. EXTREMELY TOUGH GRADER. VERY HARD TO GET AN A IN HIS CLASS. SIGN UP FOR ANOTHER PROFESSOR.,0
Great class with huge reading load. Mason is a great professor- very knowledgeable and made lectures enjoyable. The tests were difficult.,1
"I did not particularly enjoy this class. Partner work every single day, which I was not a fan of. Lot's of online homework, and I thought there was a lot of busy work. You also have essays. She's a really nice lady, but she does not speak English well, and her tests are super hard (and way too long for a 50 minute class). I struggled in this class.",1
"Your average try-hard adjunct professor at first..  Teaches off of ppt's  and justifies it with essay test questions. But he is very spiteful. I received A's and B's throughout the whole semester, but when I had to make up ONE test for a family trip, he made sure that I received an 89.4 for the course despite my effort. Pass on this bitter old man.",0
"Either he doesn't care or he doesn't understand English enough to answer questions, so have fun teaching yourself. His ""lectures"" are just reading from the slides word for word. All the stuff he draws on the board is, you guessed it, straight from the slides. If he says something you don't understand, don't ask questions. He'll just repeat himself.",0
"He's a great professor that keeps the class engaged, does not give too much homework and is a fair grader.",1
It is not difficult to do well in his classes if you go to class and listen to what he has to say ON TOP of what he has in his Powerpoint slides. He is a very nice person and  quite cheeky when he wants to be (he has perfected the stink-eye)! He is a incredibly knowledgeable and can be lenient with conflicting midtermassignment dates. Not so bad ,0
There is a ton of work every week.  Took this class hoping to have an easy online class and this was not it.  Makes videos of herself talking with puppets and then you have to do an assignment on what the underlying meanings of it were.  Very strange assingments. Quizzes extremely specific once a week. Many discussion posts and responses to others.,0
Dr. Molina's class is great. His lectures are easy to follow and he is very clear on grading and projects. There was one big group project which he will provide feedback for all stages through out. Text readings were provided. Show up and put in good work on assignments!,1
Green is arguably the best professor in the English Department. He makes you feel confident that you have the capability to succeed. He is available almost every day outside of class for office hours and gives great feedback because he does expect great work from his students every time. Very understanding and personable as well.,1
Had a lot of powerpoints with maybe one example each. He was an okay professor but honestly who teaches calculus with a PowerPoint? He let us out early everyday but then played catch up in the end. He has question and answer days on tuesdays and exams on Thursday. Dont take him if you cant dedicate at least 5-10 hours a week for his class.,0
"She did not communicate with the class throughout the semester. She did not give any feedback and did not grade the majority of the assignments until the deadline, which is today. Since this is a class where students are trying to decide which career to pursue, I expected that the teacher would offer some guidance, but she did not.",0
"Way to be completely useless for advising. Might as well sit around inside a metal box while holding a compass. You aren't going to get any useful information or direction from her, conversations just go in circles.",0
"Very good prof. She is very helpful, and has experience learning other languages. She is good at teaching you HOW to learn a language and not just the language. I would definitely take another class with her. She is very nice, and easy to approach for extra help. The class expectations were very reasonable.",1
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
"I thought this class was difficult when we were actually going to school but this is the worst class I could have taken during this pandemic. She leaves TONS of work like we don't have other classes to deal with on top of stressing. Those memes about professors leaving 20 assignments and telling you ""I know it's a stressful time but.."" are her.",1
"She's they type of professor that it'd be useless to argue with. It's her way, or no way. If you are writing about ANY of the films she shows you in class, SAY THAT YOU LIKE THEM. Arguing your point, no matter how valid you are, will result in a low grade.",0
I don't know how the E.E. Department allows this kind of professor to get tenure. He barely speaks English. His lectures are so boring and useless that he now has to do pop quizzes just to make sure that people come to the class. He also is not fare grading. It?s a shame that people like him teach mandatory courses in the curriculum,0
"Professor Hawk was so awesome! Just make sure to show up to class. There weren't ever any tests or quizzes in this class, just a weekly paragraph and two essays. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Prof. Perez is great, not very organized though and yes, she reads the slides. But, if you ask her a question she will respond and with examples. She gives a lot of extra credit and participation is a plus. People who give a bad review are just lazy and do not want to study, they want an easy A.",1
"Stay away from McConnell. His classes are dry, his voice monotone, and his readings tedious. There is not too much work and he is an easy grader, however it's still not worth it. He's v vague in his assignment descriptions and seems to grade many papers without reading them. Even films did not make this class any more enjoyable.",0
"While Dr. Turkovic gives interesting lectures, the only thing his class is made up of are 4 tests, all in essay form and participating in class discussion. If you don't do well on those tests, you're pretty much screwed. I would not recommend taking this class if you are not a good test taker.",0
This guy is the best! If you're looking for an easy philosophy class this is it. It doesn't get much better than this. He has 3 exams and no homework (except the reading which is not required but if you want to get good grades on the test is highly recommended) He gives great examples in class and is available for helping after.,1
Hart was the worst prof I've ever had.  The only thing I learned in this class was that she thinks protists are cute and that she loved fungi.  No use attending class because you learn nothing.  Teach yourself the material using the textbook because that is your only hope.,0
He is not helpful and the exams are very hard and often do not apply to things that we do in class.,0
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Avoid if possible. Hes a very tough grader. Sets his expectation for his students very high. Does NOT give good feedback on any essays and makes you figure it out yourself even at a basic level course. Is never satisfied with any essay. Vague topics. One low grade and you can never recover.,0
"I have taken multiple courses with Dr. Hanson during my years at CLU. I am very sad that he is retiring because I will miss his style of teaching. He is very old fashioned and relies on the basic system of lectures and essays/tests. However, his lectures are always very interesting and most of the pictures he uses from around the world are his own.",1
"Yes, pharm is a tough class but Dr. Kalisch makes it easier! She tells you exactly what you need to know and gives lots of practice questions. She does ask questions during class, but it helps if you try to answer them beforehand in your lecture notes. Its also a great way to learn. Shes passionate and knowledgeable, 100% recommend",1
"Incredibly arrogant and not helpful.  He is right and everyone else is wrong.  His point of view is contrarian and somehow common sense, but highly impractical in real world, which is a place Jagpal infrequently visits.  Rutgers needs a pure marketing class, this is not a marketing class at all - it's a management simulation class.",0
"There were 0 questions on Erie Doctrine on the final. Steinitz told us several elements of a rule, backtracked and told us the rule was something different, and then backtracked again and told us she was correct to begin with. Also her class is not focused: she tries to accomplish too much (i.e. real world+theoretical+practical perspective).",0
"Her online lab class has 18 weekly modules, lots of lab assignments, extra credit discussions, midterm, final, & weekly mandatory zoom classes. Ask questions & participate, she is super responsive and accommodative! She truly cares about her students and loves her profession! A bit of a tedious class but she is one of the best lab professors ever!!",1
Very organized - has note guides for every lecture. He is truly passionate about what he is teaching and seems to care that his students understand the material. If you're not a geoscience major the class may seem a little geology heavy.,1
She's super sweet and the course was an easy GPA booster.,1
"Professor GZ is wonderful, her in-class explanations of Calc 2 topics are very relevant and down-to-earth. She has incredible patience for simple questions, and is persistent in working through student struggles.",1
"FSE100 was an easy class among harder engineering courses. Muhilan is a pretty quiet prof with a thick Indian accent, but he is very helpful as are his TAs. You are assigned a group about a month into the class, and if you all get along, the class is very easy. Only two tests the whole semester! 7:30 AM labs were painful though, coffee is a must!",1
"She is a great teacher. She always emailed me back in a very timely manner. This class has really helped me with my public speaking. I loved that she allowed the class to give feedback on presentations because the feedback made me more consciousness of how other's view me. Therefore, I can correct my mistakes and improve.",1
Terrible teacher. Haven't had class in a month. Reading assignments are never online but he expects you to read them. He coughs all class and will randomly call on you. Do not take if you have another choice.,1
"I took her in the summer and although she has way too many iClicker questions, she is actually a good professor- Her exams were difficult but I was lucky and got a really helpful TA but overall I would recommend her- She usually tries her best to make the class enjoyable but I will warn you the tests consist of too many questions in little time-",1
I really loved her class. She was friendly and helpful. ,1
"Her classes are extremely boring.  Although she does let you copy her slide shows from her website, you still have to show up for class... and all she does is read the slide show to you.  And she cant dress appropriately (stomach hanging out) but tells you to dress for your mentor teacher. I dont quite understand that. And group work? come on!",0
Scott is my favourite teacher from Seneca. You can tell he has fun teaching his class and is very respectful of his students. All he wants is for students to attend class and to participate. He ensures that his classes are safe environments and helps students get out of their shells. As long as you show you're making the effort you will pass.,1
"If you take Jasmin for Orgo 1, you will not learn a thing. His class is very disorganized, the syllabus dates for exams are not correct so you can never plan ahead. His due dates are random and he's very hard to understand in lecture. Dont get me wrong, he seems like nice guy who wants to see you succeed but everything about this class sucks. Avoid",0
Horriable...makes you feel so bad during every class,0
"Prof. handled the virus really well. Two short papers (2 pg reflection paper and 3 pg essay), open book online quizzes with the questions ahead of time. Zoom classes were fun. One easy group project. She was always available for us. Wish I took both history classes with her! My other professor made us write essays every week and didn't teach us.",1
"This is the easiest class that I have ever taken. Anyone who says that this is a hard class is an Ag major that has had it really easy during their community college days, or they are a lazy liberal arts major. Would recommend for an easy science credit. I have no ag experience whatsoever, and I got a 100 in the class. Buy the course packet.",1
she's the worst teacher in NJCU. the only time she teach the class was when Dr. Barugel went to observe the class I was tired of her stupid video clip she show on the class. she's a frustrated producer,0
"Great professor. I enjoyed his sense of humor, which I know isnt for everyone. His assignments arent hard, just get working on them as soon as you can bc they can be long. He repeats info often throughout the course to help you remember stuff & makes light jokes out of mistakes. Overall an awesome professor & great class.",1
"Wastes time on stuff not on exam. Forces you to talk in class. Rarely available for help, either doesn't answer email or takes a week, does NOT show up to open office hours. Takes forever to grade things - had over a month to mark a test and paper worth 40%, but only let us know marks day of the final.  Have to take his class? Skip, read the text.",0
"Ven is a caring professor who gives very good, detailed lectures. She is very flexible and knowledgeable. HW's are doable through following lecture, textbook, and other online resources. Midterm and final are similar to HW's. There is a short coding project at the last half, and shouldn't take more than 2 days.",1
"By far the worst professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking. 100% biased and disrespectful as well as unprofessional. does not care about your grade and does an inadequate job of teaching the material. He basically turned the class into a debate hall and sat back instead of teaching. His averages on every test were horrible, DOESNT TEACH.",0
"Very dismissive. Makes no effort to answer questions in detail. Very tough/unfair marking. Stubborn/unwilling to make accomodations to help students, even in difficult times like COVID. Uses same assignments each term, so no solutions are released and you can't know where you messed up. Interesting course, but she is not a good prof in my opinion.",0
This class was taken asynchronous. Overall my experience was okay. It was not the best. I have to agree with the failure to communicate directions for assignments and the lack of response through email. I know some prof have hard time with online Bc of the pandemic but online was just not it! I would not take again. I did not feel like I learned.,0
"If you show up, it's extra credit. She goes through the material quickly, but it's nothing too difficult so it's an easy A.  Only time you ""use"" the book is to do your homework, which most of the time doesn't pertain to what you learned in class but there are examples to help you figure it out. Loved her as a teacher!",1
On tests he chooses the most difficult problems and tries to make his tests as hard as possible when they shouldn't be. His tests are much much harder than the homework and quizzes. He makes his tests as hard as possible.,0
"Very understandable, helpful if you talk to her. Overall great professor !!",1
"I took Numerical Computations with him. The class is super easy- 3 quizzes that are open notes (and he gives a study guide with all the answers), 6 homeworks that he practically does for you, and one project that isn't much harder. His lectures are well organized and he has code samples in a ton of programming languages. Very nice guy.",1
Don't waste your time with ALEKS homework. Focus on labs and studying for exams. Learn everything taught in class. Seek help with tutors early in the course. Majority of students drop the course. He brags exams are intentionally tricky. Each exam includes 34 extra credit points if you're lucky enough to earn it. He doesn't curve. Syllabus is final.,0
"Do not take this class whatever you do. This guy lies about due dates, does not fully explain assignments, and assigns reading as if his class is your only class. also, tons of films to watch as readings too. Lectures are unorganized and unhelpful. Worst class at MSU. Guaranteed.",0
"PSA: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I am only 5 weeks into the class and I hate it so much. I am a very responsible student and he is an extremely tough grader. I got knocked down a whole letter grade just because in my paper the class name and date were switched. This class is not worth the stress, take this class with another teacher or in person.",0
"Prof. Serikova has a very heavy accent and can speak fast sometimes so it can be very hard to understand, specially since she is teaching math. Also not helpful at all, the few times I asked for help she barely explained anything and did it very fast and I was just left even more confused.",0
Great prof! Just show up and do the work! Attending class helps with the Overall Grade!!!!,1
"Chemistry is already a hard class, his class was the most difficult class I have ever had in my life. He rambled on about how the universe was made for 3 days! I asked if he could work with me, one on one and said no. He showed up late to class frequently and sometimes even canceled. He told me I shouldn't read the textbook. Do Not Take this Class!",0
"I have taken many Honors English classes and I found this ""basic"" class to be very difficult. The directions for assignments were unclear and when Dr. Lewan would send an update regarding the assignment, the criteria changed. I thought her grading was very harsh.  She is certainly a stickler for the dynamics of writing and no creativity is allowed.",0
This class is very lecture heavy. It is impossible to retain all the information given. Each exam is on approximately 10 units with 20 slides each. Additionally he is a very tough grader. DO NOT TAKE unless you absolutely have to.,0
"Very nice, helpful, and respectful instructor. Not a difficult class. However, after entering Thermo 2 it was clear how much I didn't learn from her. Basically learned all of Thermo 1 in the first two weeks of 2.",1
Best prof I've ever had the pleasure of learning from in University.,1
If you want a decent professor that will actually teach you something about plants avoid this professor. The only thing she will do is confuse you with her disorganized PowerPoint slides and drop your grade with her tests that don't test anything we cover in class. whatever she teaches you is not tested. study guides are USELESS,0
Dont take him.Very boring and waste of time and money.. Will not learn anything..Dont please DO A FAVOR ON URSELF...............,0
"Dr. Courtney Ray is an obviously inexperienced teacher. She had 4 wrong answers on her midterm that she had to correct for all students. She assumes it's your fault if you bring an issue to her attention. She's pretentious. She does not explain what she requires for the essays, then lowers your grade when you don't do it exactly how she wants.",0
"Never take it, unless you have really smart friends to get answer from them. He is boring, not easy at all, you have to write well for every tests, and TA s are  hard grader, they grade hard for this class.",0
One of my worst experiences with any prof ever... He doesn't seem to care about his students at all. He is not easy to reach and when he does respond he basically tells you to do it on your own. His first midterm was hard and he doesn't help explaining previous class quizzes well enough to see where you messed up.,0
"He is by far one of the most useless instructors I've ever had. He stops instructing the course after about two weeks, and instead piles on dozens of assignments that he's never explained. Prefers to sit at his desk or wander the halls the entire three hour period and rudely respond when asked for help. Due dates and expectations are never clear.",0
"Professor Schap will hold you well over the time period every single, showing a blatant lack of respect for students as individuals outside of his class. He also decided to send us links to YouTube videos halfway through the semester and watched those instead of class. I payed a lot of money to watch random YouTube videos. Frustrating.",0
He has a huge ego which causes him to degrade students sometimes. His grading and attendance policies are strict. He will like you if you understand philosophy.,0
There's a lot of required participation. She's empathetic to the textbook issue and provides alternatives if needed. She is a nice person who would often play podcasts for the class to listen and comment on.,1
"I am still in this class right now. He is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. I was really sick and e-mailed him, he never responded back to me. Now I am behind by like 3 assignment and I missed one day. He is horrible at communication. He doesn't seem to care about the students even though he says he does. I would give him 05 if I could.D:",0
It shows that this was her first semester teaching a course by herself.,0
She is the single WORST prof I have ever had! She is scatterbrained and contradicts herself. She is rude when asking questions are asked and literally just rants about plants and climate change. Grading criteria for midterms is nonexistent and she expects you to be an expert on the subject even though her lectures are utterly useless. Good luck,0
"Dudley is an amazing professor who cares about students and is naturally funny. She's very enthusiastic and passionate about marine biology! Be sure to show up to lectures because those notes will be important. The labs she assigns are incredibly fun and informational, especially the field labs. Not much effort beyond notes and occasional reading.",1
"I got an A in her class. Her lecture is pretty clear. She explains every step on the board. Even if you skip class, you can still catch up what you miss since she posts the questions with answers on Canvas after every class. She always stays after class 1 more hour, so if you don't understand, you can always ask her. I love her class so much !",1
"The discussion posts are impossible. He has instructions that you can use ANY Source; Text, Videos, OR Outside source. But when he comments back he says that if you use an outside source you have to use the textbook too which makes no sense. Directions are super unclear. He makes the work more difficult then it needs to be. DO NOT RECOMMEND",0
"Palmer was somewhat approachable after class, but was completely disorganized with unstructured format of his notes, tests, and his class as a whole left me appalled. I learned little from his class and would warn students to not take him if they have the option",0
"Profe Fletcher is literally one of the sweetest ladies ever. She is so understanding, and will do anything to accommodate you to make sure you get a good grade in the class. There is a ton of homework, but its really easy and just a matter of staying on top of it cause it can get overwhelming if you slack off. Exams are super easy.",1
Completely terrible. Avoid at all costs. He assigns material without letting you know how to do it and when he grades it he gives you half credit for doing wrong ??  Any who he isnt organized we completed the last 4 chapters in 2 weeks which was rushed and basically all on the final. Terrible Professor.,0
"Grading contract, so if you do the work, you will get an A+. The class has tons of group discussions to help you towards writing papers, and he will always give feedback to improve. He is an activist himself, but he won't shove his ideas down your throat. You can tell what he cares about by what he gears material towards. I loved this class!",1
"Excellent professor!  Couldn't ask for better... very helpful, intelligent, enthusiastic, encouraging, informative... He's just an all-around great guy!  He made learning fun and promoted community in our class.  He taught us the meaning of design well before other professors started to broach the subject 2 or 3 years later.",1
"At first, after reading some mixed reviews, I was nervous to take Rhonda's class. However, I'm almost at the end of my semester with her and she is great! She's an all around great professor! This means something coming from me because I hardly ever liked any of my professors. Tests are hard but only if you don't study!",1
Probably the worst experience I have ever had with a professor. I got an A in his class but still i would not suggest taking him. The amount of material you have to teach yourself is ridiculous as he chooses not to teach the material necessary on the tests. He comes off as rude and unprofessional to those who don't agree with his personal views.,0
"All homework and quizzes are done online on a site you have to pay for. That's where the textbook is as well, but I never used it and passed. English is not his first language, so it may be difficult to understand what he says, but powerpoints are clear. Pay attention, show up to take notes and you'll pass. Hands out a clear syllabus.",1
Lectures are pointless but you have to go because of pop quizzes. If you arent already experienced with computers or programming prepare to teach yourself. The class itself isnt that difficult but he assumes you have prior knowledge. Very bad lectures.,0
I want to be Dr. Braun when I grow up.,1
First class with him and I'm already regretting my decision to take him. Should have read these reviews. 3 hour class and I barely understood what he said in those 3 hours. He just reads off the slides and his accent is unbearable. I would avoid. Sucks that he is the only professor teaching INFO 2315 this semester. Listen to these reviews y'all!,0
His grading is the worst.  He does not answer quistions.  He explains for himself.  Always make mistakes and then says you can fix it at home.  Too long exams where you cant do them on time.,0
"Excellent teacher, one of the best math professors I've ever had.",1
"Poor teaching skills. He himself has trouble teaching the material. On multiple occasions the students had to correct him on problems. Has very little knowledge of what he is teaching. Most of the course grade is from 3 tests. If you are not very good at math, I STRONGLY suggest that you do not take his class. Save yourself the trouble!",0
"I took her after the amazing experience I had in her Chem103 class. She struggled to get adjusted to everything being virtual and kept on changing her decisions which led to a fall apart. I'm pretty sure she will be more prepared for the upcoming virtual semesters, but regardless, she is still the best Chem professor to take.",1
I enjoyed her class! She really wants you to understand the material. He tests are much harder than her quizzes but overall a good class. She is also very accessible outside of class.,1
"She deducts points fast!  I wish she inspired me and all the other students in class.  Even though I passed with an A, I would recommend any other student to take another instructor.",0
Very easy reasonable guy. Just pay attention to whats going on in class and you should make an A(if you can't that's on you). He tries to get the class involved as much as he can in his lectures so if no one talks then he will make the class more difficult. Only 3 test with a short hw assignment due every week. does give occasional extra credit,1
The class was full of long assignments and graded activities with unfair distribution of credits. You will have more than 10 assignments  activities together each takes more than 1 week to finish 1 quiz and 2 exams. He didn''t teach. He just made you work. Don''t know how something works Find out on your own. His feedback was ambiguous. ,0
"Hands down worst professor I have ever taken. Save yourself the immense headache and take this class with someone else. He is terrible at explaining things, and makes you use a textbook that he wrote which is full of mistakes. He doesn't know what he's doing, and he's rude to students who ask questions. Nor will he help you outside of class.",0
"O'Donnell is overly strict and unrealistic in her expectations for her students. Her way or no way. She's rude and uninviting. Public speaking is a fearful thing for most people, and she does not make it easy to overcome this fear. Go to class and do your work ON TIME. I will never take a class with O'Donnell again.",0
"Great professor, provides clear instructions of her expectations for her class. Test and assignments were easy. There is really no way you can fail any of her courses, shes great!",1
"Really recommend Engelhardt. Great guy, funny, always there to help. Really clear and wants you to learn.",1
"He was a great professor! His main priority was making sure that you got a good grade. He checks to see if you do your hw or if you just copy the answer key... His tests were pretty easy and if there was something that you didn't know, he will probably tell you what the word meant (even if you were supposed to know it.).  THE FINAL WAS REALLY EASY!",1
"Professor Walling was a bit unorganized throughout the semester, we were jumping from chapter to chapter. However, I would defiantly take him again, exams and quizzes are straight forward, he drops lowest quiz grade and gives lots of extra credit. I would take him again.",1
"I actually took this professor for HRM 444. I was really nervous about the amount of group work, but it actually wasn't bad. There is homework every week, but it's a reasonable amount. Gives good feedback, but isn't a super tough grader. Do the work and you will do very well in the class!",1
"She was the worst teacher I have ever had, she is cruel and vindictive. Also now she is in charge of the entire theater department. So now I have no choice but to leave Laguardia, because she is unbearable.",0
Dr. Meyer genuinely cares for his students and makes it clear and easy for students to pass! He let's you know exactly what he expects of you as a student. His lectures are engaging and beneficial for anyone going into counseling. I also had him for CSG421. Both classes were taught the same way. He is also flexible on deadlines and over-skipping.,1
"Such a disappointing class. A lot of reading dense and irrelevant articles, limited class discussion, no organization, vague assignments, unrealistic expectations. Don't take her for CF!",0
"My second class with Dr. Crockett in four semesters.  Might be the best instructor in the program, a consensus favorite among students.   Academically rigorous and inviting at the same time.  Perfect balance of lecture and open discussion.  Brilliant without arrogance.  Models counselor traits, and will go out of her way to help you succeed.",1
"Dowding's class looks hard when you get the syllabus, but it's not as terrible as it seems. There's a load of reading and writing assignments, but he gives opportunity to rewrite and raise your grade. He gets more helpful as the semester progresses and tells you exactly how to edit. You'll learn valuable skills needed for the real world from this.",1
"Ms. Walker is very unorganized, won't make time for you, and doesn't care about her students at all. I asked her for help when I was struggling n quizzes and her advice was to change my major because I wasn't good enough to be a nurse. Seriously, she's rude and doesn't care cuz she's head of department. Worst professor I've ever had DON'T TAKE HER!",0
This class isnt hard but she gives essays back to back & grades tough.,0
"She only taught one section so her focus all about her students. She loves teaching and she's just genuinely kind. Always emails back & answers Q's. Tests: study the vocab and charts! Group project was actually fun. She gives you clear expectations. Final was rough, A LOT to remember. She has a fun night class and I would definitely recommend!",1
Prof. Tucker is so sweet understanding and understands communications throughly. She keeps up to date with current forms of communications so well!!,1
Overall good professor. Class is well organized. Give homework in every class but easy to finish within class. Do work on time and show up. Strict with deadline. He will give you genuine feedback. Respect Dr. G,1
"If you like macintosh then you will do fine in this class.  if you think it is an inferior, overpriced product you will not succeed in this class.",0
I loved his lectures and the reading material wasn't too bad. There are few assignments and they are pretty easy if you keep up with the lectures and reading. I would definitely recommend him.,1
Quizes and Homework are totally different from whatever he taught in class. I litterally only leanred from textbook and the Internet. Not recommending him for this course.,0
"4 major assignments miss one and you are done for. Class is very work/essay heavy. Be prepared to write a lot. No makeups, no extra credit",0
"She was the sweetest professor, thanks to her I discovered my love for Sociology and Social work. Her class isnt tough the PowerPoints and self explanatory and so are her reviews I really enjoyed her class. I was a Sociology major, which is why I was interested in taking this course. Her class is an easy A if you just show up and pay attention.",1
I did not like human animal. She is a tough grader and picks favorites.,0
"Expect to do lots of online homework (sapling) to understand the material being presented, and self teach.",0
This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend.,0
"Professor Riggs is very pleasant! He will remind you of the quirky grandfather off of a sit-com. To be successful in this class be sure to stay ahead on the readings. Practice the math, especially from the end of the chapters (online) and from lecture. Try not to memorize formulas but familiarize yourself with them. Most of all, go to SI.",1
"If online, skip her. She's terrible. Uploads videos of lectures where she just reads off the PowerPoint without explaining things properly. She rushes through everything. You seriously won't learn anything from her. Not hard to pass but she's a terrible online instructor. She offers extra credit which helps your grade but I wanted to learn...",0
"He's young and new, when he walked in we all thought he was a student. The class is SUPER easy, he seems to know what he's talking about. Lab was the best part, lecture (his part) was very boring, only 10 people came to lecture the last 5 weeks. What's important is the CODE for online not so much the book. Do the study guides and tests are 100%.",1
Gives you too many questions without enough time to do them since you cant use a calculator,0
"For goodness sake he gives you the test before hand.  Take the 2 hours out of your day to read over the test and memorize some information and poof, A.  On top of that he gives you the opportunity for extra credit.  Honestly, I don't know how people failed his tests.  I will agree, if you are a visual learner, he tends to speak most of his lecture.",1
I dont like math,1
"The worst teacher I've had. If this is your first time taking a college class talk to your advisor and make sure you don't get her. Incredibly vague in her directions and gets upset when you ask for clarification, just citing the directions again. I went into this class with a passion for writing. Not so much anymore. Way too hard for English 101",0
"If you enjoy hearing the word ""um"" incessantly, this class is for you.  Prof Miiler is a terrible teacher.  Don't let her nonsense critiques of your papers fool you...she honestly doesn't know what she's doing.  If I were you, stay away!",0
Ms. Aguilar is more of a lecturer so be prepared to listen as soon as you sit down till you leave. She grades pretty difficult in English 1302. Always be there and never skip unless it is an emergency.,0
"Yates is a wonderful and competent professor! You can definitely learn a lot from her if you just listen. She provides all the slides and key terms for the tests. Her lectures are interesting and informative and her experience in the field is noteworthy. Do the work, listen, study, and appreciate having an amazing professor.",1
"This class was my first class at NOVA, and I was feeling very nervous at the beginning of the semester, but Professor Mancini made me feel right at home. Very funny and casual environment, but I still learned things I didn't know before. She was always happy to answer any questions, and was super chill. Course work wasn't very challenging either.",1
Very very hard class. Professor Alse seems like a really smart guy but is not a very good teacher at all. His in class lectures are just all over the place and are really hard to follow I had an easier time understanding the material by reading the book.  His tests are extremely difficult be prepared to study all day and all night before the test.,0
"Dr. Knight is one of the nicest professors on CSU campus. He cares so much for his students and is very understanding of the student's morale as the semester goes on. You need to study for his tests, but as long as you pay attention in class (which isn't very hard; they're so interesting), you're going to be okay. A true bona fide cowboy for sure.",1
"Don is such a beauty. He is hilarious and made a late night lecture fun and exciting to attend, even online. He is a great prof and made a math-heavy class easy to understand for someone like me who is not a math person. He made me enjoy finance and inspired me to pursue more classes in finance/accounting for a career. 10/10",1
"I don't know WHAT some of these people are talking about.  First of all, if you are not willing to talk and argue with ""femanist liberals,"" then what exactly makes you want to do English? I have found that all POV's are considered with good supportive evidence.  If she seems cold, try to show her how interested u r in the class, u may be surprised!",1
"she gave 19 problems for the final exam... HW due in class at 8 a.m. Though she did not take attendance, she use quizzes to drag you out of bed......",0
"Professor Rice is one of the best math instructors in the math department. He has a great sense of humor and is always in a good mood. He is very well respected and doesn't say anything rude to anybody in the class. Anybody who needs to take a math course to strengthen their skills, I highly recommend this professor!",1
"If taken online get ready for a lot of reading and movies. Weekly group projects, reading, and busy work.",1
Blah. This class held so much promise yet it was totally uncaptivating and I hardly got anything out of it. I think 99.9% of the class was asleep at any given time. So many examples were presented for a single concept it was hard to keep them all straight. The seminar saved this class; it was a fair amount of work and useful.,0
The class is hard!!!! if you want to get a good grade your are going to have to study a lot read all your notes that you take in class... if you want an easy class this is not the right one ... if you want to learn and do homework and study a lot this is the right class for you!,0
Super chill!  Easily the best professor I've had so far.,1
HE IS THE WORST. i would never take him again. he picks favorites. when he lecture he goes all over the place. worst teacher i ever had.,0
Nan is a great lady but she grades really hard. If you are having trouble go to her office hours or ask for help because she will help you with a lot. She does have a bit of an accent but her lectures are very clear and concise. She gives a couple quizzes on the reading (which is a free online textbook) and tests on lectures.,1
"I took her online class this past semester. Lots of forum posts in the online class, but helps you understand the short stories and poems. The class greatly improved my writing.",1
"Great professor. Lectures are easily understandable. Just expect to do lots of work. He worked at WD at the same time which was impressive, and has recently moved on towards Google. Good luck fam",1
"I took her for ENC1101 and then recently again for ENC1102. She's honestly one of the best professors at Broward College. She's awesome, caring and funny! She's clear on what she expects and she makes the class fun and interesting. I would recommend her to anyone!",1
"Strong educator. Hawk really cares about his students individually. He wants you to become a better writer, and provides great feed back to help you improve. He also gives you many extra credit opportunities. The workload is light. Two 2,000 word papers and a weekly response of 300 words. I definitely recommend taking his class.",1
"She is a great professor. Review the power point she creates in canvas and even though her quizzes in canvas are not part of your grade they are a great tool to study with. Attendance to labs are a must , 10 points for each lab which will boost your grade nicely . She also has great test reviews on canvas to study from. Easy to talk to.",1
I am taking her this semester and by far she has taught me the most in any English course I've ever taken. The people who are commenting harsh things are kids who 1) never show up 2) expect a grade to be handed to them 3) didn't try to understand the material. She's very understanding and will help you if you help yourself.,1
"Not the best, doesn't keep the classes attention.",0
"Grade your papers based on criteria she never mentioned before, or only telling you  after you submitted your paper. Often doesn't care about sound arguments as long as you criticize every thing. Worst professor in four years at the university. ",0
"avoid this lab instructor...She has a serial killer look to her. Very hard marker and I know this because I took my work to the other two lab instructors and they both agree the mark should be higher. Maybe she means well but honestly, it is stupid the deductions she give...just avoid, go to Melissa's section",0
Maybe he is a better teacher in person but I have learned very little from this online course. Some problems are explained through videos but many of the videos are extremely confusing and unhelpful. Plus $80 for mandatory WebAssign membership even though the point of City College is to be free/cheap and accessible to all. Worst online course imo,0
She is the best.,1
"Sometimes unclear, but boring class.",0
"I took this class during winter session. So it was a 6 week accelerated course, with a lot of information to take in, in a very short period of time. She did an excellent job of covering the material so everybody could understand it, and was willing to help students personally if they were confused on anything.",1
Dr Schwartz definitely cares about the students.  He wants you to do well by learning the material. Had extra classes to help and even had a special class on a Saturday.  He's there for you if you study. I'd take him again,1
"He live streams and records his lectures so you don't have to attend in person. He has good examples and I had a good understanding of the material. Seemed like he had other priorities this semester. Didn't send out ANY grades for our labs/hw. Often canceled class or said ""online class today"" like 3-4 hrs before class and was late a lot too, idk",1
"Very difficult to understand her teaching style. She isn't really one to answer any questions as her excuse is ""I don't have enough time"" to answer them. Her grading style is very off and seems a little unrealtic to pass the class. I don't recommend taking her if your math skills aren't up to par. She's not one to go into detail about.",0
Very picky when grading!,0
He is hands down the best teacher I had at Pace so far. He is extremely passionate about the subject and its contagious. If you are having trouble with something he is the type of teacher that will go to all ends to make sure you understand. There's a lot of work but he gives you till the end to make up  any missing work up. TAKE HIM!!,1
"Mr Phelps is probably one of the worst professors I've had.  Leave it to Phelps to start working on Test 4 material before you even take Test 3 (yeah, he does that).  If you ask him for help or clarification he says ""Ask someone else."" He has the assumption that everyone on earth loves art as much as he does. Beware of Mr Phelps",0
A great teacher who cares about her students! Had extra review sessions during her office hours and was always happy to work out extra problems when students asked. Plenty of extra credit also. If you want to ensure an A in this class I strong suggest you work out all the hw problems even though she doesnt take it up for a grade.,1
"Great teacher, interesting during class and helpful when you have questions. Has a very difficult project, so make sure to employ his office hours. Great 208 teacher.",1
"veru tough professor,at the same time she does not have the gift for teaching. avoid her.",0
Her accent is so thick that I barely understood half the material. She can't really teach otherwise either. Doesn't provide solutions half the time. Doesn't provide feedback. The course was hard on its own but the lack of her teaching skills made it worse.,0
"This teacher is easy to take. Do the work and the quizzes and you will pass. Yes, the book is needed but it's not too hard. The Exams are however because they are 100 questions in 1 hour. It's crap but I made a 71 the first time and a 50 on the last one. It sucks.",1
Schubert's Math 5A class was difficult. He expects you to know everything that he's teaching already. He works on problems on the board and basically solves it & talks to himself and asks the class if what he was doing was right and that's basically the whole lecture. He doesn't teach you how to solve the problem or say why he's solving it that way,0
She is the worst,0
"Kenney definitely knows his stuff. His essay exams are taken from the notes and some from the readings but, He speaks VERY quickly and I recommend a tape recorder for those who jot notes slow.",1
"He is no help at all and is just awful, don't know how he has a teaching license.",0
"He is very interesting although he is very confusing...He is a liberal and I'm a republican but when I voiced my opinions, I thought he was very respectfully and would listen to my side of the issue",0
Great prof but the course was sooo hard!,1
"Lady expects us to write a 15 page law school policy brief in 2 days. We would have had more time to think about it and write it, if not for her disorganized teaching style and procrastination! She procrastinates so much and never keeps to her promise. Its really hard to keep up with the class because of her.",0
"Poorly prepared, makes exams unneccesarily hard with picky/tricky questions",0
Professor Hines means well but doesn't come across clear. Took her class for Diversity in the Workplace.  She talks in circles and is confusing.  If the readings say one thing she says another. Be prepared to take notes and fast. She does not post slides and she only leaves them up for a moment in class. She makes each student repeat what they read,0
"I've taken many online courses, and really do prefer them, but Taking this class was a mistake. If you struggle with math, please please please look for another professor or wait a semester. Your GPA isn't worth it!",0
Full points for completed homework. Take little effort to pass the class. I took two of her class last semester. currently taking 1 one of her online class. Best professor ever.,1
"My favorite professor I have ever had. Her class is very difficult but if you make it a point to establish a relationship with her, go to her after/before class and make friends with the smart people in the class you'll do fine. She is a tough grader but her goal is not to see her students fail. Taught me not only science but life lessons.",1
Mr. Lirenso is a good professor. All he really wants is for you to show up on time and do the homework. He does give a lot of homework but most of his stuff is incredibly easy and he is an easy grader. His tests are also the best. It's an open notes test and honestly the only way you can fail this class is if you can not read or speak English.,1
Mr. Bannow is extremely condescending and borderline angry when a question is asked in class. He is obviously a very anxious person and when class gets off track he is visibly annoyed. He will shame you publicly if you give him the chance by asking a question about something he thinks he has covered enough already. You'll learn physics on your own.,0
Terrible professor. Becomes side tracked really easily. Often didn't come prepared to class with a lesson plan and made us sit there with nothing to do until the time ended. You can tell she loves English but she is very unhelpful and you do not learn anything.,0
"She is sooo amazing. She knows her stuff. The tests are very easy if you come to class, you don't even have to read the books if you show up. If not, read, and go to the review class before the test...you'll be gold. Enjoy!",1
"She makes chem so fun! Explains things in an easy, but not juvenile, manner. Would definitely recommend!",1
run away. take a different history class.,0
"Absolutely terrible.  Does not explain how he wants things then gets mad when its not what hen its not what he wants.  Never there, unclear, unhappy, waste of time",0
"she gave lectures well, she just didn't help the struggleing students well.",0
"I really enjoyed his class, probably my favorite out of my junior year courses. Sucks that it was virtual, I could imagine he'd be even better in person. Lecture notes were easy to understand, HW due Monday, Quiz on it Wednesday, Test after three homeworks. Man was realistic in most parts of the course, but I guess a lot didn't see it that way.",1
Got through the class with the help of Google and fellow classmates trying to figure out what she wanted specifically on assignments. If you know JAVA you have a better chance of getting good grades. Would recommend going to other campuses and avoiding taking a class with this teacher if you are not willing to work hard to get the grades you want.,0
Took the Creative Writing class with Professor Daniels. He explained everything in an easy-understanding way and related many things to real life. He's also very chill as a person. Wish I would have gotten more feedback though for my writing though.,1
"Nice but seems unorganized and unprepared. Essay assignments make no sense. Unnecessarily repetitive. The class was online for me, so it could be different in person.",0
"1. 20+ pages per elementary report, any less than that forget about getting above 80 and that's if he doesn't take off 20 points for nth like he always does. 2. Impolite, no professional attitude. 3. the most useless prof ( not sure why he is called so ) in the whole school ( so far ) 4. this dude needs to chill, it's only 1credit. AVOID and REPORT",0
"She really needs to learn to review her answers for some of the ""pop quizzes"" she gives. Some answers were marked wrong. TA was rather useless. Too many tests and assignments. Research is mandatory or you will not pass. I wouldn't recommend her online class.",0
"Great professor. Be prepared to do a lot of work though. He places the learning responsibility square on your shoulders, but is also there to help. He tends to give word banks even when he says ""don't count on it"" just to surprise students. Enjoyed his class a lot.",1
"Super sweet and understanding Prof. Basically to pass this class you need to take notes on every assigned chapter, which I didn't mind b/c I found everything interesting. Using the review list to know what to specifically take notes on is useful too. Well structured each week, 2 attempts on every test (even the final), ezpz.",1
"This was my favorite class this semester. Research and writing about new media and social media. Time in class is never too demanding, but I always felt like what he talked about was useful. And his comments on essays are really helpful. (also, I got a 95% on one of our essays, so I don't know what the comment below me is talking about!)",1
She's a very nice teacher just do your work and make sure all assignments are on time she doesn't like late work. If you do whats expected which isn't much you will for sure to get an easy A. This class has helped me especially since i'm not big on speaking in front of people but she made it simple and easy.,1
"Refuses to publish his powerpoints, read the textbook and pay attention to his study guide to figure out what type of test he's giving this time. Unsure if he's just new to the job or what, but he was completely inconsistent in assignments. Also regularly says inflammatory things to get discussions going. ",0
"We did not use our books once. We started taking notes in the first week of class (because that's what he told us to do), but the more days went by, the less people were taking notes. Everyone ended up stopping and just stared at the powerpoints for the last few weeks. He only makes us write papers (legit every weekend) and harasses specific people",0
"There are 0 lectures posted, tons of trivial comments involved and really no lessons from the professor himself. You're teaching yourself, meanwhile he's constantly sending threats out about cheating every week and taking points off for nothing.",0
"Very boring, assignments and exams unrelated",0
"He is a great professor but his class includes long lectures everyday and there is a lot of reading outside of class. If you don't do the reading it will be tough, especially for the in class clicker questions. There are a few quizzes that are heavily weighed.",1
She is an awful teacher. Its her way or else you fail.,0
not a good teacher avoid at all cost. oh believe me..,0
"Ali is one of the best professor ever.  He is very nice, approachable and helpful.  He is also very knowledgable in the area of emergency management.  Strongly recommended to take his class.",1
"Is angry before the class even starts. Yells every word for no reason. Takes enjoy in humiliating you in front of the class and loves to make you feel stupid. Ive been taking classes for a couple years and Ive never had a professor so inappropriate, rude, and condescending.",0
"If you have any doubt or question, he will answer back with another question. He does not care about telling you the answer. Lectures are very boring too. The content of the class is good and the programming assignments are nice and challenging.",0
"Worst prof. ever. Made the class extremely difficult. Doesn't know what he is talking about. Not clear, not helpful, just a all around D!ck. Made sexest commments which he thought nothing of. He should be fired before given another class to teach. If you want to fail take him, if you want to pass and understand the material, stay clear. DO NOT TAKE",0
Study hard for these tests. The lectures are all power-point but Dr. Hill does a great job interacting with the class even though there are over 200 people. The clickers really help involve the class as well. Dr. Hill certainly knows her material in the class so do not hesitate to ask a question and she'll gladly help you out.,1
Very strict professor AVOID him.,0
The amount of homework given is out of this world and it counts for 20% of your grade. That was the hardest thing for me in this class. But for her tests if you study the reviews she gives you will get a good grade on your tests.,0
"Professor Henderson did a great job relating topics to what was going on in the world. Even though the class was online, it felt like a real classroom environment. She provided us with tons of resources to help complete assignments and walked us through things if we needed more help, which was great!",1
"I had AP credit for Calc 1 but decided to retake it. If you have not taken calculus before, I would not recommend doing it with Chester. Lectures are boring, and he makes a lot of mistakes on the board. Expect to learn everything in discussion. Luckily, the examples in the book and discussion worksheets are nearly identical to the tests.",0
"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",0
"Ms. Carter was professional and consistent with her teaching and helpful qualities. She applied real life examples of her work to the lessons so that we could understand the material  rather than memorizing, which most are use to Students who had issues with her were those who thought they would get good grades and not work for it Class had several",1
"He is the worst professor I have had and ruins the college experience. I understand about staying on task, but he isn't clear about any of the assignments he assigns. The papers that he grades, he grades inefficiently. We had an assignment on notes, notes about myself, and I did not recieve full credit. Makes no sense. Just terrible!!!",0
"Professor Jackson does give a good amount of work but hes very on top of everything. He posted our assignments for basically the whole semester right away, and every week is the same assignment for different chapters so you catch on pretty quick. For exams ALWAYS WATCH THE LECTURES!!! MOST OF HIS QUESTIONS COME FROM THERE!",1
"Unless you enjoy terrible teachers, do not take Dr. O'Gorman's class.  He is as liberal as they come, and he thinks that everyone is a political science major (and he grades accordingly).  I can honestly say that he is the worst professor I have ever had.",0
"Long boring lectures, her quizzes were straight forward, the class project was super easy BUT her midterm and final were ridiculously difficult!The Midterm was multiple choice and free response, questions were hella specific and totally unexpecting.The final was similar to the final but more straightforward. Advice:STUDY EVERYTHING!Take good notes!",0
"She does lecture, however, she makes the class go by fast! I loved her and everyone in class enjoyed having her as a professor!! She knows the material and teaches well! She is respectful and professional. This gives students the confidence and the motivation to work hard and achieve their goals! TAKE HER!!!",1
Very hilarious and raw with his choice of words.  Gives many life lessons within his lectures. Very easy going and still teaches us more than we've ever learned before. He gives us a lot of opportunities to make a great grade due to a lot of assignments through the week. The tests are easy if you prepare! Offers many opportunities for group work!,1
"Very confusing at times, sometimes wasnt very clear. But this class was super easy! Just show up and he usually gives you an A for effort.",0
"i personally thought he was really great, helpful, enthusiastic and funny, though i could see how others in the class were not on the same page as him and thus did not really enjoy the class. he comes across as kind of laid back but you really have to work hard on the assignments cause he sees through people's BS. fun and interesting class though.",1
"Fran is an incredibly amiable person. She cares deeply about her students, going extra lengths to make SURE those who ask understand a concept. I think she is an excellent teacher, instilling core concepts well. That said, she is not especially easy, but well worth the experience. You will leave as a better chemist. You will never feel left behind.",1
"Awesome teacher! Discussions online were really interesting. Reaction articles were very interesting as well. Read the notes, read the chapters,complete the chapter reviews, and you will get an A!",1
"Perucci is the best of the best at UNC. He is extremely knowledgeable and wants his students to succeed. Always available during office hours, and always eager to teach. Attendance is mandatory, and every day you dont show up is 5 points deducted from your final. However, showing up to class was not problem because of how fun this class was.",1
"I really hope she reads these and sees the feedback. This class was horrible. Way too many readings, responses, quizzes, and some nice 50 question exams. Most professors choose either a long multiple choice or a full essay, but she does both. WAY too much work total for 100 level class.",0
"This was the first time I had taken Dr. Schreiber. I found her to care about her subject matter and to be an expert in her field. She also cares about her students. She is a tough grader, but fair, and instructions are clear, as is her syllabus. I would definitely take her again.",1
"She is a great professor i learned so much from her class! She teaches in a much more visual way than most profs, which is great! Her tests will kick your ass, but it's worth it!",1
"During this class it was a cold case institute, due to the pandemic we werent able to continue in person but Professor Massnick made it easy for us to make sure we get our work done online and made it adjustable and helped us out with the assignments/quizzes",1
Professor is not much help when needed.,0
"Un autre club social, ce professeur n'hésite pas à parler de n'importe quoi, même si il n'y aucun lien avec la matière qui sera évalué. Si vous aimez les débats, les discussions, c'est un cours pour vous. Les évaluations sont facile car il n'y a pas tant de matière que ca. Aller aux conférences, lisez les (courts) textes et ca devrait alelr.",1
"If you need an upper level elective in IT or similar major this is a solid choice. Very reasonable workload, relevant and interesting material, and an overall nice guy teaching.",1
"Mr. Crittenden taught survey of math for the first time when the previous professor fell through. He seems like a genuinely caring man who wants his students to succeed. He writes everything out on the board, helps you if you need it, and lets you retake tests. His lectures can be a bit relaxing but you just need to bring some coffee to class!",1
"She really thinks she is an intellectual, and will hold it over anyone who doesn't meet her standards. Snobby and unpleasant to learn from. Demeaning. She needs to work on her personal issues and know when to leave them at the door. There are better teachers at BCC.",0
"Had him for OB. Great professor, one of the best in Paul. If you ever get a chance to take a class with him, do it. The midterm was in essay format. For the final we had a group project. ",1
"This class did not feel like an intro class. 4 exams and 3 papers, and worksheets that were basically quizzes in discussion. The material he presents was very, very heavy and a lot to process. Gives study guides for exams but it wasn't much help. Exams were tough! goodluck",0
"She gives a review the lab before the practical. However, it is misleading because she would say certain parts would not be on the test but it ends up being on the test. She also takes points off for spelling. You are better off reading the manual. It is a hard lab for an already hard class.",0
The way she teaches is confusing. She expects you to know how to do problems before she explains them and then when you don't know the answer she acts like your stupid. The class average for the second test we took was 60%. Then she gave us a 25 minute lecture about how we should have done better.,0
He basically just takes the textbook and turns it into a slide show.  You do not have to go to class.  His lectures put me to sleep.  He is strict no electronics in class.,1
"she is an alright teacher, so borring though and its 4 tests in all and she dropes the lowest garde. The clas itself is borringa dn she makes ven more  , half the time i text,",1
"Took his night class.... bad idea. All he does is talk and talk, and rants about other random stuff. Don't get me wrong he is funny, but that doesn't make up for other stuff. He literally has to walk up to you in order to hear what you said. STAY AWAY lol",0
"He's a terrible professor. His transition from lecture to HW to tests makes no sense. I did so poorly in his class that he made me reconsider my entire major. DO NOT TAKE!!!! His entire class was a waste of time. If you have him, switch!! He has to curve ridiculous amounts and even admitted there were questions on the test none of us could answer.",0
"Heather is one of the best professors Ive ever had. I had her as a sophomore and now a senior. She is tough, but she wants everyone to succeed. She is extremely helpful and reachable. She gives amazing advice and is always there when you need her!!",1
Great teacher! I learned a lot.,1
"Beware she will test you on information that she does not cover, nor say to read in text book. Also you can write what you think is the right answer, but she will mark it wrong. When you ask her for anything she is not approachable, and is arrogant and rude. She puts students down in and out of class, and shouldnt be a professor period.",0
"She speaks clear English, and has discussion questions in class to be turned in for credit each day. Rated a two because if you show up to her limited office hours (1.5 hours a week), she acts like you are bothering her and barely answers your questions because she wants you to do the work.",0
"very smart prof & interesting lectures that basically talk about the reading assigned the night before to help you understand exactly how it relates to class. weekly 1pg writing not very hard, papers suck but not impossible. no text book just had small books to read for each unit.. great class over all highly recommended :)",1
This professor was AMAZING! Best professor for business law! 3 tests and 4 group projects. She's very knowledgeable. I would take her over again!,1
"Nice class, Highly recommended. An easy A class. You have a 250 words discussion every week based on a book and need to reply to some of your peers and their is a final paper, that's it! Organized online class, but you wont hear from her replying on emails as often.",1
3 things: Physio- study a day before test. anatomy study- 2/3 days before. Physio-use powerpoints/ and chp. summaries. make sure to understand everything on study guide. Easy class idk y ppl dont do well.,1
"FABULOUS instructor! My favorite one yet, take notes and you'll do fine on the test, they're straight from the notes. Extremely friendly and a great professor. His class helped me make up my mind about my major(I'd been going back and forth)and I changed it to Music Education. Best Professor at ODU!",1
"She's really nice and willing to help if you go to her office hours. However, yes, she's quite a tough grader. She's very specific and wants it done her way. I feel like I never really got to know her personally, though. Kind of removed and forgetful about individual students.",1
"Il parle surtout d'histoires personnelles et de lui durant les cours, n'explique pas très bien et ne fait jamais d'expemples au tableau il fait simplement montrer le corrigé des exercices et commenter rapidement. Bref, je ne recommande pas ce prof!",0
"Teaches the class like it's some 6 unit 400 level class... very hard exams and quizzes. Her lectures often have nothing to do with quizzes and exams and just feel like a waste. So if you are unlucky to take this class, get ready to teach yourself.",0
"He doesn't explain what to do for projects clearly so you might miss up on some. He doesn't stick with the syllabus. The experience was weird to me, I ended up passing with a C.",1
"Professor Simerka is a very intelligent person. She really knows her stuff and is a huge intellectual. Nevertheless, her grading style is too harsh and the subject matter was a little dry. Although she is good at making you feel insufficient, she does care about her students and is always willing to make the time to meet one on one to discuss grade",1
"She is a sweetheart but stern in her class. You will work for an A, and she is very clear about the outcome of her class. She will answer any question, half of the class is online and quizzes are open book online, don't miss the deadlines because the system will close it. Two easy essays a specific topic, prepare to speak (timed) in front of class",1
Dr. Morgan is super nice and laid-back...you'll feel comfortable asking him absolutely anything and he will definately help you learn..his lectures are clear and he writes notes on the board...6 quizzes that are super easy if u just skim the lab b4hand and he drops one...the tests are more difficult but just study and u can definately get an A,1
Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She drags on everything we do. I would never recommend taking her. Incoming freshman beware she is heartless.,0
Lectures are completely pointless but sometimes there are in class responses that she takes attendance off of (which is 15% of your grade).  The majority of her class is her reading quotes off of her slides. Very annoying class but assignments are easy,0
"Good lecturer with field activities. Seems like a nice guy but his tests are deceivingly tricky. Overlaps well with book; some assigned readings. B is very doable, A is hard to get.",1
"He's the best teacher, he made history fun and easy to learn. his class is lectures mainly so beware, and all you do for assignments is a few essays",1
"Worst teacher ever!!! Tough greater, doesnt even teach but expects you to know everything and she will report you if you forget to cite anything. Shes absolutely terrible this lady should be fired, not a teacher at all!",0
21. Which of the following [b]statements[/b] is/are least untrue? a) Dr. Lai's class is easy.  b) Laboratories are not tremendously difficult.  c) Dr. Lai's class is [b]somewhat[/b] boring.   d) all of the above.  e)  a) and c) only.,1
"This was the worst and most unorganized instructor in spanish.He fails to use any visual aids, no handouts, no powerpoints, spreaks only in spanish with a satuated accent, fails to answer any emails, hardly use the blackboard, grades unfairly, and gets mad if he finds out you reported him, takes it out on the class, he is a terrible instructor!!!!!",0
"The class design makes grades heavily reliant on timed exams, which unfortunately are on applications of the assignments which no student would understand unless a student has taken the course or some equivalent before.  This places students who don't have the proper background at a disadvantage.  I learned a lot, but I'm worried about my grade.",0
She is awful. I took her for Soc201 and there was one test worth 49% of the grade. She takes forever to respond to emails and is not understanding at all even if youre a good student. She overcomplicates concepts and moves really fast in class. She does not care if students succeed. Do not take her class if you can help it.,0
"Extremely helpful, made learning the topics fun and easy. Loved her job which made learning the material a lot easier. Cared about her students and how they were all doing. Dropped a bunch of low grades and assignments.",1
Hardest class I've ever taken. The tests were impossible. I had a CPA help me with the assignments and they had problems.,0
"Dr. Bates is a great teacher and shows great interest in her job and research area. She is very easy to talk to, entertaining during classes, and gives a fair work load. Attendance is not taking for her intro classes, however as she likes to give pop quizzes it's risky to miss a class. I enjoyed the class and would take another class with her.",1
"She has difficulty speaking English and understanding complicated sentences in English, even though she is an English professor. She would be more appropriate in another department, such as global economics or history. She is often rude. She doesn't seem to like Americans very much.",0
Lover her. Best Professor EVERRRRRRRR. And she's totes easy on the eyes (;,1
"Very fun and enjoyable class. SHe always was lively durning class and kept us all focused and entertained on such a boring subject. Read a story then discuss durning class, day after day with a few neat activities inbetween. I learned to get more out of reading and that professor Jaroff was one of my favorite teachers ever. DEFFINATLY reccomend.",1
"His lectures don't line up with anything that will be turned in for a grade. He does do lectures based on the upcoming lab assignment, but that's just him reading the posted document(s) to the class. He posts most material online and usually will just read off of those during lecture. It's an intro course but background knowledge is required.",0
When it comes to tests this guy does not know what he is doing. His review sheets have little to nothing to do with his tests.,0
"Professor Wigginton thrives on torturing students. She goes out of her way to make assignments and quizzes more difficult. She cancels her office hours almost every week, so when you have questions you have to email her. Then she never responds to emails!! Ever!! Rude and never available. Dont take a class with her if you can help it!",0
"This guy is probably a good engineering and knows what he is talking about. However his English comprehension SUCKS! He cannot communicate clearly with the class, mumbles his words, mis-spells on the board, and when a question is asked he doesn't really understand what is being asked. Although he is a nice guy, he isn't a good teacher period. ",0
"He seems that he has a lot of information, takes his time in the lectures, side tracks a lot.  He has good stories, but he really doesn't get to a point. Attendance was not mandatory because it was an iTV class but you had to email him the homework. He DOES NOT collect the homework AT ALL!!! the quizess were okay. but i won't take this teacer again",0
"Mrs. Johnson did voice her opinion, but she has said from the beginning you dont have to agree with her and was always opened to hear other students views. I wouldnt take this class if you get easily offended, but in my opinion it was a great class, easy assignments, and she was a sweet lady.",1
"Very, very helpful. If you have a question, he answers it quickly. He jokes when the time is appropriate, and so far my favorite teacher I've ever had.",1
"Not very helpful when taking his online class- he only answers some questions that are asked, and even then he is kind of rude about it!",0
"I used to be a music major before I switched to Physics. Even with my background this class is dull and uninteresting. Had I known before, I would not have taken the class; not because it was difficult but because it was tedious.",0
"This was the hardest gen ed I have ever taken. The test were difficult, and the writing we have to do is graded very harshly. His lectures are very interesting and it shows he loves what he teaches but the work that we have to do in that class is horrible. 3 test that over a handful of people failed? That should not happen in a gen ed",0
Doesn't grade or give feedback on the many lengthy assignments till weeks later.,0
He thinks his students know the same things as he does! does a poor job explaining anything in detail. wouldn't take him again and his tests are hard!,0
"No extra credit, impossible exams and quizzes, wording is awful so you dont understand questions. doesnt want students do to well or curve, no one got a good grade.",0
Great Prof! we had a lot of discussions in the class and they were very interesting. She's very fair when it comes to grading and testing.,1
"You need to read a lot by yourself. His grading most on lecture quizzes, but just be careful. And lab quizzes are not hard.",0
"WORST class I have ever taken. The discussion class is misnamed, the tests are impossible to study completely for and the paper outlines are apparently written with the expressed purpose of tricking students. Needs to learn to control the volume of her voice- BADLY.",0
"He's funny.. that's about all the positives I can give. He goes on and on about a subject and then says ""But that won't be on the test"", so basically he wastes like 20 minutes on a single subject that won't even be on the test. His lectures are sloppy and unorganized, and if you ask a question he probably won't understand what you're asking.",0
"INF 100 is an awful class, however, Prof Klatzke attempts to makeup for this, and with it being a 1 credit hour class I cannot fully analyze her as a professor, but I did enjoy talking to her. She is definitely a professor I would take again. She gives really good feedback on assignments and really cares about you.",1
"Interesting topic, monotone teacher.",0
"If you're someone who isn't strong in math, I definitely wouldn't recommend taking her class. She didn't explain things in ways that were all that helpful to me. Gives a lot of homework/quizzes - these also left me confused majority of the time.",0
"DO NOT TAKE!! If you expect to be taught the fundamentals in this intro course then do not take this class with this professor. He doesn't teach. 3/4 of my class dropped him including myself. Knowledgeable and nice person, but he is a terrible teacher.",0
You don't attend Thurs and have DBs about movies instead those days. Proceeded to look around at what people said the movie was about then pretend I watched it too. Final project poorly explained. No lectures in class; all you do is discuss assigned readings in groups. Why is this not an online class? Ugh. I couldn't take her seriously.,0
"I learned a lot and worked hard, but my grade did not reflect my efforts. The highest grade on assignments/exams is usually a B. Average grade is barely passing. You will learn a lot in her class, but at the cost of your GPA; no matter how hard you work.",0
"While Jen herself is nice, her quizzes don't line up with what is covered and are worth 25%. She gives 15 minutes for 10 question quizzes. She often says not to worry about things and then puts them on the quiz. She picks small phrases from the text instead of main concepts. Effort and putting in the work do not really correspond to grades.",0
"Great prof., very helpful.",1
Great professor. Very intelligent and easy to understand. The best advice is to READ THE BOOK!! All of her tests come straight out of the book and not from lecture. Tests are very difficult but the class is fun overall.,1
"She's an awesome professor. The class is an easy A in my opinion as long as you do the work required. Theres about 12 labs, but you only have to do 8. There are 10 discussion boards, but you only have to do 8. 4 easy quizzes, but you have to do 3. 2 tests, but you can bring a note card. If you do the extra labs then you get extra credit. Easy A.",1
She is an excellent teacher. She give fair grades and give interesting assignment to do. She is the best teacher you could ask for.,1
"Prof. Ferrero's class was a delight. You can tell she's passionate about the subject as her class is designed for student success. Course has 4 exams based directly off her powerpoints, one project, and always fun activities at the end of class to help with curriculum comprehension. She also adds in interesting facts into her lectures, a real gem.",1
Online class - Prof is very vague and incredibly inconsistent in stating what he wants and in dealing with students.  Not in touch with the real world at all.  He's a classic example of someone who is probably book smart but has no common sense.,0
"Took this class online. Was kinda confusing to me, but Professor McLawhon has outlines for you to follow to help clarify things. Tests are real easy, no time limit so you have time to look up answers. Group discussion, and weblink assignments for each chapter. Keep copy of all tests with correct answers. Will use them when you take the final exam.",1
She talks a lot.,1
This is my second time taking this class. He's a far grader. If you do the work you'll pass. Simple. You have to keep up with postings and due dates. He's far!,1
"Extremely unorganized. She expects you to be in class but was late for class a lot herself or cancelled. She didn't seem to know what she was doing. Required three textbooks for the class, more reading involved than English classes. She required you to also write 5 papers. Her PowerPoints were extremely long, and her lectures were boring and dry.",0
"He really shows he cares about the students especially since online school during a pandemic is TOUGH. All assignments were case studies, same formatting for all so it was a bit redundant by the end. Follow his criteria and you'll do fine in this course!",1
"Avoid this guy..Worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of taking a course from. Like the others have said, BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF! He hardly ever lectures and when he does they hard to follow and boring. He has the students do the homework prior to class and then has the students provide the answers. This guy is in it for the paycheck.",0
"Has the ""fun teacher"" personality but publicly exploits students when they do something wrong or harps on when they ask a question he doesn't feel like answering. Also provided mandatory course content that wasn't even accessible for most students and told them to ask classmates to do it. Basically could fail if a classmate doesn't do me a favour.",0
best online class i ever took. she is a great professor and cares about her students passing her class. responds quickly to emails. 4 exams and 2 assignments only for the whole semester!,1
Professor Fitzpatrick was such an amazing professor. She is willingly to help on any essay she has assigned and is very concise with her comments on essays. She encourages her students to do well and is very passionate about the subject she teaches. I would love to take more of her classes.,1
"I could not stand this professor. Dashley was one of the worst math teachers I have ever had. She was just completely rude when a student would ask a question. By the end of the semester, no one wanted to participate because she was so degrading in her responses. Also, how she grades your homework is ridiculous...",0
I took a class in the spring with Professor Rios-Freund and she tells the funniest stories while also teaching us the grammar and culture. She's an excellent teacher! She is very easy to understand and always answers questions after class. ,1
"HORRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Acts like you have your degree, gets mad at questions, arrogant, rude and makes you feel dumb. Dont let your gpa suffer. She explains nothing clearly and goes super quick in power points. Chem is about memorizing but she gave us a whole chart to memorize 2 days before an exam. Absolutely the worst",0
I loved having Professor Mejico as my teacher for PSY120! He is so passionate about what he does and it shows through his teaching. Lectures were great and did not occur in every class. He did a lot of hands-on activities that were super eye-opening and inspirational. He made class online on Fridays so we only had class twice a week.,1
"Dr. Ingram is a good man, that I will not argue. However, his lectures can be hard to follow and contain a strong bais in favor of his own political views. If you disagree with those views in your essays, you may not do as well as others.",0
"Alison is a force to be reckoned with.  She is the sole reason I am a success today.  Her course is very intense and time-consuming.   The goal of her class is, to make you as a student, ready for the intensity of NCCC's nursing program and I promise you, you'll thank her one day. She cares! So put on your big kid pants, and work for it:)",1
She's fine. Nothing great.,1
Yes the coarse is tough but you cannot blame the professor for that. He genuinely cares about his students and would like to see them do well. He knows his subject is difficult so he gives online hw that you can redo as many times as you want until you receive 100% and he also offers extra credit which. Would take it again if I had to take it again,1
She is a very helpful lady. No need for book in health and wellness. Highly recommend to take with this professor.,1
"Professor Higgins made 8:50 AM mornings amazing. Her lectures were always informative and directly reflected the exams. She made the class personal and you could tell she really cared about what she was teaching. The class used TopHat a lot and there was a good amount of reading that was put on the exam. Overall, highly recommend!",1
First time teaching Photoshop CIS120. Used the book extensively.  Unsure of  how-to stuff.  He moved really fast and tried to please all the Photoshop pros in class instead of teaching an intro class.   I didn't learn much except for the book. Homework was fun so I think he will get  better with experience.,0
Dr. Mangone's lectures were engaging and he explained the concepts well. The tests were very fair: know all the information from the lectures and you will be fine.,1
One of my worst college professors ever. She knows that material herself but can't explain it at all. I wouldn't even recommend this class. You really need extra tutoring and like help from multiple people. She literally only explains things once and will ignore your question is hse doesn't understand it or she has someone else answer it.,0
"Interesting lectures that are easy to follow. Attendance is 15% of your grade. Easy exams with multiple choice questions. Need to be able to write or type pretty quickly because he goes over a lot, but if you miss anything he will be happy to repeat himself.",1
"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS. In fact, he loves to leave early and leave it up to his TA's to answer 57 questions from a class of 150. Pray that you have Brady as a TA.",0
"Hands-down the worst professor I've ever had. She grades everything harshly and is merciless. She should be fired but the CS dept takes what they can get at this point. Nothing in CS252 makes any sense. She also thinks she's so funny, but she ain't. Do NOT take this class if you don't have to. If you do, good luck comrade.",0
"The professor is awesome. Make sure to pay attention to every detail in class because he will go over most of what to do on assignments and exams, and those things are not easy. Do your best to get help during his office hours.",1
"Rizzella recognizes hard workers when she sees them and is an amazing resource. She is tough, but if you seek her out for help/explanations/ideas, she is a fountain of knowledge. She rewards good, solid effort and thorough work and appreciates when students are clearly interested and involved in her classes.",1
"While she may be friendly, she is an unnecessarily strict grader. She told us once that student's complained that they ""never know what she expects of them"" and why that's ridiculous. She has very specific written instructions, but there are unwritten rules behind those instructions that you don't know until it's too late and you're staring at an F",0
"Dont take this teacher..horrible does not give students credit for the work that they spend days on. Useless class a lot better english teachers out there to take their online class. I do not recommend this teacher at all,especially during summer.",0
"Good lecturer who gives clear specifications of what she wants from you. The topic was really interesting, and she taught it well.",1
"Professor Stewart in one word: awesome. His dry humor kept me awake throughout this intro level course that I'm sure would otherwise be rather dull. He makes the content engaging and interesting, and is always up for a quick chat during office hours in case you missed anything during lecture. If you get the chance, definitely take Stewart.",1
"I've already left a review, but I'm leaving another one because I STILL have not gotten a final grade posted for this class and it's almost Christmas. I can't even enjoy being on break because I keep checking to see if it's been posted yet. Seriously don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
"Senora Pilkington is a very kind professor. If you took a couple of years of Spanish in HS, you will be fine. She will get you up to speed if you feel rusty. Keep up with the homework and ask questions and you should receive an A.",1
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
"Schilling's lectures are boring, but if you just do every single reading, this class is an easy A. Tests are all multiple choice, including the midterm and final, with some easy short answer extra credit questions.",0
"Very surprised that anyone doesn't like Adelle. She is a brilliant woman and her lectures are engaging and thorough. You have to do the readings and go to class to do well, but her course is quite fair and I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in the subject. I honestly didn't mind the readings or going to class because I loved it!",1
He cares about the students.,1
"Dr. Mangone means well when it comes to his students. He knows when you care about the subject and equally knows when you don't. Genetics itself is an incredibly difficult course with a whole lot of information to understand/memorize, but Mangone makes it pretty clear what you need to know. He's not a five star professor for me, but very close.",1
"Mr. Prunty was a really good teacher. I hate math and I'm terrible at it, but his way of teaching stuck with me. His lectures are very simple and to the point. If you have questions, he's always really kind and doesn't make you feel stupid. His classes always flew by. If I had to take another math, I'd definitely take him.",1
"Very hard class. Always got good grades until I took this class. Jumps right into high intellect teaching. Near to impossible to pass. Study guide had over 130 questions, which were hard to study for being that we get it a week before the test. Very very tough grader and tough class. Would not recommend.",0
"SHE IS THE WORST TEACHER EVER. SOOOOO much stress that she has caused me in just one month and i'm not even halfway done with the course yet. Her assignments are like life or death, i feel like i'm dying until i finish them. She doesn't direct you at all and the little directions she gives are so confusing that only she understands. don't do it!",0
"Worst professor I have ever taken, he Doesn't stay on topic instead goes on random rants that have nothing to do with the subject were talking about, can't teach his materials, and knows nothing about religion what so ever. you would be wasting your money worth on this professor.",0
"Don't take her. Anatomy is a hard class already. You don't need to be burdened by a teacher who doesn't know anything about what she is teaching. If you ask her questions about the material, she will tell you to ""Google it"" (Even if it is on material she just went over). Also watch your grades as she won't give you all of yours.",0
Mr. Ed is the reason why iam doing so good in school. the best teacher I ever had.,1
"Very hard to keep up with, knows what he's doing, but not very good at explaining himself. This is the first class I have ever failed. He is also not good at posting grades on blackboard, so you aren't able to see what you have overall in the class. Would not recommend.",0
"He's professional and respectful (calls everybody by their last name e.g. ""Mr. Jones""). The journals and weekly news story readings required a lot of work. His class is one long lecture, but there were a few role playing case studies, which were fun! Overall, do everything he says to get a good grade (participate in the online discussion boards!)",1
"As a person, she is very kind. She's probably a great PT. However, as a professor, I didn't find her lectures helpful (basic overview of anatomy class) and her online materials were not up to date. She used to boast about professionalism and she had moments were she didn't display that quality. The textbook helped and the notes from her PowerPoint.",0
There's a test on every chapter. The tests are extremely long and doesn't come from the book. I spent a lot of time reading and still almost failed every test. Tests don't accurately reflect the textbook readings. There's no discussion boards at all and there's no interaction whatsoever with the professor. She was out of the country a LOT!,0
"She is a strict grader, though she does compensate by raising the grades on the exams so that the student with highest original score ends up with a 95 or 97. There is a lot of homework. She is very willing to help students if they are in trouble or don't understand something. Is a big fan of rubrics in grading to try to be unbiased.",1
"DO NOT TAKE BIOLOGY FROM RISA COHEN! She is the absolute WORST teacher I have ever had in my life. I am an 'A' student and I got a 'C'. Her tests do not reflect anything she taught in class, she gives pointless homework/in class assignments, and she is boring. She is not the least bit helpful and she yells/embarrasses people when they are tardy.",0
Honestly very disappointed in this professor. Took a class I cared about and came out less interested than I started. Meyers is extremely dogmatic and narrow minded for a philosophy professor. He is very set in his way of thinking and presenting opinions other than his will not end well.,0
"There is a difference between constructive criticism and rudeness. When you give constructive criticism, you touch on what the person did wrong AND right. This professor only pointed out everything wrong and nothing right when it came to my work. Needs to learn how to give constructive criticism if she wants to guide students into the real world.",0
"Way too involved for an intro class - if you didn't participate every day, points were deducted. He is very condescending and rude at best, but he definitely knows his stuff. He sent me to the writing center after I turned in a paper, and I told him I worked there (lol). Said the ""tone"" was inappropriate for the in essay exam but refused to explain",0
"terrible professor, more concerned with mind games and messing with students that actually creating a decent learning environment, Avoid at all costs!",0
She is one of the most inappropriate and careless professors I have ever met. She is careless and doesnt care about her students. Take take her classes,0
"Professor Ladon has a lot of knowledge about what she teaches but she teaches the 121 class as if it is a 131 or higher level course. She is belittling when students ask questions and expects students to do numerous hours of studying, whether it be from the textbook or practice problems. She drops the lowest quiz and homework grade.",0
Patronizing and condescending. Made you feel inadequate for answering a question wrong like he had to prove he knew more than his students. Felt like I was paying to boost his ego. Unacceptable for the school to have such a discouraging professor teaching the class that should get students the most excited about pursuing a career in medicine.,0
"Wike was an AMAZING Professor! Her class for me, was overall pretty easy. 2 exams. 1 final and i want to say 6 quizzes, lowest one is dropped. She is very clear on what she expects you to know for the quizzes and exams. The only downside is it's all in essay format. Alot of reading to do! And lectures were dry. But a great teacher! TAKE HER!",1
"-presentations sound like the announcer for 'The Price is Right', very annoying -takes 3-4 days on average to respond to forum questions -poorly narrated 1-2 hour slideshows, run them at 1.5x to bypass dead-air and slow speech -slideshows are recycled, you can HEAR older errors prior student reviews, ""he's fun!"". gee, this ain't middle school",0
"Poor explanations, assumes students are finance savvy in this basic level course. Handouts were old (2006) with dated content/examples years ago. Crazy curve 74 is an A-tells you about prof teaching style. Wandering lectures went from tangent to tangent. Verbally dismissive to students, poor use of expensive textbook-no glossary in version used",0
"The class is super manageable. If you don't understand a concept or a HW question she is super helpful in office hours, or will respond super quickly to emails. Exams are really fair and the lowest grade drops. The lowest HW grade also drops. The online HW is a bit of a drag but it really helps with exam prep- the exams are easier than the HW.",1
"Jason was by far the worst professer I ever had in my life at the time I took his class. Now looking back at it he is not only the worst professor I have ever had , he is honestly a horrible human being. Very smart guy but doesnt know or care to relate to other ppl. He thinks he is better than everyone.",0
Participation is really important. Gives you homework about stuff that you haven't even learned yet. A lot of break out rooms.,0
"Professor Gibson is one of those professors that you wish for every semester. She is patient and easy-going. There is always work to be done but TRUST ME, she gives ample time. Extra credit and revisions available to everyone who participates in class. Love Dr. G. Awesomeness!",1
"Lois is a trainwreck. For an instructor of a class with the stated aim of ""open-mindedness"" and ""objective analysis"" of political systems, she does nothing but  opine. This leads to a poor educational environment. I don't know how anyone could or would recommend Lois' classes to anyone",0
"He's truly great, he made discussing the books fun. I normally hate being assigned to read books but the things we had to read were interesting and would read again. The only thing is that there IS a lot to read so you have to give yourself time for reading and maybe discussing with classmates or him if you don't understand the texts.",1
I have never failed/dropped a course in my life... except his.,0
One of the worst teachers I had.  Doesn't explain much in class.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone,0
She is nice throughout the semester but does not give any updates about grades. At the end of the semester she basically gives you what she wants you to have. No matter how well you actually did on assignments. She gave our entire class a letter grade below what we actually had because she felt like it. Take her at your own risk!,0
Ms. M was a great teacher. Not very interested in subject but made it very bearable. PowerPoints have lots of info but all of it is needed to build concepts. Replaces lowest grade with attendance % if it helps you. Emails back very quickly and easy grader. Extra credit available. Very nice and approachable. Really - a great prof! Recommended.,1
Good professor,1
He is definitely a very hard professor and his test will test you if you study the material or not. Lecture was not helpful so you will have to learn everything on your own. He is very helpful during office hours and does provide extra credit at end of semester.,0
Does not even try even a little bit too make her class engaging. Not to mention that the lecture and textbook readings are literally word for word. Her tests were tricky and with limited time it was really easy to mess up. Felt that she didn't want to teach or want her students to do well.,0
"She takes 30 min to explain an assignment that could be explained in 5 min--incredibly boring and redundant. In-class assignments every day so you must show up. You'll hate being in class, but the final paper is only 6 pages. 5 papers including one group essay. $50 textbook was only used 4 times. You just need the bare minimum for writing skills.",0
"jUST when you think you have gotten a grip of the class structure She changes the syllabus and expects you to know whats coming next without informing you. WORST Prof EVER. She's not even a prof. She rushes through the material, assigns never ending readings & homework's, gives pop up quizzes, 3 presentations, in class debate, online hw, finals :((",0
Not a tough grader at all but the time limits for quizzes and exams are rough. This professor is knowledgeable and knows his topic but if you arent crazy about art history you will hate this class. Online classes are difficult as it is but this one was a downright struggle for me.,0
"If you have a choice to not take this professor, don't. She seems like genuine human but not a great professor. Never replies to emails!! so good luck! Iv'e sent over 50 emails and heard twice back, and only because I asked her to check during zoom. I don't understand her lectures and she does not record them so if you miss class, good luck!",0
"Very nice guy, cares about students and wants to teach. Lots of reading but they're well picked for what the lectures are about. Tests aren't bad. He'll really encourage participation. Great choice for an introductory class",1
Very Very Very DIFFICULT! I would not recommend her at all! She is a smart ass and does nothing but sit in her chair and read from the book. She expects us to know very little details from page long poems which is nearly immpossible! Just take someone else...,0
"Extremely clear on what he expects, and what he expects is very reasonable. Half the class got A or AB on tests, only one paper. Only downside is mandatory attendance. But he's someone who genuinely wants his students to do well.",1
"I don't understand the tough grading on here. My experience with Dr. Meche is great because I do all the assigned reading. He does, however, ask that the students really read the material and post six separate discussion posts. (at minimum 200 words a pop). I think he just wants us to actually get something out of the class. Clear on criteria!",1
Awful professor to have if your an athlete at the school. I had her and she expects you to learn new material before the class and do the homework that you have not been lectured on. When i had a game i had to miss the class and she would not accept the hw because i was not there to turn it in when i was already gone. Would not take ever again.,0
"He is an awful professor. You can't understand a word he says because he mumbles so bad. If you ask him a question, he repeats the same thing over and over again that doesn't help at all. He's definitely a big part of physics ""teaching you how to teach yourself"" so don't expect much for lectures. Avoid if possible.",0
"Prepare yourself to read and watch a few videos, then discuss the information. If you read the textbook you should do well on the quizzes and tests. I took this course over the summer,  it was intense; and since it was online discussions, homework, and quizzes were all online. Good class, informative, and if you do the work you should easily pass.",1
"Easy class, Dr Sobhi is not a strict guy. But he's not a great teacher. His instructions often vary greatly from what's in the lab manual and when you ask for help, he's incredibly unclear. He doesn't post grades on Blackboard and when he hands back graded papers they just have a number written on top, could be out of 40 or 100. Who knows.",0
"I think he is a unfair grader, He has in his head what he wants to see from you and you have to read between the lines. His curriculum is to complicated, even for him.  All his grading is subjective on papers and essay, you will never get a paper without some comments. He may even mark up his own paper. The material is not hard. He makes it hard.",0
He taught the class so that all could understand. For those that had a lot of prior knowledge and for those that did not were able to learn something from the class.,1
"Of all the horror stories I heard from everyone who took this class from other instructors, Sheila definitely went out of her way to make this class an interactive fun learning experience. Attendance is mandatory, exam questions are straight from lecture, and labs are time consuming but doable. Definitely take her, she makes this class worth it. ",1
Take a different professor. That is all.,0
"Chester Miracle was a great Calc professor. He has been teaching calculus for who knows how many years and has perfected his teaching methods. He uses his own textbooks meaning all of the homework, tests, worksheets and lectures are written in the same format. Pay attention to how Chester works through problems and you can ace every test.",1
"Prof's class is relatively easy but practice lots of math problems to pass. Three quizzes total. Forgets what she says one week to the next. Is generally clear but you never know quite what you need to memorize for an exam and if you're not a nursing major yet, ask a nursing student about types/amounts of shots and insulin mixing. Very approachable",1
"Extremely rude professor. Not very helpful to student responses, more often to just respond with a snark comment. Poor teaching skills, and course coordination skills. Doesn't listen to student feedback.",0
"This was my first time having Prof Hansen, and I enjoyed his class each week. His lectures were insightful, and I could tell that he knew a lot about the books he taught. If you enjoy a class that is discussion and lecture combined , take him!",1
"This is a great class if you want to learn. She is funny and keeps the lectures interesting. Make sure you do the reading because she will call on you. Study for the tests and take good notes. Not a lot of homework, and the homework that is assigned is easy.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS INSTRUCTOR IF YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD GPA OR GRADE! He brags about failing students during class. Attendance is mandatory and they fail you without hesitation even if you have a doctors note. Although they teach a freshman level class, their grading scale is very harsh and they expect students to know everything about painting",0
WARNING: FLIPPED CLASSROOM. Look it up pretty much nothing is done in class(but you have to show up) and all the real learning is done on your own time. This did not work well for most of the class. Averages were in the 40s,0
"Although he is gifted, he can be quite abusive. He is chaotic. He stresses his students out, while other classes are enjoying the experience. He will make you want to quit. He will make you hate life. If you are okay with abusiveness, exhaustion, being berated, stress and anxiety, then you will do well in his class.",0
"I think he's funny! Lectures are boring, I would do homework from other classes. He does answer any questions you have and will go over your essays and point out your mistakes. He lets you re-write them so, that is good!",1
her complete and total lack of meme knowledge was completely inappropriate. i give 1.5/10,0
She seems to grade our weekly study guides purely based on how well we cite our sources directly related to her grading rubric that exists only in her head and has no rhyme or reason,0
Take this prof if you want Michael Scott as your design prof. very personal and terrible with people while also being very sensitive. Is all about manners but when he thinks you mess up resorts to calling you things like dude and questions your intelligence over not understanding his often STRANGE assignments. Also judges you outside of arch.,0
This teacher is absolutely horrible. She thinks you are supposed to know everything.  When you ask her to re explain something she does it worse than the first time she explained the concept. Don't take her!!!!!,0
"Wants you to learn for sure. However, she vaguely explains things and then gets mad when we don't understand them. Especially when we don't get things right, she seems offended. Vague explanations, doesn't like if we think an article is not too good, definitely has preferred or favored students. Sure I failed the class already despite my efforts.",0
"too much work, and assignments are not as inspiring as she believes",0
Very funny but a horrible teacher. He does not teach just tells you what to look at in the book. Very messy on the board and jumps from one thing to another. I cried after every test but huge curves if the whole class does bad. I'd say if you have a good background in physics you'll be fine but if you're shaky with the stuff don't take.,0
Great professor.  I learned a lot in this class.,1
"Ms. Scott is an incredible teacher who is so kind and understanding. This class was one of my favorites, and I loved how we could be creative in picking our essay topics (be ready to write multiple essays!). She gives great feedback and is always there to answer questions and offer advice. This was a fun class that wasn't difficult (in my opinion).",1
"She seems like a cool professor the first day, but don't let her kindness trick you. You have to show up to class, she uses reef pooling for attendance. Her lectures literally put me and the whole class to sleep. Her book  review is dumb hard, and the tests are very tricky. If you really don't like history STAY AWAY!!!!",0
"I had him his 1st semester too, it was awful. big waste of time to be honest, I hope he has gotten better, for everyones sake",0
"Thoroughly prepared me for Chem 151 - not for slackers. Very thorough and detailed with her lectures and is quick to respond with help about material in person and over email. Nice teacher who likes making chemistry fun. Do all Extra Credit! Capstone is tough. Nit picks answers - but will tell you if your answer is ""on track"" (so ask questions).",1
"If you are not already fluent in Spanish, you will not learn with this instructor. This class is very difficult, do not let ""beginning Spanish 2"" fool you. I am fluent in Spanish and got an A, but my classmates who weren't struggled very much. he ""teaches"" too fast and doesn't allow enough time for a subject to sink in before moving to the next.",0
1 word- BORING! It was honestly the worst class i've had so far.,0
"Professor Reyes's class was the only SPA class that I didn't stress about. We had a small class of about 12, so there was a lot of attention to each student's skills. He put a very heavy focus on speaking and writing, which helped out majorly for the tests (all that was left was memorizing vocab words). He was also super personable. Great prof!",1
"Sears is a bad teacher. You have to teach everything yourself. He throws questions, which are easy if you had practice problems, but are hard because you haven't seen them. Old exams will help you on the midterms, but it will not help you on the final.",0
"Horan was the best teacher to have for the first semester of college level English. He makes the class extremely easy to pass, as long as you do your work. All of the assignments for the entire course are laid out in the syllabus and on Canvas. As long as you keep up with  the weekly assignments, it is an easy A.",1
"One of the best math teachers ive ever hard. Math has always been such a hard subject for me, and for the first time since middle school, I was able to get an A in math. Also allowed us to have formula sheets for the tests which saved my life. Defentially recommend taking him!",1
"My class didn't like her. Half the time I thought they gave her a bad rap and half the time I wanted to join the mob. I got great grades when I thought I did bad and bad grades when I thought I did well. Takes a while to get these grades. I've had a lot worse though; I think people need to get a grip (some criticism here is deserved, however)",1
"Kelm is amazing; if you can get him, take him. I took him at Moorpark and CLU, and I wouldn't take anyone else but him. Great guy and fantastic teacher. Talks a mile a minute during lecture but its only b/c he loves what he does, so if you have questions - ASK HIM! He's all about student succeeding and he'll work with you to get your grades up. :)",1
"good prof. watch his lectures read the textbook and youll pass, quizes are shortly times so you will have to work fast!! the rest was pretty solid .",1
Dr. Venus is very intersesting man. he can be harsh when it comes to grading but he explains everything throughly. he is extremely helpful. and likes class discussions. he also has writing assignments evryday,1
"She is a very sweet person but I can honestly say i didn't learn anything. She gets off topic all the time, she takes forever to grade your papers, she's never prepared for class. She doesn't know what we've covered or what we haven't. Very unorganized mentally. It was very frustrating being in her class. But she was very nice.  ",0
Dr. Weber is my adviser and my teacher for composition lessons. He is a really awesome guy and helps me learn about cool new compositional techniques.,1
"Richards is a decent teacher, but this class was HARD & STRESSFUL for me since I'm not good at accounting. I switched my major after this class. The chapter cases were difficult (some more than others) & the worst part is they're due the SAME DAY they're assigned. I hated the LearnSmart's as well. Buckle up; take LOTS of notes & get help if needed.",1
10/10 would recommend. Easy class to get an A. Just do all of the assigned work and you'll be fine.,1
His tests are often confusing and he ends up dropping four or five questions every exam because they are worded awkwardly. There is an immense amount of reading that goes on in this class. If you are not constantly on top of the reading you will fail the exams at the end of every four units. ,0
"Professor Quinlan is an amazing professor. He is such a sweetheart and I honestly enjoyed his lectures. He is really smart and holds so much knowledge, you honestly learn so much. Quinlan just wants you to do well, and he is a very understanding person. His tests are tough but they are fair. Taking him again in the fall. Would really recommend him.",1
I absolutely loved his class! He was so great at explaining concepts and he helps you every step of the way in your writing process.  He does rough draft workshops so it is important to attend class.  Sometimes he lets you out early on paper due dates! Love his glasses :),1
"I have taken her online Math 108 and found that she is extremely helpful when I need something. She has reopened all of our quizzes and homeworks to get a better grade, if you choose not to do this you need to live with the grade you were given. I would suggest not taking all your quiz chances the first time and save a couple later.",1
"Ridiculously hard tests, that don't focus on the ""main concepts"" he says he's trying to teach. Lectures are hard to sit through, although he did cut a deal with me when I failed one of his tests. So I can't rate him terrible as a person, just his class sucks.",0
"the professor doesn't do anything. he only gave us syllabus, no lecture, no communication as in NADA. If you want to learn something, you better register to a different professor",0
"Toms class was the hardest A Ive ever earned. Theres no homework, but this means that your entire grade relies on the four tests he gives in class. The tests are very difficult. Tom can be condescending if he can tell you dont care about the material. Only hope for me was to talk with him one on one. Hard, but a challenged me to try harder.",1
"Bad teacher, unorganized, lost one of my tests so now I'm getting a C in the class, literally nothing good about this teacher to speak of. Take her at your own risk.",0
"If you like reading, take this class. If you don't, don't take this class. Generally read about 20 pages for each class period but sometimes it was up to around 80 which seams a bit excessive for a 100 level course. The readings vary greatly - we try to cover every subject from every area on the globe from every time period which can be interesting",1
not very clear when teaching. gives little direction on what to study-says the answers are all right their in front of u in the text but u will have a 10 question test on 30 pages form the boring text... hard to prepare for his class and exams.,0
"Covered to much to fast, lacked substance",0
"Dr. Britton is fantastic! She is very helpful and wants to hear what you have to say. Prepare to read, cause the chapters are long and are well covered in the tests, specially the case studies. You have to work hard for it, but you're not alone, the GTA's are awesome and she is too. Totally recommend! ",1
"I took Dr. Hanson for a ONE UNIT Honors seminar class and it was one of the hardest classes I've taken. She made us write so many essays, give an entire lecture on dry, heavy philosophical books, and she was VERY picky with grading. She marked up my essays worse than any English teacher I've had and I get A's on papers. Don't highly recommend her.",0
The best teacher ever!!!!!!!!,1
"I am getting my second Masters degree through AMU & Makri is by far the worst professor I have ever come across. She is accusatory, offensive and when she does not agree with a paper she will write incredibly inappropriate, unprofessional and offensive comments on it. It got so out of hand I actually reported her to the university. Stay away!",0
"Great Professor! Really nice and professional, show up in class, participate, read the material and you will get an A.",1
end of the semester and STILL no exam grade?! you have got to be kidding me.  One excuse after another. Guy is a complete joke,0
"Such a fun class! Easy A if you show up & do the work. Attendance matters, its recorded through a sign-in sheet. Two big projects. 1- youll be raising a child up to their adolescent years 2- group presentation. Have to come up w/an educational toy for teens where youll be bringing it to life & interviewing an adolescent that actually used it.",1
Burridge is such a sweet man. He genuinely cares about students and enjoys what he does. I wish I could take him for every class,1
"Dr. Morris is a great person, a professor I'd take again, and a total babe.",1
She is a director and not very knowledgeable about acting and movement. She plays videos from a website and tells students to copy the moves. The vocal warm-ups are also copied from papers. Basically she doesn't have the necessary education and experience. Don't take her classes.,0
"Dr. Cleveland was a great instructor. He was always willing to help & emailed you back quickly when you had questions. A few things were confusing but he would send a clarifying email if many students didn't understand. His assignments weren't too difficult, but there were a lot of them & time consuming sometimes. Overall, good teacher & class!",1
"She just reads off her powerpoints.  Emailed students with each exam; continually expressed her disappointment with the class. I don't think we intend to NOT try or do anything to pass; we are. But instead of learning it all in class, we have to take our own time after class to ""relearn"" the material. If you can't pass the test you wont pass. ",0
"This class is super easy. But this professor is the horrible at explaining the content. He is a super nice guy, really caring and cool, just sucks at explaining math. I taught myself how to do everything in this course.",0
"She's sweet, but lectures fast. The amount of work is OUTRAGIOUS.(Took as refresher, I've taken several A&P classes over the yrs, took this one 7yr ago, earned a B) Exams are NOT what are on the objectives, quizzes dont help w/ lecture exams. DO NOT take if you have other classes or work full time. This class takes 4-6 HOURS every DAY to keep up.",0
Hes very dry but funny. actually enjoyed class. If you show up you will pass,0
"This teacher incredibly evil. I took this guy based upon what I read from the other comments and it led me to a lot of pain. Hard tests, and doesn't know how to teach well. HUGE EGO PROBLEM!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. I HAVE TO RETAKE CALC B/C OF HIM!!!",0
"I have taken multiple classes from Mrs. Henderson, I now try and pick classes that are not being taught by her. Its not that her classes are too hard its just that everything feels like busy work and she spends too much time during the lectures trying to talk about her personal life, oh and get ready for you email to be flooded with notifications.",0
This was the WORST and I repeat WORST professor I have ever taken. It might be better to delay your graduation than to take this man and hurt your GPA. He just doesnt have enough experience to teach math and will simply not work with you. He expects you to memorize formulas that are just extremely unnecessary and removes points for foolishness.,0
"Death by PowerPoint! Does not care!, Does not teach!, gives vague questions!, doesn't give any feedback! Well you know what they say, if you can't do you teach. Except that makes for a poor teacher!",0
Took several of his classes and loved them.  They are all VERY challenging but very interesting too. He is passionate and its contagious.,1
I enjoyed her class. Very informative. She is abrasive but was very nice when I would ask questions... Be sure to follow her directions and STUDYING IS A MUST. Good luck,1
"No study guides, likes to trick students on tests. No extra credit, doesn't care if you learn or not. Bad accent and hates it when you don't understand what he is saying. Do not take him!!!! Nightmare!",0
Easily the best math teacher I have ever had.  Explains things very clearly and is more than willing to help you if you are confused with something.  My only complaint was he focuses on the theory of the math about as much as he does the application of it.,1
He was an okay professor his lectures were very boring but he explains everything in a way so you can understand his downfalls were on the online assignment where your homework was treated like a quiz wont tell you what was right or wrong so whats the point of homework if you don't learn from it you can easily fail his class just from homework.,1
Chemistry isn't my strong suit but she made it pretty clear in lecture. Definitely have to study a couple days before the exams because she makes you memorize everything but half the periodic table and equations. Still a good professor to have for such a difficult course,1
She was by far the best chem teacher I had. She actually teaches step by step with plenty of examples from her survival guide. If you have a difficult time understanding chem. Take her course!,1
"In my entire life, this class is the most toughest course I have ever had.  You need to spend 15 hours minimum for Week's homework. The instructor is very picky in terms of spaces, comments. etc.  Even if you are 1 min late in your homework submission, you are awarded zero points. Will will absolutely have no motivation in this class. Beware!!!",0
"Everything is pretty much automated.  Very little interaction with teacher, but she expects students in her online class to meet up with up to 6 other people to record essays.",0
There is an accent barrier so you really have to listen to understand him. He's a nice guy but it was hard to concentrate and I didn't really know what was going on half the time. If you do the readings and go to class it's not hard but he only has essay tests and papers for his grades.,0
"among the best graduate instructors I have had.  superbly organized lectures. tough class but he is extremly helpful and accessible outside class.  his youtube videos are really good, and online tutorial sessions solve lots of problems. He really does go above and beyond.  And he responds to email within the hour....",1
I enjoyed her class. Before taking classes with her I'd heard how hard the classes were but she really is a great professor. She wants to see that you care about your grade. Great professor!!,1
"Very scatterbrained, not organized at all, I do not recommend taking her at all.",0
"Great class. He's a former mayor of Philadelphia and City Council President, so he knows a lot about local government. He doesn't assign much homework, and what he does assign is just a certification that you read something. He does tend to go off on tangents, but they're interesting. Budget simulation at the end of the semester is fun, but hectic.",1
"He gives a few opportunities to earn extra credit. Definitely be sure to do them. Tests are difficult but he does provide study guides and class notes. It's a hard class, but he does his best to help you out.",1
Just try your best to don't choose this instructor. Loved design classes until i choose him. Class is easy he makes it terrible. He is a nice person and a good engineer but not a instructor. Marek if you ever see this just give up. You been teaching for 15 years and i am still saying this. I would give you a 0 but website won't allow me.,0
"A very good professor whos the only one Id prefer to teach me math thusfar. His lectures are amazing because of they he makes the lesson relatable to his students. He also interacts with his students & if we have questions about any types of problems, we solve several of those types together as one. Hes the ideal math professor.",1
Professor Hensley you can tell is very passionate about what he does and he is very knowledgable when it comes to business. This class was very easy online and required almost no studying for quizzes and exams. A couple group projects that you have to work on outside of class but overall an easy A.,1
English isn't one of my strong subjects but professor Pepper made it easy for me to understand each prompt. We did have an assignment due every week and the occasional discussion. The class isn't as difficult as I thought it would've been. We had workshops in class to revise our essays. Take her class she makes it fun!,1
"I Had Jon for a Calc 2 TA and felt obligated to write this when I saw a bad review. Jon has been the best TA I have ever had at UConn. Very clear, very knowledgeable, and very fair. He is great at explaining both concepts and problems. If I could have him for all my classes I would. If you have the option, take his class, you won't regret it.",1
"His class is structured with his own interest in mind rather than students, a series of tricks/gimmicks, seems he is interested in making life more difficult/not expanding knowledge. Changes grading criteria, hides info so that you can only get from his office hours, bizarre test structures which test memory not knowledge, plays favors. Got A tho",0
"Professor Rodgers is great. You will definitely learn with her because there are lecture outlines due every week, learning objectives for the exams and required pre/post lab work. Highly recommend the objectives if you want to get an A/B on the exams. Offered extra credit when we attended on campus seminars.",1
he is a great teacher and very clear on assignments and willing to take the time to help if needed,1
"Hw is myPhysicsLab, each time u get a Q wrong, it decreases your %. He will drop for attendance. Class time consists of 90% group work, before it was 100% lecture. Also, you need to read the chapter and take a reading quiz before each class on canvas imo they're hard. I wish he would go over worksheets in class more. You can use equations on test!",0
Once of my favorite professors of all time! Dudrick makes you want to show up to class because he's utterly adorable. Motivates you to read and learn the material. 4 papers (he's a fair grader) and a slightly harder final. I'd recommend him to anyone- truly a pleasure!!,1
Brings up controversial topics a lot. Does not control class when topics get out of hand. Does not allow for differing points of view. I learned nothing new from this class. She is a fair grader but monotonous during lectures and class discussions got way too argumentative. Also homework was not always clear. Should really focus less on discussion,0
"Professor Ulysses is by far the kindest professor I've had. Spanish 100 was so fun with her, and I actually learned a fair bit of Spanish. There are few assignments and those are clearly outlined. Ulysses is hilarious and makes class worth coming to. I hope I get her as a professor again!",1
"Professor Lewis is very nice to his students, know the materials. Don't miss  his class. Pay very good attention to his lecture and you will do well. I recommend him for you.",1
"Prof. Krutz is fantastic. He's able to communicate very well to the other students - with a nice mix of humor - and knows not only what he's teaching, but how to convey it to the students. It's a shame my only experience with him thus far is Freshman Seminar - I'd imagine having a more robust class with him would be much more fulfilling overall.",1
You have to do the homework and show up on time this semester half my class dropped because it was too many papers like too many he should at least put it on the syllabus before because it would be better and gets mad that we couldnt take words from the class discussion for the mc notes he is a character mainly speak and you better be right,0
She was so helpful during registration when she wasn't even my advisor! She got me into classes I needed for the major and outlined an academic plan with me. Thanks Rizella!,1
"He is the most funny man alive. his lectures were never boring and there was alot to cover. Showing up to class and doing the work shows enough participation. he is a tough grader but will help you succeed. as long as you show him respect and understand his jokes, your on his good side. i would highly recommend him. i have learned alot from him.",1
I found the class boring since the slides seemed like they were mostly taken out of the textbook with other information added on. She engages with the students but it would be helpful if discussion was done more.,0
This professor is so rude. Not recommend!!!,0
"One of the most arrogant professors I've ever encountered. Not helpful what so ever, and very condescending. I had a few issues in the course because of a BBLearn error, but said it would be alright and in the end got upset, even though I had outreached to him. I didn't mind the content or the work, it was just his lack of willingness to help.",0
"He is very organized, kind, and really wants everyone to understand the material. Stats is a tough subject, but he tries to be clear about what will be on the tests. He also offers opportunities for extra credit. He grades quickly. The workload is reasonable, not much homework, but attendance is important for success because of in class work",1
"Jose Morcillo is one of the best professors I have ever had in my last 4 years of university. He makes sure everyone participates, answers questions, and gives some of the easiest and useful tests ever. If you want an actual professor to treat you like a human, take him.",1
"This class is hard, but it is extremely rewarding. Dr. K does everything to help you understand what you are confused on and he is ALWAYS around---seriously. A great professor to take a course from and a great person. Go to class.",1
"This guy is pathetic. he grades very harshly, the group project is a mess and is not needed. the readings are way too difficult for a regulars English class and as the semester starts to wind down u will say why didnt I take another professor. He will make English a living hell for u . Stay away !!! Youll see",0
BEST PROFESSOR AT HOSTOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE.,1
"His papers are given 2 weeks to write. first week, He assigns a reading you'll discuss and how to relate it to your paper. The second week, you'll give a rough draft, then a peer review, then a final draft. He is a tough grader, almost impossible to get a high A. If you dont go to class, you wont understand how to write it.",1
Nice and awesome teacher. She really helps you out when you're having a tough time with a problem/,1
"Great class! The class is basically all discussion (plus one 8-10 page paper), so I wouldn't recommend it if you don't feel comfortable talking in class. We cover really interesting topics and Dr. Collins is very laid back and willing to help.",1
"Very poor grader - She doesn't have a real rubric to go by. She takes off many points for miniscule things. There are four assignments in the whole class with one discussion each week. You have 3-4 days to post, not the typical full week. She takes weeks to a month to answer emails and grade assignments. She is very unhelpful.",0
"Always makes class a great time. Format and details are important to him when it comes to writing, but his stringency really helps when it comes to impressing judges and firms with your writing sample. Probably one of the nicest guys you will ever meet & a great teacher.",1
She is such a hard grader and is inconsiderate . If you come even 5mins late to class when an assignment is due you will get a zero. Her teaching isn't bad. Gives a lot of handouts,0
"This was a great class and he was a great professor! Prof. Powell enjoys interacting with students and teaching the students. I would recommend him to anyone! Just do the assigned readings, do the assignments, show up to class and participate, and you'll get a good grade for sure! Although he doesn't just hand out A's, he's fair in his grading. ",1
Great teacher!  I very much enjoyed his teaching style.  Great class.  I learned a lot.,1
"Has a good sense of humor, great person but horrible professor. Has only three tests and are very hard. I'm already bad at math but he won't let us use the formula sheet.  Whenever I don't get something I ask but I still don't get it. Goes way too fast. If you're good at math I'd recommend his class but if you aren't I wouldn't.",0
"I loved her. She improved my writing more than I could have ever imagined and gives amazing feedback when she returns your essays. Would take her for every English course available if I could. Take her and I promise if you put in the effort, you will do great.",1
This is by far the worst teacher I had ever had at sac not very helpful posts the reviews the night before. Writes too fast on the board and also makes mistakes on the board too. Also all of his tests are extremely challenging.,0
"I had a mixed experience with Prof Rubin. The labs are clear cut and easy to do, but the final exam was a mess. There's no real study prep and questions were given that we did NOT cover. She is very dated and gives advice no longer relevant. Avoid this prof, and if you get stuck w/her, be sure to do an HONEST AND DETAILED evaluation.",0
"She's very sweet. If you can't be punctual and always attend,don't take her. This class was challenging at the beginning as I was petrified to deliver a public speech. However, it got easier and easier. Practice a lot, study the reviews for the tests, be on time, she likes slides, don't miss a class, pass.",1
Lots of readings. One of the worst professors I've had at AU. While the readings are interesting there is no deep discussion and you don't get helpful feedback. ,0
"Passionate about teaching. If all professors were as dedicated as Asbell, we would all succeed. Made learning fun and inspiring. They broke the mold!!!! Thank you!",1
"I took this class last semester, and it was terrible. I expected to actually learn. And all I did was read the entire book. This teacher literally reads off slides and expects you to know everything on the test with a little bit of help of a study guide. I wouldn't recommend him at all. Not worth your money!!",0
"Despite getting the highest grade on all of the exams (90 avg), I still almost made a C in the class because of pop quizzes. Asks extremely specific questions and sometimes counts AGAINST you for getting it wrong. Burghardt is laughably condescending. You'd think you're talking to a celebrity with how self-important he is. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"Easy class if you pay attention. Nice guy, gives extra credit, class participation is important. Attendance is a must, and don't be late!  He will not accept late assignments-No Exceptions.",1
"Dr. Cornish is honestly one of the best professors at UNI. She is SO caring and understanding. She really takes the time to get to know her students. Her classes are not challenging, come to class and you are fine. Even if you don't come to class read some material you'll be fine. I could talk about how wonderful she is all day. You will LOVE her",1
This class was hard only 3 tests which count for 90% of your grade. My advice for any students interested in majoring in business stay away from buiness adminstration if you are not good in certain class,0
Goodyear made the topic extremely interesting.  I would take a class with him again.,1
"I really enjoyed Dr. JSC's intro to US government class. She cares so much about her students and wants us to be successful, academic wise she has high expectations, but will 100% help if you ever need it. Buy the textbook and read, it will make her lectures easier to follow. Overall I would take her class again!",1
"Blanton is the harshest grader ever. Since he used to proof read for an insurance company for decades, he takes off point for any little thing on an essay or summary. For example, he takes off five points for leaving too much space between your name, the date and class subject on an essay. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER, BLANTON. STOP BEING SO RIDICULOUS!",0
"Entire class is based on a group project - unfortunately, I had the worst group. Projects are okay, there was one term paper and a few other assignments (not anything crazy) but like I said entire class is based on your one group project. If you get a good group, you'll be good to go. Marking criteria is not clear / no real schedule to the class",0
"Prof Harris is a wacky, fun and sweet person. Unfortunately, Her class wasn't the best to deal with. Pros and Cons: Her tests are almost impossible and her feedback consists of: study right before you go to bed and study some more. Labs are repetitive and tiring but They're an easy grade. Homework is easy and she makes it short. GET THE ATLAS!",0
worst professor i've ever had. though she's interested in the photography she is not very good at teaching the important stuff ie. the photographer/ his background/ ideologies and theories. her assignments are too vague and she grades unfairly.,0
Such a great teacher. He will make sure that you know the material. Easy going and always willing to help! Take him if you have the opportunity,1
"If youre about to take AP with this Professor, BUCKLE UP! Professor Sexton is an amazing teacher that youll learn a lot from but this is the hardest class Ive ever taken! It is AP so thats expected but I BARELY made a B with a 79 in her lec and lucky a 85 in a different lab! Her exams are HARD! She wants u to succeed tho & will help in anyway!",1
A really approachable prof with interesting lectures! Work hard on the paper and you'll get a good grade,1
"This is my first time reviewing a professor here, but Prof. Paul's class was one of the best experiences I have had at APU. If you EVER have the chance to take a class from him, DO IT. You will not regret it. So much musical knowledge gained this past semester. He's not too difficult, but you learn SO MUCH.",1
"Mr. Faulkner is one of the best teachers I've ever have.  He assigns just the right amount of work, organizes his lessons into an easy to follow way, and has a good personality.  If you are looking for a class to take as an elective, this is the one!!",1
"Tests are pretty fair. 2 paper that were graded super hard, lose a lot of points for formatting so make sure you brush up on APA style. Long lectures but overall interesting class",1
This online class was horrible.  He was not helpful and you have to do rediculous amounts of work and still can barley pass the class,0
Only offered one extra credit assignment out of the whole semester. She does not answer emails regarding questions or grading. When I asked questions in her class she made me feel stupid and when I asked for help she just told me to figure it out on my own. Honestly your pretty much on your own.,0
Stats was hard because it's time-consuming.  Prof reyes is the best! i took all my math classes with her. She makes lecture so clear and understandable. You just need to take good notes. I would recommend everyone to take her for stats. Her study guides helps you a lot because you know what to expect on the test. seriously she is the best!,1
"Lectures were riddled with mistakes, annoyed sighs at any question, and a bad internet connection. Refused to acknowledge her poor internet connection even though her RECORDED lectures had plenty of evidence. Make sure you check your graded work because she's careless and makes mistakes on everything. Easy class if you read the text and practice",0
"Took her for art appreciation. gives a study guide out with every question and answer on the test. you don't even have to pay attention in her class, you just need to pay attention and get the answers to the study guides on REVIEW DAYS. the lights are always off and i usually bring work for my other classes to work on! ITS BORING but A VERY EASY A!",1
Really great teacher and fun class! take it if you can get in.,1
Kato Sensei is excellent. She worked tirelessly last semester to move the class online and was still available whenever students needed help outside of class. She is laid back and kind but knowledgeable. I was sad when class was over even though the semester was so emotionally hard to get through because of Covid. I highly recommend her class!,1
Dr. Griffin is really helpful and kind! She draws from lots of different sources to teach the material effectively and incorporates strategies we can use in our own classes someday.,1
"Morris straight up didnt care about teaching this course and all he talked about was his job at iRobot. Didnt look over the lectures beforehand, and lectures were a week behind homework for most of the semester so you were learning what you needed to do the day you turned in the homework.",0
"Dr Lenhart is a great professor and keeps class really interesting, tests are difficult go to class.",1
"snoble a little bit,",0
I do not know where to began because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps and can't teach.,0
"closed minded and not helpful- Announced to the class that ""white people steal everything from us."" She was very offensive and only accepted her opinion. CANT STAND HER",0
"If you disagree with him, you're wrong. If you have to take a philosophy class find a different professor. He's boring and loves the sound of his own voice.",0
Her pre-recorded lectures because I can't ask questions right away. we only have 3 classes per week but she would post 4 long lectures for us to watch. Her after lecture quizzes are easy but her exams are super confusing and hard to understand. She doesn't give examples for math problems but expect us to do it during exams.,0
"Dr. P is great. Her tests are multiple choice and ""by the book"", so if you read and take good notes you will make As. At the end of the semester, there is a challenging group project. You can't expect a major class to be 100% easy. Even if you do poorly on the project, though, you have easy participation and test grades to balance it out.",1
"He's a really nice guy and if you ever need help writing a paper, he helps a lot and always gives a ton of feedback on every paper.  There are a lot of pointless assignments but they aren't hard.  He's pretty laid back and a great prof.",1
"I'll start off by syaing that she is a very nice person, but a terrible teacher. She does know Social Work, but is very very unorganized. She also takes forever to get around to grading. The class is easy but she seems to not really have a game plan going into it.",0
I enjoyed this Psychology class very much. I took this class for winter session and Professor was very organized and professional. She made the class fun and interesting. She related life issues to the lecture which helped remember the information during the test. She is also was very attentive. I hold this professor to very high regard.,1
she is great,1
Loved him as a professor. Really passionate about what he teaches and knows what hes doing! Would recommend him for any class he teaches!,1
Professor Broome is quite funny.,1
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Very confusing, due dates are not clear, the syllabus makes no sense. He gives you 50 questions to do in 40 minutes for the exam. The directions for the exam are horrible. ",0
"Most wonderful spanish professor. She lets you know that learning English was very hard for her in the past, so she knows learning another language is tough. She is VERY caring and understanding with her students, is available for us whenever we need help. Very clear in her lectures and makes class enjoyable with her humor. I highly recommend her.",1
"I am so excited w/ my senior year. Took 446-Epi, loved it, got an ""A"" and now looking forward to his Writing-in-Majors 494 from him. Yes, lots of reading. Yes, lots of writing. Yes, lots of learning. Isn't this what we should want? I want to become a better science writer. He teaches you. If you party, don't take courses from him. I will get an ""A""",1
She is a very tough grader and her requirements are ambiguous; you are never really sure what she is looking for. The class overall is boring and way too much work for a 2 credit hour course. Her interactions with students is unpleasant and can be downright rude! I will be sure to never take a class with her again!,0
"DO NOT take this class! This was for an elective credit and the worse class I have taken by far. Way too much work for an ""Academic Success"" course. I wrote over 10,000 words throughout the semester for weekly Journals. He would write comments like ""Nice job keep it up"" then take points off. It's a semester worth of busy work, save yourself!",0
"Really boring lectures, really quiet speaking . . . half the time spent in class is awkward silence while she waits for someone to answer the question she just asked.  If you don't drink a cappuccino before class, then bring a pillow.",0
"Angelica is an amazing person. Sometimes it is a bit hard to follow the way her mind works but if you speak up and ask her to re-explain something 9/10 everyone else was thinking it too and she is very kind when revisiting a problem. Overall, one of my favorite instructors at Newark.",1
"Please take this with a grain of salt. I had the pleasure of having professor Adrian Garcia as my film 3 professor. All though hes nice and very easy going, I wouldnt take any of classes again. Hes unorganized, seems to make things up along the way. Doesnt speak thoroughly (ex: he informed my class that we had to present a film idea to...)",0
"It was a once-a-week class, but we missed several due to weather and class was super unorganized because of it. I had a fair amount of homework, but it might have been less if we had more classes. Also, she lectures a TON and the group project is described pretty poorly. Our group was so confused on how to do the research and presentation.",0
"Run in the opposite direction. He's Satan when he writes those exams from hell. His lectures are awesome, but those exams are hard!!!!",0
"Very unclear of what she wants you to do. You will never have the right answer for her. No matter how hard you try in her class it always seems like it isn't good enough. Can be rude at times. Not interesting. She will lose your papers and then tell you ""oh well"" or give them back you a week later. I would not recommend to take her. ",0
"This was an on-demand class, so I never got to know my classmates or the teacher which sucked. The situation was ""do the assignments in an hour once a week right before they are due,"" so I didn't get that much out of this class bc I didn't put that much effort in. I have kind of a better sense of my career path, but not really.",1
"If you're looking for a good College Algebra teacher, take Ms Gordon! She is so amazing! I never understood math very well before I took her class, but now I actually like math! Take her!!!!",1
"I learned Dutch as a fourth language.  Growing up, Chinese and Vietnamese were my first two languages. My parents came from Vietnam and they thought learning both languages would be advantageous. Jenneke is the greatest language professor I could have ever asked for.  I'm blessed to have been her student for the last two years. Bedankt voor alles!",1
"A real caring professor. Offers students to come to him for help, will read your work and offer advice on changes to be made before he grades your work. Wants everyone to do well. Solid in his teaching, experienced teacher. A",1
Maybe online wasn't the best way to take this class. I still enjoyed it and he was easy to reach out to and gave the BEST feedback. Always willing to connect if you needed or wanted to. Tough grader on the essays but the rest was simple if you didn't fall behind.,1
"He has little knowledge of economics outside what he's read in the textbook that you use in class. He ""encourages"" discussion, but anything that doesn't fit into his narrow ideology is shot down. One day in class he made the claim that, and I quote, ""libertarian ideas of economics are the same thing as socialism"". I'll let that speak for itself.",0
She is horrible! Doesnt care about the students overall and seems nice at first but be aware!!!,0
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
Great professor! She works you out at your level and I also enjoyed the individual attention that she gives. She is also a great motivator!,1
"This class is hard because Tammie makes it hard. She penalizes students for being unprofessional, but if she makes the same mistake all she says is ""I'm sorry."" She struggles with controlling her attitude when she is unsatisfied. She will have you stressed out about ""to be"" and phrasal verbs rather than the assignments, but even they are stressful.",0
"Best professor ever! I took her for bio 141 and 142 and she was great at explaining difficult concepts. Offers extra review sessions, and all her assignments are so helpful. She is very approachable, sweet and friendly. I would take her again if I could. Be prepared to dedicate your life to this class, so worth it and not impossible.",1
Great Prof,1
"Wilson gets a bad rep for being vague and very confusing, which is definitely true. Her class was definitely interesting and in my opinion valuable. To be successful in this class just participate in class, do all of the assigned work, go to her office hours (she's really nice), and work well with your group. Tests are super easy.",0
Love her! She's so fun and laid back. Increased my love for photography!,1
"She is literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Her unprofessional and hostile attitude are sort of shocking level. In my opinion, this program, especially in the clinical part, does not constitute and organized well.",0
"Really enjoyed listening to his lectures, he seems like a very normal guy rather than a typical college professor.  Fair amount of assignments and grades fairly.  Definitely have to work for it. Tests are not easy. If you take good notes and study, you will do well.  Definitely attend discussion.",1
"Great teacher, very helpful. You need to really study though, because she goes through stuff pretty fast. You need to keep up and know the material. Only thing that kind of sucks is the online homework. Nadeau is hilarious.",1
"Never in my college career have I had a worse professor than Mooney. She does not give clear directions and when she gives outlines for tests, no matter how hard you study, its never on the test. I hope she sees this too. She spends 30-45 minutes on just one slide and rambles, so boring. AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
"She told us in her exact words to suck it up and buy Microsoft Word, even though many students (including me) dont have the money. She literally laughs at us struggling and makes everything extra challenging so we fail and learn. Terrible strategy. I will be avoiding her for the rest of my time at HSU if possible. Hardest class Ive ever taken",0
"Professor Couch was a really nice lady, this is basically the dream English class if you're decent/mediocre at writing. Ask questions if you are unclear about something, she is easy to talk to.",1
"Never replied emails!! The feedback he gave me in the extended outline is ""plz insert page number"" and then gave me a 65%. excuse me?? Then another feedback said, ""your final results are different with the results in previous work you submitted, plz explain."" Why? because I found I was wrong in the previous one and now I wanna correct it! Can't I?",0
"Please let me know why this guy has such great reviews. Honestly. Only reason I took it read because of the reviews saying take him, youll pass yeah No. he doesnt care about whether you pass or fail. I attended almost every single class and did everything I was supposed to. He is so boring and dry. Acts like tests will be easy and theyre not.",0
Very annoying. Gives zeros on papers for little things such as not having your date right. You can redo them but she takes forever to grade. Boring lectures and gets mad if you dont pay attention. Would not recommend,0
"The worst class I have ever taken. All the lectures were very boring and I found it very hard to pay attention. His mid-term and exams are crazy, he gives you a study guide and if you prepare off of those throughly you will be okay but they are a lot of work. He is very arrogant but does try to relate to students. If you want a good grade must try.",0
Would not recommend unless you're a freshmen. The class was a dread to go to and kind of annoying because it was a waste of time but it was extremely easy.,0
"  I would not take this class again. Professor is very blunt and seems clear, but when it comes to lab tests the material is not familiar. Lecture tests were okay, but I felt like Lab tests were an impossibility. I didn't know anyone who recieved an A on a lab exam, for that matter I didn't know one classmate who didn't agree with me. ",0
"She is very nice and really knowledgeable about science. I like her passion for her job. However the tests are way too hard, and you have to learn some of the material outside of class.",1
"Just like any other English classes, theres a lot of writings. Research paper is you final exam, but she helps you to prepare for it throughout the semester. You have to watch some tv shows and read a story for this class, but I didnt have to pay for those. Youll be able to find it online. She gave us one extra credit opportunity.",1
She was never enthusiastic to come to class and teach us the material. She reads right off the slides with no extra discussion. She is honestly a super boring teacher who is not thrilled to be there.,0
"She was really cool and chill. You read ALOT of articles in the semester, its what the class is based on and you will be lost if you dont read. But its only one per class so its not hard. START YOUR RESEARCH PAPER ASAP. She only gives one paper and a 5 question quiz every other week so you have to read. The articles are interesting though.",1
"I'm not sure why people don't like Professor Ou, because I had him for ASIA-115 last summer and he was amazing! He had a lot of guest lecturers speak and they gave us really useful career insight. The class wasn't difficult at all, and the content was super manageable. I'm not sure if he changed his teaching method, but I really recommend him!",1
please do not take his course he is not helpful at all and will not help you in anyway belong. he is so boring,0
Maria is a wonderful professor. She has a passion for the subject that not a lot of professors portray to their students. She has actually been to a lot of the places she speaks about in her lectures like the Guggenheim museum among many other places. Having her bring her passion was a breath of refreshing mountain air. Russian candy included.,1
"So. Many. Papers. They werent hard, dont get me wrong, but it was excessive. The topics didn't always align with the notes, but it was always easy to look things up & write 2-3 pages on it. He grades super easy & there was only one test, which was also easy. Just show up & write the papers & youll pass, easy.",1
If youve had the pleasure of being in Dr. Gs class you know she is such a sweetheart. She truly cares about her students and works at a pace to make sure everyone understands the material (mainly just reading sheet music). She understands not everyone has prior music knowledge and does what she can to help make connections. Very few (easy) HWs,1
"Good teacher, funny, his course was easy. Very helpful in the essays. His test is rather hard, but his essays are easy. He takes off point for stupid stuff all the time. My English was good before I took his class. I had a little bit better teachers, but I think he is a good teacher, and I will recommend him. He gives clean answers for questions.",1
"He's a tough grader. Small mistakes can cost you lots of points, which I think is too extreme from his part. He tells you exactly what he wants in the lab reports. The error analysis stuff may be hard but I'm glad I learned about it. The labs are varied, like 8 lab reports, a couple of quizzes and a final (individual, no groups) Expect to work.",1
"I wanted to do a french minor until I met this guy. He is literally the worst person I have ever met, he is racist, sexist and misogynistic. I honestly don't know how he has kept a job interacting with the public. Be ready to be picked on in class and made fun of if you're wrong. Avoid at all costs",0
"This class was amazing, a great professor that makes learn English an enjoyable journey.",1
"I've taken his Global 130 class before and this class was similar grading structure: 3 quizzes, midterm& paper. I really liked the course, the professor did a great job of explaining all the terms/events. Not all reading is mandatory, he will tell you which will be tested on and most slides are posted, overall pretty easygoing and approachable!",1
"He's a nice guy. Seems like he has seen his fair share of the world. Rambles a lot about random things, like pink armadillos and manatees mating.  Good professor? Not really. Easy A. Bring something to do. Will go over time every class period and will not care.",0
"Amazing class w/a wonderful Prof! She is extremely knowledgeable on herbs, essential oils & organic gardening. Every class is a treat w/organic herbal teas prepared for consumption along w/healthy snacks.  You will learn about the  healing properties of herbs & the many benefits of essential oil use! Class is interactive in the best type of  way!!!",1
This professor promotes his own book and assumes that no one is good enough unless they read his book and go by his own completely impractical marketing dogma,0
"He's so loud, eugh. He gives you 2 or 3 abstract assignments with no clear directions. If you're a novice Adobe user, good luck, pal! He won't go over the programs much in class, & def. won't teach you. Whenever we had class (he canceled a lot) he would just go on rants. (not useful!) Pro Tip: When he critiques, don't talk back. It can get uglyy.",0
"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever had, however, I would not recommend taking him. He plays favorites and if you are not one of them, expect a final grade that doesn't  match your work. Does not offer any help and expects you to accept his interpretations as truth- anything else is incorrect. Don't take him if you can help it.",0
Worst teacher in the world Do not take the class Doesn't know how to teach confusing Not helpful  Bad gradin,0
"the material for this class was very dry! there is no homework  and you do not need a text book either. There is a quiz EVERY week on the material but he does tell you what it will cover. take advantage of making notes on an index card and using it on the weekly quizzes.  Overall, good eye candy.",0
"Prof Mirbod is the best Accounting teacher on the GT campus, her lecture builds on the readings she assigns, She gives a lot of practice problems. Accounting is not an easy subject, but follow her lead and she will lead to an A. I got an A in both ACCT221 and ACCT222. She cares for students and is honest if you are going to pass. Be ready to work.",1
"A quarter of the class withdrew, and half of what is left is failing extremely bad. AVOID AVOID AVOID. glad i withdrew when i did. horrible professor.",0
"Everything is confusing for me (can't speak for everyone else). Even when I'd get help, it just always seems like she doesn't really want to help because ""we should know this already"". Math used to be my favorite subject and now, I hate it.",0
"Dr. Beymer-Farris is an absolute ICON. She is truly my favorite professor since I've taken this class with her, and purposely have tried to take courses she offers to be able to have her as a professor again. She is so knowledge and passionate about Environmental Science & Sustainability and Geology, and I truly admire her work ethic. My queen.",1
He is the most specific grader i've ever had. his lectures are good and you'll understand the concepts but his grading on tests is enough to drive you crazy. You have 4 tests and a final and one of the tests are dropped (if he didnt drop your lowest grade you wouldnt pass). try and take someone else,0
"She is an inspirational women. She teaches her student to make the connection textbook to real life. She will not teach you she will help you make the connection. 80% is individual learning. Those comments below are from people who are lazy , expect everything to be handed down to them, and dont read before class.",1
This instructor is the worst instructor I have ever had. She doesnt have the quality that teacher supposed to have. She shouldn't be teaching at all until she goes back to school to educate herself on how to be a professor.,0
"Dr. Pan is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and takes the course at a great pace. His Materials Science class was one of the most enjoyable I've had so far. Learned a lot, two tests were fair, not much homework, no final.   Last month of the class was just group project presentations, which was actually pretty great!  Did I mention no final?",1
"EASIEST A EVER!!! I took this course online, therefore, participation in the group discussions are MANDATORY. Not much work, but being this is an online course you're definitely going to be engaging in discussion posts. The final was a reflection paper. Overall, I loved the class and will be taking her this summer",1
"I took 252 twice with Stewart. The first time I got a D so had to retake it. He was always honest and supportive when I had to make my decision about retaking the class. It is a very hard class but if you listen to his advice to stay diligent, do the ready, and attend class then you will be fine. Stewart is one of the best professors at the school",1
"First things first, Her tests are really hard. It is like she wants you to fail. Its like the tests came out of a different book. I did OK in her class but I had to try really hard. I usually get A's in math, but not in this class, mainly because of the tests. Overall she does a good job. Did I say the tests are hard?",1
"Dr. Kosnik was the best professor I have had in my college career so far.  His notes are clear and easy to understand and his lectures are humorous and engaging.  I miss his class.  Ee is awesome at piano and the organ.  Also, he is the cutest, nicest old man ever.  Dr. Kosnik is a boss.",1
"Went to class twice, got an A. As long as you go over his 3 question practice exams there is no way you would fail, since he gives the same questions on the actual exams. Huge curve, even though everyone did great. If you actually do want to learn though he is actually a very good lecturer too. Take him, you won't regret it!",1
"Not worth the Credits. You could do absolutely perfect on an assignment but he takes off points just for the hell of it. His lectures are pointless and he assigns ridiculous assignments every class period. He is absolutely dreadful. Do not take this professor at all costs! He is a nice guy to be fair with him, just a bad teacher.",0
"His pre calc class was horrific. He goes so fast during the lectures that you can barely keep up. He skips so many steps that you can't ever really tell how he got to the answer. Even if you do well on a quiz or test, be prepared to get a terrible grade, since he will deduct points if you don't show every little ounce of work on that paper. Awful.",0
"For my first graduate course this professor made everything easy. Clear directions for assignments and answers emails quickly. She was not too involved in discussion boards, but still made her presence known by commenting on a few posts. Offered resubmissions and extra credit. Overall easy class of you do the work. APA understanding is critical.",1
"Don't take this guy. He doesn't care about teaching and he'll basically blow through class with his powerpoint. He asks hard questions in class and doesn't give you time to read the question. He does the problems correctly so write everything down and learn it later, at least that's how I did. midterms aren't bad, but try to not take this guy",0
"He is HORRIBLE! Do not take this class! He has a syllabus, but no due dates, and he expects you to submit things on time. Then he does not remind you if something is due.",0
Prof. Gaffin always covers EVERY part of the reading in the textbook to ensure that everyone knows whats going on. He is inspirational and makes an hour and 15 minute lecture weirdly entertaining. He is the best and I would not want any other prof. for that class.,1
"Best teacher I have ever had. He is very nice, and all the work I did in his class really helped me become better at drawing. His lectures are very engaging. I can tell that he is passionate about art, and he really cares about his students. His class is the only class I was actually excited to be in. I enjoyed everything about him as a teacher.",1
"Sarcastic, unhelpful, favors certain students and do not give attention to the rest, rude, always late for class, does not explain and expect students to know it all, have seen almost all international students dropping from her class. She exhausts students with long papers on top of readings and a weekly quiz. Spends the first hour of the lecture",0
He was a very fun guy and it was fun to come to class.,1
"I LOVE Professor Goodman! His voice is really monotone, which isn't great, but he's got a good dry sense of humor. He's really understanding about absences or turning things in a day late if you've got a good reason and usually come to class on time & contribute. He taught me a lot even though I'm not gonna be a PE teacher.",1
"The worst professor I have ever had. He does not care about the online class at all, does not answer emails or messages. Do whatever you have to do to avoid taking him.",0
"He's really good, and I was able to follow the formulas really well. I really liked the class! He's an easy going teacher and would have a few laughs in them.",1
"Sometimes it is hard to understand his Texas accent but he means well. He was late to our classes sometimes but wasn't strict with us about things like that, so he's fair. The class was pretty easy overall. Brown used the previous prof's syllabus, so no surprises. Not a great teacher compared to the others here but he's new and still learning.",0
Prof Favara is one of those rare professors that actually cares about her students and is willing to help them!! She has a way of making everyone feel respected and important. The class takes effort but isn't super difficult and you learn a lot; I never liked English too much but I'll genuinely miss her class.,1
"I have a very clear understanding of the material, because I've already taken the class, but she grades horrible. She would take off 3 points from a 5 point problem if you have the wrong sign. I hate taking this class with her.",0
"suggestion questions outdated (textbook updated already), rude, harsh, did talk personal life in class",0
"I LOVE ADRIANO. I had him online this semester, and he was the best. He is so caring and made class enjoyable and interacted even through zoom. Homework is not that bad either. He ended every zoom with ""Have fun, be safe, and don't drink"". I love this man!!!",1
"His lectures are very clear and concise. The quizzes and exams are based off of the homework, which I could usually knock out in a few hours every week. Get a study group.",1
Avoid at all cost. The professor cannot teach and makes atleast 10 mistakes per class. He is very unclear when explaining and gives rude answers to people who asks valid questions.,0
"Prof. Laucella is so kind. She's an easy grader, cares about her students, and is just an overall good person. Her class is really easy, just a waste of time. Try to take online if you can. We used the textbook but it's really not necessary. You can get away with not buying it.",1
"She made me glad that I chose to go to unl, so easy going and helpful and amazing in every way.",1
"this class is really fun and interesting.  You learn so much about movies, film making and directors.  plus.  hes friggen hot.",1
I started off with an F but i immediately went for help during her office hours. she can explain complex ideas extremely simple and it was a joy to have her as my professor. Before each exams she prepares the class with a practice exam so make sure you complete that before the test. Great professor if you want to learn the beauty of algebra!!,1
"4 exams composed of questions requiring perfect memorization of several philosophical persons. He personally attacks you for not reading or being incapable of answering his questions. NOT OPEN-MINDED AT ALL! Utters inappropriate things in class and is just an all-around bad professor. More than half the class dropped the first week, but I couldnt.",0
"This is a prime example of a professor meant to only teach to math majors. He has the pace and brisk attitude of a prof bored of teaching lower level math. To a savant, he would probably be well suited, but to an average- or even slightly better than average- learner, he's too fast, too intimidating, and too brief.",0
"She is one of the laziest teachers i have ever had at any university. Her ""lectures"" are just her reading random points from the book and telling us what the test questions will be. She puts absolutely no effort into class and then is confused as to why none of the students want to participate. I would avoid her at all costs if you want to learn",0
Dr. Carter is such an engaging speaker. He is inspiring & thought provoking as he leads people in thought very effectively. Dr. Carter was very aware of his students' mental spaces; he managed a classroom with expectations & goals but at the same time he took time to lead us in meditation when we got burned out a bit. I see life differently now.,1
Best professor! Such an encouraging individual. I looked forward to his class. I can actually say that I learned something every day and honestly he's not boring. He keeps the class engaged and he's well respected. You'll appreciate Dr. Wood tremendously!,1
"Professor Rich is very clear and concise in her lectures. Although lectures tend to be lengthy, the material she teaches is worthwhile learning and she makes lectures fun with demo's and videos. READ the textbook and pay attention to her examples as they often appear on the test! Tests can be tricky if you don't study enough.",1
"Professor Galan was incredibly easy and his class was very enjoyable, you get extra points for attending his class. His tests were the reviews that he gave, so do them and you'll get A's on his test. If you're looking for an easy A, I'd recommend him.",1
"She is very bubbly, laidback, and nice, and tries her best explaining things, if you talk to her in person or in email. She also gives a lot of extra credit. I ended up with an A+ in her class. She has 3 online exams, 1 major speech, and online assignments. She also gives back feedback during the speech assignments. A very easy class!",1
"Dr. Kuss is a very bright man. HOWEVER, his lectures are so incredibly boring!! He mumbles, talks to himself, and ALWAYS shows up to class 15 minutes late. It was so hard for me to keep an interest in his class, I found myself not wanting to go. Bring your computer, you'll need some entertainment. (took western civilization I)",0
"Right now she is it for A&P lectures so you have no choice. Her teaching style is very hard to follow, doesn't make it easier to understand.  Her testquizes are hard.  Feel like she is trying to trick you. If you have to take her use other supplementary material to help you pass this class. You will have to spend ALOT of time studying.",0
"Disorganized, boring, draconian, bad feedback, etc. Easily the worst SOC prof at Temple. Perspective: The only other prof offering this Required course has their roster fill quickly w a long waiting list while Allen has open seats. $160 for vaguely relevant books is excessive. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!",0
She is ok I guess but gives different review than actual test,0
"The content of this class is fine but his grading system is simply awful. It's far too easy to pass but far too difficult to get an A. With surprise test questions, sporadically dispersed (yet heavily weighted)  iclicker questions, and no extra credit I was the only one to actually achieve the score for an A (95) in nearly 250 students. Ridiculous.",0
"You write 4 papers. His quizzes come from the book, not lectures. He does not answer emails at all. He does not grade papers efficiently.",0
"this teacher made promises of discussions each week and tests, 5 weeks in we have yet to see one. this teacher has organization issues and a hard time staying on track.",0
"Professor Onyiahs accent is difficult to get used to, so it definitely requires active listening on your part. (I would recommend seeing a tutor.) He genuinely cares about the success of his students and encourages questions. Hes not the greatest teacher, but hes a nice guy and will meet you halfway as long as you put forth the effort.",0
"I loved taking Marxian Theory with Marc. Found him to be sweet and caring; felt as though we built a genuine relationship over the course of the semester. Assigns lots of reading, but it is great stuff if you are interested in the material. And lectures help to clear things up. Will encourage you to follow your own interests where possible.",1
Great professor who is very professional.,1
"She did not believe me when I told her a test was not open for me online and proceeded to give me a 0. I believe this says a lot about her as a person, and I do not recommend you take her class.",0
"Nice person, bad prof. Not willing to work with you out of class, ignores emails, rarely was in office during office hours, didn't grade homework because she was ""too busy"", didn't really give partial credit, overall I do not recommend taking a class with her. ",0
Very hard to understant do to her accent.  Class was taught at a graduate level over our heads.  Did not like answering questions.,0
"Marketing 201, or markets and institutions, is a super boring class, but if you are looking to just pass the class deff take schellhorn, and plus you'll learn along the way",1
"Pretty good.  Somewhat ignorant of special education.  Sometimes a hard grader and inflexible.  But is enthusiastic, lots of great info., and learned a lot.  May be repeat of ENG 308 for some.",1
"A bit eccentric, but patient with students and explains course material clearly. Great Professor! Material is not hard if you go to class.",1
"Good, organized professor.  He offers lecture notes that are only available in class.  There's practice exams available, to which he provides the answers.  These practice exams make up the majority of the lecture exams.  Lab is not complicated at all, but the lab exams require some studying.  Put in the time and you'll do good.",1
"You can tell she's been teaching the same for a long time. All of the assignments are time consuming and repetitive. I've had to map out a full 8 semester schedule, three different times in the first semester. All te assignments are just busy work which is annoying because there is so much of it. This class is just a huge waste of time, avoid it.",0
"His notes suck on the board, you cannot read them. He is kind of rude but if you just sit back and go to class its not bad. I liked how the homework was all organized out for the semester and how it was online but his test suck and are hard and LONG!!!",0
"MUST read textbook, assigns 1-4 readings before each class on top of it, various lengths. Super into presentations. Blue book exams. This class was harder than my 600 level class for my major, he throws a lot of information at you, most of which will go over your head if you skip a reading. Be prepared to participate, if you don't you won't pass.",0
I took Handys class online and it was super easy. I emailed her with any questions I had and she answered them thoroughly. The tests are EXACTLY like the homework so make sure you understand everything. I would definitely take her again!,1
"Ms. Dixon-Brown is an amazing professor. She is super kind, and probably one of the best professors I have had. Make sure to participate and do your weekly assignments. Even if this class does not pertain to your major, it's interesting for our day to day life!",1
"Ryan is awesome! took him for Portfolio 1 & 2. He is helpful in class, but because of short class times,  take advantage of his office hours. He is always willing to listen and help you work through your creative issues to create something truly great.  He is a tough grader -  he expects a lot of out of his students to prepare them for ad life.",1
"Very intriguing lectures, and always brings in personal stories.  She does not lecture for the exams, but rather broad ideas. You teach yourself from the book. Easy to approach, and seems to care deeply for her students.",1
Lectures were really informative. A little bit of reading but it was very interesting and the discussions were great. Would totally take again. One of my my favourite classes.,1
"The lack of empathy and understanding of learning styles really makes her teaching detrimental to others. There was a lot of lack of communication on what she wanted one to get out of the information and even the work itself. Nothing sticks out more than her saying in one lecture to ""suck it up and buy microsoft word."" ignoring others circumstance",0
Not a very helpful professor... but not horrible. There certainly are worse professors. I feel neutral or indifferent toward the class and professor.,0
Class isn't hard if you study well and put some effort into the class. I didnt use the textbook even though I bought it. You can survive off the PowerPoint slides and notes you take in class.,1
I am absolutely not interested in Biology. I realized a month into the class I was naturally tuning him out. Curves & extra credit is how I achieved a B. Overall a polite & funny guy that gets the struggle is real; occasionally veers off course on a random tangent that is quite entertaining. Read the chapter Show up Take notes STUDY Ask questions.,1
Had Dr. Klosterman for ThermoFluids lab class is pretty easy you do 4 labs over the course of the semester and a presentation on one of the labs as a final.  Grades fair and give you a chance to make corrections on the first 2 labs.,1
Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. Garyen Chong is the best biology professor at Langara and he is a very fair and lenient marker. Read the textbook and you will succeed.,1
"She is an amazing professor the class is a bit challenging but totally doable. Shes always willing to help, even if its her day off, she will help you! Shes very kind and funny as well. The class was great and inspired me to continue. Do your hw and attend the class.",1
"I have mid 80's in all my engineering and math classes this semester, and mid 60 in his econ class. The exams make no sense, and the grading scheme is bizarre. His lectures are painful and repetitive, and he only covers simple topics. He uses slides provided by the textbook publisher. Worst professor I've had in 5 years.",0
"Grade is based completely on four tests, so make sure to study. He posts the study guide online, but you need to go to class for the vocab, especially the class right before the test. No homework but he does offer extra credit.",1
"She is a very knowledgeable instructor. She often gets off task and talks about something else. If you do your work, she will help you. If you sit there and do nothing and ask for help, she will do the same back to you and will not help you.",1
"Took Scott for Trig, would not recommend unless you already know what you're doing and would still hesitate to recommend. He's late for class almost every class. His answer to most questions is 'look in your notes'. If he does answer it there's not much explanation. If you take Scott and plan to understand trig, be ready to learn it from a tutor. ",0
"A Wonderful teacher! I could not have asked for a more patient and enthusiastic professor. I recommend that anyone interested in a foreign language, take her course!",1
"He's one of those professors that you resent during the semester because of the amount of reading and how hard his tests are, but I have to say I came away from his class with a ton of knowledge. Makes you work for it, but it's probably the class I've got most out of in college.",1
"Professor Rice does try to understand his students on a personal level and always is in a good mood. However, his lectures are unorganized, most of the work done is online ALEKS ( basically you're teaching yourself.) He always says study, spend more time on your homework, but how will you learn if he doesn't teach? Good person, horrible teacher.",0
"While content reviewed in class is posted on blackboard, his notes aren't understandable if you miss class. There's about 5 assigned books, they're horrible reads and if you just listen when he reviews them you don't need to read them. He doesn't help when asked for assistance. Lots of writing required - 3 wikis and 28 blogs. ",0
Dr. Pringle taught the second semester of this course and she is a fantastic person and her lectures were well organized but her tests were absolutely ridiculous. She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,0
"He's funny, smart, and just a great man in general. I can't wait to take another one of his classes.",1
Dr. Ostrowski is very personable and knowledgeable about biology. The assignments she gives are very helpful for the tests and quizzes and she is a fair grader. She's great at explaining concepts and drawing things out on the board. She really takes time to get student feedback and truly wants to make her classes enjoyable. Highly recommend!!,1
"Extremely nice, easygoing, and helpful.  He can babble and be scattered with his material at times, but he always reviews it so it is clear afterwards.  He truly cares about his students and always attempts to interact personally with them.  He will offer help in aspects that do not even involve his class.  Few assignments, and you can rewrite.",1
Aunave is like a drill sergeant. Classes are mandatory and you loose points if you're always absent. There is a lot of homework and she expects it done and neat.Their is progress in french grammar and she is helpful during office hours. But we didn't practice speaking french; she did most of that. Exams are not bad but her study guides are useless.,1
"Dr. Curtis is a nice lady but her lectures are all over the place. She does not go over much in class and she makes her test extremely hard. Their are only 3 test, which is basically your whole grade, so if you do bad on one test you are screwed for the rest of the semester. I would not recommend.",0
"Seriously, to echo everybody else, never ever ever take. The cutoff for a B+ was an 87.  I got an 88 and he gave me a B because he told me he didn't think I deserved a B+.",0
Jenneke's the bomb. She understands language and how to explain it. She loves engaging her students and is funny and interesting. She also very literally wrote the book on learning Dutch. 10/10,1
This man is a horrible professor. I have never in my 20 years of living encountered a man so distasteful and rude to their students for absolutely no reason. Then you get to class and you're lucky if he let you know what was going on ahead of time because he can be so useless to be such a nasty man. Very strict attendance policy so be wise,0
He does not spend much time on teaching. Harrop is much much better and helpful. not easy A,0
He was a great Prof. he was interesting and a bit of a goofball at times. There were alot of notes but we could use the book for things. I loved his class!,1
"Be very wary.  I would never encourage anyone to study privately with Terry.  Ther are much, much better trumpet teachers in Boston.  His information is limited.  He is not the kind of ""all-inclusive"" teacher that should hold a position at a major university.",0
"Okay, relatively easy class.  Proffessor Brandt however does not attend office hours, his quizzes the 'TA's make' are made by the book and are ONLINE (with the answers), and he overall doesn't seem to care about his students. The tests are about 50% quiz questions and 50% lecture questions which you can get from the power points he posts online",0
Rambles...,0
Professor Warn was the best professor that I had during my first semester of college. You could tell that he really cared about what he was teaching and he always knew his stuff. He used personal stories to relate to everything we were learning in class and it was extremely helpful and entertaining. I learned a lot and would take it again.,1
"This teacher was not very accessible. Her answers to questions were not clear, and I had to have her clarify most of the time. Since it was an online class, I could read other students' frustration with the same issue. She also took a long time to reply to questions.",0
"I enjoyed my semester with Koskela. Arguably he is not the most fun and exciting professor but he is very intelligent and knowledgeable. He actually cares about his students and gives a decent amount of extra credit. He gives you a chance to redo and resubmit  your essays no matter what grade you got, very organized and follows the syllabus to a T.",1
"seems like a great person talks nice will go the extra mile to help understand class materials but she's very serious i think she laughed once or twice during class the whole semester, shes talks ALOT, won't let you out a min early and also doesn't accept late homework no matter what you do if your late for an exam she will rush you",1
"Even though Flannery can be silly and animated during his lectures he knows what he is talking about and does a great job of teaching the material. If you don't attend class you won't be deducted points but you will miss a lot of material. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and his teaching to the point where Economics is now my minor.",1
He failed me even though I got  an 80% on the group project... Terrible prof. Not responsive to emails at all.,0
"Although he is a very nice and funny man, I do not recommend him. He moves very fast compared to the other teachers and his lectures were incredibly unclear. He sorta just skims through the chapter and tells you what to look at- doesn't give examples just draws a few sloppy pictures and tells you to do the example on your own. Tests are hard.",0
"Haleh was very caring, but it is hard to get past her accent and yelling. Her lectures were eh. I read and watched many videos to make up for this. She was good at making easy quizzes and moving deadlines just in case. I didn't miss class, but if you did, it might become harder to pass. Take her if you need to, but don't expect anything special.",0
"Dr. Kim has a great personality with an accent to match. Neither of these assist in understanding the materials. Though the tests often covered more chapters than manageable (because she runs out of time), she is fair in grading. I earned a mid-C, but she graciously rounded me to a B due to constant attendance. She recognizes students who try!",0
"Awesome professor! I am terrible at math in general and she made me understand math topics I had failed in high school. Shes very good at explaining things and will take time to make sure every student is on board and clear with what is being taught before moving on. Had her for MAT 111, take her you wont regret it!",1
Amazing professor! Enjoyed his class! His lectures were easy to follow and understand! He gave past midterms to study from which was very helpful!,1
"3 chapters in the 1st week with 10 assignments that took multiple hours to do each. He lets the book teach, I outlined the chapters & did all the extra problems from the book. He is very strict about the academic code. You have to make sure you re-word everything into your own words. Syllabus & FAQs are frightening. Math was easy.",0
"easiest teacher youll have, but dont let that fool you!  she is super easy but you learn everything she teaches in class! her method is amazing props to her.  she will even tell the class the answers for every quiz and test(even the final) before taking it she is such a good teacher",1
"I took culture, nature, and society with Prof Li and it was pretty easy. Took notes every day and when tests came around he'd hand out a study guide. I'd read over my notes maybe once and make sure I was able to answer all the questions on the study guide and got an A- in the class. He's very respectful and enjoys when you participate.",1
This class if full of daily lectures and constant homework assignments. Dr. Steadman is a cool guy but not super flexible on deadlines and outside circumstances. If you pay attention in class and do your work it is an easy A.,1
Pretty good teacher. Really helpful with any questions. Really wanted to help everyone learn and succeed. Not a big fan of the final project in Adolescence class but other than  that pretty good class.,1
Extremely harsh grader that makes you feel like the worst writer in the world. Pray for a B.,0
Great professor that easy to contact and responds quickly. His class is set up very student friendly with a clear understanding of what's need to study without overloading. The least stressful class I've had so far. Highly recommend!,1
"Good teacher - really feel as if she is trying to help you succeed. I made a C, but I deserved it.",1
"Sullivan is an interesting person and knows his material, however, I did not enjoy this class at all. If you have the opportunity, take with someone else. Very disorganized! His exams are completely ambiguous and not related to the material. We had a project/paper with no direction. He never answered email and wasn't available during office hours.",0
"The quizzes give you 90 seconds to complete each question and if you start a discussion she will grade it right away. Discussions are graded as soon as you submit your post, I lost most of my points when she graded the assignment 5 days before the due date and hadn't responded to other people yet and she refused to change it on the due date",0
"I took speech with her over 10 years ago. I'm back to warn those of you who are nervous about speaking in front of others. I suggest you find another professor. She never offered any kind support, in fact, she actually created more anxiety causing situations. It almost seemed, to me, as though she enjoys watching people suffer.",0
"This guy is funny as hell and if you talk to him outside of class he will always help you out.  He also reminds me of Joe Pesci and curses almost constanly. He also doesn't put up with any crap either.  So, if you're a lazy ass bum like one person that commented earlier then don't take the class.  Probably the funnest class I've had because of him.",1
Worst class ever!!!,0
"He is a nice fellow, but always goes off-topic, therefore his class is useless. Its easy to cheat in his class, not that I ever did it, but yeah...I find it frustrating how he does not even notice.",0
"This class is not an easy A. There is a LOT of content, and a lot of the time there will be things on exams that weren't even discussed in class, so keep up with the textbook. Despite this I felt like I really learned a lot and that Dr. Lyons is very knowledgable and passionate about archaeology.",1
What I saw happen was that more than half the class was so demoralized and afraid that they just gave up because they knew he would fail them if they said anything. We were not being lazy or afraid of putting in the work. It was the teaching that was missing. Professor Fontenot shows up makes a few jokes and leaves. The TAs were just like him.,0
"Please get another professor, I'm writing this review because I use the website for reviews but I never wrote one so I realized that we as a student need to help each other! I'm helping you by saying this professor is no good!",0
Very difficult class with poor instruction. Had heard he was a great teacher so maybe the class being online threw him off his game. Would record all classes so you can re-watch them later except the test review lectures. Like what. Glad this one is over with cause that was brutal.,0
shouldn't be teaching intro,0
"Professor Dudley really is amazing. Everyday I woke up excited and eager to attend his class, and that shows a lot. His lectures are very interesting and hes so funny! He includes jokes and personal stories as examples. Going to class is mandatory because the things he says and writes on the board are all also on the tests. Take diligent notes!!!!",1
AMAZING. you work on a really cool group project the entire semester.  He's really helpful and funny and entertaining and an overall great teacher. You do have quite a bit of work (one entry per week kind of like an online class) but theyre enjoyable,1
Nice guy - but he knows nothing asbout MIS - this is not a computer science class - it should be about business.,0
"Pros: - She gives full credit on late assignments. - Difficulty is easy, except for the midterm and final. - She is helpful. Cons: - Her explanation and details on assignments and projects are vague. - If you're having technical difficulty on your assignment, she can't help you.",1
"Course consists of daily lectures from PowerPoint slides, occasional class activities based on nutrition/diet, 4 exams, and a presentation. Grading criteria is very straightforward and Dr. Ferrero is super smart. Be sure to pay attention, participate, and review the exam study guides for an A!",1
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
Hard but good,1
"Incredibly confusing syllabus (you had to check three different places just to figure out what readings you needed to do), tons of reading assigned but never tested, doesn't test on how well you know the material but rather how well you could decipher his unnecessary wordiness. I'm switching out of the Global program because of this class/prof.",0
"Do NOT take this class. He is very inconsistent and unfair. He gives pop quizzes multiple times a week and they are very different from the tests. He assigns up to 5 worksheets for homework a night. Granted it is easy math however sometimes It is very time consuming. Overall, he thinks hes never wrong and is very hard to work with.",0
"It's true, Sean Brennan is the best there is. If he is still teaching mechatronics, don't miss your chance to take it with him. Not a blow-off elective though. Great lectures, lab sections were challenging and often frustrating, but rewarding. Exams and homework were not bad. He is a well-respected guy and the best prof I've had at Penn State.",1
"Professor Tanoukhi seems intimidating at first but that's because she just wants you to do your best. As the semester goes on she really grows on you, and it becomes fun when you engage more. If you're shy at speaking during discussion that's alright, she leaves some slack for that. Fun and enjoyable class overall, and don't forget the readings!!",1
"Class was supposed to be on inductive logic, though we didn't cover much of that. Not really a way to fulfill math requirement. West got off topic a lot and seemed more into trying to entertain than teach. Easy A, but don't expect to learn much.",0
"This guy is a f***ing chooch, I tutored half his class and he failed me. He said I cheated for helping the other kids to much.",0
Professor Aragona executes her lessons in the most organized and straight to the point ways.. She's an amazing professor who offers her assistance and makes contacting her very easy.. I've taken several classes with her and strongly recommended her as a professor!!,1
"I don't know why people are complaining about him keeping us the whole time. Isn't the point to actually have the class you paid for? Anyway, the class isn't difficult at all as long as you turn in the movie reviews and listen during lecture. Most of the movies are very good but I guess me had to show us 1 crappy French art film. I'd take him again",1
"Awful grader. Takes off points for not doing it exactly as he instructs although you understand the problems and your work is in general correct. Don't take him, he will ruin your GPA. If you want to have a good experience at SMC with math professor you need to join the scholars program, otherwise you'll get professors like Mr. Konya. Unfortunately",0
"He's not the worst, not the best. Chemistry is not an easy subject. Lectures can be boring. He has an accent so sometimes he's hard to understand. He comes off as being rude sometimes. He has a pet peeve about headphones. He's a fair grader. It seems like he wants his students to be successful. Better than some of the other CHEM 131 professors.",0
"The class was fairly easy, but her lectures were bad. Spends most of the time talking about her personal life, then has to speed-read off the slides for the remainder of class. Kind of homework-heavy but not hard, just tedious. I wouldn't want to take her again, but I've heard there are way worse psych profs here, so do with that what you will.",0
"Talked randomly about variety of topics that have nothing to do with the tests, no review or outline for tests. Nice guy, but c'mon man. Canceled class without sending an email, and would make you feel uncomfortable if you were late even though he was late 90% of the time. Didn't even know schedule for exams . 2 exams and a short quiz is not fair",0
She takes 20 points off for citation errors. So the max you can get is a B- and no revision opportunities. Awful,0
"Very nice professor. Tests are difficult and sometimes seem unrelated to the lectures. He does curve which is good. About 10 cases studies as homework. Pick a good group for the project and don't slack off. Lectures are long and sometimes boring, but he offers a lot of real world insight and advice. More than willing to help you if you need it.",1
"Dr. Guerriero is incredibly kind! Her passion for the subject matter is always evident.  While her class can be very boring and redundant, it is a breeze, and she makes it very easy to pass. There were 2 easy quizzes and the final, which was not cumulative and taken online.",1
"Very hard to understand, tests are not anything like the lectures, and the study guides he gives out are useless. There are a couple of map quizzes which are super easy and they bump your grade up a little from all of the difficult tests. I would not recommend this professor to anyone.",0
"Took calculus in high school and did very well, but Coop's approach to teaching isn't very helpful. Write down his in class examples, but try to read the book for further understanding",0
This man would tight rope walk the Grand Canyon if it helped you understand a concept. Awesome guy and really loved the material he taught. I suggest everyone use this class as their Tech Elective.,1
in my opinion she really isn't clear on what she wants from your discussion board post or essays until she has gave you your terrible or good grade. very good communication lots of reading and lectures fail a test and your grade will drop like a bad habit.,0
Dr Lopez teaches her class like youre one of her micro colleagues. She forgets that youre in the learning stages. Shes not approachable. She says that shes there to help but not really. Who says to their students right before an exam that I expect everyone to get below 60%. Not very encouraging. Pick another teacher. I dont recommend her,0
"Tends to use internet videos as a tool to teach students and requires students to participate in saying what they learned from the video. If not, a pop quiz is promptly given. Lectures given are over  PowerPoints that are recited word for word.  Doesn't express much enthusiasm in the field of psychology.",0
"All assignments are worth 100 points. If you do bad on one, your grade goes down a lot.",0
"Worst math professor I've ever had. Doesn't allow use of a calculator, often messes up calculations in class but expects you to be perfect.",0
She is pretty good teacher. There are times where it does get confusing when she is explaining a lesson. And there is always a presentation to do in the advance Spanish classes.,1
"Dean Robiniwich is the best professor I hve ever had. I reccomend to take as many classes from him as you can. He is a huge part of the enviroment in the school, always welcoming and helpful. His classes are geared towards bar passage. He is friendly and helpful and makes this school a great place.",1
"Jade is intelligent, she defentialy knows her stuff. When it comes to lecture I felt as she just read word for word what the power point says giving no examples, no explanation, so there was really no complete understanding. Basically felt like I had to teach myself alot, to get through. Lots of extra credit, and can fix your tests for extra points",1
"Mangone is very passionate about the material, but genetics is a hard course. He goes through the slides very fast and often skips whole sections all together. He is good at explaining things if you ask questions. Attendance is counted through clicker points. The tests questions are a lot like the clicker questions.",1
"TERRIBLE!! Makes a ton of mistakes. Always looks at her notes. Can't answer a question not in her notes. Didn't finish much of the laplace section. All homework online (waste of time and money). If you can take someone else, you might actually learn something. If you take her, you'll pass, but not learn anything",0
"You are graded ONLY on tests, but it isn't clear what he will be testing (if it is mostly on the lectures or the textbook readings). The lectures are long and jam-packed with information, and he goes fast in lectures. He shows lots of videos to show clear examples and cracks jokes often, but I would rather him be more clear of his testing methods.",1
"Ne prenez jamais Lawrence Olivier. Incompréhensible, CONFUS, il est perdu comme ca ce peux pas. Les textes qui nous donne sont incomplet, parfois en vieux français, il ne donne pas d'explication, fait juste lire les textes en classe... Bonne chance pour vos travaux, vous ne savez pas comment faire? Lui non plus.",0
Senora Logue is an amazing teacher. You can tell she is very passionate about teaching spanish. She makes class time fun and interactive. I would take her again in a heartbeat!,1
"Easy easy A. Do the online discussions, add a quote or two from the readings, slightly expand and youll get a 100. Ability to get extra credit on every assignment (somehow got it for every one and didnt try). You can put in slight effort and still pass with an A. Highly recommend for a GPA booster.",0
I loved this teacher! She was very nice and understanding towards students. You could tell that she wanted every student to get a good grade and helped everyone to the best of her abilities.,1
This teacher was the most unclear professor that I have ever had. She was never avaliable if you needed help. YOu could never get a hold of her. She told me I was getting one grade then ended up with another. I know a few people she did that to. My thoughts are they could find someone better to teach an education course.,0
"DO NOT TAKE COURSES WITH PROFESSOR RYNER! He is inconsistent in his grading, very vague in his assignments, and overall very boring. He expects you to be an expert on the subject matter beforehand. He will take points off for extremely minor grammar mistakes, while filling his feedback with typos. Terrible instructor!",0
Profesora Garcia is THE BEST Spanish teacher I've had so far. Take her class! She's interactive and teaches so that what you learn will stick. I highly recommend her.,1
Professor Trubatch was not a good lecturer. He would write things on the board without explaining what he was doing and would often just mumble while facing the board. When he did try to say something he sometimes wouldn't even finish his sentences. He never used examples to explain a topic which is necessary in a math class. Avoid at all costs!!,0
"The come-up is real in this one. Danae has been through it y'all. I legit almost cried when she told us her life story. Ok, enough fangirling. Absolutely my favorite class of the semester. The assigned reading & hw was very interesting & eye-opening. The only downsides are that there's a lot of hw & she's pretty disorganized. Still ily though. 3",1
Words cannot describe how horrible this class is.She is completly unprofessional and dedicated in a cultish way to a belief system that shapes the entire class. readings were absurd and yoga useless. ruined the entire discipline for me. i am ashamed that a university like Duke supports this kind of shoddy teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
I enjoyed the way he laid out the lecture material on the board and walked through it before doing practice questions. I would give him a 5 but it was difficult to hear him at times during the lecture.,1
"I had to retake this class after completing it in another program with another teacher and revived an A but with Nella she gets personal grudges and if you give her the wrong impression she will set you up to fail, Im shocked I even passed as she goes back and changes your grades if she feels you no longer deserve that grade. Horrible teacher.",0
Loved Henson's class when I took it. He is extremely down to earth and easy to talk to.,1
A phony and fraud -does not put time or effort into grading student work,0
Literature review was easy but time consuming. Finding articles for your project can be more difficult than you'd think. 15 page final paper was quickly written and his exams are exactly what is on the study guides that he thoroughly goes over before the exam. Teaches APA style. Very helpful.,1
"I had him pre/post COVID. The course work: pre labs, group lab reports, journals, quizzes, tests, MyLab, pre-recorded lectures, & zoom sessions. Although he is a sweet guy, he expects far too much and gives too little. The lectures were fine if you read. Labs were unorganized & work-heavy. He often had multiple things due at once. Don't recommend!",1
"You can tell he likes what he does. You always know what to expect on tests, he gives some extra credit, and will always answer any questions you have. Highly recommend him.",1
Professor Walker is by far the best professor i have had. There are 2 writing assigments due every week as well as class acitivites that are worth 10 points but she provides a study guide for each exam which consists of 50 multiple choice questions. Final consisted of a group project requiring a 10 slide resentation and 5-7 page research paper.,1
Easy A and loved his lectures. You have 1 apa paper and chapter take-home quizzes. I recommend renting the book if you want to fly through without too much effort. Definitely would take again!,1
Un des meilleurs profs d'HEC !,1
boring lecture ever    Makes you get a coma,0
Great teacher knows her stuff! boring class sometimes felt pointless and unnecessarily long.,1
"This is the most unorganized teacher I have ever taken in my life! We have (4) 4-5 page papers due within a 6 week time period. And she couldnt figure out how to work the online system for 3 of those weeks. She didnt even grade out first paper until one week before the summer term was over. If you are in unorganized student, you will not make it.",0
Does not seem to understand the material during lecture times and does not go over the material to make sure you understand. Not the best professor!,0
I just took him this fall semester and Im not the strongest person in science but I managed to finished with a B. Definitely worth taking him,1
"This class was not at all what I expected.  The tests were completely random and hard, but at least he scaled them. Lectures are hard to sit through for 1hr and 20 min",0
he reads his own notes that are so messy you can barely read it. terrible experience. tests are hand written and difficult to understand. tests have nothing to do with his notes or homework.,0
"She is nice, but not a good teacher. Doesn't go through material very well and not organized. He class almost seems pointless. She expects more from you than what she teaches, and so very easy to get confused. Especially on tests and papers.",0
"Fully Online Pros: You go at your own pace & don't need to attend recitation. Cons: You go at your own pace (you need to have good time management & be strict with yourself). Advice: Don't freak out, just get things done ASAP. Do all your HW & go to tutoring center at least 1x per chapter. Get tutored 2x before each test. Don't need to read hw.",0
"This guy got a chemistry degree from Israel. I don't  understand why our school of chemical engineering hired him because he obviously doesn't know too much in our field. He made an evident mistake in the class, but when a student pointed it out, he denied it! After that I decided to be absent from the class since I highly doubted his ability.",0
"CLASS WAS A BREEZE. SHE IS A GREAT PROFESSOR. STUDY, STAY CAUGHT UP ON YOUR WORK AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.",1
"This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. I am fairly certain I will retake it, not because I didn't pass but because I didn't get anything out of it. I don't feel like I have any better understanding of the subject. DON'T TAKE THIS TEACHER! This was a disaster of a class.",0
"I came to this class with some understanding of statistics.  I'm leaving wondering what the heck he was talking about.  As has been said, he teaches from the slides, which usually don't make much sense.  His lectures simply aren't clear and he doesn't seem to care.",0
Overall  i think one of the best statistics teacher  at palm beach state. If I had to i would  take him again  as long as you have the Ti84 or Ti83 and do the homework you should be ok. And if you ever need professor Davis his at the math lab to help.. very good professor..,1
"Deeply difficult to understand which makes the material hard to understand. If you are a Russian native you will have no trouble, but for Memphis Tennessee its impossible to understand her.",0
The class is pretty easy. In class labs are given once or twice a week and are worth 10 to 20 points. Dr. Liu is actually really funny and basically tells you what questions will be on the exam.,1
Great teacher! Heres my tip to get an A. His lectures are important so write everything he says. He gives out an outline of the test material. He lets you look at the essay questions before the test. he gives bonus points for everyone on the test depending on the class average. Offers extra credit. make sure to write long essay if you want an A.,1
"You eventually get used to his accent and he is a very brilliant man! Pay attention in class and his lectures, and do the hw bc thats where he gets his exam questions from. Get to know him and make sure he knows your name bc he will help you out bc he knows you want to do well. If you show him that you want to do well he will help you!",1
She is unfocused and unfair.,0
This class is purely online and is the single most convoluted course I have ever taken. Complicated usage of CANVAS. I am only three weeks into the course and the assignments are due in parts on different days with outside applications required.,0
"horrible teacher, she knows what shes doing but no one else does. she is not helpful and is simply not a good teacher for calc. avoid having her",0
pretty hard. good luck! youll need some with this course,0
"Very clear speaker, but you have to pay VERY close attention to his lectures. I love classics, but I have to say this class does nothing for me. Too many texts to read, and tests take a long time to write. There are also too many definitions to study, but that doesn't guarantee you'll see some ever on a test. He leaves off really important terms.",1
If your looking for an easy enjoyable class this is the class for you,1
"Has good knowledge, but lacks in presentation. sometimes hard to catch him. surprise tests count for grading. don't miss class :(",0
Fun Class! Quick pace. Lots of info. Read what he puts on blackboard,1
"The worst teacher I've ever had so far. He was always late and full of himself; lectures would often turn into a statistics class, which was neither interesting nor helpful. He often got carried away and shared personal details from his past. The lectures would end up being useless and had nothing to do with test questions. Made mean comments often",0
"Honestly, if you procastinate I recommend you not take this class because he is a tough grader! He doesn't care for excuses he will give you the grade he thinks you deserve. If you show up everyday, pay attention, and take very good notes then you'll most likely pass but very few people pass",0
"Dr. Feige was so much fun. Just be prepared to work hard, his class is not easy. He was amazing as we had to switch over to online because of COVID. He's super patient and he's so much fun to be around.",1
"One of the best English professor at CCBC. Took her for ENG 102 online course. Only advice i would give is do what you are supposed to do, and you will get an A",1
"If you don't get an A in this class, you're doing it wrong. Incredibly easy. You will learn a LOT about Philadelphia politics and government. There's really no higher authority on Philadelphia politics than him, whether you liked him as mayor or didn't or aren't from Philly either way. Final exam is a city council budget simulation. NO PAPERS/TESTS",1
Sure nice guy!! Is extremely good looking and easy on the eyes.. I could look at his chiseled body all day!!,1
"She is the best professor ever. If you do your essays and assigned journals, trust me you will get easy A !!! I love her, she made me start loving writing the essays. the class is so much funny, she is a very modern professor, you will have a lot of fun in class. Having problems with essays? always there for you whenever you need her. ",1
Worst professor ever. Checks everything for plagiarism and will tell the dean about you. When you dont understand something he will make sure you know your a failure for it.,0
"Professor Pangalozzi is a very caring professor, she assigns a lot of readings but you can skim through papers. As long as you demonstrate knowledge of the readings and participate, she will give you a good grade. My lab grades weren't the best, and I still got an A. Exams are based on the textbook, not hard. Will recommend her for ENVI majors.",1
"I got an A in this course, but I don't feel like I learned anything.  The professor seemed nice on the surface.  However, he was a huge scatterbrain and his lectures often went on long rants about minor details.  Take this class if you have to, otherwise please don't.  Most of my classmates did awful in this course, he has a specific grading style.",0
"Honestly learned absolutely nothing, and she was one of the worst teachers I've ever had. I am not very good at math, so I was hoping I could utilize her office hours, but whenever I went she would do nothing but complain about her life, and told me to ""work harder"". I would NOT recommend this class to anyone.",0
"Did not learn much, discussions where not helpful and were off topic, wish I could have gotten more out of this class.",0
"Li Liu is amazing! Her lectures are very INTERESTING, quizzes are based on a textbook, discussion posts are pretty easy. Li Liu has great communication skills, she's very CARING and will work with you if you have any problem or need extra help. Her assignments helped me to become a better communicator, succeed at work and understand people better.",1
"Very enthusiastic even when everyone is tired in the morning. Makes class fun! Teaches exactly what we need to know. She does spelling bees, games and videos to help us learn. Great instructor with a great personality!",1
Marek would be easier to comprehend if he stopped taking English lessons from E.T.,0
"I've only had her for one course, but she is a very caring professor. She really cares how you do in her class and takes the time to help you on your assignments, ensuring that you understand concepts clearly and correctly. I recommend taking her classes.",1
Awful prof. Condescending attitude towards students. Sometimes she messed up her lessons & was corrected by her students. MC tests were horrible. I dropped this class the day before the last drop day. The material was interesting but I don't recommend this class if she's teaching it.,0
"This guy is the worst guy you can take for 330, he doesn't care about,  and he thinks u're only taking 3 credits per semester because you have to constantly study for his pop quizzes.  Avoid it at all cost.  When I took this class he gave us the pop quizz in the second of class .... like seriously ?  u have not time to warm up with him ",0
Had him for multiple classes. Does not care about his students. Does not care about his course material. More focussed on his own career at the expense of others. He taught one class (Malware) completely from a power point without actually doing any labs like we are supposed to. His test questions are pulled directly textbooks. WASTE OF TIME/MONEY.,0
I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR :) HE IS THE BEST && FUNNY !! TAKE HIM !,1
"I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!!! But remember: Pittman expects you to do your work. Pay attention. Write your essays. Study. It's not hard to get a great grade if you study - but if you don't care enough about your education to study this isn't the class for you. Pittman has a beautiful Minnesotan accent, is a lovely person to talk to, and very helpful.",1
"Dr. Swint is a very good teacher. He is pretty funny and his classes almost always hold your interest. Attendance is important, and taking good notes is also important. And he's on Twitter!",1
"One of my favorite courses that I have ever taken, and I am normally not the kind of guy who likes literature based classes! Dr. Osborne is awesome in leading discussion, and makes sure everyone is engaged. I highly recommend!",1
"Also, the lectures are very boring. He thinks we are dumb and we don't know anything. He makes us feel like we are uneducated students. I have never felt so low in my life, I have always gotten A's in college except for his class. I recommend to him, respect your students because without students you are not a teacher.",0
"By far one of the best professors I have taken. Very relaxed and personable, wants to ensure her students understand the material. Handouts are very helpful, shows work step by step in ppt and on the board. Exams are 2/3 of final grade, no cheat sheets. Comprehensive final included in drop. Wish she taught more courses, would definitely take again!",1
a lot of homework ,0
"the absolute hardest nursing class i have taken at bellarmine. so much busy work. every class we either had a quiz or paper due while also taking two other nursing classes that all require tons of studying. the powerpoints are not helpful and the exams are hard, not what you would expect to be tested over. helps out of class, but classclear as mud",1
"Former mayor of Philly so he has cool guests. The class was very easy and there is a lot of opportunities to really participate and learn about local gov. You truly just have to show up and complete assignments, which are rather short. He gives a unique perspective which I feel is valuable. Definitely very interesting to say the least.",1
She really drills in what is needed to know about test so when taking the test it is easy to remember. She also does online test.,1
"There are in class assessment questions so you have to attend zoom lectures but Dr. reddy has amazing powerpoint that are really good for studying for exams. She writes her own exam questions and they are very specific so pay attention to what she emphasizes during lecture. One exam was unnecessarily hard but other than that, she is a solid prof.",1
I really enjoyed her class but I personally feel like she's a feminist.  :(  I put in a lot of effort and still a C? ,0
"His American Lit online class is just a lot of time consuming work. You have to read what he assigns, make 6 discussion posts (200 words only gets you a C). I like to do things fast and having to wait for other people to post to reply to them is stupid. The work is easy though? I like doing the discussions.",1
"She's an amazing professor! Its psychology, so of course you're going to read, don't be lazy because it'll only get harder for you. She helps you out a lot and is very open to new things or any concerns you may have. Shes very inspirational and motivated to help you try your best ... the work load isn't hard at all! Just read & study!! ",1
"If you want to pass you must attend! His favorite sentence is ""I'm here to help you learn!!"" Class is pretty dang hard and hard to understand the lectures but he's pretty approachable. You can sit there and listen to his lectures but it's easier to write down the information in your own terms. Ask him a lot of questions!",0
"Mr. Miura is never available outside of class, I sent him several emails outside of class and only a few were responded to. He is a tough grader and you may get the answer right to his conceptual questions but if its not worded like how he wants you dont do well. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!",0
"He is a fantastic guy but one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He is very unclear with what he wants and he frequently forgets what he originally required and changes his mind. He is a nice and funny guy but he just cannot teach. Nearly everything I learned in that class was from the book. Take someone else for this class, you won't regret it.",0
"I took Dr. Hadley last fall and she was a fantastic professor. Despite taking ANTH 4301 online, she made she she would answer our questions and grade our assignments in a timely manner. Her lectures were very helpful and interesting. I also had to complete an 8-10 page paper for this class (this assignment may require a lot of feedback and help).",1
I made an account just to comment on what a terrible online teacher Derek Maher is. I wish I could've read this before taking the class online. It is not an easy online class. He does not work well with computers and is hard to keep up with his mishaps. He is terrible at responding to emails which is crazy because its online! Tests are hard. ,0
"Easy class. Only a few essays and she tells you ahead of time, not much homework. Attendance is mandatory",1
She doesnt have a good method of teaching. Just expects students to know stuff that wasnt even on previous assignments and without teaching it. Class is filled with examples but no teaching of concepts,0
"Kula is nice, but BORING! I had him for 4 hours a day, twice a week and that was a challenge! GET MY ACCOUNTING LAB! he doesn't use it in class but its all the h/w problems and they tell you answers and it helps on exams. Exams are pretty fair...gotta know what you're doing though! Accounting is hard...you kinda gotta teach urself if u have kula:((",0
She is a great professor. If you go to class and do the projects that are given over the semester you will be fine. She gives feedback on the Material that she thinks you should improve in the future. You will actually learn something from this class if you pay attention and do your work. She will also help you if you have problems with essay paper,1
"Dr. Kim is likely the sweetest lady on this earth. Sit up front. Laugh at her jokes. Make eye contact. If you are focusing, you will understand her accent. Saying you ""can't understand her"" is a copout. Be motivated. I took her for Org Chem Lec and Lab and got easy A's in both. Dig into her power points and do her study problems. You'll do fine.",1
"Good teacher, she is knowledgeable, professional, approachable  and kind in her words to students. Take her class you will be well prepared for your life's journey. One of the best at Humber College.",1
Why is she still teaching?????!!!,0
She's a good teacher. She has some good stories and she has a great sense of humor:) recommend,1
"Great professor who keeps his lecture interesting and funny, I have taken him twice and as long you study for the tests and attend class you bound to get a good grade! ",1
The class was boring if you dont like the course. He is boring. Class is mandatory. Gives you a week to turn everything in. Not that bad. Just boring. I passed with an A.,0
"Professor Horn is such a kind person, and is easy to reach. She is an easy grader and hardly ever gives homework. She truly cares about each one of her students.",1
Really hard class and is not clear in his lectures would not recommend this class at all.,0
"My FAVORITE psych prof. I've had him for 371, 484, and 485. He's so friendly and funny/corny. So smart and knows his stuff, which makes his lectures interesting. He's a very tough grader though. If you go to him for help, he'll tell you exactly what you need/what he wants to see. If you follow his advice, you'll get an A or B for sure. Great guy.",1
Always makes sure if someone needs help. Gives good feedback. Not a tough grader.  Gives plenty of extra material if needed.,1
