Tough tests you can't image!!,0
What did she even say? With her accent an fast talking I wasn't able to understand much of what she said. Her way of answering questions is by avoiding them. The online Labs Plus was more help than she was. ,0
Seminar on Internet and Politics.  Great class.  Highly recommended.,1
You could actually watch the oxygen leave the room.,0
Professor Chavez is a nice lady and sends out reminders for when work is due. The only way to fail this class is by not doing the work and by not studying.,1
"Dr. Raja's class isn't that hard, but be prepared to be talked down to a lot...I just kept my head down and surfed the back row.  Not a lot of busy work outside of class at least.  You can pull off a B in her class relatively easily if you just study a bit and show up, but I found her sense of humor and attitude toward students really irritating.",0
"She pulled a whole weight off my shoulders my first year of college. She is clear from the beginning of what is expected from you. Her feedback is very helpful and teaches clearly. She will contact you if it looks like you might be in danger of failing too. She's very helpful, I suggest taking her class. Time always flew by in my English 21A class.",1
"Very nice professor, love her personality! LABS ARE FUN, BUT If your are not a science major DO NOT take this class. Test are tough  ""This is why i hate teaching non science majors"" Her words exactly.",0
"Class and Professor Unorganized and unclear. Never know what is expected. Arrogant, self serving,controlling, retained hardly anything. If you can take a different professor for this class I would recommend it.",0
This guy is the man... period.,1
Don't take this class. I read these reviews prior to the class and decided to take it anyway. It was terrible. He doesn't appreciate others opinions or views about a reading. Also there is a ridiculous amount of readings for this class. Lastly his TA is terribly as well. A mixture of the 2 made this class miserable.,0
"OMG-PROFESSOR BRADSHAW WAS INTERESTING, HE DID HAVE A KNEE INJURY THEREFORE HE GAVE US A COUPLE OF TAKE HOME EXAMS, WHICH WAS SWEET...HOPE HE GETS BETTER..",1
"As other said, and at this time I have to add, even in an online class, be ready for this teacher to go off topic, very unorganized, shares too much of her private life. I will say if the class were face to face she would have been talking about her life all day long. No offense but may be it is time to stay home and enjoy your family.",0
"I absolutely love Prof Cutler. If you do take her class though, be ready to work for your grade. Attendance isn't mandatory but your grade will be MUCH higher than someone who skips if you go to all of the scheduled class sessions. She is very caring and I recommend having her as a professor. Highly recommend skimming lessons in book before class.",1
"He didn't use a textbook, instead he sent us copies of homework reading. Lectures were really interesting and he knows so much. I loved this class and what I learned has helped me understand not only education but also politics. Only had 3 tests, 25 easy discussion posts, and a group artwork project. Easy but great.",1
Horrible! She hates her students is the simple way to put it. Never responded to my email from 3 weeks ago. Does not care at all,0
"One of the best teachers at Evangel! Dude is tough, but he cares about your learning and about you. I went to him many times with personal issues-- even on holiday breaks. He is awesome!",1
"Marketing: Is a nice lady. Lectures strictly out of the book so class is a little boring, make sure to take a highlighter cuz dont have enough time to write anything down. Tests are pretty easy to get by with a B but just like any class make sure you study. Have to do 5 little presentation papers which are easy.",1
"I was very excited to have Rachael as a teacher due to all the good things people say about her. However, she is completely unorganized, expects participation but doesn't give engaging lectures or ask good questions and then blames it on the students. BUT 505 is insanely easy course with her.",0
Very personable and fun professor,1
"She is very helpfull, fair, smart. She always answers questions. I didn't know Chemistry but I learned from her a lot. She is good professor.",1
Taking this course online was rough. Prof Ferguson seems like a lovely woman but definitely struggled to teach this course online. She gave vague directions and nothing she said during her lectures ever made much sense. Would not recommend this course (online at least maybe she is better in person).,0
Good professor. Helpful where it counts.,1
"Don't take S&P with Palmer, he makes it unnecessarily difficult. Much of your grade is 2 tests, which are ridiculously hard. He didn't give us any hints on what's on them, saying everything in the chapters is ""fair game"" so I spent hours memorizing like 170 concepts to be tested over 20 of them. It is the hardest and worst class I've ever taken.",1
"shes so amazing! she seems cold but she can be so helpful. shes a brilliant artist and knows A LOT. She will gear you in the right direction, just give her a chance.",1
"You have got to be kidding me! Ridiculously boring lectures, all class, every class (this is a liberal arts college!), difficult to understand, and a horrible grader. Expects very much from students taking a 100 level course.",0
"Honestly, I hated his class. He came off as a nice guy at first but was close minded and rude to people who had other ideas. If you disagreed with his ideas he hated you the rest of the term. He assigned way too much reading for a 244 class. He's a great teacher for suck ups but if you aren't a brown noser and think for yourself watch out.",0
"she's a great teacher, she's a no nonsense kind of teacher, do the reading and work and you will do ok. if you don't do that than you will fail . the tests are somewhat hard. its multiple choice and open ended questions. attendance is mandatory. if you are lazy and not a good student don't take this course or have her for a teacher. not boring.",0
"Great teacher, definitely learned a lot from him. Hes honest and straight forward with great stories.",1
"He wanted to be funny, but he doesn't really make people laugh. He makes genetics jokes. He occasionally will have extra credit pop quizzes, so attend class daily and on time( if you are in class you get one point). Really takes the time to make sure everyone knows the material.",1
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"I've taken Physics and Intro to Solar System Astronomy with her. She's very interesting, and gives lots of great examples. Class is extremely interactive and she is incredibly quirky. Honest grader. Her English isn't perfect, but it doesn't take much to understand what she says. Encourages students to correct her grammatical errors. Very chill.",1
"She wasnt ever direct in what she wanted and Was a very harsh grader. She was very scatterbrained all of the time, would not take this class ever again. Literally avoiding taking her class this upcoming semester.",0
"You have three books and lectures to read each week, averaging at about 140 pages per. Then you have a 30 question quiz, often with paragraph long questions. Then you have pages long ""discussion"" board topics to write weekly and bi-weekly journals. All the while you need be working on your 40-50 pages term paper. This class is busy work.",0
"Nice man, very patient with students. Although class is not mandatory, it is important that you go to lectures because they're only twice a week. Quizzes are 1 day before the test. A lot of hw.  Grades on completeness. Tests are hard, but should be easy if you attend all lectures. Willing to work around your schedule.",1
"Dr. Brown is a great teacher! I took his three hour course and was generally engaged the whole time (which is difficult.) He does a lot of activities so you're not bored, and I found all of his assignments to be worthwhile! He's a super nice guy and a great resource even after you're done taking his class!",1

She only allows 3 absences. If you're on your phone or daydreaming she counts you absent. She is super hard grading on papers. You have to read short stories and take quizzes on them on very specific things from the story. She barely smiles and is very monotone. I would not recommend taking this teacher.,0
Too much material for him to teach. I've never heard anyone say anything good about him. Very arrogant and impressed with himself. I am a little confused why he teaches this class since he mentioned he had a degree in engineering. He forgets about the PP behind him that goes along with his lecture and clicks through it at the very end. Avoid.,0
"Frank is the best. Plain and simple. One of the best professors at SUNY Potsdam. He's my advisor and he is one of the most helpful, funny, and honest people. He's a wonderful professor.",1
Really improved my signing ability! My favourite ASL prof to date.,1
"I would advise to take this class online. It is a lot of work required, but just make sure you do it bay the deadline.  She was extremely helpful and doesn't require you to do as many LearnSmart questions like other teachers. That's why I took her twice.",1
"My average math grade in highschool was a 76. My grade in her class is a solid B (85). She gives a good amount of homework, but it really helped me understand what she was teaching. She teaches quick and simple ways to do math equations. She is funny, good sense of humor and reasonable with grading. I would recommend her to anyone.",1
"Three exams (85%) 100 questions each. first two exams are noncumulative and the third exam(final) is partially cumulative. Clicker Quiz every week or so (5% of overall grade.) He gives chapter homework assignments like right before each test (easy 10%.)STUDY THE PRACTICE EXAMS, he does not change his exams much. If it is bolded on the ppt, know it.",1
Where should I start? just know you need to eat the book and teach yourself everything. lots and lots and lots of homework. does not understand the situation of his students during the pandemic.,0
"Her grading criteria sucks! 60% is based on test 10% is on hmwrk.  If your not good in math, My suggestion is keep looking.  She purposely makes the test hard so you can fail. When she grades your test she marks you off for every lil thing even though it is correct.",0
"She is nice but doesn't grade, can be very unclear with what needs to be done, and is slow with any sort of feedback",0
Took her for the summer course and it was a lot of fun. Quizes before class on readings but pretty straight forward and simple. Really fun professor and she definitely knows her stuff. The class was really fun just try to engage in what is being talked about and you'll be fine. As long as you go to class and try you'll have no issues with thisclass,1
Awesome teacher! I took a lot from this class! Highly reccomend :),1
"As a teacher myself, this guy could use some pedagogy classes. Sure, he knows the material, but can he teach? No. I had to practically teach myself. If you asked him a question he would belittle you in front of the whole class. I think he means well, perhaps he should be working with more advanced students, not amateurs. Avoid this class if possibl",0
By far the worse and meaningless class so far. He spends 60% of time talking nonsense and inappropiate things not related to class. Then rushes 10 mins before class expecting us to know all the info before exam in next class. Expects us to read the chapters byt vaguely discusses them in class. Long study guide with short and long answers required.,0
"Doesn't teach very well and usually explains things poorly, but his notes are excellent.  Teaches straight from class notes.  Requires a lot of work outside class to succeed.  Attendance of TA's office hours is usually required to get a good grade on the homework.  If you put in a good amount of effort, a great grade is possible.  Slackers beware.",0
Great easy class but must be disciplined,1
"This class is awful. I'm sitting here now and am debating getting up and leaving. She has NO clue how to use the online system and if you don't do the homeworks (which are graded) you WILL fail. She never lets you leave early and is so unclear, for a 101 class she speaks Spanish 90% of the time. Drop this now. ",0
This is an online course.  The semester is over and there are still unanswered e-mails that need a response. Not a good communicator at all.,0
The essays assigned are almost impossible to get an A in. The essay prompts are also poorly written. His expectation on said essays is very different from just about everyone's previous writing styles (which he will deduct points for).,0
"The professor is very chill, nice to talk to. But what he did in exams is not fair. He just left us all on our own, no clear criteria of what to do in exams. Once the exam is done, he posted the actual criteria and deducted marks. If he didn't mess up the exam I would have given 5 rating :(",0
"African-Americans in film ... don't take this class. most of the time we get out early, but class discussions are 5 minutes long and mostly consist of him saying the same things about one movie as the previous one. The book is good. won't learn much. harsh paper grader",0
Dr. Lai is very knowledgable professor.,1
"He is very nice.  He will make you feel like he is judging your every move.  He will appreciate any contribution you make to discussion.  His syllabus, yes, is outdated and his grading is harsh, and he will try to make you care about stupid literature which no one cares about.  There is a lot of writing, and little room for extra credit.",0
"Could never understand what he was saying with his accent. Even if I could the lectures were boring and couldn't pay attention. I studied the material myself outside of class. Pop quizzes but he drops 3- although he ended up dropping 4 and an exam because so many people were struggling. Bought the book but never used, all powerpoints are online.",0
"There are assignments due for each class, they usually are pretty short though. Sometimes her grading criteria is unclear but she is willing to work with the students to change. There is A LOT of small group work so be prepared to meet EVERYONE in your class because she will make you work with different people multiple times in one class period.",1
Makes you earn your grades.,1
"Mrs Hays was an okay instructor. She does expect you to keep up with weekly schedule as do most instructors. You can ask her questions. You will need your book and you will have to do most homework on cengage, then weekly discussions/replies to peers. Most homework was due once weekly and that is it! She was not hard!",1
"I am thoroughly impressed with how Dr. Kelley laid out course materials in Blackboard. Everything is easily accessible, organized to limit confusion for students. I WISH that every professor would lay out their classes this way.",1
"He gives you a good presentation and you have some time to use your note during the test. However, there is a lot of pop quiz during his class and you cannot use your note on that. His grading system is different. He doesn't grade based on percentage. he grades on based how much points that you get",1
"Mrs. Bowlin does not teach at all. she just sits there and reads the ""questions"" that will be on the test. i have not really learned anything in the class. and we don't have any type of disscussion. any time that there is an attempt at disscussion from one of the students she shoots it down.",0
Took course online for fall 2018. Course had little assignments but tons of reading and 2 papers to complete work. Not sure what to make of it but it required 2 books.,0
His way or the highway.  Not my way.,0
Took the eight week online course and it's no joke! Be ready to work and have lots of it. She is no joke. Kind of a tough grader also. Takes a while to respond to emails.,1
"A lot of fun. Quirky, and very amusing. She's very helpful with work and goes at a relatively slow pace so that everyone can keep up. There are problems that can be done much simpler ways, but the way she teaches sometimes take 1 or 2 pages just to solve one problem! Otherwise very enjoyable teacher!",1
"AWEFUL!! I took Cultural History of Dogs and was SO excited for it.  She totally ruined it by teaching the class as though it was an impossible writing class.  If you can help it, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!",0
"Would NOT recommend taking any class with Eric. He does not teach well, few examples, would rather talk about off subject topics. He will grade you well if he likes you as a student, otherwise you fail. One of the worst professors out there.",0
Great Professor! At the end of the semester if youve missed a certain number of times your letter grade is dropped. He also gives alot of pop quizzes. If you show up to class they are easy and so are the tests. You cannot make up anything but if you know you will miss he lets you take stuff early,1
"This is a very difficult class, especially if you had no French experience in high school. Do your homework, do her little extra research projects and extra credit assignments.  Try really hard to practice speaking French (you never practice in class, only get graded in class). This class will become your life.",1
He is an old man. He makes lectures boring and gives only a limited amount of extra credit to a few students. He gives too much homework problems to do. He makes mistakes that involves math and sitting on his own glasses (Best Moment of his Class). He is disrespectful. He takes points off small details. He makes people feel bad. He shouldn't teach,0
"I don't know if online isn't his thing, but he really dropped the ball this semester. Everything from lectures to hw resources posted late enough to not be useful, or not at all. On top of that he doesn't let you show work on exams. Makes our lives harder to make his easy. Avoid.",0
bad teacher,0
"TAKE THIS PROFESSOR AT YOUR OWN RISK! Completely unhelpful, unwilling to correct mistakes, straight lecture, no actual problems done until you do your homework. Extremely picky grades while creating ridiculously vague problems on test.",0
He is a chill man. Very smart and teaches well. Very clear and super helpful!!,1
The class wasn't all that difficult and it is my fault for slacking off towards the end. But he was easily the worst CS professor I have ever had. I'm not sure if it was just me but the way he taught the class and interacted with students made me feel very unmotivated to participate. I would avoid taking a class with him at all costs.,0
"What he was looking for in a paper is never immediately clear. I would turn in three essay drafts (2 more than required) trying to get them to his liking and he was never satisfied with them. The class structure was unorganized, but he says some pretty entertaining things. Would not recommend this class if you can take another elective.",1
"Professor Lorentz is hilarious. His lectures make me laugh and they help me remember so much more. He makes everything in the class very interesting and explains things in detail. Show up to class, try to avoid taking a class that is more than an hour a day with him because you will get distracted from his lecture. Other than that, he is GREAT.",1
"This professor just reads off of her slides and goes through them really fast. She rarely participates with the class. She DOES give partial credit on exams which is, I guess, a plus. If you miss a class don't worry because she posts her slides on blackboard. She gives study points that don't really help and she's terrible at explaining things.",0
For someone who always taught online you would think she would be good but this was ridiculous,0
This class will take over your work-life. Way too tough of a grader.,0
SHE DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL. REFUSES TO HELP STRUGGLING STUDENTS. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
Orgo is hard enough as it is. Do yourself a favor and just take Flemming if you want to understand anything at all.,0
"He's super chill & nice but tends to explain things in a way thats rly roundabout and can be a bit confusing/boring, but if you ask him questions he will explain happily. he encourages group work and the practice tests are almost exactly like the exams so thats rly nice. also he was really accommodating when i had to take a test late bc i was sick",1
Professor Scoville is a great man with a big heart. I would have enjoyed the class more if we didn't get stuck on the small things and focused more on the larger topics.,0
"He is no help at all and is just awful, don't know how he has a teaching license.",0
No Comments,1
"This is my second class with Crocoll and he is the best professor for those of us who don't have a strong suit in Math. His lectures really do prepare you for the exams and quizzes, making a difficult subject not so daunting. 5 exams (lowest dropped,) and 17 quizzes (lowest 2 dropped,) and offers 25-40 extra credit points. No homework.",1
"Idk why her ratings are so low but trust me when I say she's amazing. She explains things rlly well, and rlly cares about her students. Responds to emails, and helps u whenever u need it. She is a tough grader but she gives you good feedback on drafts so u can get good grades. If you'll put in the work then you'll be fine. Take her she's amazing!!",1
"A lot of people didnt like Isabelle, and while she wasnt the best lecturer, I really liked how she set up the lectures. We would have a break halfway through class to work on sample problems of the material we just covered, which were similar to the ones on the final. I really appreciated this. The final also wasnt too bad!",1
Great Teacher! I had her for microbio and human anatomy! She is very helpful! I learned so much! The classes were really fun!,1
"Phenomenal professor one of the best I've ever had at Albany! Very quick to respond to emails, and always extremely helpful. Lectures are the usual, but just follow his online slides and you'll do fine. Material is somewhat tough, but the actual data mining Python scripts you write are really fun.   Would definitely take another class with Chen. ",1
"Really straight forward class that  includes two midterms, one book review, and a final. Exams are multiple choice with one short answer. The study guides she post make studying for the exams super easy. Questions from the readings and inclass videos are on the exams. Doesnt require too much effort to do well.",1
"Professor Lopez was a funny, charismatic, and approachable lecturer who could make Shakespeare appealing to anyone. Plus there's an option to write no essays (if you take an extra test)! I would recommend his classes to anyone. It",1
"I got an A minus in her class which is surprising to me. She is the most difficult teacher i ever had it was stressful throuhout the whole semester, she takes points off every thing. Don't get me wrong she is nice but she's just a harsh professor. I took this as a hybrid if you like a challenge take her class . This class took most of my time.",1
This lady is very unfair!!! she WANTS you to FAIL.  You have to suck up to her hardcore to get anything close to a B. DO NOT TAKE HER!,0
"Difficult, but worth it.  There is real insight to be had in the lectures, which are highly structured.  Contrary to popular opinion here I found him to be pragmatic if he found the majority of students hadn't prepared well for class, in that he could adjust on the go to ensure clarity.  If you can dedicate the time, take his classes, it's worth it",1
"Dr. Ranft is a great guy. However, refrain from taking his ethics class. Everything has a right or wrong answer whether or not your values are different. He loses assignments very frequently and is often late to class. His test are ridiculous and most material is from Google. If you have options, do NOT take his class!",0
"The most arbitrary grade I have ever received. Most of the grade is his opinion on your ""participation"". I learned NOTHING in this class. The material was basically pop psychology. To hammer the point home again, Meyer and his class was useless in every sense of the word.",0
"Nice guy, but I hated him. I never understood what he was trying to explain. Sometimes would spend whole lecture on problem then say it was wrong, and it had nothing to do with homework or test. Too much theory and not enough examples. Only C I ever received at Stevens",0
"Goes over material too fast, doesn't ever give out handouts to learn from. All he does is just talk and do quick problems on the board..",0
"An easy class to get your writing intensive requirement out of the way. Attendance is 20% of your grade and the classes are pretty boring if you're not a GEO major. Two big papers with four smaller ones in between. Try hard on them and follow the requirements, you'll get an A.",1
"Jim and I got off to the wrong foot. At first I hated his class but after the midterm things got better. His assignments are time consuming and there's a TON of them so be prepared. He's a sweet guy and I like him as a person, just not as a professor.",1
"Extremely helpful, made learning the topics fun and easy. Loved her job which made learning the material a lot easier. Cared about her students and how they were all doing. Dropped a bunch of low grades and assignments.",1
"Very easy to talk to and helped me when needed.  The second half of this class is quite difficult and statistics. Her tests are open-ended questions and difficult to get done (13-14 questions) in the time period. Overall, she is a very good teacher and makes you learn!",1
Easy class. The test questions are exactly the same as the study guide in the back of the book. Class can get a little boring sometimes but its mostly because its a 3 hour class. She's funny and her accent is great.,1
"Freshman here. I had some issues adjusting to being away from home, as well as the workload that comes with attending a university. I fell behind (like bad, I was failing pretty hard), but Heyborne worked with me to get caught up. He had no reason to give me a second chance, but he did. I highly recommend his class. He's definitely the best.",1
"Genuinely one of the most caring professors out there. She is a true gem. Always super quick to respond to emails, and will go out of her way to communicate with you. I could not make office hours but I wanted to go, and she facetimed me outside of her work hours to make sure I had my questions answered. Truly the best.",1
"offers great instruction from an actor's perspective, not JUST a professor",1
"The papers are graded weeks after they're turned in. This is very bothersome because you don't get feedback on your mistakes until after you've turned in ANOTHER paper. Also, I'm two days away from the classes closing and I'm waiting for 3 papers to be graded AND the final to be graded. Also, no help. Read, quiz, exam, paper, repeat.",0
I would recommend Jana. She cares about her students and is very helpful. Always has a smile on her face and an attitude that matches.,1
She is very  disrespectful and very unprofessional and unorganized .,0
"Dr. Schellhorn is by far he worst professor I've ever had. She says on day 1 that the final exam is going to be incredibly difficult and every semester the average is an F. She also says that she won't curve the course at the end, but not each individual exam. She only curves by 9 points but says that she will curve by a lot more than than.",0
"She might be a good therapist , but a horrible educator . One of my worst professor forever",0
Don't take class with her. She was the worst professor that I had at foothill college.,0
"Erika was one of the worst professors I ever had. She's very rude and only lectures. She showed us really boring movies also and I wanted to fall asleep every day in there. I enjoy history and anthropology, but this class made me question that. Also, the readings were so long and hard to do. Please don't take her class.",0
"She is teaching in Rutgers now and although Logic on its own is quite annoying, I still managed to learn quite well. She is a very easy grader and gives opportunities for retakes. Also available outside of class. Her lectures can be a little boring but her class is an easier one if you pay attention.",1
"I really hope CP24 knows about this. WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS?!! I never knew a professor can be this bad. I got an A 100% because of my own hard work. What is learned in class is ""The course is called ITM 100"" PERIOD!. And whats with the rat tail?",0
"Personally I enjoy her teaching style. It is completely lecture based and she gives key terms at the beginning of every class that will be what your exams are entirely based off of. It is her TA that is what you should worry about. They are the ones that grade the papers. I am an english major and my paper didn't receive above a C, usually get A's.",0
"Worst Professor I have ever had. For 1 credit lab, he makes you write 20+ lab reports or else you would pass an 80. Finds anyway to subtract points, gave me a 65 on a 50 page lab report , that took 7+ hours to write. Avoid him at all costs for any class",0
"Best Professor ever! her lectures were awesome and helped you understand the grading criteria and the information needed to write the essays. Only needed to write 3 essays on super easy subjects. She lets you pick what you want to write about based on the topic. Also, watched the movie, The Greenbook.",1
"This class was awful. I hoped to learn more about forensics, since I'm in the field, but all he did was make us read stuff about the 'corrupt' forensic scientists. I learned nothing about forensics at all, just how some scientists have done poor work. Do not recommend AT ALL.",0
"She doesn't know what she's teaching, and as a result, grades harshly (notthe same as in the book, not right). The projects didn't connect with the course material. Each project consisted of 4 parts that could be a project to themselves.",0
"This professor doesn't curve the test or do anything when the class average is below a passing grade than tell you to drop the class, no extra credit or anything. So if math doesn't comes to you easily then this teacher isn't the best teacher for you. You can be dropped from the class because of attendance but it is not apart of your grade.",0
Marek is a terrible teacher. He is very hard to understand. His lessons do not make sense as well. I think he just wakes up and teaches on the fly. Ridiculous how Humber College still has him hired.,0
"billy's a necessary evil because he's the only organic chem prof, he's an idiot, you can find his companion notes for the textbook online and he just reads them word for word, you'd be better off just reading the book and only showing u for tests, if you remember anything about gen chem 1, you're smarter than he is",0
Very difficult class.  Didn't help that he burned through the material.  Nice guy though.  Knew what he was doing.,0
"I believe he is very smart and always want to help you to success. He is always late to the lecture as well as online meetings. He rarely help in lab, basically you just figure with your lab partners and he's doing his own stuffs. Takes forever to grade and provide very very little feedback on your homework. Tons of homework due at the same time",0
"I don't recommend taking this professor. Doesn't grade fairly (makes mistakes in grading and gets mad when we ask for points back), very defensive, condescending to students, no one wants to ask questions because she always answers rudely. We leave feeling discouraged. We had a full class and everyone dropped out except maybe 8 of us. Lucky them.",0
"Very good English teacher.  He pushes you to be the best and really guides us to our very best.  He is very family oriented and he remembers all his student's name and gets along with all of us very well.  Really nice guy in and outside of classroom, very professional as well and he is always there to help you.  But we have to work with him as well",1
"This teacher is a great person, but not a great teacher. She did not teach this whole semester. All she ever talked about was her kids and her life. She only taught a lecture three times  the whole semester, and still expected you take quizzes over material each week. Get the book, its the only way you will pass.",0
"Decided to take a summer class forChem. Honestly was so hard I wanted to cry. Knows what he's talking about but his accent is so heavy its impossible to understand him. Chemistry uses big words so this was even worst. The whole class was failing so he curved GENEROUSLY, I mean I got a B and failed most exams I thought I was getting a D possible C.",0
"A very fair and knowledgeable professor. Mainly a discussion based class, but people aren't forced to participate if they don't want to, although it helps with participation grades. I do feel like I learn a lot in the class, and he's a really nice person. Lots of reading though, mainly reading based. There are writing assignments but not a ton.",1
"The best teacher I have had in WCC. Funny and classy, different things to do in each class, assignments are easy to do,the stories are so fun to read. She is very excited about her topics. She gives chances if you forget an assignment. Show up, write reading responses and get an A. 4 projects that are fun to do including one short 2-4 page research",1
"Well, she's a smart individual and you can tell that she's a good chemist. However teaching is not for her, it doesn't mean if you're good at something that you're automatically good at teaching it, probably research is her play ground but NOT teaching. Get ready to be your own tutor!!",0
Mr. Prunty is a good math professor. He will help you understand what your learning. He is very thorough on teaching stuff especially stuff he knows his students will struggle with. He responds well to emails and is understanding. He is very nice and respectable. I reccomend taking his class.,1
No Comments,1
"This professor is way too difficult. She is extremely confusing and drops a load of work on you from the start. The class just started for me and I instantly regret this taking her. I don't know how I'm going to pass this. If you're looking for a chill and normal PSYC class, this is not it. This is for the people that like to work very very hard.",0
"This class is for people who understand Algebra or have just taken it a few semesters ago, unlike me that hasn't taken a math class in 5 years. She doesn't bother to explain a problem she makes the students explain it. If you're behind it feels almost impossible to catch up. I do not recommend professor Flores if you have trouble with math.",0
"Exams are all multiple choice, however very tricky and involved a lot of critical thinking. In the end, she did not give us our exams back so there was no way of finding out what we got wrong or give us a chance to study appropriately. Lectures were unorganized and each exam was on 2-3 chapters. The fin grade is based on 3 exams and participation",0
"This was a super easy class. I think Andre reads these comments and takes the feedback to heart and applies it to the course because the instructions were really clear and he was available after class to talk. Even in lectures, he would constantly ask if anyone was confused and explain stuff over again if people asked for it.",1
"Proff. Mancini is a great teacher for SDV. I've heard that some ppl say that teachers take to long to get to the point, but if you take Mancini that wont be the case! There are weekly assignments, but they're pretty straightforward. She makes lecture fun and the longest class we had was 40 mins tops. She is caring and funny.",1
Professor Guzzone is very knowledgable about the Music Industry and all it entails. He definitely helped me become well versed in the world of Copyright and Media. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in working in the entertainment industry in anyway.,1
His very good i like his classes,1
"Prof Asbell taught this class with Stahly/Sosa and her section was incredibly easy to understand. She went over exactly what would be on the test and told us what to study during her lectures and after videos. The material was really interesting - gender fluidity, hip hop culture, etc - and was approachable and easy to talk to if help was needed.",1
"Dr. Keeling is one of the best teachers at CNU. I have taken her for both children and adolescent literature. She. Knows. Her. Stuff. But while her knowledge on the subjects is fantastic, her real gift is facilitating class discussion. Nothing feels forced for the sake of participation. You will walk out of each class having learned something new.",1
"Professor Garrisi is by far the best instructor I have had in my two years at OCC. She stands for 4 hours (I had her for a 4 hour block, 4 credit class) and never sits down and teaches. We get to speak all during class in Japanese. If this is a problem, don't take her. You will learn to speak Japanese without realizing it. I love her!",1
"This prof does not use any technology in her courses. She stands at the front of the class with her  paper in front of her face, and you can't understand anything because of her accent and she does not give a mark higher than a 75, and her midterms consist of 10 or more essay questions. AVOID AT ALL COST.",0
She is the worst teacher ever. She literally stands there with a microphone and talks. No one paid attention and literally the whole class failed every test. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE HER. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.,0
"Sigal's exams are very tough, don't take her class. Her husband (math prof David Earn) is really hot :)",0
She is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is very helpful and will go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. Ask questions and be interested in learning the information. You have to study and read. She provides great notes for the entire semester and does outside study groups! Take advantage of them! Dont slack!,1
Has an excuse for everything and does NOT give useful study tools! He even brought his daughter to class during a midterm which was very distracting. Would not recommend this prof. He is a nice guy though,0
"Easiest Bio course given at UD! Never went to class once and I am overly cotent with my grade. He's pretty boring and have a monotonous voice but attendance is not required at all. He's not one of those bio teachers who tries to trick you, his questions are straight forward. I wish he taught more Bio courses.",0
Doesn't know how to park at Tim Horton's TOTAL FAUX-PAS!!!,0
"Professor Faux was super chill and I really wish I was able to take this class with him in person because it wouldve been even better than it already was. Exams are open note, so if you pay attention and take notes its an easy A.",1
"You will NOT get what you earn...grading is 100% subjective, and the class participation was NOT participation based... it was off the wall projects with WAY too little time to complete them....do'nt piss her off or you will get a bad grade...",0
"Take anybody else, seriously, because the tests are super hard, no review, a major rambler, too many surprises, not very helpful, tests formats always changing, too much homework, etc. She has probably done better this semester than the past semesters, but she has a lot more work to do if she wants to be a better professor.",0
He was a decent teacher but the homework is hard. Tests aren't even that bad unless you missed more than one class in that unit. He was funny but a little awkward.,0
Dr. Searfoss was a good teacher. I had her for zoom university. She gives a pile of hw once a week(takes about 45min to do) Slow talker but you get use to it. Not a difficult class if you pay attention and take notes,1
She's a very sweet professor who wants her students to succeed so she helps with extra credit and also explains material more than one time if requested to do so by her students.,1
"Professor Zeman is awesome! She's super interesting, intelligent, nice, helpful and funny. She truly wants everyone to do well. Her tests are very doable but u should study. I highly recommend her for any bio course she may be teaching. You'll be glad that u took her. She's the best science teacher at rcc!",1
"Worst I've ever had. She doesn't give any bullet points for the tests, the material is extremely long with tons of new scientific terms. She reviews the chapters AFTER the test is taken, which proves her lack of professionalism. Gives you Ds and Fs no matter how well you do the homework and refuses to give clear explanaitons. She will ruin your GPA",0
"Took her for ANTH1 & ANTH2 and received an A for both. She is very detailed and awesome at teaching and loves anthropology. She gives you all the information in class that you will need to succeed on tests and really gets students involved in the world of anthropology, even if it's not your major.",1
"MKT 350, very easy class - easiest A in the College of Buisness",1
I don't know if it is him or the class itself but it's VERY difficult. Makes you feel stupid when asking questions and poor office hour times.,0
"My favorite professor. Took her for ACC 311 and was genuinely expecting to hate accounting but DJB made it awesome. Teaches clearly and effectively, is hilarious in lecture, and will do everything she can to help you understand material. I would do my homework outside her office just so I could pop in and ask questions if I had any. Truly the best",1
DJB is an absolute queen. She cares about her students and is flexible with scheduling. Any class with her is a good time,1
"Such a sweet lady! Kind woman, definitely recommend. Not too difficult of a grader, but very reasonable and helpful.",1
"Honestly, the way he presents the material in class makes it so much more interesting! Always keeps you entertained with his loud and dramatic voice, loved it! One page essays are due every week with lots of requirements to it and sometimes the TA's grade way too harshly. However, there's LOTS of extra credits and will help you get an A :)",1
"DO NOT take a class with her online. The course is extremely disorganized and she doesn't ever put grades up, so you won't know how you're doing. Also, she never answers e-mails. Although you'll end up getting a good grade if you do the work, you'll feel as if you learned nothing.",0
"Love Professor Sexton. In her lab right now and doing very well. She uses powerpoints and you have a quiz every week. I plan to take her again for AP2 lab if she teaches it. If nothing else, I would take her just to look at! She is beautiful!",1
"Unless you really know java REALLY well I suggest you stay away from his data structures class. Hard to understand also, when you ask for help most of the time he just repeats himself and talks in circles.",0
I definitely do NOT reccomend this professor. his quizzes had nothing to do with the material learned in class and his loud teaching style makes it hard to comprehend,0
good teacher,1
"I found my class with her incredibly boring, nobody wanted to participate, and it was difficult to pay attention because of the low energy level of both professor and student. Some of the articles we read were interesting, but I was one of the few that actually did the assignments. Grades tough, you have to write extremely well, but borin",0
"David is not a great lecturer he often goes off and does not stay on topic of slideshows. Lectures are very long and boring material, he has a very monotone voice making it nearly impossible to stay engaged with topic son hand. I would not recommend the class to anyone. Assignment given often are very vague on what they want it written on",0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Ms. Bridges was one of the least effective teachers that I have ever had.  She often times makes problems way more confusing than they really are because she doesn't understand the material.  Those who did well in the class had previously taken calculus.  Her tests are really tough unless you understand all the concepts.,0
"DO NOT take this professor. He often confuses himself when he's lecturing, which of course confuses the class. He had to make corrections to his poppers several times because the right answer was not even an answer choice. He made something as simple as algebra extremely difficult. Wish i had better things to say...",0
Professor Whidden was awesome.  I had to work for my grade but it was totally worth it.  I wish all my instructors cared as much about students.,1
Mr. Joe is AWESOME!,1
Amazing professor who truly cares for his students and their education. Has political views that are strong but will listen to others opinions and takes them in! AWESOME! I learned sooooo much!,1
"He seems to be a good guy and he is passionate about the topic but he jumps around so much in lectures and gets so off-topic that it's basically impossible to take good notes. His tests are really hard and encompass things he didn't really go over in class, so you have to read the textbook.",0
"This class was a blast. I learned so much. Thad has a very dry sense of humor which I enjoyed. He is also not hard on the eyes. It is very important to attend the lecture, but the book is not necessary. He takes test questions from the study guide. He was often disorganized, but oh well. Evening lab was great, we were always out early.",1
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
Plus gros pervers de l'UQAM. Cest une manipulateur pervers jai etait ecoeurer de ce prof qui vient de la campagne. Faut vraiment que LUQAM refasse ses criteres de selection.,0
"Professor Lai is very passionate. He puts effort in making the class engaging and interesting, will relate it to the real world. He will go out of his way to help you if you ask. He is straightforward about exams, no curveballs or trick questions. Rent the textbook and you're set.",1
Dr. Boden is passionate about his work but is terribly inconsistent    comes grading. there are grey ares in geology but he still  grades strictly for  100 level course.  to  this   a community college!   not recommend taking this class. it   gpa  killer! hw is  and long. way too much time   a good grade  an elective class.,0
Prof was okay. She's never at her office hrs though. Class was interesting but the TA who does the grading is an ass (will kaufman).  Who counts #of incorrect comma usages and deducts it from your grade?  It's not even an english class!  Isn't content more important than a few grammatical errors?,0
"Professor Kleindienst is a cool guy, can be funny at times but his class is ridiculous. Group project almost seems completely unfeasible and pointless. First case study he doesn't give you an example, just a template and tells you he'll explain after it's discussed in class. Still grades you as if you knew what you were doing. Would not recommend.",0
"I did everything right: I read, I participated, I studied, I took notes on everything, I went to her to get help on my mid-term and my 1st paper. The only thing I did not do was go to her several times with my paper and midterm questions. She teaches like its an intro class, gives out exams fit for a 2000 class and grades like it is one too.",1
"Dr. Hollis is absolutely hilarious, fun to talk to, and has the best stories. However, he makes an already-difficult class (animal physiology) infinitely more difficult. His test questions are very specific to tiny details, not the whole picture. He is unsympathetic to any difficulties and unhelpful outside of class. Dense lectures, and READING.",1
"Took Prof. Osoba two semesters back-to-back and not only did he remember past students, but he would also genuinely take the time to ask how you've been, what you've been up to, and will reference past class information. He's quite old-fashioned and is a very paper and pencil type of guy, but he's a fair grader, and the syllabus is easy to follow.",1
He's a good person. Everything you could ask for in a professor.,1
"Thad, is a great instructor. YES he is an easy teacher. He teaches from the book and that OK! He has a great sense of humor that keep lecture alive. He doesn't explain things clearly when it comes to Krebs cycle and so on.. Group study sessions are necessary if you want an A. I worked two jobs and was a full time student.",1
"He's a good professor, he makes it clear on what to do on the assignments, but he can be confusing sometimes, for ex. he gave us 3 different dates for one test and I got really confused... but then he made it clear and warned us, he's not bad at all but he doesn't give us enough time to do our tests and the final exam, not enough time to do tests.",1
He grades way to harshly for an intro class.,0
Worst prof ever- brought her toddler to class 3times including final exam! She expects to be accommodated but accommodates no student even if you have a learning disability. Boring classes- always starts talking about her own life for min. 1 hour every class. I tried complaining to the dept-  no reply! She should be fired. Waste of my money & time!,0
"This teacher is easy to take. Do the work and the quizzes and you will pass. Yes, the book is needed but it's not too hard. The Exams are however because they are 100 questions in 1 hour. It's crap but I made a 71 the first time and a 50 on the last one. It sucks.",1
Take Mr. Lockhart's class!!! You won't regret it. Very helpful and he is sooo nice. If you miss an online quiz he'll reset whatever you need to be reset. Very understanding and caring of his students. ,1
"Trombley is the worst teacher I have experienced. I was having a major surgery on the day a test was given. I asked if I could redo the test, but she informed me that he doesn't give redo's. I told her my situation, and all she said was you should have scheduled it another day. I scheduled this months before signing up for this class. Unforgiving.",0
"This professor was the absolute worst I have ever had. She gets off topic almost daily; you forget what it was you were supposed to be discussing. Her idea of ""teaching"" is having students discuss with no help or input from her.  Critical research paper halfway through the semester but gives no help on it. Everyone in my class got a 1! Sanity? Nope",0
"I had Jill for my clinical instructor. She is amazing! She is extremely knowledgeable, she goes out of her way to make sure you are learning, not just going through the motions. She is always quizzing you to make sure you are getting it. And she's cute :) I grew a lot as a nurse because of her.",1
Very easy gen ed. Just do the homework and its an easy A,1
"I have never experienced a professor so demoralizing, ignorant, and loathsome in my life. Your grade will suffer if you disagree with her. I came into this course excited to learn and came out feeling personally victimized. Gives papers with no guidance and expects you to turn in graduate level work. Take this professor and you will regret it.",0
"This guy is the worst guy you can take for 330, he doesn't care about,  and he thinks u're only taking 3 credits per semester because you have to constantly study for his pop quizzes.  Avoid it at all cost.  When I took this class he gave us the pop quizz in the second of class .... like seriously ?  u have not time to warm up with him ",0
"I really enjoyed her class. She's a younger professor, but she is very respected. She seems intimidating at first, but she is very nice and loves one-on-one time, so take advantage of her office hours. Attendance matters. She gives quizzes every class, so read your material and show up. She will mark up your paper, but she doesn't grade too tough.",1
"Brooke has a reputation on campus for the best Trig teacher out there. She is the best! If you struggle with the math she will help one on one. You must attend all lectures to stay on track. She always wants to help every student succeed. Yes I only got a high B but if you work hard, she admires you and helps you. She inspires you to keep going.",1
"Yue Laoshi is hands down one of the best professors at RPI. I have taken Chinese 2-5 with Yue Laoshi and can say the class is always fun, interesting, and interactive--you get to learn so much culture beyond just the language. Additionally, the class size is small so you get to know your class and amazing prof. I would highly recommend this class!",1
Not a good prof at all. Rambles during lectures and goes off topic frequtly. Lectures are all over the place. Do not recommend her.,0
Hes a great person hes just tough when it comes to grading. Theres never a right answer.,1
"Janet Elliott was absolutely fantastic. Her notes and lectures were clear and easy to follow and they prepared you well for each assignment and exam. If you are taking CH E 243, definitely try and get her as your prof. She truly wants her students to succeed and does an amazing job.",1
Professor Allen knows what he is talking about and is pretty easy. Classes can get boring and it can be hard to pay attention. He is pretty funny and a generous grader.,1
"She is a hard grader. Her tests are too picky, you gotta know the whole book to be able to pass. It is hard to get an A on anything. Only few things to grade you on. DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS!",0
This was an easy class before I got to this guy...He made everything difficult and made tons of mistakes which made me have to follow up all the time just to make sure that I got the grade I deserved....I was doing my job as a student and his by constantly having to correct everything...Forget it...,0
"I had him for Grammar and Comp and am currently taking Reading and Convo with him. He is very willing to help and explain, although he may do a couple of loops before he arrives at the answer. Although I am fluent, I missed two classes and only one homework and still came out with an A. He is very helpful when explaining the future exams in detail.",1
"The worst class I have taken in my entire life, it's literally the middle of the semester but I can't stand this class. For heaven's sake DO NOT take this class, Spare yourself from stress.",0
I would definitely recommend her as a prof. She is very clear about HOW you are being graded as well as your progress (unlike my last teacher). She clarifies things very well! Really enjoyed this class despite taking it in the 7 week summer session!,1
took this class online and it was very straight forward and the syllabus was easy to follow. Discussion every week. 4 tests and a project. If you study the power points you should pass with flying colors. Would definitely take her class again.,1
"Had her as one of my professors during the first semester of the pandemic, she was the only prof i had who did not give extensions on assignments and was not understanding/caring AT ALL to students needs. If you have something personal happening in your life dont expect her to be lenient with you.",0
"Accounting for Managers, graduate-level. Zarb is a great teacher with some hilarious stories. He makes accounting fun (believe it or not). He also presents the material in a very easy to understand format and works out all of the examples by hand. Take notes in class, work on the examples and practice problems, and you'll get an A.",1
"Once you understand his sarcastic and sometimes cynical humor, he's an awesome professor, although somewhat predictable. His tests are not difficult if you just study the slides and skim the text.",1
I have her this semester for HED 200 very frustrating does not give any material related to the lectures for exams.,0
"If you're in 122 as your last Spanish class, then he's probably fine. Doesn't actually require you to speak spanish so long as you can memorize basic grammar concepts. If you're considering taking a higher spanish class, I would look for another professor who uses more of the language in class. Way too much homework for how easy the course is.",1
"The most condescending prof I've had at Carleton. Does not answer questions well and when you ask for clarification he seems as though he is annoyed with you and does not expand on his previous answer. Pray you have a decent TA for this class. I didn't find the course hard, however that doesn't excuse the profs lack of interest in helping students.",0
"Professor Tancredi is easygoing. There can be a lot of material to cover, but his lectures are very straight-forward. He usually gives extra credit if you see a live show that he recommends on the weekends. Attending class is not necessarily mandatory, but you may miss out on a lot of material. Only use pencil in this class. Seriously.",1
"She's a great lady. Not that good of a prof though. I had prior music experience, and I still had to teach myself everything before each test. You really need to have prior music experience before taking her classes, and a lot of patience. Maybe even a tutor. Tests were not easy, but still got a B. Good luck, you'll need it!",0
Il n'explique pas bien,0
"extremely boring and extremely easy. there is not much work at all for this class and the work there is, you can easily get 100's. there are two online tests that you can work together with, and two book discussions (say one thing and you get a 100). a chill class but get ready to fall asleep every day. also very liberal",0
Most boring class I've taken at UT.  Seriously.,0
"I'm a good student & receive good grades. Even though I was interested in the material and ready to learn he made this class unbearable. He is very strict, unforgiving, rude, and gives a horrendous amount of busy work. He's a Christian (you can see his cross necklace through his chest hair) and is bias against the other religions in his lectures. ",0
She was really easy! I despise writing papers and English but I loved the class. I definitely would take it again.  It's one of the best english classes I have ever had! She's a wonderful teacher!!,1
"Great professor, very caring and eager to help. Content is clear, direct, and simple. Would for sure take another class with her again. Very reasonable and manageable class. She has a lot of opportunities for people to do well; grades are based on a lot of different things. You are only required to go to half of the classes the entire semester.",1
"great prof. really shows that he cares about each individual, highly recommend!!!!",1
Don't take her trust me you will regret it,0
"For an art teacher she does not promote artistic writing. She is judgemental and taps into students personal affairs, not only must you teach yourself the material she grades easily. The woman is very one sided and not interested in her students ideas.",0
"This teacher is not transparent to his students. Does not use piazza, barely uses D2L. Extremely lazy when posting information about hw and exams. Does not post announcements at all. Joke of a professor at an academic institution.",0
"Erin is a good teacher. The material itself was tough to take in only 7 weeks, but if you keep up on your reading and watch her lecture videos the class is not too bad. She is very approachable and willing to help if you ask for it.",1
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
"The worst professor I have ever had at SMU. He doesn't respond to emails, does not post grades online, and rarely gives back tests. His handwriting is at a 6th grade level and he ridicules students in front of the entire class to the point where multiple people have dropped because of it. 46 people have dropped from my class if that says anything.",0
"He knows absolutely everything about music.  His tests are impossible, although he does curve them.  Impossible to get an A, altho a B isn't too hard.  Very witty.",1
"If you are looking for an easy language class stay away from ASL. Instructor is passionate, and works with the deaf community.Practice, practice and practice. You have to make time for this class because there are events to be completed and test to study for. This class was a lot of hard work but I enjoyed it and learned a lot.",1
"Best teacher I had all semester. Was very nice, brought treats for the class, encouraged open discussion even if you have an unpopular view point on the subject discussed. Would love to take her again if I could.",1
No Comments,1
"Incredibly knowledgeable and smart, a practitioner within the field and has been published many times. You will learn from him, having said that... he is extremely condescending and sometimes is a bit sarcastic. He is intellectual and gets frustrated if you are not on the same level as him, he expects a lot from you but seldom gives feedback.",1
"This was my third time have Professor Williams. I knew what to expect in his class. SF 341 was my favorite class. I recommend it. You learn about Airport Management, Airport Security, Airport Safety, Airport Inspections, How to run the Airport, and most importantly keep the Airport Safe. If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",1
"Ok don't get me wrong, she's a nice woman and was accessible outside of class but if you need to take a class to fulfill a requirement, look for someone else or wait until the next semester. She provides feedback that isn't that helpful and when you ask for help, she basically tells you to settle for a lower grade.",0
"Solid professor, nothing truly special but she is a good lecturer and keeps you engaged in the class.",1
great,1
Professor Hunt is the nicest lady ever. She is very helpful and her lectures are very informative and clear. She is great at explaining tough subjects. I thought it was so amazing that she learned all the names of her students in a 40+ lecture within the first 3 classes. Can't wait for A&P2 with her next semester,1
She kinda became the permanent sub for Murphy's ENC1101 in 2017 so I didn't really get a look into the way she would organize the class. She wants you to succeed and gives you many resources to do so but is a tough grader. If you enjoy English than you could thrive under her expectations but if you're looking to just get by take Eileen Murphy.,1
She is a good professor but the language barrier is an issue and she gives a lot of work. As long as you do all your work and show up for class you will get an A.,1
she is the worst teacher I have ever had I hated her class and dreaded going to it. she is boring and is just ughhhh. DO NOT TAKE HER. avoid her at all costs,0
"It is so disappointing that EWU lets this teacher teach at all. I have taken this class at another school and understood it very well, now I am in it here with this teacher and it is impossible to understand or learn anything. He does not grade anything or give any feedback. He also wont work with you on ANYTHING. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"It honestly is an awesome class, and there's no one I'd rather have as a teacher. Yes, there are quite a few readings, but they are easy to keep up with if you space them out enough. Studying for quizzes and tests is more complex, but it is a positive experience learning how to.",1
"Her lectures are useless. She points at models and babbles off a whole list of anatomical terms leaving everyone confused. Her quizzes invoke anxiety because you have to answer 1 question in front of the whole class. The cadavers are cool, but she tricks you on the practicals. That makes her lab very hard to do well in, very frustrating.",0
"Project-based, but she helps you understand and do part of the projects within class. You don't really have to read the book and it's free online.",1
She is great. She explains things well and speaks very clearly--I'm not the best at Spanish but I could always understand her. Recommended!,1
He is not a good professor if you take him for an online course. Also doesn't provide good feedback. If he has an issue with your writing instead of letting you know with the first few weeks so you can correct it and still pass the course he waits till the end so you end up failing. Worst professor I have ever had is no help what so ever.,0
"Professor Vannozzi is a really nice guy who will go out of his way to even give you a ride home if you needed it, but when it comes to his class get ready for long lectures and lots of memorization of him talking. He is a very picky grader, but it overall prepares you for the real world and how some companies pay close attention to detail.",1
"Started off interesting, but my attention span waned. He's a very likeable prof who makes some funny jokes during his lectures but I wish the class had more variety. It's just an hour and fifteen of him talking at you. Overall it was a good class, but sometimes it's tedious to just sit and listen and scribble notes down for so long.",1
"Okay, Professor Gartland is a sweet lady but has to be the worst professor at YSU. She rambles about absolutely nothing for an hour and 15 minutes. Often times I found myself in disbelief. A lot of students will just get up and walk out of her class because it is a complete waste of time. Extremely easy A. The questions on the exam are a joke.",0
"The only difficult thing with Dr. Tang is his accent, it is almost impossible to understand at times, but he makes up with it by having pretty simple tests.",1
My GPA went down coz of him.Not A good professor. I recommended NOT TO TAKE him. Dont ruin ur career and grades. Take Other Professors than him who can teach you hard way but then you u get something at the end. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.,0
"Very good teacher for the lecture portion of class, interesting and with great examples.  Lab lectures are incredibly boring and drawn out. This teacher takes far too long to grade exams, to the point where it feels disrespectful.",1
I had him for Political Economy. He's a really sweet (and funny) guy and knows the subject really well. Sometimes he may be unclear because of his accent and because he digresses a lot. But overall the class is pretty easy. The tests and quizzes are SUPER easy. Read the book and take notes and you'll do fine. He's one of my favorites.,1
"She was a really hard grader which was extremely frustrating. You have to write 8 one-paged ""microthemes"" for the class and it was almost impossible to get higher than an 8/10. She was super nice and cared about the class and knew her stuff, but also made the midterm and final really long and hard. Overall I liked her, but you have to work hard",1
"Might as well take calculus online because that's what you will be doing. The course is set up in a way that you watch videos every night and you have to TEACH YOURSELF calculus! He says that you can ask questions the next day but only answers maybe 2 at most because he is very unclear and disorganized. Avoid avoid avoid, trust me.",0
"KB was awesome. He was very relaxed about attendance, but held you accountable by your work. He was helpful and open to ideas, never made anyone feel that they were wrong for their opinions. He grades according to the college standard guidelines (where a c is a good thing), so I was worried, but I did really well in the class.",1
"Crumpler was great, he gave examples during class that really helped see what he expected from us and also what we would expect on the exams. At least one of the problems he went over in lecture would be on the exams. He is a little intimidating but as long as you don't ask dumb questions, you should be good.",1
"The worst Professor on Earth, not only is he a tough grader hes also highly inconsiderate. If you have him just consider dropping out.",0
"Prof. Mangone is very passionate, and honestly he goes a little overboard on the material. It is useful information, but most of it won't even show up on the exam, which can make it hard to know what to study. However, his exams were fairly easy comparatively. He is a great choice, and his material emphasizes memorization more than concepts.",1
"She is supper hard grader, and also she cares but if she dose not get your work on time no chance to give it to her. She is pretty mean.",0
By far one of the worst professors I've ever had. Easy class yet I found myself having to bend over backward just to get an A. Marks you down for no reason. Creates her own grading criteria. I had to email her before every assignment to ask exactly what she was looking for us to do as she never follows the rubric that is provided. It was stressful.,0
"He was not very receptive to opinions other than his own. He regularly talked over students when they expressed differing opinions and would devote entire class times to attempting to convince the class to agree with his opinion. Given this was an ethics class, which is inherently controversial, this was not ideal. Easy, though.",1
Unnecessarily strict with grading. Gives poor feedback with little to no reasons as to why a low grade was given.,0
"If you took calculus in High School, Don't listen to him because he makes you confused. He is a very smart guy, but he doesn't know how to teach.",0
"KNOWS A LOT, GET TO KNOW HIM, GO TO HIS OFFICE, CHAT WITH HIM, YOU WILL LEARN AND ENJOY HIS CLASS, HE WILL HELP YOU ANYTIME BUT YOU NEED TO COME TO HIM, USES POWERPOINTS AND PUTS THEM ON BLACKBOARD, LEARN SOME DEFINITIONS AND COMMON SENSE AND YOU WILL BE GOOD",1
"This class contains  lots of participation and group projects.  Attendance really matters in her class, if you miss a lecture it is hard for you to pass this class.  The textbooks were used everyday for this class.  DR. Mark went out of her way to help anyone with any questions they may have.",1
"he took 10 points off just because I attached files one the back of the report not in between, not clear of what he wants, take a lot of points for no reason. if you write a nice detailed report he will mark you off. he took 5 points off my lab because I wrote the results and explained why ! I wish I didn't take him TOUGH GRADER",0
"Professor Kaur is by far the worst professor I have had at William Paterson. All of my peers this past semester had a great English professor but I got stuck with Kaur. I got a B for the semester but I got all A's in the essays. All assignments are essays and her grading is horrible. Not an easy class or an easy person to deal with, trust me.",0
"Miranda is disorganized and showed up to the class late or right at start time. she enjoys rambling about unrelated things which also wastes time, tests are fairly easy if you go to class. she likes to ask questions about examples and side stories she mentions so pay attention to those! the only reason people went to class was for clicker quizzes",0
"The type of teacher that expects everyone in the class to discuss the reader, and is very salty whenever you do not. He also expects you to do writings in 30 minutes and to regurgitate every word of days lectures into each of your papers. Dont take him, take my advice. Hes unforgiving and gave me a 40 point deduction for leaving one topic out.",0
"He's very monotonous, which isn't great considering that the material is very dense and hence it necessitates focus. Dude just reads off the slides. He's very smart, but he gives off the vibe that he doesn't want to be there. If you want to take this class for premed then wait until another professor is teaching it",0
"He only gives 30 minutes to do assignments in class, and he grades them harshly. Do not take this professor unless you're auditing his class.",0
"Overall, not impressed by his teaching style (online). Be prepared to teach yourself everything, because he provides no lessons and little help even if you ask for it!",0
Prof Zeman is great at what she does and loves what she does which makes her a great professor sad she isn't doing A&P 2 :(,1
"Dr. Bliss is a GREAT professor! For QMB, make sure to do all the homework on time (easy points), and study at least a week in advance for his exams. The homework and tests are similar, but there are some questions on exams that dig a little deeper. Make sure to attend his webinars before exams, and I highly suggest Skoolers exam review packets!",1
"He is a really nice guy but this class has no structure. His lectures are all over the place and he goes off on tangents that don't relate to the topic at hand and that can be confusing. There are very few grades, so there is a lot of weight on them. Grades on specificity. POOR STUDY GUIDE. Disorganized. But nice guy, just not the best teacher.",1
"By far the worst professor I have ever encountered. This professor does not write one line of code the entire semester even though all his assignments are code based. You would think he would go over examples as a minimum. All he does is show youtube videos. Students can read the theory at home, they don't need you to read your poor PDF's for 3hrs.",0
"(part 3) Cons(4): There are three exams in total and each counts 33% of the final grade, participation and the lab part of the course is of no value in terms of counting towards the final grade.  Cons (5): He gives more than 100 mutiple choice questions on the exam so it is guaranteed for you to get at least 7-10 questions wrong on the exam.",1
He gives us a 20 minutes presentation to do and 8 page research paper when the class is just elective. He should have given us a option to choose between presentation or writing the paper. Not do both. 12 people drop out of his class because of it.,0
"Good in class. Clear, easy to understand, fun. Independent studies are horrible. No direction, no syllabus, rarely shows up to meetings. I highly recommend taking a class with him as long at it's in a group!",0
"You need to listen to lecture and take notes, but all of the tests come straight from his lectures. He is pretty laid back and covers the material well, you just need to make sure you do all of book reviews and the service learning project.",1
"He is one of the best English teachers I have had. He is the only professor I can stand right now, and he is so funny and optimistic about everything! He is a great guy! And he helps you to write your best. :)",1
"Unless you are a favored student, this class will ruin your life. Professor refuses to assist struggling students both in and out of class. Will mark you wrong for getting the correct answer because he doesnt like how you did it, yet wont help you do it his way. AVOID",0
"I loved this class. It was my only 8 am and I loved going. He makes his lectures and his lab funny. He expects you to know a lot, but he is always willing to help.",1
I have never been so frustrated with a class. The quizzes she gives isn't over stuff that you have recently gone over. Doesn't do examples to completion. Treats you like you are stupid. Grades super heavy. She deducted points for something that wasn't in my final answer. Doesn't give partial credit. expects you to spend every waking hour studying.,0
"please do not take her course. even if you just want to finish up the English series and she's the only prof with an open seat.... do not do it. there's a reason her classes never fill up. and if they do, trust in 2 weeks half the class will drop. just finish up your other breadth classes or wait until a better TA opens up a seat in their class.",0
"Extremely poor class planning. Will make up useless activities just to fill remaining class time. Doesn't discuss texts adequately. Tests are fairly easy, papers graded easily. Most boring class ever.",0
"I went into college loving English, I have always passed my English classes with A+/100% as my final grade but this class? This professor makes me dislike English and makes me not want to write which is something I personally love to do. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR.",0
Super hard to understand (accent). Not very helpful. A good guy though...,0
"Ms. Nuneville is truly one of the most amazing people I've ever met. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to take her class this semester. If you want a teacher that cares about you, take her class. I never opened my book, so don't buy one. She provides all the information you'll need for the tests in her lectures, which she provides on blackboard.",1
"Dr. Lee is such a nice person but I would not take his class again. His exams are so hard, I failed every one. HIs lectures don't help, you are basically teaching yourself. Nobody even shows up to class. You have to read the chapter before class and that doesn't even help. Maybe tutoring would have helped me. HARDEST CLASS, PICK SOMEONE ELSE!",0
Best Professor ever! Would give all the help you need from him! His class can't be boring.,1
"Professor Ball does not give a lot of homework. He also doesn't require his students to buy a code or book. The work he gives out is so easy and his lectures are interesting. I never was good at math but his class helped a lot. And he is hilarious! Take him, I promise you won't regret it!!!!!",1
"Online class, she did a horrible job at teaching the material and when asked for guidance she tells students try not to overthink it or read the book again instead of helping you understand. DO NOT TAKE HER. She also made us write a 10-12 page paper and it ended up being only a completion grade.",0
"I went in to Smith's Constitutional Law course as Donald Trump, and came out as Barack Obama. He is insanely knowledgeable and challenges you in the right way. He is very funny in a dad joke kind of way. Midterm and Final make up your entire grade, and are both open note. DO THE READING. I have taken multiple courses from him, he is amazing!",1
"One of the universities best calculus professors gives very good examples.  Provides notes that he posts online and follows the textbook. Makes his own lab exercises with varying difficulty to really put you up to the challenge. His exams are fair, he prepares you well so you have no excuses. Provides lots of additional practice.",1
The worst teacher i have studied with. His grading is ridiculous even the lecture is so easy (since it is a basic class). I would never take his class again,0
"horrible class. DONT take it.  dan doesn't talk about anything real during class, just rambles on about his opinion on stuff and then will give you random facts to write down so you can write the essays well. paper due every week, do all of them. and id write all the essays so that you can get a good grade. go to class because of random quizzes.",0
She does not care about students and thinks she is more important than she really is.,0
"Her grading is REALLY critical and she will not try to clear up the homework, and will tell you to just read the ""instructions"". I also felt I was being treated as if I was still in middle school. Wouldn't recommend this class.",0
Professor Winogora is really down to earth. He is super lenient on the homework assignments which are easy. He mostly shows John Green Crash Course videos which are helpful.,1
"Definitely not an easy class but it wasn't awful. Tests are eh, you definitely need to study but she will give you credit for the diagrams as long as you tried and they make somewhat sense. There is a term project but it wasn't too bad. Be sure to gradually work on it and not wait until the last minute. Have to use lockdown + webcam for tests.",1
She did a better job in this class.,1
"His lecture exams are horrible each multiple choice question is 3 pts so if you get 3 wrong you are already 90%  I am really disappointed taking his class I just did not have any choice he was the only one listed for bio 242. Boring lectures not helpful for exams. His study guide is useless, don't spend your money and time.",0
Such a nice person! Very understanding of challenging circumstances in a pandemic.,1
"Well upon a good 1/3 of the way through the semester I find these other reviews disturbingly accurate when it comes to treatment for personal views. This professor is very unprofessional, this class is taught like a master's degree. Myself and other students have been talking about how we do everything she asks and still get basically a zero...",0
"Great professor. Very nice to students who didn't get a high grade on tests. Lecture can be long but he tries to be engaged with the students to keep us awake, haha. However, I STRONGLY advise people who take his class to buy his recommended book, because like 70% of what we go over in the lectures and tests are based on the reading in the book.",1
"Professor Fazelpour's lectures are very condescending, he seemingly talks down to the class and has a hard time articulating his words and some parts of the lecture are hard to understand due to a harsh accent. Sets seemingly arbitrary rules for homework assignments and passes the buck on any mistakes he makes when it comes to the class in general.",0
Does not fully answer questions and has a very thick accent that is super hard to understand at times. Asked questions multiple times that received no answer because he didn't know how to answer and often diverted away from the question. I would definitely NOT recommend please take someone else if you can. ,0

"Homework is easy , not so hard ! Lecture is easy ,",1
"I took English 100 as part of the high school accelerated program. Her expectations were clear and she does care about her students. Lots of readings but you only have to do 4 essays, one forum post a week, and a final exam. Feedback from essays were helpful and informative which will be beneficial for your future writing. Would highly recommend.",1
"I had Dr. Longworth for her 2nd semester teaching and it really showed. She seemed unsure of herself a lot throughout the lectures, but she got better as the semester wore on. The exams are heavily curved (the top 50% of the class gets at least a B). You must read if you want an A and you need to understand the concepts along w/ the physics.",1
"Nice guy , average teacher , always makes time outside of class to help students.",1
"The class is tough, but he explains it in an easier way than the book.  He'll answer your questions if you ask, and is fair.",1
She goes through her presentation way too fast for students to clearly understand the material.,0
"The workload is heavy and he's a bit of a tough grader, but the feedback he provides on both your ideas and the actual quality of your writing is far more helpful than the average English instructor. His lectures are also consistently engaging, funny, and insightful, and he's always willing to help you out, either in person or over email.",1
"ASL is a hard language to learn but with Cheryl it was very easy. She is very knowledgeable of what signs are used around this area. She makes class comfortable, organized, and fun. She cares that you are retaining what you are learning and wants you to succeed. I will definitely take the second AMSL course. If you need an elective take this class!",1
"I wish I didn't take the advice from people leaving reviews here. I do not care how good you think you are at math this guy was a rude awakening for me. It wasn't until I started skipping class and teaching it to myself did I improve. Marks you down for doing math problems ""in a way that is confusing"" to him even if you get the right answer. Run.",0
"He's so extra. If you can put up with him and his unnecessary attitude, it's pretty much an easy A.",0
excellent teacher if you didn't think you could draw. you will think otherwise after his class.,1
"Cons: Lectures and class discussions are dense. There is a lot of reading.  Pros: You learn to think about things in ways you never have before, and you will come to understand your own thought processes better. She is SO INTELLIGENT, that it will make you want to be smarter and less ignorant. ",1
"This is not an easy class.  Having schellhorn as a teacher makes it even worse.  She is hard to understand, boring, and would rather go to prison than ever curve a test or your grade.",0
"I've never cried over a class in all the years I've been here, until I took policy with Rombo. Probably the worst experience ever. Gives little to no help, and makes you feel stupid when you ask for help. If you go to class or skip, you'll be 5 years behind, no matter what. Worst class and professor I've ever had at Oneonta",0
"He is rude and not nice. He chooses which students get certain questions. He chooses who kets easy questtions and who gets difficult ones, especially the annoying dates. He will let you know when he has had enough talking with you. He will also call you out if you email him questions a lot. He is a proffessor, he is suppose to answer them.",0
"Lectures are boring, VERY boring. He's funny. You don't have HW other than online quizzes, which don't matter that much because the tests run the grades basically. This was the only class I could not get an A in no matter how much I studied or tried. There's no curriculum, no method or comprehension. If you can memorize a lot of stuff you're good.",0
"He goes very fast and it is hard to follow along. The practice problems will help you keep up, so do them. He ends up curving the entire class at the end, so if you are not happy with your grade don't worry because it will go up.",0
"I had her in JAP 101-103 and LSFY 203 as well. She is possibly one of the easiest teachers I've ever had in college. She's extremely understanding when you turn your homework in late, and her classes are always fun! Last year was her 1st LSFY class and she's never taught something like it before, so She did an excellent job for her 1st time.",1
"DJB is the best! If you have to take ACC 311, TAKE HER! She's hands down my favorite professor at UT, would take her again if I could. The material is challenging but she truly cares about her students so if you're struggling go to office hours. She's super sweet and approachable.",1
Everyone seems to give her a bad rap for her teaching. She is a great teacher and you will certainly learn your stuff. She gets a bad rap because people are lazy and dont want to work hard. Lab is tough but extra credit and curves make up for it. Best advice I can give you is make friends fast and study with them. Class is very doable,1
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
"Zinkevich doesn't write her own exams, follows a predetermined grading system, and doesn't cover material on those exams. She will not conduct lab during lab times, and is near impossible to understand with her heavy accent. Avoid this woman like the plague. ",0
"taking notes for his recorded lectures were hard for me because he covers a lot, so attending in-person was a must for me. Plus, I liked going to his lectures because it's always a good time. Exams are straight memorization from the lectures because it's multiple choice. Great and easygoing guy. If you're going to take PSY 101, take him!",1
Does not seem to understand the material during lecture times and does not go over the material to make sure you understand. Not the best professor!,0
Vague explanation of how he grades the journal which is a major part of your grade. The class seemed more for students to fail than succeed.  Would not recommend taking this class unless you have to.,0
"Burke is phenomenal.  HIS 385 is intended to be one of the most difficult courses you take, it's centered around writing a 15 page research paper. Burke makes it fun and breaks the work down to make writing the paper easy! I got an A- in this class... take Burke if you have a chance for ANY class.  He's also my advisor and so helpful and positive!!",1
He's difficult to deal with and if you can take another class for this credit or have another teacher I would do so. The text's he chooses are either okay or awful with maybe a film or two worth watching. The class description is inaccurate at best. He is a harsh grader but provides very little feed back and very little flexibility. DON'T DO IT!,0
Lectures are completely pointless but sometimes there are in class responses that she takes attendance off of (which is 15% of your grade).  The majority of her class is her reading quotes off of her slides. Very annoying class but assignments are easy,0
Way too easy to the point where you miss out on learning.,1
"On the first day of class I thought what the heck did I get myself into. He comes off as being very intense because he is a very passionate professor. He is actually very cool and understanding, just pay attention and interact dont get on his bad side!4 tests total, and two map quizzes, each test has two short essays that go along with it.",1
"He is the worst professor I have ever had.  He is not helpful, I learn absolutely nothing in that class, and I just highly suggest not taking his class.",0
"Amazing! He really cares about his students, he wants you to become a better writer and he relates to his students and lets that be what the papers are about. You can choose topics and as long as you show up and put a little bit of effort into the class you pass with ease.",1
"i can see how this would be a great class in person but online wasn't great. It's read from the textbook then do the quiz, no notes, no lectures, no pre-recorded lectures. not impressed by this course delivery for online because of covid.",0
No Comments,1
"This class is supposed to be an easy A because no one cares about classics, we only do it for requirements. Lectures are like watching paint dry, some of the TFs are hardos and dont let you go on your phone, youll get points docked on your assignments for arbitrary reasons. Theres a lot of extra credit though and and that can save you from an A-",0
"Awful lectures, waste lots of time waiting for students to answer his questions, such as ""good mornings"" and ""have I lost anyone"". Every class, the same speech. Sometimes he is rude. He assigns people to group for major projects. He is not open to feedback. Playing music during the classes doesn't make a teacher ""awesome"".",0
"My favorite teacher of freshman year. Cancels class more than most teachers, tells great stories, is funny and keeps you entertained. Quizzes are really easy.",1
"She was ok, but really doesn't try to understand her students. Goes off on her own tangent. Classes are extremely boring and she is very repetitive. Takes extremely long to return papers and is very confused in class. Personally, I did not find her a helpful professor. But not a lot of tests or essays which I like",0
"Randy is a really cool professor! He does have a sort of monotone voice which make his lectures kind of boring, especially at 7am, but he's still a cool dude nonetheless. He's pretty flexible with assignment due dates. There's one piece of homework and one quiz due each week--not too bad.",1
"Schellhorn is deffinetly your best option for Finance 201. Gives study guide, tests are exactly what she teaches in class, and little homework. Do yourself a favor and take her for Finance 201, especially because all of the other teachers are so bad.",1
"Take him!!! Best professor I had for my last semester at FIU. He is VERY clear on everything, explains everything very well, answers emails quickly, and easy material. The only way you'll fail is if you don't do the work.",1
oral presentations homework every week attendance is mandatory if you skip a class takes points off,0
Does not even try even a little bit too make her class engaging. Not to mention that the lecture and textbook readings are literally word for word. Her tests were tricky and with limited time it was really easy to mess up. Felt that she didn't want to teach or want her students to do well.,0
Don't expect to get a good grade .,0
"She is helpful if you ask questions! She gives a huge group project that is easy and is worth a lot of points. Her tests are kind of hard, but if you pay attention, take notes, and take time to study, you'll get an a. She gives you a study guide of what the test is going to be on, so you know exactly whats on it. Take her if you want an A",1
"Makes you buy a $90 access code just to access the homework which is 100 questions PER CHAPTER and you have 2-3 chapters due at a time. Crazy tedious work, each chapter takes about 2 hours to complete. STAY AWAY. Find someone easier.",0
"Read your book prior to the lecture. She knows her stuff. She will tell you whats on the test, her test are sometimes tricky but easy if you study.",1
"He wasn't very thorough on how to actually solve most of the equations he'd talk about. Also, his examples on how to solve the problems were less than mediocre. He doesn't really put that much effort into his lectures.",0
"She's actually the nicest professor I've ever had. She really cares for her students and really helps you in order to do your best. There are no tests and essays are not bad at all. I really recommend to take her, she's literally the sweetest. def recommend",1
"This was an amazing class. Taking notes is essential, but Mr. Wells makes it easy and interesting to pay attention to lectures.",1
"She is really enthusiastic and makes the subject look interesting. You have to read a lot for this class and the exams are not that easy, but there are a lot of extra credit opportunities during the semester to improve your grade.",1
"By far the worst professor I have had in my 4 years of college. From the first week, students switched out of her class to another section with a different professor. Avoid her at all costs. Her grading is completely arbitrary and her lectures are just awful. Youre better off teaching Soil Science yourself!",0
She really doesn't care about anything or anyone except for her PUENTE program.,0
This class was a breath of fresh air for a summer course.  Nice way to wind down the year.,1
"She's not clear in grading. Seems to take points off for no logical reason, even if you have fulfilled the rubric requirements completely. Takes points off during assignments that are based on opinion... Very critical - but doesn't really give any useful feedback. No way to please her. Avoid her if you want to enjoy the subject and not resent it.",0
Don't waste your time if you actually want to learn.Very unclear and does not grade assignments for a long time and no feedback whatsoever.A shame he's the only social work teacher there because people are forced to take him.,0
"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",0
DO NOT TAKE. There are 2 quizzes every class on the reading which was homework and the lecture he gave to make sure you were paying attention. Both quizzes and all of the exams are online tho with is a plus. I had a C all semester but the class did so bad he had to scale everyones grades at the end so I finished with an A.,0
"One of the nicest professors I've had but not the easiest A. If you do all the past exams and make a solid note sheet though, you'll be fine. I didn't really study the powerpoints much. Try to take the class after gen chem so those concepts are fresh in your mind. Also a lot of grade buffers with clickers, quizzes etc..",1
"I LOVE SRG. CONTA!HE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT LACC. VERY VERY HELPFUL IN EVERYTHING. HIS TEST ARE EASY, NO H.W AND IF HE DOES, NEVER COLLECTS IT. HE SHARES A LOT OF HIS EXPERIENCES AS AN OFFICER WHICH ARE AMAZING. AND HIS STORIES HELP AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE LECTURES ARE. U WILL NEVER MEET ANOTHER PROF. WHO GOES OVER MID/FINAL TEST ?'S THE DAY B4.",1
"Unreasonable amount of work. Don't take online with this professor, the amount of useless work I had to do took up all of my time for studying for other courses. She makes you write, review, take, and grade your own short response tests. The course isn't even about ecology content because she makes you focus so much on test writing skills.",0
Dreaded his class. Just teaches the textbook during lectures with minimal effort to make it the least bit interesting. Exams are a joke and unnecessarily hard. I was looking forward to learning about marketing but he made it hard to appreciate. Good luck if you have him for 300!,0
"He is a good guy with a genuine interest and expertise in the field. But he makes you work for the grade, he has a mix of group projects, class discussions and lectures. He speaks relatively slow and spends a lot of time on a small quantity of topics. ",1
"Absolutely ludacris that this class is allowed to be taught at a University that prides itself on innovation and intelligence. Khalsa attempts to use modern physiology to explain the benefits of yoga (mostly erroneous claims) and teaches in a rather cultish fashion. If you have any respect for the advances of science, DO NOT take this course.",0
"Very hard. He is not willing to work with students, and not willing to admit he is wrong. Expects a lot from all students and if you are not willing to work very very hard you will not do well in his course. His lectures were good, and I think I learned a lot, just feel like he could have been just as good of a professor without being so hard.",0
"Dr. B has a good sense of humor and likes to keep the class serious, yet free of interruptions. He does not go strictly by the syllabus and can be confusing at times on what he is expecting from you. If you show up to class and do all the work, you will pass.",1
Mrs. Johnson is an all around great instructor. She is probably the nicest professor on campus! If you have to take a sociology class make sure you get Mrs. Johnson!!!,1
"I took the half semester option for this class. He is an interesting and nice guy, but different when it comes to grading. He is very inconsistent and tends to take away major points if your paper isn't exactly the way he would have written it.",0
Très dur à suivre. Se perd souvent dans ses idées. Ses examens sont mal corrigés/construits. Il est dur à rejoindre/à rencontrer. Ne suit pas son plan de cours.,0
"She was awesome. You can tell that she truly cares about what she's teaching and wants her students to show interest and pass the class. She responds to emails quickly and is very accessible before or after class as well. She is an encouraging teacher, and if your do the work, the class  is easy. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
"Great Professor. You will have about 3 papers per class with him that range from 3-8 pages in length. He grades papers tough but if you get them revised early on, you will make a good grade. Although he takes a long time to get feedback to you on your papers, he gives you many opportunities to re write if he does not think its good. No tests",1
if you miss your deadline... too bad. zer0! excellent teacher tho. really professional and friendly. hw isnt too hard. be sure to study and ACTUALLY read the chapters and study vocab and you will get an A.,1
"She's pretty entertaining and likes to talk. Class is fun, but watch out--she may accidentally spoil the latest TV show you're watching (Game of Thrones...). She is very friendly if you need help but she treats students like they're in elementary school. She'll get on to you for not looking straight at her during lab. ",1
"Took her course on Mad Men. Awesome class. Cool show to watch and I actually like the readings. The show really did its homework. Dr. B gives grades and feedback quick (journals, posts, essays). Definitely going to take her again.",1
"She is not an easy grader, but you truly learn how to write in her class.  she is funny and nice.  Enjoyed her class",1
"She is a great person, don't get me wrong, but she is way too harsh. She is accessible outside of class and is very personal with her students. She grades you on things you don't think you're being graded for. For example, a group evaluation. She will doc points off for grammar when you don't think she is. Just always be cautious of everything.",0
"Find someone else to take. He is not helpful at all. DO NOT buy the book you'll never use it, unless you read it. But thats what Khan Academy is for. So save yourself the money and buy the ebook",0
"I had him for my horticulture lab 161. He was amazing, especially since i don't care much for plants. If you took notes and studied them for the weekly lab quiz you would do really well. He didn't do any trick questions and you could understand what he wanted clearly. I passed the lab with an A and the whole class with him and Smith with a C.",1
"He is a fantastic guy but one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He is very unclear with what he wants and he frequently forgets what he originally required and changes his mind. He is a nice and funny guy but he just cannot teach. Nearly everything I learned in that class was from the book. Take someone else for this class, you won't regret it.",0
Absolutely the hardest and worst teacher I have ever had. I don't want you to think that I'm some student who does not care I have a 3.5 gpa. the sad thing is he will never change and faculty department will never replace him. the highest test average was a 52.,0
"Currently wrapping up her class, and it is great. She is very helpful, very insightful, laid back. She creates a chill atmosphere and yet, teaches in a way that sticks with you. She's also sexy",1
"Nina is an absolute sweetheart and such a kind approachable human being, but she has this 'crazy lefty' side of her that I didn't like. She literally gave us an article that claimed New Caledonians are smarter than Europeans (idk who she's trolling with that one). She also sometimes spews political comments here and there, but overall, she's sweet.",1
"Hardest, worst professor. Do not take her class if you can avoid it ",0
"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Dr. Curtis as a person. As a teacher? Not so much. She rarely lectures on the topic at hand and instead tells stories of her family and her time in the field as a sex anthropologist, which would be hilarious if not so off-topic. Passing the class is doable, but you have to do the work yourself to memorize the textbook.",0
"This class has been REALLY terrible. It has been impossible to follow, the answers to test questions cannot be found in any of the material he provides. He rarely responses when contacted. He disappeared for ten days and neither explained or apologized. DO NOT take this class from this professor, you will regret it.",0
"He has many in class assignments that go towards your attendance and final grade. In addition to in class assignments, you have quizzes once a week, which are fairly easy if you skim the textbook. Exams are easy in the beginning but become more lecture heavy with the last 2. In general, his lectures aren't helpful.",1
"Wonderful to work with. Learning math through Wildman is attainable. He's an excellent teacher with solid communication skills, passionate, and has a natural talent for teaching math. He cares about student success in his class and that helps engage students.I had no math skills prior to taking his classes. Thank you!",1
Incredible inspiration to all students that attend.,1
"Took this class online- Pretty easy...you have to do the work- Discussions all the time, quizzez, & tests just about weekly. Just do the work, i got an A.",1
I was first scared of all the low reviews I saw of Eric but after having him for College Algebra I think he's a good teacher. He was always willing to help better my understanding and was accessible during office hours. There are a lot of quizzes and he sometimes gets off topic and falls behind so you might need to teach yourself but I did learn.,1
"He explains problems while writing on board, then u don't have time to figure out how he gets answer. Not good with patients for others, you may somewhat understand, then he totally throws u off before u leave class. U leave with confusion and head spinning! And tutoring lab teaches differently. He knows math but not one to teach it!",0
"if this class doesn't change the way you think, nothing ever will and you will die a sour old man. you need to do all the work and test questions can come completely out of the blue, but if you can either manage to succeed or get past that point, it will be an unbelievable experience.",1
"Si vous pouvez, CHANGER de PROF, dans le top 3 des pires prof que j'ai eu de ma vie!",0
Such an easy A!! I didn't go to one lecture and I have a 95 in the class. I think I had like 5 assignments the whole semester and they would take at most 10 min. He's a very sweet guy and definitely knows his stuff if you're actually interested in music. I would definitely recommend it for your first semester and it's a GPA booster!!,1
"He's truly great, he made discussing the books fun. I normally hate being assigned to read books but the things we had to read were interesting and would read again. The only thing is that there IS a lot to read so you have to give yourself time for reading and maybe discussing with classmates or him if you don't understand the texts.",1
"I took this class in 1994. This guy was the best teacher I ever had. I have personal knowledge of thousands of people that this man impacted in a profoundly positive manner. This man actually cares about people.  I know all this, cause he's my Dad. You rate perfect in my book. Love you Pop!",1
"Prof Infante is such a nice and genuinely caring person. Despite the fact that I never understood a single reading and could probably, at the end of the semester, not tell you what this class is about I would take the course again in a heartbeat. It is rare you find a professor as nice and class discussion was always fun even when it was confusing!",1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, with an unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. 1/10 from me",0
"His tests are tough, make sure you really study. His lectures contained a lot of material, and were live one day and recorded the other of the week. He took forever to respond to emails with questions. His weekly homework assignments were challenging. The lab reports are challenging, make sure you get a good group.",0
"Currently in the class. We just got our first exam back and I got a C. But, apparently, 19 people failed it- an exam that is purportedly the easiest of the semester. Material is DIFFICULT and he did an absolutely horrible job at preparing us for the test. When I chose to sign up for this glass I wish I would've read a review like my own. STAY AWAY!",0
"Mr. Luckett is a good professor. One interview assignment, discussions and a few quizzes. Just read the chapters and you will pass. Take him!",1
"She is not for those who are not passionate about medieval history.  I am and as such gained a plethora of knowledge (I have taken her four times).  Her writing assignments are very difficult.  She is not looking for regurgitation of previously covered material, but original analytical thought, as in what historians do.  I highly recommend her.",1
"Had her for Spring semester. She's easy but not very clear, she's also very confusing says one thing then says another the next day. She loves doing free writes. That's all you do and hand them in for a letter grade. I disliked her way of teaching.",0
You won't be graded on your knowledge of economics in this class. You're harshly graded on your ability to make pretty data visualization and your ability to summarize book chapters/articles that incorporate little to no economics. I would not recommend this class to anyone. Dr. Wooten made an interesting topic (crime economics) pretty boring.,0
"Ms. Wang is a great professor. She's helpful, doesn't micromanage, and is very understanding. Teaching method is very easy to understand, and is at a very healthy but not fast pace.",1
"Nimrod Segev made me love macroeconomics, a feat that I thought impossible. He is an incredible teacher and is truly dedicated to teaching. During finals he stayed in his office for 12 hours straight to help anyone who needed it, whether they took his class or not. I want to have him as a teacher again, and I hope you do as well.",1
"I don't think there exists a funnier human being. That, and he's a great teacher. Super easy to learn from.",1
"He was a a really good wisner. Loved his class, got an A.",1
"She's a good person, but the sound of heels coming down the hallway meant the torture was about to begin. It was unbearable sitting through the class. It seemed like she was assuming that nobody had anything better to do than focus on composition. The first half of the semester is back to back papers that could have been more evenly distributed.",0
"get on his good side, if he likes you he will grade you much easier and if he doesnt like you you...well...to bad",0
"Bret was a really good professor. You do quite a bit of essays and projects in this class, along with the mandatory student-learning portion. However, the student-learning wasn't as bad as I originally thought and he puts a lot of time and effort into making sure you understand his feedback on your essays.",1
"Dr. Macdonald is only good for reading off the slides. She wont discuss midterms or how many questions they contain, she wont look at chat, she literally will do nothing further than giving you the slide info. She also doesn't have basic computer competencies, failing to even start the lecture at times. Rip to anyone that takes her 325 course",0
Make sure you attend every lecture and discussion! I had 90+ in both midterm and final. But only got B+ overall because I missed a few lectures. His one page essay is really restricted in terms of his requirement. His lecture is always useless and you better off read books on your own. Participation grade is so subjective and unfair. Avoid him.,0
"She moves fast in lecture and lectures almost directly from the book. I ended up teaching myself more from the textbook, but that's pretty terrible too. Lots of homework and tests are unpredictable (no practice exams)! If you take this class, be sure to be in a study group from the beginning. You're gonna need it.",0
"Nice guy but treats Intro 101 class more as a master's class. Too much material covered & ""study guides"" are just lists of what's possibly on tests; did not include what he's specifically looking for, which is relevant bc there's so much side material that you lose site of what he's considering the main points. Low class test scores so not just me",0
"Jeanette is one of the most vague professors imaginable. All questions are answered in an impossibly ambivalent manner. Grading is also very subjective. Overall, though, she knows what she is talking about and will better prepare you for the world of business.",0
"Old school prof. While I don't mind an old school prof, and everyone teaches differently, this man reeked of pompous arrogance. His class was him ensuring everyone realized his importance. 50% midterm on an Econ elective to a fourth year class, and a rude class-wide email responding to the low average. 8000 word essay. Needs to check ego at door!",0
"If it is your goal to learn the science of nutrition, do not take this class - with this professor. Expect to find all of her test questions searchable on Quizlet (even the online midterm), and to be blindsided for the final. Personally, I know a lot about nutrition - A LOT, and I hoped to learn something here. Nope. She is a robot, sadly.",0
good,1
"seroiusly, do the homework. just do it. and you WILL pass. with flying colors. two tests in and my average is 114. yeah, 114. ive been out of school for three years, and didnt take the course before this one. he literally TELLS you everything on the test the class before. he answers every question on the homework.",1
"he is not helpful at all,",0
great sensei,1
Alison goes above and beyond for her students. She's an exceptionally inspirational professor with a relaxed yet highly effective teaching style. Class discussions were always engaging and assignments were unique and thought provoking.,1
"Average professor. Tough but fair. I wasnt a very big fan & found him to lack connection with his students... despite being very interactive with him, I was just another fish in the sea. Usually I like weekly quizzes, but his were tough. He also comes off a bit rude, but I think he thinks he is trying to be funny.  He wasnt bad, but wasnt good.",1
"Good teacher, nice guy but terrible English language skills.",1
"Riff Raff is great. I've taken intro to Physics 1 and 2 with her and I'm enrolled to take her astronomy class. She has a lot of energy, cares about her students and making physics simple. She has an iPad that she draws on during the power points which records her voice and her writing and she posts them. She's very down to earth, as well.",1
"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",0
"Prof. Van Der Poel literally teaches what's in the book, even using the same examples. She's a stickler for notation and exact solving of each question. Every minor error means a point deduction. If you don't understand something she said, she gets annoyed and asks another student to explain. Be ready to pay $100 to turn in homework online.",0
When I took him last semester he changed some stuff around and now you have to write more papers. They are not difficult but still time consuming. The class is still easy but a lot more work. I would not retake it though if i could,1
"Can't work ahead, which is super annoying, because I could have been done in three weeks. Simple stuff! Overall: take if you want an easy A.",1
"Often rude and unapproachable in class.  Ask a question and the answer usually be of a condescending nature.  Does not seem to want to be teaching. On the contrary, visit him in his office and he's very helpful and amicable, takes time to clarify what you need.  The text wasn't mandatory, but thats where I learned most of what I needed.",0
"I took this professor because all of his great reviews, which are probably all fake. I used to love chemistry before this class, but now Im on the verge of failing. The class averages on tests are normally Ds. His lectures are by far the worst Ive experienced, the homework is impossible to do without looking everything up on yahoo answers.",0
grades harshly and doesn't accept any late work no matter the reason. I won't take her again or recommend her class to anyone,0
"Mrs. Jimmerson is a great teacher. She's very informative and explains things on a pretty easy level. The first test is on history of the English language, the second is mainly sentence diagramming, and the third is vocabulary and correcting a paragraph. Very useful class. I learned a lot. Study hard and take it seriously and you'll pass.",1
"I took him for Biodiversity of the Caribbean and he is a very caring and sweet professor. The class is graded only by 3 midterms and a final, but one exam gets dropped and each test has 8 points added automatically. It is very easy to pass if you study the lectures and come to class to do the clickers. He gives a lot of extra credit!",1
A very boring lecturer. ,1
"Nice guy but good luck learning anything from him. I've done well in Calc I and II so general physics should be nothing, right? Almost too simple if you're a science major and his explanations and ways of doing things are so convoluted and hard to follow it makes getting anything out of it difficult.",0
"She'll give a quiz every week, but by half ways through the semester, she won't post the slides from lecture until the day of the quiz. And if you're like I who has a class at 9 am, and then her class at 10:30, you're screwed. She has only given one bonus question on 1 quiz and gives 1 on exams.",0
Do NOT take this professor. He doesn't input any grades. He expects you to learn everything yourself and come to class with questions. He just throws up so problems on the board and solves them and goes over the powerpoint really quickly.,0
"He is very narcissistic and the way he oriented his class made no sense. The quizzes were absurd and asked verbatim definitions and half the class would fail every one and assignments like his resumes were all about his way. Even when i went home his ""right"" resumes were not right at all and i got bad feedback from companies about his style.",0
"Seems like a nice guy, but that means little when 90% (his #, not mine) of students fail his classes. He moves quickly, and you take TONS of notes. By the time you finish writing something, he already moved on. I know everyone makes mistakes when doing math, but we have to correct him 8 or 10 times a day. He uses ambiguous wording on tests, too.",0
"It's better not to miss her classes, she gives a lot of bonus questions in class. She is very attentive to answer questions and help if you don't understand something.",1
Awesome teacher. Very clear. Really fun.,1
"For the sake of your gpa and wanting to graduate on time DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! He's one of the worst professors I have ever had. I've never failed a class before him. If you take him, good luck.",0
Professor Burman is hilarious and helpful. She is easy accessible outside of class and always shows that she cares about you and your learning. Show up to class and do your work- attendance is not mandatory but it does reflect on your grade in the class.,1
I am a student who always ends up listening to his lectures when I start studying for my class quiz or when I have to do my assignment. Amazing lectures. Always awed by the way he drives the class.,1
I enjoyed your class and I like how you taught.,1
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
I do not agree with most of the other ratings. She is passionate about English and explains her papers in details (usually spends almost a whole class just telling you about the paper). Somewhat of a hard grader. Follow what must be included in the paper and you'll be fine. Not the most entertaining class but not too difficult,1
"Professor Brownlee really cares about his students. He was always very accommodating and willing to help. He was extremely knowledgable in his field, and exposed us to wide variety of sources. I feel like I am coming away knowing a lot more than I did when I entered his class. His tests are written, but he is very helpful in guiding you.",1
This class has been the worst class that Ive ever taken Prof tests on the concepts he barely spends time explaining throughly you are essentially on your own when it comes to tests. The labs are also bad he expects you to know all the lab material and literally comes into lab just to ask you questions and if you dont get them he roasts you.,0
"I was interested in this language but the professor herself always had useful tips to help you improve your speaking and writing. The class wes a bit easy for me; and that could be because i was already learning before her class. There are no quizzes, only homework and short readings/exercises. Exams were sometimes over activities. Received a A-",1
"She's a good Professor, and very nice. But, her grading technique is a bit strict and she makes/creates her own quizzes/exams so be prepared to actually read and gain a thorough understanding of the work. No searching up questions on google, she's not that easy. But yeah good Professor and make sure to address her by her full name, not a nickname.",0
"Jeri's a sweetheart, easily my favorite prof in the design department. She's very helpful with assignments and is pretty flexible and will adjust the class schedule as needed if multiple people are behind schedule. A really fun, positive learning experience... can't wait to have more classes with her.",1
"this class is really fun and interesting.  You learn so much about movies, film making and directors.  plus.  hes friggen hot.",1
A really nice professor! She is willing to answer questions and offer additional help after class. She made me think about the Enlightenment period more critically.,1
"Expect to have to teach yourself absolutely everything on your own time, which is extra difficult because everything you research will be in a different (and more standardized and sensible format) than what she teaches. I have yet to meet a single person who thinks she is good at teaching material. Tests and quizzes are also obscenely difficult.",0
"She has decent PDF files though I did not learn anything from her. I had to teach my self the course. Very hard tests, not enough time to go through the problems. Also, she gives multiple questions and T/F questions which are ridiculously hard and confusing. The final was extremely hard. She does not give a lot of examples. Bottom line AVOID HER",0
"This course can be very time consuming, but if you listen to the lectures and take notes you will do fine.",1
"Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree",0
"If you are a student with accommodations do not take this professor ! When simply informing her about my accommodations of extra time she acted completely unprofessional and did not understand why I needed this extra time, when clearly I have a reason approved by the SSD office! Terrible experience all around!",0
I have read a lot of comments on here for Professor Butman and I have to disagree with most of them. I like his class and understand they way he teaches. He expects yo to put your time in your work. He goes over exactly what he grades on in class and gives examples. He does try to help students during class but at the end you get what you earn.,1
"A very difficult class to do. I took her online so I didn't get to meet her in person. She was a very difficult grader and had very unclear instructions on her assignments. She has a lot of work for you to do, and I honestly would not recommend her unless you like difficult classes. A lot of the highest scores for assignments weren't even 100%.",0
"I am not even done with the course; however, ""hear me roar"". As a professor who teaches an online course, you would expect one to be more involved, detailed etc... She isn't. It's a good class, informational, & good discussions, but at the end you ask yourself: Where's the teacher? If you email her (a good long email) expect a 3 sentence response.",0
"So BORING, has the same type of voice throughout the entire lecture, not enthusiastic about, he seems knowledgeable though. Wouldn't recommend taking this guy for a three hour long class. You'll die out of boredom. Take othe homework in case you do.",1
"Saralina is a great person and the class isn't difficult at all, but it is a speech class so of course it comes wit a bit of uncomfortableness . She makes the class as caring as she can though and is not super picky if you need some time to yourself.",1
Absolutely do NOT recommend!!! I took AP Calculus in high school and passed the class but after taking his class I failed the final and now have to retake the course. His tests and quizzes were unreasonably difficult and I basically had to reteach myself calculus. He just rants about Newton and physics without actually teaching anything. Stay Away!,0
"I loved Señora Pilkington! She's super sweet and really cares to get to know all of her students. English was her first language so she doesn't have an accent, and repeats important stuff and makes sure you understand. I definitely learned a lot in her class and did more speaking than previous classes, so I definitely recommend!",1
"This was a great  animation class. Kathleen's demos and lectures were inspiring and she really cares about helping everyone to achieve their best results. She's an animation pro and knows what it takes, is willing to share her knowledge and skills, our school is lucky to have her. Grading was fair and feedback was  always kind and helpful.",1
Cool guy!,1
Dr Lopez teaches her class like youre one of her micro colleagues. She forgets that youre in the learning stages. Shes not approachable. She says that shes there to help but not really. Who says to their students right before an exam that I expect everyone to get below 60%. Not very encouraging. Pick another teacher. I dont recommend her,0
"Dr. Cheers is one of the most difficult prof. i've had to deal with. He's rude and there are days where you want to punch him in the face. But know this, he was the only prof. that made me reevaluate my decision to be a journalist. He made me see you have to find your motivation yourself. I'd recommend this class for those who need a reality check.",0
"Terrible teacher. Rude, condescending, hypocritical. Does not know her own materials. Could not answer questions on her own test. Has blatant equality issues. Would not take her classes again.",0
"Dr. Pipiras is an outstanding professor. Lectures include many examples, which is helpful. Lots of homework but they are very helpful in understanding the material. He is entertaining and the exams are easy. Probability is difficult but Dr. Pipiras does all he can to make it not so bad. Strongly recommend.",1
"Don't take her awful class.  It's easy, but not worth it at all. I would explain but moderators would rather me not,just,.keep looking for another prof. Rebecca Mugford, if she's still teaching is amazing. Had a friend take her course while I took this, so much more interesting of a lecturer and can actually say learned more from her than Adelle.",0
Fantastic!,1
"This is the most disappointing class you can take. The assignment requirement was not clearly stated. He is a very subjective marker, and you'd better write something which can fit his political opinions. Unapproachable outside the class, he refused to talk to students in person unless you have something he thinks time-worthy.",0
I think the online component for Finance classes is not taught well.  If they had lectures with examples it would be much easier for Non-Accounting Students.  This instructor definately has favorites and grades accordingly.,0
I've taken his Math60 class before the reason why I didn't hesitate to take his Math 90 this summer. His grading is clear through web-assign you're able to monitor your grades based on your work. The forum on canvas helps you to have a better understanding which Mr. bertens are very helpful to help you solve a problem. No regret taking his class.,1
Easy A. Do your work and the A is yours.,1
"Perov is the absolute best physics professor at Suffolk University. His accent is hard to understand at times, but he is a kind, caring, old Russian man, who just really wants you to succeed. To pass his classes you actually have to try. There is a daily group quiz ( if you pay attention to his lectures you'll 100% always get it right).",1
Amazing professor !,1
"Took over the summer. Did not learn anything from lecture, learned every the material on my own, but attendance was required. Spends too much time on a problem when stuck, and shows that he did not review materials before lecturing. Lab was a mess, did not explain the procedure or setup, and left us 10mins to do the lab at the end.",0
"The class is fairly easy, but the weekly readings are brutal. She assigned at least 100 pages per weeks. Also when it comes to mannerism she is extremely snobby and opinionated and passive aggressive!",0
Prof. Lane helped me succeed. It isnt a good idea to Miss classes as all the notes will matter. Every thing he warned us about was on our Exams. Go to office hours if youre struggling. The patience he has to teach is priceless.,1
He is very good instructor. I would take another class form him.,1
Jana is an amazing professor who really cares about the classes she teaches. The class wasn't mandatory but to really understand the class and be able to write your final paper you should really go! Only graded on a few things and a big final paper.,1
"This was my first year in college, and I needed to take Calculus 1, so I took her.  She is  a great professor, and there is no good excuse not to get an A in this class.  She tells you what will be on test and does a review day. Test are 3 free response and 20 multiple choice.  She will try to give partial credit and sometimes let's you retry.",1
I can honestly say that Coach Martin is my favorite teacher at ISU thus far. He's a genuine man who cares about his students. He will also have your name learned within the first two weeks! He's awesome! I highly recommend him!,1
"By  far the worst professor ever taken out of 4 years of  school. she goes on about her  personal life .waste of time and doesn't grade clearly  , i would recommend another professor if this is your major",0
"Shes very nice, helpful in class and outside class, quizzes are open note so was final exam,attendance isnt mandatory but she does count it as grade to help your grade.",1
"Students in the class get bored easily. She just talks and talks with no attempt to connect with the students. There is no real connection because Moore, herself, is not passionate about teaching, at least that is how it appears.",0
"Dan is the worst professor I've ever dealt with. He told my class that if we died, it wouldn't matter and people would get over it easily. Really disrespectful guy. That said, it was an easy A.",0
"lopez is a really cool techaer he reads off his slide and you cannt take notes but yet you can get them off the internet  thier  is no homework throughout the semester only 3 exams and the last one is the final, he gives out study guides for every test which is very helpful we alos have a powerpoint to do in a group and give you time to work on it",1
"Terrible professor, it's sad too. She isn't very good at teaching and explaining. If you're not one to study and work REALLY HARD then this class isn't for you. DON'T TAKE HER.",0
"Not concise- takes several different tries to get one thought across. Talks way too much. Be afraid getting caught in a conversation, it'll go on for way too long. Cares a lot but not a good teacher.",0
"HARD, BUT REAL!!  thank you!!",1
"Intro to Public Health. Took it over the summer. VERY clear expectations. 10% atten, 10% quizzes, 10% hw, 20% each for MT and Final, 15% each for group proj and research paper. Grading is not bad, but no late work accepted. VERY easy to contact through email. VERY helpful in terms of instruction. Won't give free grades. Straight-forward attitude.",1
Her tardiness policy is wack. She shows up to class 3-5 minutes early and expects every student to be there or do not show up at all. Multiple times students have been counted as late (then she marks off your final grade every time your late) even before class is suppose to start. She also marks you down if your cell phone is out on your desk.,0
She is a great teacher.,1
Always late to class doesn't teache you hands on . You can't walk out the class without him even knowing,0
Great teacher really recommend,1
"Very strict with students, but does not help you.  Leaves you hanging in online classes.  Does not grade, correct, answer or help in any way with your education.",0
She is very nice but there is a lot of material for the class and generally we do not go over much of it.  The Cultural Anthropology is never specifically talked about in class but is a must read.  Be careful if you don't read you will have a hard time catching up.  She doesn't really get much accomplished in class as I think she would like.,0
"Peter is a nice guy, but his class taught me nothing. Very focused on sewing and design, but did not really teach us how to sew. Taught us the bare minimum to code, still didn't understand. The way he explained things was very confusing and never answered his email. If you asked me to code now I couldn't do anything basic. Nice grader tho.",0
"Very disappointed. Ridiculous amount of work for the level of content covered. Labs worth 1% of total bio grade but could be 8-10 hours of work each week when done right. The 4 tests were cruelly short (45min) with short response that required more than could be done in the timeframe, 60% averages. Even if you are a good student, avoid this lab.",0
"The feedback she gives is fine, however sometimes can be contradictory. Seems like she wants to help but also gets frustrated easily. Does NOT give clear instructions for projects and often left cramming towards the end to get everything you need. The more work you do for the class the more she will like you, however she has very high expectations.",1
"Sanda's class was my favorite one of this entire semester. That said, there are always two sides to things. She's tough and she will tell it like it is. But she's also very light-hearted and funny. Put the work in and do what is asked of you and there are no issues. Fight for your work though. You'll learn so much from Sanda about design.",1
"She's great for students that have some underdstanding of the material beforehand, but she's horribly confusing to those who don't.",0
"I would not recommend him at all, didn't have any clear set of guidelines, idk if it has to do with being online or what but it was very unorganized and the instructions for the graded assignments weren't clear which is probably because instructions for these assignments are never actually given. Seemed like he was too busy to teach this class.",0
"She is nice, approachable and teaches very well. I would recommend her for chem 111. She gives a lot of extra credits and if you go to class and take note form the lecture then you should be OK during exams.",1
Professor Knott was an amazing source of knowledge. Her ability to provide constructive criticism enabled a lot of growth as a writer. Professor Knott teaches many tools that will prove useful in later courses!,1
"He had a way of taking long pauses between statements -- whether it was to emphasize his ""genius"", or if he was just waiting for one of the half-asleep students to ask a question, I'll never know. However, he seemed genuinely interested in how everyone was finding the material.",1
Seek him out when you get to Coventry..he will help you in almost anything.....The best. Without his help I would not have my degree its that simple,1
"Kendra is a wonderful instructor. She's always positive, gives great feedback, and is more than willing to meet with you outside class for extra guidance. Plus, she's very engaging in class, which is a rare thing to come by. Terrific experience in grad level poetry workshop. Would love to take her every semester.",1
"Her class is a bit boring for the 2 hour and 45 minute TOSS class, but she really does care and she yearns for her students to be interested in what she has to say. The course load is pretty minimal compared to other TOSS classes, and the textbook readings are short and sweet. All that she goes over is relevant and useful.",1
Best professor and extremely helpful in all areas of the courses he teaches. He specializes in ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENT so if you are looking for something other than this obviously you go to someone who specializes in that subject area.,1
"The course is difficult to follow, those cencept just do not make sense. The slides are terrible to review. Prof never responses your email, and there is no clue whether we should submit the before class exercies or not, while how those exercies fill into participant point is unknown. Just do not take this course with this prof",0
"This class was easy for me as I had prior experience in the engineering field going into this program. A couple of group projects and some pretty hard homework and tests. If you are weak in math or engineering is not for you, don't expect to pass. I put in about 10 hours per week. Creativity and precision is key in this course.",1
"wastes a lot of time letting students rewrite the syllabus until there's one week left before a test & he has 8 different topics to cover. Tests often include random & generally useless facts from articles he assigns. You don't do much in class which a is nice break, but come project time it sucks. Vote against the business game if given the choice",0
"I honestly don't understand how he got good reviews. He is a very tough grader who can be very rude and mean depending on his mood. His exam is 85% of the total grade and I was never able to finish them (I studied a lot). I never missed his class or hw and still got B-. Even I take the same class again, I don't think I'll be able to do better",0
"Prof Jones was amazing! He is definitely passionate about art and wanting the students to take something from the course and continue to learn and appreciate art. It was a lot of fun for a summer class. Some lectures his voice was monotone, but the power points were chalk full of information. No final. Just quizzes and projects. Easy A. :)",1
She was unhelpful and confusing. Her grading was nit picky. Her review of the papers of how you got the grade made no sense at all. AVOID THIS CLASS. She does not work with you and is very rude. Talks down to you alot. Not flexible at all. I could go on and on but just dont take her class!,0
"I was excited to take this class but Prof. Peters quickly changed that for me. The tests were so long and extremely difficult, almost impossible to get an A on regardless of how much you studied. Lectures were very long and dry because she read off her power points word for word. Felt like I was in high school again with the forced participation.",0
"I don't know what it is about her, but she goes off on tangents that aren't necessarily about the topic at hand. Would be nice if she went through problems step by step and wrote on the board for once. She's a decent lecturer but if you're absent minded or have attention problems it'll be a chore.",1
Take it. OMG I have such a hard time staying awake in class but online I understand things a whole lot more. Not only because it seemed to go my pace but because if I had an issue with a problem I could not solve I would add it to the discussion board and then as a class everyone would help solve it. I learned a lot no lie.,1
"Most pointless lectures ever. He ranted once that it is our fault for failing if we have jobs/kids. We were graded by 3 tests, meaning the final could be worth 70%. He kept delaying material because he thought it was too much for one test, and yet saved ALL reactions for the LAST WEEK and that made up 100% of the final. I have nightmares.",0
"Lacking of  example, the assignment is nothing about the notes. He talked a lot about the definition. the definition is useless. He thought he is a good teacher, you know....",0
I gave him a good review earlier but now that I am in 122 I see that he did not do the subject justice. I am completely unprepared for this class and its only the first week. Please take a better teacher if you need to go on in chemistry. 121 is the foundation for the rest and I feel totally lost thanks to the poor teaching of professor Heske.,0
"Very confusing lectures, he is all over the place. He gives homework that is not mandatory but only uses class time to go over that homework. Exams are hard and total surprises. Spends a lot of time talking about himself. Students are not his first priority.  Overall his class is just uncomfortable, take a different professor. ",0
Good lord he will give you the biggest stack of reading in the world.  DO THE READING. DO THE READING OR YOU WILL NOT DO WELL. He's a cool guy and has interesting things to say. Also he has a really nice dog that he walks around campus. ,1
"You will LIVE in your textbook. She is a loving person but the worst professor I have ever taken. Unfortunately she is just uneducated, a bad teacher andirresponsible. She DOES NOT HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING, lab or lecture. ""What does the book say?"" She simply doesn't know the material well enough toteach it the 1 time she answered me, she was wrong.",0
"Best teacher so far. You will have to work in this class but you'll also learn.  Very willing to help if you're willing to work.  Responded to emails in timely fashion.  Lets you submit work early for critique so you'll have a chance to revise before final submission.  If you fail this class, it's because you don't listen to what he says.",1
"100 slides copy-pasted from Wikipedia and elsewhere. there's time for about half, but who cares: there's no apparent structure, he produces nothing but truisms and mainstream opinions, no critical approach at all. In international politics! Don't email with criticism, he won't respond. I grant, it's an easy A. Hardest part is to stay awake",0
He's an ok professor. The class disscussions don't help you much for the quizes but he does give you study questions that go along with the books you read. There are only a few papers which is always good but he does grade pretty harshly. You also have to do volunteer work as your 4th hour.,1
Confusing professor who is never available during her posted office hours. Will belittle you when you ask for help outside of class. Out of 24 students she sent emails to 19 suggesting they see the calculus tutor instead of asking her for help. Very confusing way of grading exams with no partial credit. Do yourself a favor and skip this professor!,0
He is so rude. He yells and slams his hands on the table if you don't understand the material. His test suck and his study guides are horrible. Do not take his class.,0
"I blame Margo, but I also blame the class. The theories she teaches are dated. If she's to teach them, it should be with a critical eye... she just explains them with these lengthy lists of examples. And, yes, her voice is really annoying.",0
Very nice and caring professor with insightful lectures but a tough marker - be prepared to write a lot of papers and make sure you follow the assignment criteria and cite properly!,1
She has powerpoints to present everyday but every slide is a stock picture with a title. Class is VERY awkward and uncomfortable. She is also very one sided and liberal in her material and it is hard to discuss opposing viewpoints. Towards the end of the class she got very hostile and would rush through the class. Made me rethink my major.,0
"I've already left a review, but I'm leaving another one because I STILL have not gotten a final grade posted for this class and it's almost Christmas. I can't even enjoy being on break because I keep checking to see if it's been posted yet. Seriously don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
stay as far away from her! she dose not know how to teach!!!! when students ask questions she just says every one is right and dose not give a complete right answer.... she dose not know what she is talking about and she forgets everything she dose and says...dont take her class you will regret! she is not helpfull and she is soo baD!,0
"The ASL class had a pleasant and quiet atmosphere. We didn't speak and really immersed ourselves in the language. The way she went about teaching without speaking wasn't hard to follow at all, like you may think. I would take the next ASL class with her again if I had the opportunity to do so.",1
"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",0
"Dr. Heyborne's lectures are my favorite of all the teachers I've ever had. He's funny, engaging, and knows his stuff. You also go on field trips for this class, which are so much fun. He also really cares about his students and will do everything he can to help them succeed. Sometimes his grading criteria isn't super clear, but just ask questions.",1
Oh Steve.. Steve is that dude. He is one of the boys and was a great professor. Tests is based on 4 tests and he gives very good reviews. Also we has quizzes but were told about them in advance. Much love Steve.,1
"Mr. Tyson is late to class everyday. He only gives tests, no homework. The information from his lectures are what you need for the test but hes late everyday so you miss out on time for info. He doesnt help you out what so ever. I ended the class with an 89.2% and I emailed him twice about something I could do to get an A & he just didnt answer",0
"This was a well organized online class, and I learned a lot. My main issue was that I could not reach him by email or blackboard. He rarely responded to messages. Nevertheless, if you follow the homeowner, the quizzes are easy. I did not use any of his lessons during the course so I don't have a comment on that.",0
Great professor. Never be late,1
"I took this course online, and it was overall an easy class. Her class-lectures are difficult to follow, but she posts an extended version of each lecture online, and the textbook is very useful. The tests were also relatively easy as long as you study. She is a very caring person, and you can tell she wants her students to succeed.",1
"Lazo- Cividanes is a very well informed professor that delight us with his lectures, specially in the Latin American context where I can qualified him as an expert. What I like about him is the way he has help me in the development of my research paper, a paper I have been working since the start of the semester.",1
"My main issue with this professor was the delay in the grading process. I understand needing time, but returning assignments two months later does not help me understand what I am doing wrong. If assignments were graded in a more timely manner students would be able to use the feedback to perform better.",0
Best teacher Ive had @ State.,1
Love her! Great professor.,1
"Great teacher, there if you have questions",1
Avoid at all cost for Biodiversity unless you absolutely love ecology/geography. Will overwhelm you with information. To summarize this class... ecology trivia and mindless memorization of random facts he decided would make a good excuse for a class. EXTREMELY thick accent and gets mad if you ask about exam content. Rude to students overall. Avoid!,0
"Nedd is such a great professor. The class was all about Provençal history, which is relevant to where we were, and he really knew the content. The projects were easy and the essay was short. I learned a lot. His awkwardness is really what makes his class interesting. Love this guy.",1
Rude and condescending to students. I wouldnt recommend this professor.,0
The best Lited professor ever. I learned a lot about language development and literacy in her class.,1
"She's always start her lectures right on time, some of her lectures are mandatory, not all. She want you to turn in your assignments on time (one again: timing is very important in her class!). A lot of extra credits are given during the course. You also need to buy the textbook because your homework is in there.",1
"He is an awesome teacher. The study guides that he gives prior to tests are so helpful!The class moves at a fast pace, but he makes the material easier to understand and will answer any questions that you have. Keep up with the homework! I'm not great at math, but with Mr.Logan's help, I did well in the class. I recommend taking his class!",1
"She is an amazing teacher. She was always willing to help, and very understanding if you had to miss class. She does not put up with people on their phone or being late to class. I would take her foe every level of English if I could.",1
"seems disorganised makes bad jokes and will make simple concepts difficult to understand as he has a way of teaching that seems like he is trying to show off how much smarter he is than everyone else. Will not post notes or HW solutions, tests can be easy",0
don't take her. she has people do the most ridiculous assignments. nice lady but very hard grader. also holds grudges,0
He is a great professor and i would recommend him to everybody that i know! As long as you dont miss the deadlines his class is an easy A. He is very clear as to when the dead lines are and the Projects and Tests are easy as long as you listen.,1
On god this is literally the worse professor I have ever had. When I tell you do not take this class you better listen. She is so picky on her grading and everything she will not give you credit for some small stuff. The grading is not in your favor if you mess up on part its over for you and the semester. If you get caught lackin on GOD it's OVER,0
Useless teacher - I had her class and wouldn't take it again!!!,0
"Professor shively is a very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and fun professor to take for anthropology classes. She is always helpful, knows a vast amount on the muslim culturereligion and is a laid back professor. Took this class for a filler and one of the best thus far. Take her if you can!",1
"The worst I've had. She picks a couple of students in as her favorites, and it is disgustinly obvious who they are all semester long. She was my advisor and did not advise me at all - didn't have a grasp of the requirements at HWS. Spends too much time in the bars trying to be your friend when she should concentrate on being a better professor.",0
hard to pass. not a good teacher.,0
"ridiculous grading. Math is universal, but not for him. You not only have to learn math, but also HIS math. He wants you to copy exactly as he does it. Very discouraging as he states that not even D is guaranteed. Avoid. He says and believes that calc is hard and that most people will fail. If you want to succeed, get someone that believes you can.",0
"Best professor ever! Passionate about her field, engages with students, clear grading criteria. Participation can make or break your grade, so make your voice heard! The rest of the grade is determined by 1 test, 1 project, and 1 final paper. Not much homework. Thank you Prof. Delius!",1
Easily one of the best professors at UB. Be ready to read a book a week and discuss but he is very open to interpretation and is a class act in all regards.,1
"Class is smarter than she is. You can argue your answers and get credit for being wrong pretty much as long as you have a good arguement. She moves off topic a lot and is easily distracted by student dicussion. She also favors to a degree. Easy to make her favor you, sound smart and outgoing. I prefer her class over any else because she's so easy..",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE OR OVER THE SUMMER. Every three days you have to read a chapter 40-50 pages long. Lots to take notes on (2-3 hours minimum) Then you have a quiz that can take up to an hour - with 25 multiple choice and 5 longer answer questions.. You have a fill in the blank exercise as well and a 1-2 page reflection for each chapter!,0
"Okay  class, she is very sweet. You think she would be an easy grader, but I always got lower grades then I thought i deserved. Class is required. I didn't pick up the textbook, but you can get a good grade just going to class.",1
Best professor at Hostos Community College. Love her,1
"I loved Mr. Smith. He is very specific about what he expects, but he will help you reach the standards he sets if you communicate. He does expect all students to read & PARTICIPATE in the class. I thought Comm Law would be boring but Mr. Smith made it awesome. If he sees potential in you he will definitely help you develop it!",1
No Comments,0
I would not recommend taking this class online. It is a HUGE time commitment. It will not be the kind of class that you can just blow through.,0
"She's really nice.  She's outgoing, and kind of loud.  This class is extremely easy but sometimes, she can be very unclear about assignments.  Sometimes, she's hard to follow and you just don't know what she is talking about!",0
"Even though Professor Rice may seem like she doesn't care about you succeeding in her class, she's honestly really fair within her grading. Just follow the rubric, study the lab material for quizzes and procedures, and you will get an A. I had received a 99 in her class with a reasonable amount of effort. Just know the material and you'll be fine",1
Professor Yue did a fantastic job ensuring that all students were familiar with a given topic and set of words before moving on. She doesn't just teach content but the reasoning and understanding behind the content. She is always trying to find ways to improve the classroom experience.,1

"This dude is an embarressment to higher education. Does not answer emails, everything is last kinute. Completely useless to grad students. Just go do something else, what a joke.",0
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
I took the accelerated 2040/2050 course. She is amazing! It was fast paced but completely manageable. She is very sweet and makes the goofiest comments. She will follow the syllabus exactly as laid out by the department so don't expect anything under the table with My Spanish Lab or extra credit. Her handouts are a great help so do not lose them!,1
The most caring profesora in the department.  She can be very strict but she will work with you to excel not only in your class but also in your desire to be fluent in Spanish.  You have to do your homework and focus in class.  I just wish all teachers were like her .  I highly recommend her. She is a darling!,1
"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes. Instead of teaching or asking provoking questions, it almost seems like she is so bored that she could care less about planning out a thoughtful class discussion. Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",0
"If you study as days go by as how he throws questions on his exams. You will be just fine. Some of his questions on his exams are repetitive, but different numbers as you take next exam, especially piecewise defined functions. If you don't pass his exams, you'll have a chance to correct them and math center will help you if you don't get it.",1
I love his class! Very into the discussions and actually knows what he is talking about. He is a great advisor too. I have his night class and I don't even mind it. Take him whenever you get the chance.,1
"Professor Lane is a very nice lady, and she knows her stuff, but sometimes she'd get off topic or not answer the questions she was asked. Everything was pretty much straightforward, but the honors section has to write a group research paper which was a little rough. Provided review quizzes for the final that were very close to the final itself",1
"Prof. Fowler is great! While her lectures are usually unfocused, she bubbles over with enthusiasm about her subject. Prof. Fowler has also been really    accessible outside of class; she visited nearly every section before the exam. It is tough, but a little studying and you can ace it!",1
"I get pretty much nothing out of this class, except what's in the readings.  The books she chooses are boring and fairly irrelevant, and the class discussion seems wandering.",0
"Every-time I asked for help, she made me feel like the dumbest person alive. She is so smart that its hard for her to dumb things down. If you dont have a strong science background, youll probably fail.",0
save your gpa and don't take her class. trust me,0
"She takes attendance every day but we just work on our online stuff in the class, and sometimes we will write papers and have to read them in front of the class. Overall she was a nice lady, but she never gave me a single comment of feedback, and we just had a bunch of busy work online that didn't teach me anything. Easy A, but not engaging. ^1102",1
"Three hour class that can be done in 15 mins. The professor skips over the slides, which I could be doing at home. Papers are simple but he is a tough grader for no reason. Does not provide constructive criticism for you to do better on the next paper. Asks questions about your opinion, however if it is against his opinion then you are wrong.",0
Brutal,0
Doesnt provide help and your whole grade is based upon your test and quiz scores which she doesnt provide much help with. IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. One person in my class got an A 8 people had Bs and the rest failed. More than 60% of the class got D's or F's. Bad teaching. she ruined my college career,0
"I liked Dr. K a lot. I am on the edge of an A and a B. He is a hard professor, but his tests are fair and a lot easier than his lectures. If you asks questions he tries to help you to understand. He also does a review at the beginning of every class. Take notes on these because it's a good review for the test! I would take him again.",1
This professor was very nice.,1
"Ms. Magallon was my best teacher. She gives clear assignment instructions and gives great feedback. If you follow her feedback, you can't get below a B on any paper. The books were interesting and really engaged me. I would take her again if I could!! Really gets the class engaged as well. Fun, interesting and easy class.",1
"Wisotzki is by far the best art history professor in Loyola She is amazing and she is hilarious. She offers guided tours of the Art Institute for review and they are a great tool to study for her tests. The class is hard and there is a lot of memorizing. 2 tests, a final and a research paper. Go to class and take good notes and you should be fine.",1
"Worst professor I have encountered thus far. Like everyone else has said, we didn't get our first test back until a month and a half after we took it. He doesn't post assignments or readings until the night before they are due. He coughs and clears his throught 150+ times during class. Not helpful, arrogant. If you scheduled it drop it, now.",0
"he is good and knows his stuff. After all, he's been doing Math all his life. At first though, I was very upset about his grading but I studied hard for the final exam and got an A. He good!",1
"Hes a nice man, but this was the worst class Ive ever taken. The first 1/4 of the semester was a waste because he quizzed the class on the different edition of the book. Class average was a mid/low C at the time of the final. Syllabus is inaccurate and the final exam was cumulative without a study guide. Do not take this class.",0
"Dr. Chalk gives a ton of work constantly, and doesn't give you a single day off. She is under the impression that her class is the only class you are taking, and it is the most important. She gives random reading quizzes and picks awful books. She talks for 55 minutes about the books while you sit in boredom.",0
AP is one of the best professors I have ever had at reynolds. She continually strives to better herself for the sake of her classes. I have had her for three semester and wish I could have continued to have her in my fourth semester. If your willing to learn and try something a little unorthodox I promise she will not disappoint.,1
"If you're looking to take an Astronomy course, well then you better keep looking. He's a tough grader and the tests are hard. This is not an easy A, so think again. Hes very strict on attendance as well. If you don't study then you have no shot at passing, and even if you do study, then you better study harder. Go to his office hours, he likes that",0
Don't take it out on me just because he didn't give you a good grade.,1
"""Intructor First"". Never respond email. Not friendly. Not care about his student at all. Hard to get an A. Worst instuctor I ever seen. No practice exam. He only says,""the exam question is similar to your book's examples"" (I took CIS 20). Lecture is lack of organized. It is detailed but saying too much useless in class. HW are barely relate to exam",0
"She is not very precise in her lectures on what you need to know for the tests. She didn't quite answer questions in a concise way, and frankly kinda rude. Honestly, thought I was alright at math before her class. She uses SPSS and expects you to know it.. without hardly any guidance. Very hard time finding a tutor for this class. Good luck...",0
"This was a required class for my degree and I was so excited for it  and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Tricky tests, tough grader and very confusing lectures. A LOT of reading of articles so get ready for that. If not required, don't take it is all I can say. ",0
"Before I signed up for Boydston I looked at the reviews, they were low but I kept an open mind that I had to work for my grades regardless who the professor was. But this professor designs everything so you can fail, she goes beyond measures to make sure her exams difficult. Either than that I see no effort from her in anything else. DON'T TAKE",0
Extremely helpful. Her main goal is to make sure her students know the work.  Will go the extra mile for you.  If you do a paper wrong she will send it back and explain what the problem is and allow you to resubmit it correctly (with a slight penalty). Her main goal is not the grade but did you learn the material and will go out of her way to make ,1
WARNING: FLIPPED CLASSROOM. Look it up pretty much nothing is done in class(but you have to show up) and all the real learning is done on your own time. This did not work well for most of the class. Averages were in the 40s,0
I dropped the class on the first day because he doesn't let you wear a hat.,0
"She is not clear with her instructions at all. She looks at you like you are stupid when you are answering a question.  She does not listen to your answer even if you shout it, like i have multiple times.",0
"The tests are made to take more than the allotted time, he is extremely vague, and does not post grades until the last minute, and he NEVER posted homework or participation grades.",0
"The worst professor I've ever had in my life. There was probably close to 4 full books of reading for only a few questions on each test. He was really rude and immature during some times and was really unreasonable. Worst professor ever, do NOT take him",0
"Dr. Keeling is obviously knowledgable about toys and games.. but she changed the topic of the class after registration from a topic I was interested into toys so I went from being really interested into the class to not. She is an okay grader for papers, but a lot of the class is busy work. Participate lots bc its part of your grade.",0
"This class ran off of connect with 3 assignments plus a quiz each but ALSO a ""project"" (busy work) to go along with each week. The directions for these project were never clear and you basically had to guess on the internet and hope and pray you received a decent grade from the TA and even then the professor may come and change it !",0
I found him very geeky and there is so much you can learn from him.,1
"Margo is an horrifying prof. I've never been so incredibly bored in an anthropology class before. Literally reads off the slides, no new information is given, speaks ONLY about Brazil- in fact my class mate and I have taken to rolling our eyes every time she mentions Brazil, which means our eyes are CONSTANTLY ROLLING. AVOID THIS PROF.",0
"Dear Black Students, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you want to sit in a 3 hr night class and listen to your classmates demean us. If you can handle that then its a super easy A. But if youd like to keep your peace of mind. STEER CLEAR. Discusses black topics. Without the discussion. Great for your gpa, horrible for your mental stability.",0
Dr. Fan is really a great teacher. She is helpful and understanding. There is online homework due monthly but it is very easy and you get three tries on each question with explanations on how to do it. There is one 2-3 page paper due and 4 exams (multiple choice) with the lowest score dropped. You should have no problem getting an A or B!,1
"If you looking for easy way to pass cmsc411,take his course. exams are 99% same if you go to the exam review. HWs are really simple if you spend some time searching through his note/google. Projects is the hardest which is not very challenging. I doubt any can fail in his course. Easy A with effort.",0
"One of the best profs out there! Gandy is really funny and class is super interesting. All notes for tests will be on slides, only in the class. If you show up and at least get the notes, read them the night before, you will pass! He does have extra credit essays to write, but they're long. IF YOU LISTEN IN CLASS AND LEGIT STUDY, THEN AN EASY A+ :)",1
"None of your exams and tests actually have reviews that correlate to the test. There is too many places where your work is such as owl, McGraw hill, and then on blackboard you have your lockdown browser tests and exams so everything is disorganized and very confusing. Overall, this was a super hard course so I withdrew, would not recommend.",0
Professor Sheehan is simply a very dull teacher. This was probably the most boring class I have ever taken during my college career and I would not recommend it if your looking for a good interactive geologic experience. I really enjoy geology yet this class was brutal to sit through the lectures(Online format). Very easy A though.,0
"Teaches the things you need to know. Works for the student to be successful. Always available through email, if not in person. A lot of homework, but I recommend him for anyone willing to put in an effort.",1
"The BEST physical science breadth you can take!! Super knowledgeable, lectures are interesting and he was super accommodating to student's circumstances because of the pandemic! Highly recommend.",1
"This is a prime example of a professor meant to only teach to math majors. He has the pace and brisk attitude of a prof bored of teaching lower level math. To a savant, he would probably be well suited, but to an average- or even slightly better than average- learner, he's too fast, too intimidating, and too brief.",0
"Poorly organized, graded by few things for a semester long grade. Very book heavy. Most students are confused with what is going on in this class so everyone just does their best. Other profs are worse so just take this for your gen ed and get through it. Cool, funny guy but isn't the best teacher. I could see him being a good upper division prof",0
"No marking scheme. He'll mark some questions normally and others extremely unfair. Dont complain though, no reason, university wont do anything since he makes too much money for them. Read the BOOK, in class its easy stuff, exams arent.",0
If you are not good at math do NOT take him. He skips a lot of steps he feels are common sense but for those of us not good at math are important to understand the material. Quizzes every week. Doesn't answer questions thoroughly. I never felt comfortable enough to ask questions because of the way he responded to others when they asked.,0
He is EXTREMELY INTELLECTUAL and helpful!!!! BEST PSYCH TEACHER YET!!!!,1
"Find another professor. Shes vary vague when answering emails whe she answers them. All test are closed book. Instructions are sometimes hard to understand. If you can, take another professor. She complains about the number of emails sent to her and seems to get irritated.",0
"I don't know why so many people like him. he's terribly boring and ive learned nothing from him. bias towards one religion in my comparative religions class. rude to me and many other classmates. dont take this class, you'll fall asleep every time.",0
"It's one of those classes where it's supposedly an easy class, but it just isn't. She makes the assignments much more difficult than they actually are, and the instructions are never clear. She's a nice person, she just isn't clear at all which makes her class difficult.",0
"Might be the worst teacher I have ever had.  This is by far the most difficult class I've ever taken and it is only because of the professor.  Looking back at the semester, a fish could teach better than she could.  She assigns ungodly amounts of homework and does little to help us understand the material.  Outside help is the only way to  do well.",0
Easy A and you learn a lot. Teacher gives good feedback and the work is not difficult. Quizlet is your best friend!,1
"I would never recommend anyone to take her class who is doing a gen ed or if you have any traditional views. She gives out many writing assigments, and also grades very unfairly on your own analyzations of the theories learned. She is a very young professor and a joke. Uconn really needs to get rid of her. I should've looked here before taking.",0
"Horrible! I was in Ms. Hegners class to begin and she was awesome, she got sick and asked Skelly to finish our semester for her. Half the class droped the first day he was there. Doesn't make any sence. I had an A and now I'm scared to take our final because he hasn't taught us anything. Completly political and makes rude jokes. Don't take him.",0
I personally enjoyed her teaching. She was very willing to help me out and gives ample opportunity to ask questions. She always lets you know if she won't be available during office hours. Great teacher. Make sure you turn homework in on time and pay attention and you should pass easily.,1
"Hi everyone. I am not usually rated for any of my professors. However, I think you need to know about this one. Homework is extremely heavy. Making sure you have time for it. She grades our work very hard. Trust me, to get a good grade even in a discussion is very difficult.",0
Amazing guy,1
"Ray is a cool Prof and absolutely loves what he teaches, and he liked getting the class involved in discussions. Vague rubric,  sometimes too much class discussions in class which sometimes made it hard to understand what the point was.",1
"10/10 Would take again. In class work is easy and fun, you get to be creative. Tests require you to study so grab a textbook! He is super laid back and helpful.",1
"Would walk into class and say turn in papers, but other than mentioning things generally he never make clear what was due when. Turned in weekly journal entries but none were graded till the end and gave zeros for half of the entries because he said they ""were not MLA format"" but they were the same format as entries he scored as 100.",0
"Only into my second week of class and has one of the best professors I've had at Suffolk. He wants you to do well in his class and helps you succeed. Best honors course I've taken, I recommend taking this Professor!!",1
Never again he doesnt teach us anything at all your book is your best friend. #facts,0
"Someone needs to get this woman out of a classroom. She outdated. Her instructions are vague, her syllabus is vague. I didn't learn a thing in her class. She started class 15 minutes late every day, and always has to leave in the middle go move her car. She is very set in her ways with her 1938 budget!",0
"AVOID THIS TEACHER! She creates her own tests and the answers are often wrong even when counted right by the textbook! When I asked her a simple question, she had to use Google to find the answer! This class has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had, and I hate having to worry about this so much. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"Sanchez is really nice and teaches alot of interesting material but in the end, you'll feel as if you've learned nothing. This course doesn't help at all with speaking of the language. Tests are a joke. They're online and basically a google scavenger hunt with a time limit. Grades pretty fairly but takes forever in doing so.",0
"Makes you work for grade but very easy to contact, clear methods. Lots of assignments over all but helps you understand the lessons. 4 oral presentations, quizes after every chapter and tests. Some group tests. Go to class and do the homework. Very nice and very understanding",1
This prof truly wants everyone to learn. He is kind and makes the class applicable to the real world. Even tho he is new at teaching he makes it very fair for students to succeed. The class is weighted easier than any other accounting class (less% on tests and more on actual work). If youre a good student and do all the work you will do great,1
Dr. Cutler was not ment to teach! She only likes you if you understand and do well in her class otherwise she basically makes the whole class know your dumb. if you ask for help she brushes you off and does not answer your questions. she also rarely does example problems and when she does she does not finish them. Do not take this professor!!!!!!!!,0
Prof. Steinitz is great. She knows her stuff from real world experience. She helps you relate to the subject matter through practical exercises. She really wants her students to succeed. Highly recommended class and prof.,1
"Intro to Special Ed. - Hybrid Prof. Hutton knows a lot about special education & has multiple children with disabilities. There are 27 modules you have to do throughout the course, you can work ahead (recommended), they are easy but with a good amount of reading.  Study aids are helpful Gives good constructive feedback - rubrics can be wordy...",1
"Ashley is amazing! She is incredibly smart, though often overly academic/verbose in her lectures that she has to clarify. Participate and do your best to answer her questions. Talk to her and treat her with respect, and she can work with you on extensions in emergencies and treat you with respect in turn. Funny, genuine, helpful, engaging!",1
I'm not sure why professor Louis has bad reviews. I took Govt 2305 and 2306 with her! She makes everything clear since the start of class and uses connect. The connect homework is lengthy but you will always get a 100%. The exams are easy if you do homework! The only thing that you have to work extra hard for is the 2 discussion posts. Take her!,1
"Mr. Fultz is a great guy, and will try to help you any way he can. However, he can be confusing at times, and when you ask for help he confuses even more. He's very disorganized and can be everywhere. His class was super easy, though if you plan on going into A&P classes you may not learn much in his class.",0
"Scribbles vague notes on board, and cannot read handwriting whatsoever. Tests are way too hard- covers too many chapters in one exam, and are not permitted to use any notes, and entails excessive essay questions. Each individual test is worth 20% of your final grade. 70% of the final grade is based solely on these test scores.",0
This prof is funny and sets up lectures that are interactive and don't put you to sleep. He cares about his students and that they learn the content. His course helped me learn skills that I am using in my business placement and in other courses as well. Thanks for the great semester.,1
"This was a capstone class online. No test given as majority of your grade is based from the business simulation program. You will work in groups/teams for the simulation and had members that did absolutely nothing, and he will not hold them accountable for getting a free grade from the rest of the group participating which was extremely frustrating",0
"I'v never struggled so much in a class. This guy is impossible to get ahold of through email. He grades so harshly and provides no feedback. His tests are 50% memorizing phylogenetic trees. Seems like a nice guy, but just not the best professor.",0
"A tough class, but a great teacher. Definitely a satisfying challenge.",1
coolest teacher ever...,1
"He is a very difficult grader, but he doesn't seem too bad overall.",0
"taught u stuff that was not applicable till the next test so she would teach u new material right before a test, that is foolishness",0
"Without a doubt the worst professor I've had so far. Very poorly organized barely teaches anything and the group project is a mess. Any feedback you get back from her is confusing and unhelpful I don't think she even knows what she is looking for. Attendance is a significant part of your grade as well, which is frustrating because of how bad she is",0
Is awful with technology especially computers! He tells you what will be on the exams but is not really on them. And DO NOT EMAIL HIM! he is a nice guy but shouldn't be able to handle a classroom and make sure he gives you the right office hours,0
this class is the reason i question the use of gen eds.  literally so confused every class. his lectures have absolutely no structure  hes really good looking but i wouldn't take him again,0
"This professor's expectations are high. If you want to learn a lot and be driven hard, take a class from her. This class, ENGL 308: Interpretation of Literature, was reading-intensive (two or three hours a night)and covered a wide range of interpretive theories. You'll get as much out of the class (and out of her as a lecturer) as you put in.",1
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
Quizzes and exams are hard. All of the assignments are all rushed together. Most confusing class I have ever taken at UNA. ,0
This man makes my life worth living.,1
Hes good people through and through.,1
"Awful grader. Takes off points for not doing it exactly as he instructs although you understand the problems and your work is in general correct. Don't take him, he will ruin your GPA. If you want to have a good experience at SMC with math professor you need to join the scholars program, otherwise you'll get professors like Mr. Konya. Unfortunately",0
At first I was super annoyed with her lectures it was super difficult to sit through 3 hours of lecture then be expected to practice what you were just shown-wore me out! But I stuck in there and if you put in the work and support what you don't understand with tutorials then you can get through it! In the end I learned a lot!,1
This guys voice is SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I am Hispanic and I cant understand him. So bad. Everything is based off the PowerPoints but they are extremely long.,0
"Funny as all get out and even gives personal testimony to help you remember things. However, Extremely tough and strict.",0
B-O-R-I-N-G !!! Impossible to stay awake in his class... he surely is a nice and intelligent teacher but there is no structure in the course. You can definitely stay at home all semester and just read his power point online...,0
"a very artistic person, but at times he was extremely snappy. He did not like if I disagreed with him about my own art. I did all the work, worked hard, but he was argumentative at  times. Other times he was perfectly pleasant, and I can't say he was an unkind person. But his tendency to snap at students once in a while makes the class a but tense.",0
"Great online class, definitely recommend her!",1
"Fun Class, Hard Tests.  You gotta read the book and take notes forthis class.  He is a gret entertainer, but his tests can be very hard. you gotta work for an A in foresty wildlife and fisheries.",0
"Hannah Britton is awesome! She challenges you to think in different ways(her classes are not for the lazy). She also cares about her students, a rarity at K.U. I loved all of the classes I took with her!",1
"Clausen is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. She breaks down the material like no other professor can. If you listen in her class, and study, you will do fine. I took no notes in her class but actively listened and studied for her final and got an A in Contracts and B+. I decided to be a transactional attorney because of her.",1
"Lots of quizzes and homework, no final exam, just a big group project with 5-8 other people, she tries really hard to make it interesting but it just isn't and the concepts are just annoying to have to remember, we get a cheat sheet for exams and she grades attendance. Easy class but veryyyyy boring...",0
Took him for Calc III. The lectures are very cursory so make sure to ask questions or you'll be stuck on the homework forever. Practicing all the homework problems will more than prepare you for the tests - one midterm one final - which are all that is graded.,1
great person but awful professor. she never lets you out a second early and be ready for a huge homework load.  she seems to think that her class is the only one students take.  if you don't want to be stressed out and annoyed all semester DONT take her,0
"This is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is a great teacher and really makes you understand the topic. Didn't read a single chapter of the book and passed the class easily. Take her,she is awesome!",1
"Absolutely terrible. Gives little help on the massive amount of daily homework. Little explanation over topics expected to know without prior discussion. When he does answer a question is extremely condescending. On more than one occasion said ""If you don't understand this then drop the class."" Has knowledge of Spanish but doesn't wish to share it.",0
So uninspiring. So boring. It was torture being in his class. He humiliated students whenever they asked a question. He offered absolutely no guidance. He speaks in a low soft voice and has major problems hearing. Avoid taking his class!,0
"Terrible teacher. He can not hear so class is just him asking for people to repeat themselves. One midterm one final pretty easy since the ta's held review sessions, but I never knew what I got on the final. 4 crucial projects, a lot of work, but doable. Finished the last 100 point assignment in one day. Barely went to class. No feedback.",0
"2-3 Exams (Midterm and Final usually). Depends on timing. Quiz every class, but you can easily get by if you study the material (Drops the lowest 3). Gives a good sample exam that is about 80% of the main exam and genuinely loves Ornithology. It's a field course so you go out and identify birds (not in the rain). Highly recommend for Ornithology.",1
Easy A and easy class,1
"Assigned interesting readings but led very poor discussions. Anytime we got going, she took us off in a new direction using her buzz words she uses over and over. (Ex: hegemony, intersectionality, ideology). She also grades papers based on her politics and not on the quality of your writing or argument. The course is interesting, but she is poor.",0
"She has very strong opinions and pretends to play devil's advocate. She challenges you to fight her opinion, and trust me-you won't win. She brought up current politics and made her opinions into facts. Would never take again and do not think she should be teaching history, or really anything at all.",0
"She is a great teacher. She always emailed me back in a very timely manner. This class has really helped me with my public speaking. I loved that she allowed the class to give feedback on presentations because the feedback made me more consciousness of how other's view me. Therefore, I can correct my mistakes and improve.",1
Don't take her. It's hard to understand what she says during class. You mostly will have to teach yourself.,0
way too hard and hes super picky about grammar,0
"I ENROLLED IN THIS CLASS 6/29/2011 FOR SUMMER B SESSION. I READ REVIEWS WRITTEN BUT DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. BOY I WISH I HAD LISTENED I STAYED IN CLASS FOR TEN MINUTES AND HURRIED TO DROP. PROFESSOR WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, FAST SPEED AYOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE WORD SHE WAS SAYING... HOW DO EDISON EXPECT YOU TO LEARN LIKE THIS!! DONT TAKE HER!",0
I enjoyed the content of the class and I feel like she presented it in a way that was understandable. I liked the online format where I could print out the slides and take notes on them. The reading quizzes were difficult and really made me pay attention to the text. She knows the material extremely well. Be prepared to work for a good grade.,1
"BEST PSYCH PROF AT PACE- knows his stuff, fair grader. wants you to get an A. goes out of his way to make sure you understand the material.",1
"If you've taken an AP calculus class before, go ahead and take him as a professor. If this your first time ever seeing calc before, stay away.",0
"The material of the course was quite difficult, however Abdallah teaches it very well.",1
"snoble a little bit,",0
She is a nice teacher and well prepared but she does not go over the homework in class. ALOT of notes that weren't very helpful. I failed the class.,1
She is the worst,0
"Monotonous. If you need to catch up on some sleep, just listen to his lectures.",0
"Professor Zein is ridiculously picky about what she looks for when she grades, and it's very difficult to get a feel for what she's really asking.  Her lectures are fairly disorganized and somewhat dull, as are many of the readings.  She expects close reading, deep thinking, and hard work, but that's probably not enough.  Avoid her if possible.",0
"This class in general is very difficult but this professor didn't help at all. Limited office hours, no extra credit and your grade is 75% exams.  homework is 25%. He expects you to read each chapter 4 times, and come with questions. Wont tell anyone what is on the exams. If you don't ask, he doesn't tell. Will make you feel dumb for asking ?'s",0
"Dr Picault is a very nice guy and generally very approachable in office hours. But you really have to get used to his lecturing style: there were weekly only quizzes  and 4 multiple choice midterms. Final exam was a long and moderately hard (multiple choice). No diagrams, no analysis. Very lazy assessment, you won't learn a lot  of economics here",1
"Don't fall behind. Very clear, responds to emails quickly, very tough- but if you do all (and i mean all!) of the practice examples then you'll do well - if not then it's too tough to do well.",1
"Learn from the book. Didn't buy the finance calculator. He doesn't know how to do the problems without it, so if you can't teach yourself. well good luck. Review is not helpful. He cannot give formulas or extra help unless it is directly from the slides given to him. Why pay for a class when the teacher can't teach?",0
"He was confused, I was confused, everyone's confused.",0
"Okaaaaaay let's see ... Whatever I'm gonna say I can't describe this professor. He is amazing, great, one of the best professors I ever had. I always like to bother him with my questions lol, he always helps. You better take his class if u guys see his name. You will get an A if u listen to his comments on your presentations. Take him��Take him��",1
"Awesome class, awesome teacher!",1
"Sweetest person I have ever met in my life. Great, caring and loving teacher.",1
Easy B fench class!!! Try and you'll get an A-. She will notice if you're not there and homework may be posted on sundays,1
"If you disagree with him, you're wrong. If you have to take a philosophy class find a different professor. He's boring and loves the sound of his own voice.",0
I really liked her class . I could tell she likes to teach. She sends out weekly announcements. The course is straightforward with about 12 quizzes and 1 tests online and 4 discussion papers. There is only one project to do which a lot of work,1
Do not take her speech class! She is a really hard grader! You have to dress up for the final and it has to be 13-15mins long or you will fail.  Avoid her at all costs! I passed with a C.,0
"absolute worst professor i have ever had in my life. I had to retake the class because she failed me with a 72. She may or may not be clinically crazy. Her tests are impossible, she is extremely lazy, she gives you one day to do hw. makes you hate microbiology bc shes so awful.",0
"Although attendance is required, don't pay any attention to her lectures. Study straight from the book.She wants very detailed answers and is a little nitpicky when it comes to grading. She does curve, and if she doesn't get to a topic, she will delay tests. Everything is straight memorization from the book. If you're good at that, you'll get an A",0
"Attend his study sessions and ask questions. His classes are easy if you use his help, don't rely on the text book to learn especially in pchem, his lectures are more useful.",1
Jackie is the best teacher ever ! She is the best teacher ever ! Shes SUPER FAMOUS cause of her kindness and always respect her students. She always makes me feel so thrilled every time I attended in the class. She makes me feel like I WANT TO ATTEND TO THE CLASS. Thats the truth. She gave us so many games n if u pass it u will get HW PASS ��,1
"His online class was the best I've ever taken. Simple and to the point, but thorough. Only post response to discussion board, no response or reply to another post. 3 Tests, open book and straightforward. One paper of your topic choice. Swint is also a pretty funny guy, very relaxed!",1
"Lisa is GREAT! She has a really good knowledge of the French language and really wants everyone to be successful. We did fun activities, ate food, learned the culture and the language. I totally recommend taking her class!",1
"I took Law and Politics in the Ancient world with Professor Tulin Fall 2015. I enjoyed his class however, the title of the class is misleading. The material is all based on rhetoric which is good to study if you are in a social science discipline. He does have a class attendance policy that will effect your grade.",1
Dr. Sankara is an excellent teacher. He has very high expectations and is not an easy grader but he does grade fairly. He is always willing to answer questions or provide any necessary help. ,1
Great guy who definitely understands that this material is difficult.  He is very funny and very laid back.  Good grading system as well. Take him if you can!,1
"She is brand new but she is pretty great.  Professor Peters is honest and tells it like it is, and she also makes you completely aware of what she wants on assignments.  She is horrible at power points but makes class fun with her great sense of humor.  She is a fairy easy grader but a stickler for APA. She can spot 1.5 inch margins a mile away!",1
I got a good grade but I don't feel like I learned anything. I emailed him a few times with no reply. That's not good for an online class!! If you don't need to talk to a teacher he's the man for you.,0
"Took Beba for 20th C. Fashion, Art & Culture. A really good class. I knew next to nothing and learned a lot. All papers (creative writing, midterm, final) have correlating PPTs. A brief quiz. Finding primary sources, especially for earlier decades, can be a bit of a pain, but it's doable. Check your grammar on your papers!! Def recommend.",1
"He is laid back and brilliant. He truly cares and is more than fair with grading. If you need help, he's maybe the most accessible prof in Cox. Put in the work and you will do well. His lectures are enjoyable and low stress.",1
"Probably the worst prof at OU. Flies through lectures with little to no practical explanation of the material and expects students to retain all the info (even skipped a chapter that was covered on final). Quizzes are 10 Qs that cover 5 chapters of material. Pretty much need to teach yourself with the textbook, and even that can only help so much.",0
"Cares deeply about his students. Knows his material. I had him for both Con Law and Crim Pro. Excellent professor. Be prepared to read a lot for class and memorize case rules for exams. If you don't mind the reading and memorize the rules, you will do swell! I probably learned the most in his classes during my 3 years at Loyola.",1
"Very difficult to communicate with.  Didn't repsond to email. Cares about students in class, but hated our daily discussion groups.",0
Great all-around professor. Homework is pretty usual and consistent and tests are pretty basic. Very helpful.,1
"Super fun if you engage her, just participate in class and you will do fine.",1
"Great professor.This class was very lengthy and kinda boring, but he is very enthusiastic about acct.He goes above and beyond to help you pass even if you havent done anything.He is very funny and like one of the guys.",1
really poor and mean,0
"I don't see why anyone could complain about him.  He knows his stuff, he is enthusiastic, and best of all, he makes class FUN.  Imagine that.  Anyone that wants a good grade in MGMT, take him.",1
He has a very thick accent and spends most of the class writing theorems and equations on the board without explaining what they do. Exams are way harder than the content seen in lectures and homeworks. Do not take his class if you are not ready to learn all the topics by yourself.,0
"Nice and understand but not very good at teaching online course, at all.",0
Notes are unclear as well as her lectures are pointless. Avoid.,0
"Professor Lukomski is a great professor. Her exams can be challenging but she does explain what will be on it and what to expect. She really challenges you to work for your grade in this course. Make sure to study your head to toe assessment early on in the semester, it is worth a large chunk of your grade. Overall a great professor and course!",1
"Never take this class as an elective. Forget about the online component, It's way too much work (readings, assignments). You are supposed to read the whole, 300 page textbook, as well as watch hours of lectures. Every now and then you are supposed to buy the newest version of the textbook (which she was an author of) that costs $100+. Ridiculous.",0
"Dr. Baddar is fantastic at getting you to think around the literature you'll be reading, she's extremely insightful, and she's definitely someone I look up to, but she's one of the harshest graders I've ever encountered. It wouldn't have been so bad if she gave me feedback, ever. Save yourself, don't take a writing class from her.",0
Lectures are pretty useless. He asks the class to participate and waits more than 2 minutes for someone to answer. Really heavy accent. Boring lecturer. Hard grader on reaction memos. Midterm not that reflective of the book.,0
Seems intimidating at first but he really cares about the student and he's really good at answering questions if necessary. He gave my friend a full text book for free.,1
Professor Guzzone is absolutely incredible. This is my favorite class that I have ever taken in my life. He is so knowledgeable about music and the history of it. I had a 3 hour class that met once a week and always wanted to stay for more! I never even needed to take notes! Tests are so easy if you pay attention and read the chapters when asked,1
The class was definitely something that pushed me as a student. It wasn't just a typical freshman class. He really pushes you hard but it is all worth it. In class he can come off as harsh but if you go into his office he is very helpful. Gave very good critique and made me a better student.,1
"He has no clear grading criteria, his methods of grading and teaching are all over the place. His PPT slides are 100 each and he jumps around and skips slides, which makes it really frustrating. He only scribbles stuff on the chalkboard when he tries to further explain a concept but still doesn't make any sense. Exams are unfairly difficult.",0
"I've had this prof many times, and each time it just gets worse. It's impossible to get office hours. Don't even try to get feedback on a paper before you submit it. His handwriting is gibberish-so feedback on assignments  and his notes on the board are scribbles. The quarter also ended last week and he hasn't posted any grades yet. He is a mess.",0
"If I could give him a 0 I would. Worst professor I've ever had by far. He doesn't explain anything and just reads directly from the book. Goes through at least a section a day if not more. Other classes aren't even in section 13 and we ""finished"" already. Do not take his course, you'll regret it.",0
"I had her for lab, I did not learn anything from her. If i did not have an amazing lecture teacher i wouldn't of passed BI121. lectures are all linked to personal stories from her life and job of being a nurse. Took test from different professors, so wasn't diligent on grades. Says spelling doesn't matter but will take points away if spelled wrong",0
Very enthusiastic about the subject! 3 tests. He gives you the test to study a week in advance. No final so once you take tests you can forget the info. 2 part tests: define terms & essay. Just attend class and you will get an A!,1
"Hands-down the worst professor I have ever had. He rambles every class, never following the syllabus. He is a really tough grader and is unwilling to discuss his grading techniques/reasons for giving you the grade he gives. If attendance wasnt absolutely mandatory I would never go because he is very disrespectful and talks down to students.",0
"He was a very nice man and he knew his subject very well. However, this class was almost four hours long. He was not a very engaging professor to sit through a four hour lecture under. You will learn the subject if you pay attention, but I struggled to pay attention and stay awake during his class.",1
"I have taken multiple courses with Nancy and did well in all of them. Fair warning though, Nancy does not care about her students and has no interest in helping you succeed, even when you make an effort and/or are a good student. The classes are worthwhile, if you put in the work you will learn, but expect to do it without her support. ",0
"He is nice professor but he really need to change his teach style. He is a kind of professor who hope students to go to his office hour. If you go to, he love talking with you and answer clearly. And his exam has many works. So, good luck on it.",1
He is a very good teacher! All notes and test material come straight from PowerPoints. He does not post them on Moodle so you need to show up for class to get your notes. However attendance is not mandatory. Be prepared to study a lot though!! You have to study to pass! His tests are quite difficult but his bonus points are strange but funny.,1
Her tone with the class is very awkward doesn't really connect well with her students. Quizzes are every class period. With the bad flood was forced to miss a class and wasn't allowed to make up work. Very poor teaching methods kinds jumps right in with out giving a strong foundation.,0
An amazing teacher i enjoyed being in her class she made math easy and understandable ,1
"Toms a character, but knowledgeable about what he teaches.",1
"Professor Justice is the best math professor at Akron because he of his ability to explain concepts well to students. He grades fairly, and the grade you get in his class is the best you could possibly do in my opinion. Class is all quizzes with a final. Because of only having to study sections at a time for quizzes, final is tougher to study for.",1
No Comments,0
Makes you do unnecessary work and is super extra. This class will make your life harder than it should be. Also dont bother asking for extra time because hell ask you for evidence on why you need it.,0
She is awesome teacher. Even in summer classes I can understand her clearly. I like the way she teaches. She isn't partial in grading papers. She will always solve the difficulties in class or outside class.,1
"Dr. Oks was a really nice guy. If you went to his office hours he was very easy to talk to and was very willing to help. However, in class, he never explained anything very well and would only flash typed examples of physics problems on an overhead and then removed it promptly. Only survived by using old tests. Never learned a thing.",0
"Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended. Prof has lame sense of humor, but at least she tries. I normally HATE math/anything math related, but I easily followed her lectures and found the subject matter interesting. She is very easy to understand and VERY helpful if you have questions, etc. Full PP lect notes available online.",1
"Miller can be hard to please because he expects you to be real and talented in a way you might never have known existed before, but he is a professor who makes you feel you are in college and not high school, which is what this school feels like in most classes besides those of Miller.",1
"Probably the worst teacher I have had for first year, hardest grader unnecessary work for an elective, trash professor responds in a week time",0
Took her class online. Her Instructions are not clear for assignments that are not pre-outlined by the book. I informed her I was struggling with the class several times. Her response was rude+unhelpful and very unprofessional.,0
You use the textbook a lot! Teacher does not put in as much effort as the students. Teacher uses the excuse of forgetting to grade assignments or is busy. The syllabus is outdated along with written assignment requirements. It is the last week of the semester and this class is still waiting for feedback on their final assignment.,0
"The experiments are quite interesting and I enjoyed working on them.  However, if you encounter some sort of issue, Prof Ho will be of ZERO help to you.  I dont think he spoke more than three times the entire semester.  Youll have fun working on his required 50 page lab reports - any less and he wont even consider giving you a grade above 80.",0
"BEST TEACHER!! You'll never find a teacher who cares more about their students. Take her!! Do not buy the book, you won't need it. She gives out study guides that are pretty much the test and the tests are open notes soooo its pretty easy.",1
"super irresponsible, not good ppl to communicate",0
"He clearly explains all concepts in lecture and explains ahead of time what will be on the tests. Your grade in the class is based entirely on the 4 tests, as there is no homework, extra credit, etc. The tests are challenging but the GSS resources (which are posted on ELMS) help a lot to prepare.",1
"Great instructor! Great stories from a public defender that are a learning experience. Make sure to attend class since all test material will be from lectures, no need to purchase textbook unless you want to. Best instructor and would recommend his class to all those that want to learn Criminal Law.A GREAT TEACHER, wish more were like you...",1
He is really confusing,0
I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in linguistics. There are no slides and lecture can be repetitive and dull. Attend class because your best bet is to repeat Sam verbatim on exams or you will probably be marked off.,0
"ECE 241 is an intro class for Computer Engineering.  Meaning that nobody knows anything about computers in general.  From the first day, Dwight spoke to us as if we already knew everything we needed to know about Computer Engineering.  That put us in mass confusion.  Not to mention that the labs took three weeks to grade.",0
"Although no textbook, Tons of readings. Could not finish his sentences all the time, but his sense of humor helped a little to make the class interesting, and can't forget his funny gestures. Kind of a tough grader, really have to study and put work into essays.",0
"Dude, you are teaching an INTRODUCTORY class to ACCOUNTING, one of the toughest subject ever. Students just don't come in and pick up debits/credits or balance sheets right off the bat. He really screwed my accounting GPA over.",0
"She is a really nice person but as a professor she is not that great. If you have to take her make sure you study ahead. She is very disorganized and her test are really hard especially the multiple choice part, the essay part is pretty easy but multiple choices are worth more so make sure you study and read the questions and choices slowly.",0
"I actually learned in her class. She may be strict and tests at time can be difficult, but if you pay attention you'll actually understand accounting. Also, she is crazy about making sure students don't cheat, so don't even try.",1
"Perkins is such a sweet heart. During COVID everything was very different but he did an amazing job getting you the resources you need in order to pass the class. Id say their is at least 1, 10 question quiz each week that is open note and 4 test then the final. You can tell he cares about his students and wants you to succeed. TAKE him if you can.",1
"Dr. Luttrell is a nice, Christian man, and is willing to help students out by giving them publication and research opportunities.  Teaching isn't his strong point, however.  Combine the PowerPoint slides with studying the book to succeed, fairly easily.  Make a template for lab reports to save you time.",0
"Professor Nuneville is a solid choice when taking ethics. I know ethics can be a boring subject to some, however taking it with her will make it better. She uses mindtap for all homework assignments, tests are open-book and she brings in guest speakers. You get points for showing up to class, but it can hurt your grade if you skip.",1
he is an extremely tough grader for a level 100 class. he wont hesitate to smack you with low grades every time u have a slip up.,0
"Kristi is very friendly but she sucks at replying to emails, she grades everything months later. Is confusing when explaining the papers she assigns. Exams are ridiculously difficult would not take again.",0
"The whole class is based on religion. Class is pointless just study before the exams. You only have 3 and its just two or three short essays (paragraphs), graded by TAs.",0

"I enjoy Hensley's lectures. I tend to slack off and not pay attention in most classes, but I really enjoy listening. He always gives good examples and stories throughout the class period.",1
"Get ready to read. Pretty tough grader, and not very approachable outside class so it was difficult to get feedback on assignments. This course was also very philosophy/theory based, and was rather dry - and often difficult - because of that. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.",0
"Mrs. Wright barely taught us anything & barely communicated with us (in-person or through email). Lots of group assignments and quizzes on TB chapters (which you don't have to read). No lecture material. She is not very accommodating or approachable. She does not reply to emails for weeks. The class was an easy A, it was just frustrating",0
oh my god what should i start with. first the class is way harder than it seems. u have to do so much work besides walking in the field for 4 hrs regardless of the weather. quizes are redicules. be prepared to know all the trees and flowers that u see and know everythiing he says. ton of memorization.,1
Professor Dudrick is my favorite professor at Colgate. He always takes the time to talk to his students outside of class and he gets excited to talk to you about philosophy and your life in general. His is so engaged in class and is really funny. You have to participate a lot and go to office hours but if he sees that you care he will work with you,1
"While his lectures were excellent and he knows his study, Mr Schlortt seemed vague and inconsistent in his feedback on papers and took off points from every minuscule mistake imaginable. His quizzes and ""cartoon analyses"" are extremely rushed in class (he hangs over you if you haven't finished in 5 or 10 minutes) and rigorously graded.",0
Had this teacher for 2 online classes. Introduction to economics and principles of microeconomics. Watch videos on the connect site and you should get an A.,1
"Dr. Boden is the only reason i use rate my professor from now on. taking his 100 level class was a great challenge and even though many hours were spent doing homework, lab reports, tests, quizzes, and taking notes i ended receiving a C for this class. never had participated in such a hard 100 level class, no extra credit avilable. not recommended!",0
Take him if you want help and arent good at math. He gives alot of extra credit and makes math easier then other teachers! Great teacher would def take his class again,1
Helps you out Chemistry is a very tough subject and he understands that,1
Gina is awesome! She really cares about her students and makes sure she is doing everything she can to help us. She gives great feedback. You will have short writing responses for homework and not many big papers. Take her class if you have the chance!,1
"Had to drop this class after a few weeks. She gives tons of homework for little credit. Homework is worth 5 points only and thats only if she collects it. She does some mistakes on exams like marking an answer wrong when its correct so you have to look out for that. Whole grade is based on tests and final, does not count homework or attendance.",0
"Professor McCarthy is one of my favorite professors at AU. She can be a little tough on grading, but she lets you rewrite the papers and you most likely will get a better grade.  We read some interesting books (a lot of reading at times) and had good discussions. Would highly reccomend.",1
"""GOOD MORNING"" ""HAVE I LOST ANYONE"" *random music plays in the background* ""IT HELPS ME GET IN THE ZONE"" Okay Shawn, okay, we get it.",0
Andre was a very thorough professor. He clearly explained the data and which steps to take for SPSS. Also held office hours to go over or explain sections of the paper one might not understand. The first assignment was extremely easy. You just need to make sure you go to class to follow the instructions precisely. Or you won't do well on it.,0
Really hard to understand. Goes over practice problems in class but the way he describes them is really confusing. Business calc is extremely difficult with him. Would recommend another professor.,0
Dr. Wisotzki is a great professor. Definitely take her before leaving Loyola. She is brilliant and her lectures are interesting. You will want to go to class!,1
"Ouyang is nice, but a really difficult professor.  He reads straight off the slides, offers no real explanations, and the project work is insanely difficult.  If you take this course, pair yourself up with someone strong in accounting, especially if your new to the topic.",0
Though he is a nice person I hate his teaching style. I prefer teachers to teach us the material in class and then go home and read over what we learned about in the book. He expects us to read first and then he skips around the chapter without really talking about any topic. He grades hard and doesn't give very good feedback either.,0
Really good and entertaining,1
It's a shame this man is a professor for the prerequisite classes. He seems so unhappy teaching 2D and 3D which transfers into our class environment. If you are not conceptual or performative do not expect him to like your work. I see him discouraging many future artists which is very disappointing. Do not take him if you have the option.,0
"Don't even think about taking him for Differential Equations. The first day when he said this is the first time teaching this class in 20 years I should have dropped it. Not prepaired, completely oblivious his surroundings, doesn't know what he is doing half the time, and just a bad teacher in general. Don't make the same mistake I did...",0
"Tana was a really nice and engaging professor. But you can easily get drowned in the reading and the memos are graded incredibly harsh. Though, because I participated a lot during the class Tana noticed this and bumped by grade up because of it so she's an understanding teacher as well.",1
"Fuentes is one of the best professor I've had. He's always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand the material. Lectures are a fresh breath of air, you can tell he genuinely cares about his students and what he teaches us. Super passionate about his teachings and always willing to help and answer questions.",1
He's a great professor and really helpful in office hours! His tests are like the examples he gives in class and in his review book so make sure you buy that,1
"Very helpful,skilled teacher.",1
"Professor Dutta made the transition to online classes bearable. He provided clear instructions, provided well-thought out lectures and materials, and gave a lot of partial credits. He is considerate to students' feedback. It's not an easy class as it deals with SQL and Visio, but as long as you put in the work and attend lectures, you'll be golden!",1
Tests are unnecessarily tricky. The way she asks questions makes you second guess yourself. They are so tricky that even she messed up 3 of the questions. The NCLEX questions aren't even that tricky. I am an A student and got a C on the first test. She told the class we were doing very well with an overall C average. How is that a good thing?,0
"Dr. Lim is a knowledgeable prof. Notes were clear. However, he is incapable of teaching or getting anything across. Took him in the summer, and it was painful to watch his lectures to get somewhere since he focuses on things that dont matter. His midterms were okay. Final was natural selection. Advice: dont take him unless you absolutely have to",0
"Do not take his class. For the field class prepare for the class to end sometimes more than an hour past what is schedule. Very strict grader, heavy on the report papers every week. Boden teaches intro level classes but teaches them in a more complex way than most people understand. In other words, if you dont know a lot about geology good luck",0
"She is a great teacher and she knows her stuff. But, if you need an answer, you better send your question a lot earlier, because she won't answer your question right away. DAAC classes involved with a lot wring anyways and on top of that you will not get graded, So you'll never know you passed or failed until class is over about 2-3 weeks. ",1
The class was split in three parts or times in literature. We were tested at the end of each part. As long as you read and participated in discussion you will pass. exams consit of object exam and written essay exam.  The end of the class a research paper will be due. You have about two weeks to complete. Teacher replies to emails within a day.,1

"Such a great prof! He genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. Explains things clearly and is open to any questions you may have. His tests are very fair, if you go to class and do the homework you'll do well",1
one of 3 best in my 5 yrs of education,1
"This course was made up of group projects, class discussions, and student participation. I'm glad I took this during winter intersession. It was a fun class and we discussed very interesting topics. Professor is reasonable, very friendly and knowledgeable. Grading criteria is also very clear. You will learn a ton about gene manipulation.",1
Awesome professor. She gives out a lot of helpful examples and is very helpful during her office hours. You do need to work for your grade but it's not too hard. You'll do well as long as you study and do the extra credit,1
"Worst teacher I've had in my 5 years of college, 3 years at UCD and my 2 years at FRCC. Really regret not looking the teacher up first considering all these horrible (and accurate) reviews.",0
"Like the last comment said, take a SL class that is five units so that you will not have to take another upper division GE requirement. This class is a waste of time. Only her political view matters and that is what you will be graded on. Another student argued with her and she had the audacity to email us calling us complainers. Good luck.",0
"Tough grader, Little feedback, and has no filter",0
"She's not a bad teacher, but she's really weird and intense, she makes me uncomfortable. If you work hard you could probably manage a B+ but if you kiss her butt you can probably get an A",0
"This class was a huge waste of time, the class was 2hrs and 45 mins and for at least half of each class Bert would just ramble and try to make jokes. He was never prepared for class and would usually freelance his classes, and he also didn't explain how to use the programs and expected us to know what we were doing.",0
"He is terrible at explaining concepts and he does not prepare for his tests which are extremely difficult. He is available for office hours, but he lets all students into the room so that it is really hard to get your question across.",0
"Professor Cox is seriously the coolest professor ever and teaches such interesting course material. I recommend her classes to anybody. The work is all interesting and the lectures are actually engaging. Take her classes, any of them, it'll probably be your favorite that semester.",1
"Mike is a sweetheart. I took this class with no previous knowledge of Informatics or CSE and he made it very easy to succeed. It is ABSOLUTELY possible to get an A like 100% if you work hard in this class. He is fair. He grades you based on the weekly assignments and some quizzes/participation. The final project is easy, just choose a good group.",1
Save yourself some grief. No one wants to listen to Mr. God's gift to students that early in the morning.,0
"Professor Luallen is one of, if not the best economics professors at Tufts. He is able to teach the material in an easy to understand way. And if you have questions he is able to actually clarify the topic, instead of rambling off on a side note. His tests are hard, but doable. Just study and you'll be fine.",1
"The most stressful class I have ever taken. He doesn't give clear instruction and doesn't really teach you how to take pictures. Make sure you submit something on the assignment due date even though you don't do a good job. Because he will only grade everything at the end of the semester, which means you won't know your grade until then.",0
A very tough grader.,0
"Tanoukhi's lectures provide no clarity on the philosophical readings, and really neglect the assigned literature. Her slides are huge block quotes without page numbers--which she does not put online--and her exams are quote IDs of author, title and date. She also loves to waste class time with bizarre stretching or trying to learn names. ",0
"Sobie basically just takes the entire book, writes every word onto a powerpoint and says good luck. His powerpoints cover way too much unnecessary material so theyre useless, exam reviews are 200 qs, but the exams are only 85. The exams are all too close to eachother to learn that much!! He also grades vaguely!! Do not reccommend!",0
Jeremy Fry is one of the best teachers I've had at Hawkeye.  He made the classroom fun and gave great examples that made the problem solving very easy to relate to.  He respected you and had fun with you as well.  He likes to pick on you and I think that makes his class that much more fun and it makes you want to do your best for him!,1
Great professor willing to help all of his students.,1
"Easy A if you complete the assignments. Easy grader. Loved his ""religious amnesia"" concept. Final exam completely based on lesson quizzes. Easy it was!",1
"Shes really helpful, fun learning environment, couldn't have asked for a better teacher. Main thing is to show up everyday and do all the HW.",1
If you take this course be ready to spend time on it.,1
"She gives off the vibe that she'd rather be doing anything but teaching her class.  Grading is SEVERELY biased.  If you get on her bad side or she just doesn't like you for any reason, you will not pass her class.  Gives out unrealistically difficult projects with no time to do them and no assistance.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"What an unbelievably disappointing class. She bases the entire course on class discussion, yet has us sit in lecture-style rows and talks for 75% of the ""discussion."" She's very easy, just don't come in hoping to learn anything like I did.",0
"Great guy.  Show that you care and are trying and communicate well with him and you'll likely get an A.  He does not communicate your grade well with you, but he is always available to meet with to discuss anything.  In his first semester teaching MG 101, one of his classes won ""Top 'Dawg""...that should tell you something.",1
"Fantastic teacher! Knows what he is teaching, with very helpful videos to complete the projects. Fast at replying to emails. He looks for your effort, and he loves creativity. Hands down, would take a class from him again!",1
"Never stays on topic. More interested in telling BS stories about himself, trying to impress us rather than teach us. Never around when I needed help. Knows a lot (I think) and wants you to know it. Seemed more interested in helping (& flirting with) good-looking girls than anyone else. But he is fun (for a prof).",0
This class is horrible with him. I attended this class everyday. Some TAs grade very hardly. Not helpful. Not clear. Not easy.,0
"Dr. Clark was wonderful, even considering having class fully online because of COVID. I still feel like Ive learned the content. He is a nice guy and he likes to utilize group work during class. I would definitely recommend!",1
Great Professor!! She LOVES what she is doing and does all that she can to help students out to prpare for every aspect of the class! Makes learning fun!,1
"2017: LECTURES WERE SOOOOOO DRY. i have never been so bored during a class, was a great time to catch up on other classes. She expects you to read a lot, but she gives you interesting novels. She is a very tough grader, extremely picky on exams and midterms. She can come across as sweet, but can also be very sassy (not in a fun way)",0
"I did not enjoy his class at all. The lectures are extremely boring and vague. He doesn't give many assignments but when he does, he grades them toughly. So if you do take this class, I recommend putting lots of detail into your papers. Also the mid term and final are 50 min and difficult and out of 54 people, 2 got an A on the midterm. Good luck!",0
"I enjoyed this class. She told a lot of stories and never really got to the point with most of them, but she was funny at times. Her tests were really fair and came pretty much straight from her notes. Study the notes and you should be fine.",1
Took several of his classes and loved them.  They are all VERY challenging but very interesting too. He is passionate and its contagious.,1
the worst professor i've ever had. he's very knowledgable in the subject but he doesn't know how to teach it. he rambles and often tells us that things are going to be on the exams and then they aren't. he comes across as rude and is not accessible to students.,0
RUN I YOU CARE FOR YOUR GPA. THIS CLASS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY L I K E PHILOSOPHY OR HUMANITIES. THIS PROFESSOR SHOULD NOT TEACH GED CLASSES!!!!!!!! HIS CLASS IS FOR A PHD STUDENT. HE THINKS HIS STUDENTS ONLY HAVE TIME TO READ FROM THE TEXTBOOK FOR HIS CLASS EVERY DAY. DO N O T TAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOULL THANK ME LATER!,0
Learn nothing from this class! Lecture are terribly boring. He expects you to know everything! Midterm and Final are bummer. Do not take this class unless you know all the code and HTML!,0
"He is a current PHD student so this was his first semester teaching, over all a great guy and good professor. He knows the material and is willing to take the time to explain any questions you have. 3 exams, 1 project, attendance not mandatory. Passed with an A. ",1
"Even though I never have written so much for a course, my writing ability increased tremendously because of the course outline! You can ask my wife!",1
I took Dr. Makover's Calc I class a long time ago. Years have passed and I still see reviews that mirror the horror of my Calculus class. Avoid him at all costs. I dropped his class and retook it with another professor... took that professor for most of my other math courses.. Got A's in all of them.,0
"She is a pretty good professor. There is a lot of discussion in the class so go over the assigned readings. 1 paper, 6 pop quizzes, 2 tests. She is always willing to help you during office hours and she offers extra credit! The class covers a lot of controversial and interesting issues.",1
"If you're looking to actually learn about literature, don't take this class. Its structure consists of games that have nothing to do with the pieces you're learning about. Dr. Lawrence is the least helpful professor; he lets the students run amok 75% of the semester. And all you do is group work, so if you're an introvert, its that much worse.",0
Its not a easy intro level course but she really is the most amazing lecturer. She really makes all the stuff in the class fit together. The tests are essays but they are COMPLETELY based on lectures so its doable. There is also alot of extra credit.,1
"With the workload you would think this was a 300+ level course. She is also always emphasizing her grading system (which is a harsh system) I personally would not take her again. Dont think its easy just because its online, that isnt true at all. Take a better Professor and get the grade you deserve",0
"This man was awesome. He was a super nice guy, kind of qwerky, but probably the best professor I've had in a while. While he did his best to make the class interesting, it could get boring every now and then. However, Mr. Todd always did his best to help you succeed, and I would take him again in a heartbeat.",1
"His exams are open note, so if you take good notes you're golden.  He is one of my top five all-time favorite professors.",1
"If you show up, you'll be fine. However, just warning you that the tests are a bit difficult. If you are on top of your assignments, you will be fine. Just know that the tests are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.",0
Best ENC professor at BC!,1
"very nice woman, tends to ramble about things we will learn later in the bio sequence instead of explaining what we are learning. If you use the web site that comes with the book it will be easy if not you will have to read every bit of every chapter. also she uses the 3rd edition we have the newest edition either 5 or 6",0
She is fabulous.  She's makes marketing interesting and she knows what she is talking about.  The material is tough but she makes it managable.  She's got a great sense of humor and makes it worth going to class.,1
"He is very well informed and is always talking about current events. This man is woke!! There is like 8 one and half pages essay you write every other week, a midterm, group project, book report, and final. As long as you listen to his lectures its a pretty easy class. 10/10 recommend!",1
"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",0
Tom D'Angelo is a great person and professor. You can tell he really loves what he teaches and cares for his students. I wish more professors were like him! Always open to a discussion and never judgmental about your opinions. Homework is one weekly journal done from the textbook readings. Just show up and read and you will do great!,1
Really mean for no reason,0
"For a speech teacher, she is very nice and helpful.",1
"Ignore the rating beforehand. Deadlines are all on math lab, why would you ""expect"" extended deadlines? She provides you with power points, my mathlab, and is literally always there to help. Open notes on everything, in exchange for hw you can legit complete in class. I got an A and it was the best class I've ever taken, she cares.",1
"Mi-Sook is by far the best professor I have ever had. It takes a while to get used to her strict grading, but she will go above and beyond to help you when you ask. She cares about students on a personal level and truly wants each person to do their best. Her high expectations are a reflection of her interest in student's learning.",1
"She would try to engage the class, but I don't think teaching is her strong point. The online Cengage program is ridiculous, the textbook reads like it's catered towards high schoolers, but the material in the exams online is nothing like what we learned. I barely passed them, despite having a strong interest and background in abnormal psychology.",0
Mr. Wilbrandt was one of my favorite teachers at AU. Was never that interested in ECON but he tried to make class as interesting. Always made sure his students understood the material and if not would always be willing to meet with you. He held study sessions before each test that helped a lot. Tests and quizzes are easy if you put in the time.,1
"Professor Okten was a very caring professor, and it was evident that he wanted everyone to understand the material. Though the lectures were remote, he did a stellar job of explaining the concepts to the class. Some of the assignments were graded a bit tough, but he did a good job of explaining why things were graded how they were. Would recommend.",1
"I had Mr. F-M for ENC 1101 and 1102, and I enjoyed having him as a teacher for both classes! He is very clear on the requirements of the assignment and gives good feedback on the rough drafts. He is very comical and is understanding when it comes to stress level, especially during finals and midterms. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Great Professor, very fair and helpful.",1
No Comments,1
I absolutely do not recommend her! Online class is terrible! Gave tons of assignments at beginning of semester without any kind of discussion/lecture. Never replied to emails. Kept saying her computer was broken when the students went to her in person. It's midway through the semester and still no contact? Please! Try using other excuses!,0
"Great prof! Does lots of examples in class, which are very helpful when studying. His notes a great and he's really helpful if you ask. Easy to understand.",1
"JP is a perfect example of someone who can't ""do"", so they teach instead. He is totally inept when it comes to software development and loves to tell you what the ""industry"" is doing, when it's not only completely inaccurate but it's laughable, he's never worked a day in his life in the private sector. Avoid, he's hard to understand and childish.",0
"This Professor loves her students, she will make sure you get the most out of her class even if it means answering all your questions until you understand. The only thing with her is that YOU will have to let her know what your problems and I know she will explain it. AWESOME PROFESSSOR!!!!!",1
Very helpful. Knows what he's talking about. A professional in his field. Very funny,1
Such a good English class. Was my first class English class of college and was a breeze. 4 essays over the semester along with a well defined Syllabus. She explains things clearly and her tests are easy as long as you pay attention. Make sure to read for the book for reading quizzes. Loved her and would take again.,1
"Margarita is a great teacher.  She has passion for the Spanish language and is very sweet.  She wants questions and answers them very clearly.  Expect online homework every night, usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.  Three very short papers due over the term, most had to be 200 words all in spanish.  Would take her again.",1
"You always know exactly what she expects out of you. Clear guidelines and you can revise. Although, if you do the outlines that she gives you, you shouldn't have to revise much.",1
never take his class never!,0
"He is by no means a bad prof, but I will never take him again if possible. He gives you all the exam questions before hand so as long as you study those you will be fine. Most of class is spent on tangents, and had to rush through most material because of it. Since attendance was mandatory this made coming to class difficult.",0
"She is the best teacher and best mentor that I could ever have!!! I've taken her for 3 classes (including an internship). She really cares about her students and takes the time aside to sit down with you an figure out what to do, whether it is for life in general or for the class.",1
Roopa does not provide as much help as other professors do. She dont lecture enough and many students were failing/failed her course. Do not take her unless you want to fail.,0
be careful!!he deducts points on your exams even though you do them the right way.,0
"Not very helpful. He doesn't respond to any students e-mails for help. Also he hands homework back extremely late, so you are not sure if you are doing all of the problems correctly. He seems like a nice guy, but I wish he would explain things in class and show some initiative towards his students.",0
Extremely helpful and fun.  Highly recommend taking her classes.,1
Not clear on grading and basically impossible to get an A. You can follow feedback after feedback and never be given higher than a B unless she likes you. For our final project she didn't have any feedback and nobody got more than a low A no matter what. Seems impossible to please.,0
"The only reason students take Dr. Jones for genetics is because she is the only one who teaches genetics (most of the times). Nobody I have ever met has anything good to say for her at all. Her arrogance is all over her face, the way she talks, and the way she answers your questions. Why do I need to buy Tophat when I just spent $250 buying books?",0
His like so like gr8 like I've learned like so much from him its totally like LITTTTT,1
Emails long reading assignments/outlines an hour before class with many unused pages for you to print out. Doesn't go in depth more than social mobility of a specific time period. Avoid teacher at all costs.,0
"Professor Makover is probably one of the worst professor I have ever come in contact with, barely explains stuff in class and runs over it very quickly with no examples. He refers to our knowledge and compares it to 4th and 5th graders, even though I have heard him say multiple times that ""Our knowledge is probably better than his.""",0
"Amy inspired me to pursue a major in Bioethics after taking her class. The material is very interesting and her lecture style is clear, easy to listen to. She is very approachable and understanding, so many students engage in the conversation in her class, she sets up the perfect environment for productive discussion.",1
"This class is not easy A class anymore, because recently she changed her lecture. Such as finish minimum 2800 words 12 pages report paper in a week and 20 pages reporting paper for final. unless you love to write reporting paper, I am not recommended this class.",0
"Took terrorism and Contemporary . Amazing lecturer and kept me engaged and interested. Work is really not that hard if you go to class and pay attention to his anecdotes on the readings. Honestly,  I skimmed the books and got A's in both classes since he goes over books in great detail in class. Very interesting classes. Pop quizzes but small %. ",1
"He is the worse instructor I have ever had, he will not email back because it is a hassle. Doesn't really understand english and really don't think he knows anything about the powerpoints that he uses!",0
"Honors Humanities. Dr. Osborne is so-so. Assigns lots of readings over Plato, Aristotle, etc. and has class discussions over the material. He's very knowledgeable and makes discussion fun, but it's often dominated by a few students. The only homework you have is a midterm paper, research project, and a final paper. Interesting, but quite difficult.",1
"It is very difficult to learn just from lectures. Does not allow electronics in class meaning , no laptop to take notes. Goes over slides too quickly and cannot finish taking notes. Uploads unit notes on the class before exams. If you're stuck with her class isn't mandatory. You will learn more from the book.",0
mrs. jafroodi is really nice and very helpful in class. so far i am enjoying being in her class!!,1
"She is a great teacher. Her class is well organized and she stays on point.  The assignments are clear, and if you don't understand she will help you. However, she is a tough grader you have to try hard for an A.",1
Do not take his class! You will regret it. ,0
"Dr. Ba is a fairly descent professor If you don't mind reading alot. He is fairly easy on grading if you do yoUr homework and study for tests he gives you sample test there is no way you will walk out without a B or A. However his lectures are dry, read off power points, and he has thick accent that sometimes is hard to understand.",0
"Very knowledgeable and has accomplished much in her scholarship. Makes every attempt to engage the class, usually with success. The work-load is heavy, but manageable. Both classes I've taken with her have been valuable experiences, and I would recommend her as a professor. She's very understanding, and willing to hear your concerns.",1
"really hard to understand. he moves very fast with out giving alot of examples. there are alot of office hours, but when you go if you don't understand something he seems mad at you. test was 6 questions, 2 mc, 2 put in order, and two worth 25 points each...stay away!!!!",0
this class was easy for me I made 90's on all of my papers the class are long and boring but shes not very strict to when it comes to drafts and final drafts she worries more about the final paper ,1
I am not a science person but I'm so glad I took my science courses with Christy. She was so patient with helping me understand each lesson. Her lectures were so thorough and clear! I would deff recommend her!!!,1
His exams are really hard no matter how much you study you still fail. Dreaded going to his class. He is nice but hard.,0
"She is very knowledgeable about pediatric material and her power points are very clear.  She expects you to read the book but only the parts that she discusses in the power points and she gives you hints throughout the class on what might show up on the test.  Very fair tests!  Great professor, I wish all the nursing profs were like her!",1
"I get really good grades, but this class was extremely hard. Her lectures on powerpoint are not clear. She jumps around from slide to slide w/o telling you what chapter she's on. She goes very fast in lecture and it is impossible to take notes. Erases everything after talking about it. Doesn't answer emails for help. Class test avg is in 50's.",0
Every class was spent going over the previous class homework which took away time from the lesson.  No work sheets giving which I would have liked.  Overall she worked with you if you had problems.,0
He does not teach well,0
Great at explaining complex ideas one step at a time so they are easy to understand! Also very helpful in labs. Beware the final exam is quite long and difficult but for some reason you only get 2 hours for it.,1
"Fantastic attitude. Simplifies anatomy in words you can grasp. She will take the time to explain it until you fully get the concept, no judgement. Personable, 10/10 recommend",1
"Pros: - She gives full credit on late assignments. - Difficulty is easy, except for the midterm and final. - She is helpful. Cons: - Her explanation and details on assignments and projects are vague. - If you're having technical difficulty on your assignment, she can't help you.",1
"I struggled with understanding Dr. Stewart's teaching and he wasn't able to understand questions very well when asked. He also struggled with professionalism with students. Lecture was not very helpful, and the few times I tried to get help outside of class were not benificial. He did end up curving a lot on exams to make the grades more normal.",0
I would highly recommend this professor. He is great at what he does. I have never enjoyed an english class as much as I did sitting in Mr. Hetricks class.,1
"Her grading system made it difficult to see where you are on grades until it's too late. Harsh and slow grader. Her general HW grade and Attendance grade seems made up and not based on anything but her opinion. She expects a lot from you, cancels class often and expects us to be understanding of her but she is not understanding of the student.",0
"Best Chem Prof I have ever had. HW is 20%- He prepares you well in class, but sometimes you have to dig deep into the book. ACS final--he prepares you excellent with his tests. Make sure you know why you got each Q wrong. 5% EC just fro reading the book before his lecture. I received a very high A  just by attending each class & group studying",1
Tavss is an awesome professor. He puts a lot of time and effort into his lectures study guides. Do ALL the practice exam problems he puts online. The study guides practice exams are very helpful and essential to get a good grade. You can skip the book problems (not helpful) and skim the readings but COMPLETE ALL PRACTICE EXAMS ONLINE!,1
Dr Avila is a very awesome professor! She teaches the subject very well in a slow pace. Take advantage of the extra credit given to you. You have a quiz every time you meet. The questions from the quizzes show up on the exams. Study! Very hilarious professor!,1
Dr. Holgado is an incredible professor. If you show up to every class and you do the work and out in effort she will not let you fail. She genuinely cares about all of her students. She offers TONS of bonus points. She is also always available to help you outside of class if you need it.,1
DO NOT EVER SIGN UP FOR THIS PROFESSOR. He is not interesting or interested. He will not work with you. He thinks the only reason you exist is for his class. There were massive withdrawals for my class. I am an A+ student and I was getting C-. DO NOT BELIEVE THE OTHER COMMENTS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.,0
"A lot of work!  He is not hot, the girls like him b/c he is mad flaming.",0
"Dr. Falvo (Doc) is simply the greatest instructor I’ve had. You can treat him more as a friend than a professor, and you can expect the same from him. Very talented performer.  Mistakes not a part of his vocabulary. He will help you about personal stuff and assumes the mentor role for his students.",1
"I would suggest any other professor for this course. Ridiculously confusing, and as someone else stated, it's more about writing styles of papers. I didn't learn a thing. ",0
Great teacher. Really cares. Would take again,1
"He is a great lecturer, and has so much energy that it almost wakes up the whole class. The lectures are very note heavy, but it is not at all hard to keep up. There were a lot of quizzes, but they weren't really that bad, and as long as you study the notes or read the corresponding book sections, the exams are pretty straight forward.",1
"His class is not for ""average"" CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you're forced to take him, Good Luck!",0
"The main issue with this professor isn't his teaching style or course content but the fact that he always sounds angry. I don't think he's actually mad, but it's hard to feel comfortable in a class where the teacher's normal speaking volume is shouting. Expect to spend a lot of time on the labs and homework. The exams were very straight-forwards.",0
"This is a GREAT class to take, especially if you're working a lot. The slideshows are posted online, and the bulk of the quiz material is there. The lectures are optional to show up to, but they're really good, so I recommend showing up if you can, even though it isn't necessary. Prof. Law is very sympathetic and accepts late work/make-up quizzes.",1
Dr. Ghosh is a really terrific teacher. She makes it easy to follow the course material online and has a easy to follow timeline for everything in the semester. She answers emails back quickly and usually with a good deal of explanation. She is very fair.,1
"this teacher doesn't tell you how to do anything. she just expects it done the way she wants it!! dont miss anyclassed or youll get 0 points. BORING CLASS...bring a pillow. shes teaching about teaching, yet shes not teaching!!",0
Feedback is not helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking him.,0
"She is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. I had to switch majors and I was not looking forward to the classes I was required to take; she made me love my new major. She brings in her own real life experiences and you never want her to stop telling her stories. She makes you work hard, but it will helps you become a better doctor.",1
She is one of the most inappropriate and careless professors I have ever met. She is careless and doesnt care about her students. Take take her classes,0
"I really enjoyed taking this professor, she was very supportive on feedback for our writing assignments. I really hated english classes but after taking this professor she made me feel like its not to bad after all. I really recommend to take her!",1
"Avoid at all costs. Refused to answer students questions on designated exam review days, because he ""didnt know if the questions would work out"". Lectures last an average of 20 minutes",0
"This instructor is terrible.  She expects you to know everything, which is impossible.  Print outs are useless because they only list general terms with no information so you never know what your surposed know. Has good intentions, but not a good teachers.  Lots of essay questions, be prepared if taking this class.",0
"Online classes beware- You can tell immediately that the online classes are neglected as he is too busy to be engaged. Emails were responded a week and a half later . Poor English and grammar, how is he a grad teacher? His criticism levels are unprofessional and unhelpful. One of the worst professors I've ever had in my academic career.",0
"I don't think it matters how hard you study- in taking her tests I used information from her slides, the textbook, and information from other class textbooks and still received below a B on all exams. She doesn't tell you what you did wrong, just takes marks off. She can't use technology and trails off in the middle of her sentences.",0
"Took this class two years ago about technology and education, lesson design and assessments. The professor drew on a broad variety personal case studies from his elementary school teaching days to broaden your understanding on best practices for 21st Century classroom.",1
Not very intresting. Reads off powerpoint. Often gets things wrong. Exams are difficult.,0
"Worst class I've ever taken. She was not a good teacher, and had a horrible TA who she let control almost all of our grade. When we complained that the TA was giving us horrible grades with no explination she just said ""you will have to take that up with him."" Horrible teacher, horrible class. I'm a straight A student and withdrew. WAST OF TIME.",0
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Rude and unprofessional. If you don't already basically have a masters degree in physics he is going to make you feel stupid. Doesn't care about his students or their comprehension of the material.,0
"He knows his stuff, but he is very arrogant. If you don't know something he will put you down and say you shouldn't be out in public not knowing the answer. He gives a ridiculous amount of work, so don't try to take this class as an elective or if you are busy. He comes across as nice, but send him an email for help and you won't get any.",0
"I took her Black Sci Fi class a year ago, and it was so incredible that she easily became my favorite English professor. All her analysis are amazingly detailed/structured, and I'm always awed by what she manages to pull out of texts. Not for everyone, but if you're looking for a professor who actually discusses race, you can't go wrong w/ Serpell.",1
"Professor McConkey is a great guy! I definitely recommend this class for the Religion Ged Ed requirement. It's not difficult, but the material is interesting and he is so flexible and understanding. Read the powerpoints and come to class at least once a week and you will ace this class!",1
Very nice and helpful. Exams are kind of hard but gives a lot of extra credit. Overall can be an easy A class if you do the work.,1
she makes differential equations harder than it needs to be. her grading is very strict with not a ton of partial credit. the tests are very difficult to finish in the 50 minutes she gives. when you ask her questions that arent in her notes she gets confused so it seems she doesnt fully understand the material,0
"an easy course, if you don't listen to the professor.  I just took all of my notes from the book and answered any questions she had in class, and I ended up getting a really easy A",1
"Great teacher, easy class, read books and material. She is very helpful as long as you are willing to work. Will make time to work with you.",1
"Labeled an MBIOS course, but MBIOS was not addressed. This course should be listed as sociology/anthropology. The class only discussed topics like poverty, women's rights, and mental trauma. Teacher assigns a ludicrous amount of reading and writing. You WILL spend every night typing papers and reading about topics not related to MBIOS. Awful class",0
"I personally hate this class. The layout of the class makes no sense. The countries are scattered and the order is not related. He constantly talks about the ""Universal Pattern of Culture"" which is in no other academic source online or otherwise. The only source I have found that has anything similar contrasts his definitions completely.",0
Marek would be easier to comprehend if he stopped taking English lessons from E.T.,0
"You go in blind to all of the exams and final. There is no study guide. When asked, she does not even divulge how many questions there will be and if it is multiple choice. All she says is that whatever is in the book, lecture or previous courses is fair game. It is a incredibly difficult class and extinguished my interest in accounting. ",0
A bit eccentric at times but excellent teacher. Thinks fast.,1
"She's a very nice person but terrible professor. All we ever did was critiques, which are important, however she has given us hardly any instruction and is very harsh when it comes to critiquing.",0
"His class really prepares you for a career in reporting. The work load can be fairly heavy, since you are assigned stories that you have to collect interviews for and write an article. He is very accessible and helpful. His lectures can be a bit dry, but he can be funny at times. He really makes you a better writer.",1
Debbie is my home girl and an excellent facilitator,1
"She is very quick to get smart with you.  Her work doesnt make sense, she expects things that are sooooo stupid to be crystal clear. if you leave class early, she takes off points. No book....cant enter class.  its like high school...even worse, middle school.",0
"Instructor was inaccessible all semester, checked in once a week in a 6 week course, which led to a lot of assignments with no submit links, or being posted the day before they were due. Assignments are convoluted busy work, that she grades harshly for something she isn't available for questions about. Students had to answer each others ? instead.",0
I loved this class! Very interesting.He's a great Professor in Philosophy. He was clear and concise in his lectures. I would definitely take another class taught by him.,1
"Too much reading. Every session, get ready for a quiz (single multiple choice question). I understand that the reading are for our knowledge but she gave too much reading (two books for a one meeting). If you dont know how to manage those, you will fail. Exams are essay type and not so hard. TA are nice and helpful.",0
"He's a nice guy but not a very good teacher, went to lectures during the beginning of the semester but stopped because they're confusing and often irrelevant to tests. You'll do far better in the class if you use the textbook and the assignments and lab manual questions he posts.",0
"Whispers during lecture, have to read the entire book to study for a test because you can't understand a thing he says.",0
"Dr. Lorimer is a great professor. I took her online and I thought it was going to be tough but honestly it wasn't she is straight forward in her syllabus and she is there if you need the help. 3 essays, peer reviews, discussion questions",1
"Randomly jumps years,religions,people,topics. ",0
"Really hard to understand, mostly because he talks so fast and his accent just adds to it. He keeps his tests the same from previous years... His part of the final is hard and once again most of it was the exact same from the previous year.",0
WORST professor I had at BSU. Had to leave a 3hr lecture 10 minutes early for work and she called me out in front of class. Not accepting of non traditional students. Emailed her privately about a pregnancy that I wouldve liked to keep private but she talked loudly about it immediately after class in front of everyone & asked if it was planned.,0
Dustin is the BEST professor anyone will ever have at WSU. He understands the material and knows how to teach it. If you are having a difficult time he is more than willing to work with you. Gives helpful tips for exams and goes through many example problems to help you prepare. Having trouble in other engineering courses? Hes the one to talk to!,1
"I took this course as a post-bac student and I just don't recommend to take it over the summer, much less with him.  As others before me have said, yes he does have a DEEP accent.  Yes, his tests are hard.  Yes, he goes through his lectures WAY too fast (which is why you NEED the textbook).  He is not great at scanning the room for raised hands. ",0
"She's a sweetheart. There are a lot of group projects in the class but they are all done in class and are super easy. Tests are common sense stuff, stuff you've probably learned in high school. Just pay attention in class or she'll call you out in front of everyone. She clearly loves what she is teaching and that makes the class even better.",1
Really kind and is open to helping students. Weekly readings and at home 2 question quizzes. Midterm and final are very clear and open note. Definitely a top choice for a teacher.,1
"This teacher is really hard to understand, the way he teaches makes the subject matter harder to explain than necessary.  He adds steps that go beyond the basics of this class and goes more into higher end math like calculus",0
"Assigns an absurd amount of reading before class; often in between 10-20 cases. The course consists of regurgitation of 170 cases for which you need to memorize case names, holding, facts, rationale, importance, etc. Never accessible outside of class and doesnt care about student success. Teaching is fair at best.",0
Jana is an excellent teacher.  There is no guessing with her.  She tells you exactly what she expects.  Her tests were over her notes.  The group activities were fun and her assignments were few but definitely a learning experiance.  I highly recommend any class with her.,1
"He is very interesting although he is very confusing...He is a liberal and I'm a republican but when I voiced my opinions, I thought he was very respectfully and would listen to my side of the issue",0
Very rude teacher. Never gives a direct answer when you ask a question.  The work isn't hard but I don't like being treated like a 16/17 year old.  It's a lot of work but not hard. She gets really mad when you don't attend class. Not worth the stress for me.,0
"She's a lovely lady who loves to talk about her life. Lessons are clear, all you need to do is take notes. Tests are easy.",1
"If I could give Dr. Brown a 0, I would. He is by far the worst instructor I have EVER had. This was an asynchronous class, so there was no live lectures through Zoom, just videos he posted on the website. The lectures weren't helpful and he always rambled, never going back to the info that was important. Didn't give partial credit on the exams.",0
"Love Dr. Record! Really easy class, just show up and participate a couple of times. The group projects can be a pain but if you complete them with effort this class is an easy 4.0",1
Wouldn't recommend this professor.. Dry boring lectures and exams did not correlate to anything we did. Quizzes were nearly impossible. Do not take this professor unless you are very skilled in acct,0
"This class was a challenge, his lectures were interesting and understandable but not really exactly what you can expect on the test...TEST ARE REALLY HARD...I havent completed the course yet but Im praying for aleast a ""C""...if you want to learn than take this course,you cant slack at all....no room to,oh attendence isnt mandatory but still attend!",0
"By far the worst professor Ive taken at uno. Gives only grades for 2 test and a final, no homework grades and no quizzes. The test are 2 questions. Doesnt explain his notes and expects you to know the material already. Dont think you can ask questions in class because he gets mad he has to answer your question. 0/10 dont recommend",0
"I took Dan's class in 2018-2019, best professor ever. Was very helpful. He does not skip steps, very through with his work. I miss his class.",1
Terrible person. lot's of HW. Does not explain the materials.,0
"Mr Phelps is probably one of the worst professors I've had.  Leave it to Phelps to start working on Test 4 material before you even take Test 3 (yeah, he does that).  If you ask him for help or clarification he says ""Ask someone else."" He has the assumption that everyone on earth loves art as much as he does. Beware of Mr Phelps",0
"Class is easy, but boring.  Tests are really easy.  Lots of PowerPoints and movie clips. He does not get to know the students so do not be surprised if he has no idea what your name is until the last week of the semester.  He does check attendance daily, and if  you miss 6 days, you lose a whole letter grade. Miss 9, you get a D, miss 10 and FAIL!!",0
"She would go over a few key points during lecture so they were helpful. However, when she said the tests questions were based off of the test in the order they appear, she wasn't kidding. READ! Covid-19 was difficult for everybody, unfortunately she kept having her lectures corrupted or had technical difficulties.",1
"Get the Skooler's packet and you'll be golden. Skoolers is harder than what is on the actual exam so once you get to the exam you are more than prepared. There is a cheat sheet 3x5 flashcard for the 3 exams. Homework assignment due every Sunday and at the end of the semester gives extra credit. Cool guy, and Jon from skoolers is the BEST.",1
Weird teacher! She makes us do the most random essay topics and makes little sense when explaining them. She grades hard based on if she likes what you wrote about not on structure or style. The classes are pointless she reads out of a book or someone's essay. There are only 3 papers and a notebook and thats ur grade. Get someone better if possible,0
"The poor guy is an open book. His insecurities, in reguards to intellect, are quite apparent. It really shows in his pompous, arrogant, and jugemental behavior. I think Steve would benefit from a good self evaluation before classes begin in the spring.",0
"Tests did not reflect anything that was taught in lecture, you are better off learning all the material off of YouTube. He hardly responds to emails and when he does he answers vaguely. He also emails you in the middle of tests to correct his own errors in the creation of the test. He Is not willing to work with students with questions.",0
"He is a nice guy, but admits the first day that he is monotoned and prepares us for a boring course.  His quizzes are hard for the pure fact that there is so much material to cover for a 10 question quiz.  He isn't helpful outside of class and is very hard to get ahold of. DONT TAKE. Take learning!!!!",0
"This profesor is one of the best I have had at UM. She cares and is very understanding. Took this class in the summer, online during the pandemic and it was the best experience. There was a lot to read, some easy some hard about Post Colonial. The subject is a bit boring but discussion boards and 3 essays were required. She is very flexible.",1
"She was expected you to know everything in class. When you visit her office hour, she just shows you the rubric she gave, and let you read about that. I would not recommend her unless you want to write discussions (600 words) + survey per weeks + weekly quiz, and 12 pgs (2800 words) for midterm and 24 pgs (4500 words) for the final+final exam.",1
He thinks his students know the same things as he does! does a poor job explaining anything in detail. wouldn't take him again and his tests are hard!,0
"If you took Intro to Chem in HS prior to this class, you might want to reconsider! There is loads of homework (online, texbook, lab, etc.) & so much money to be spent all on supplies for the class. Easy grading if you do all the work, but 4 midterms is NOT it. She expects you to memorize absolutely everything. Had to drop due to too much stress!",0
"Dr Hunter is the best math teacher I have ever had. He may move fast but he never hesitates to make sure everyone is understanding his lesson. He takes the time to give many examples as well. Just make sure after every lesson you keep up with the homework. If you struggle with math like I do, he is the teacher to take. Ps Makes math class bearable.",1
"One of the best profs I have ever had. Especially during the pandemic, she was super understanding and very lenient. Grades consist of 3 exams, 1 very easy project where you have the choice to work alone or with a partner/group and weekly quizzes. The exams were very easy just study the lecture slides and there's no textbook.",1
"She is the coolest teacher, she is such a funny person.",1
"Only three grades in the whole class: a midterm essay, a final essay, and participation. Make sure you speak up because he takes participation very seriously. In general, the class work was not difficult. We read short stories and poems and then wrote an essay on them.  You can tell that he really does know what he's talking about, which is great.",1
She's very unclear and doesn't give specific instructions. You have to beg her for help. ,0
"SHE IS A CRAZY PROFESSOR, SHE THINK THAT  THE STUDENTS DOES NOT WORK SHE GIVES A LOT WORK TO DOING FOR EXAMPLE  TWO PAPER PER WEEK, PLEASE STUDENTS DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF DONT WANT BECOME A CRAZY STUDENT",0
"Intelligent and cares about the subject matter, but dull and not very class-aware--doesn't give the students enough time to take notes on his slides. He also made a comment about Africa creating more waste than the USA because it's 'underdeveloped', a fact that is both false and ignorant.",0
"Bob is an amazing professor. His passion for writing shines through his lectures, which makes class very entertaining. He's a professor who truly cares about his students and the uniqueness of each student's writing. I had him for W301 and it was easily my favorite class in college. If you love writing, you'll love his class. Guaranteed.",1
"Taylor is fine. I took her during her first semester teaching, and she is still a little rough around the edges. She's a very nice woman and helps students if they ask for it. Feel comfortable enrolling in her class.",1
This was my first online class ever and I absolutely loved it! Prof Zaranek was extremely helpful and always responded to questions I had. You have to post at least 175+ word response for each discussion board which is not that hard and then reply to two other students. Gives an easy essay every other week. She is super nice and understandable!,1
Eng 1/28: A good professor but the class can be boring! she gives a lot of busy work for homework and we take quizzes on the readings a lot. only one book required and you write and essay on it and you need to read it in order to do good on the quiz too. Lots of writing. Only allowed 3 absences given. you have to work to get the A but possible.,1
"Extremely dry, makes everything unnecessarily confusing, and does not adequately prepare you for tests. She turns an interesting subject matter into pure torture. Does not care about student success. I didn't understand a single thing happening in this class.",0
"I thought she was pretty good. Her lectures are kinda boring. I didnt read the textbook, just do her study guides because its basically the same as the test (I usually found the study guide answers on a quizlet)She says shes a hard grader but I got As on both the papers we had to write. Go to class bc she gives random extra credit!!",1
"Ruder is not an engaging professor but he's learned to be somewhat helpful and has made the class obnoxiously easy. He doesn't expect much from you. Do ALL the homework, easy points and gives you a basic understanding. Also the practice tests were *identical* to the actual test. Take it with him to get it done if you're not a BMIS concentration.",1
"I loved Mr. Marsh, these classes were very hard, a lot of studying and an amazing amount of homework, but these classes are hard in general. Marsh has been my favorite teacher so far in my 2 years at Clark, he is understanding, flexible and will help anyone. I had fun during labs, lectures are a bit tough, but it was very worth it in the end. ",1
"I took Spanish for 2 years in high school and passed with A's and B's. So when I had to take a language for my degree requirement, I thought Spanish would be a breeze. Boy was I WRONG! Even with my prior knowledge I was confused and he moves very quickly. SO MANY ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS. He takes points off if you don't show up (even when you are sick)",0
"Very inattentive professor, extremely lecture heavy, doesn't make eye contact with students, horrible at explaining content, very strict grader, tests have nothing to do with textbook reading or what he presents in lecture. He expects you to be an expert before having taking this class. I strongly advise you to find a different physics professor.",0
She is a fantastic teacher and it is very evident that she cares about students success and loves the field she works in. The group projects are easy A's. There is a review before every exam that earns you extra credit on the exam. Shes provides a study guide for every exam. She also looks like Pam from the Office. Good for non science majors.,1
She had a participation grade where we were required to participate in lecture at least once a week to get the full credit. The final was very difficult and different from other exams,1
"She's a good professor, who really cares. I learned a lot in her class. She is very knowledgeable in the law field.  I found her to be reasonable and fair.  The workload is challenging. I would love to take another class with her.",1
Go to class. Her exam was way different than what I studied. Had I gone t class I would have known. Overall her exams are tough. She doesn't curve which is unfair considering hw low the averages are.,0
"You will have homework due every day, but it is pretty easy and he usually gives most of the answers in class the day before. Goes over everything you need to know. The material is surprisingly easy if you pay attention. Tests are too long though. Most people run out of time. Too much reading and writing. Nice and funny guy though.",1
Sister Kirkham is by far one of my favorite professors i've ever had! She is always willing to help you in the course and she brings the spirit to class every time! She teaches through personal experience and tries to make the work less difficult. I learned so much from her course and from her that It changed my outlook on life completely!,1
Thinks he's smarter than he really is.  Not impressed at all.,0
"Very good professor, he is the ECE department chair, and for good reason. Genuinely cares about students, puts effort into both classroom and research, not always personally available for office hours (because of his other duties as department head), but has excellent TAs to make up for it. Tough grader but gives extra credit to make up for it.",1
"MOST BORING PERSON TO EVER LIVE. monotone lectures are better than white noise for sleeping, reads the textbook, and does exercises, no initiative to ask students if they're learning, don't even read the chat if people have questions! HW and Exams are via 3rd party. no need to attend cuz he can care less how many ppl join, hell teach an empty class",0
"The best English teacher Ive had. I struggled in English classes in HS because essays had to be on how works were written(ex use of literary devices),not what they were saying/about. This class was about understanding the works and responding to the aspects of them that engaged us. Nice,grades leniently,+accepts late work,but you gotta read+work!",1
"Best prof I've ever had. He is amazing. So smart and funny. He's not really tough on attendence but there is a quiz almost everyday over the reading. Not hard if you read the bible. I've learned so much about the New Testiment because he knows so much. Great man of God, I wish I could a class with him every semester",1
"he definitely knows nothing about teaching a class!!! his class is no use at all, and the lecture is just reading from the material. never teaches anything useful, the lecture and the homework and quiz has nothing related!!! definitely do not take his class ever and ever!!!! the worst teacher in this University!!!",0
"UI100 is a blow off class, everyone knows it, except for her. She thinks this class is the most important thing in the world. You have at least 6 pages of homework from her workbook every period. She talks about how great of a teacher she is and how the students are stupid for not preparing for other classes. She thinks she's funny, she's not.",0
"She is really into the topics and If you're not into it (most probably aren't) do not take her. She is a touch grader and has quizzes every class, a map quiz, midterm, in class writing essay, and a final. She is not approachable and a lil rude. The worst part of class is when she asks difficult questions and calls out people at the end of lectures.",0
"She is very rude. This class is boring and she doesn't answer questions when you ask. She gives smart remarks.  The work is not hard but she treats everyone like they are 17 and I am not.  If you can handle a rude teacher, the work is fine. Pointless though.",0
Unreasonably timed quizzes randomly.,0
Alyssa is awesome She set a great atmosphere within the classroom and made it really fun. However she DOES make you work for your grade but it''s still really fun because the topic are intriguing. ,1
"Dr. Hays made this class interesting and fun. He helped us understand the basics of developmental psychology with interesting discussions. He does not post grades, which can be stressful.",1
gives little to no instruction on the labs you are doing. extremely tough grader. I will never take her again.,0
"Professor Ramamoorthy is not a very good teacher. His accent is very thick and hard to understand, he's very unclear about the assignments even when you clearly ask him, and it's hard to get anything done in his class. Lectures are boring and the labs are torture. He's an easy grader and gives out an extra 5% if you attend every lecture and lab.",0
"If you ask anything other than an amazing question, he will publicly fry you in front of everyone. There might be 1 or 2 homework assignments in the semester. He assigns a 5 question essay quiz every Friday to be completed online by Monday. You will have 3 online exams and one final exam in class. Hes not horrible, though. I got a good grade ",0
Not too bad of a class.  He is very good to us students,1
"You feel like you are in elementary school (color coded groups...etc.) bad first impression, yet she expects high quailty work! Lots of HW online. (time consuming)!!! I studied all the time and would do terrible on tests.  She did offer EC towards the end of sem though.  If you like to teach yourself take this class!!",0
"By far the best prof I have run into in my opinion! Easy grader and is very open to giving feedback and help! She has been a sweetheart from day one, and the lectures might get boring but they are 100% straightforward! She can also help you in advising for an Anthropology major and is great at that too! Overall a wonderful prof and person!",1
"Lots of her ""stories"" were full of inaccurate facts. She is not the sharpest tool in the drawer...likes to talk about herself too much...boring.. teaches diversity class too, as if we need that info any more.  It's 2010 Ms. Rogers...we know their are other races, we just all want to be the same now...",0
He doesnt understand what the average person already knows. Bio 101 means you have to explain concepts like DNA and cell division. He expects you to be familiar with concepts without teaching them first.,0
"Give her the time of day in her class and she will ensure you succeed. She is the most caring and helpful instructor I have ever had, her professionalism and empathy make class enjoyable and she makes the content relevant. Work hard for her and she will work hard to see you succeed.",1
"Professor Kiesewetter is very good at explaining chemistry. She definitely knows what she is talking about and is very dedicated to the success of her students. CHM101 was mostly review for me because I took chemistry in high school, but she made me understand the new concepts. There are 4 exams and then the final. They are all fair not too long.",1
if you think your gonna go in this class and take exams on Jazz History your not.  All 5 of your exams will be on distinguishing what type of jazz you are listening to. not easy because in class ALL he talks about is the history which is not on exam. So u teach yourself from vids on blackboard! If your not a music major avoid! Extra cred impossible,0
"Professor Fan is a very good professor. She is an expert in her field and her passion for teaching is incredible. The course is a bit difficult, but she is always there to help. Class consists of 4 tests, 4 homework assignments, and 1 case paper. Overall a pretty easy class just need to put in the effort.",1
"Awful! Wouldnt recommend to anyone. No help outside of class. Has an agenda and wont slow down to help students. Knows her content but isnt there to teach, just there to collect a pay check.",0
"This was a good class. All the information was on PPT, and those were online. Most readings you could just Google, but for ease of access get the course packet. Group work was meh, but it was a short one. Aizura was a great professor. He was critical and to-the-point, yet enjoyable even at 9am in the morning. Take good notes and show up  A.",1
"He wants to help students learn, but expects much too high a level of understanding for a 100 level class. The exams are VERY difficult (average student getting under 40%)and require a much deeper level of understanding than the homework. Harsh grader. I would avoid his class at all cost unless you can do vector calc in your sleep.",0
I took the 8 week course and it was FAST! You just have to stay on track by following his assignments schedule and due dates. He was really good!! I would take his class again but not the 8 week course..,1
i knew more about her family than i knew about biology.  Her past quizzes did help me from failing...Curves were crazy,1
He is such a great teacher! He doesnt sit up their and bore you with a lecture. He actually teaches so it is understandable. He also does so many examples to make sure students understand.,1
"Yonn is not only a lovely guy, but also a scholar and an intellectual. The subject matter is always interesting, and his entertaining lectures and fun personality make it all the better. You'll likely have a couple research-oriented papers and a couple quizzes/exams, and that's it. So be sure to do the work and study for tests, and you'll do well.",1
She lectures off of notes everyday and they are so boring.  She is willing to help outside of class but it is so hard to learn during.  Take another biblit prof.  ,0
"Learned a great deal.  Applicable to job.  Semester long, difficult group simulation, but did enjoy.  Fantastic Professor.",1
Dr. Grover is the best professor in the entire university. He knows how to teach students in a fun and enjoyable manner and his lectures very easy to understand. He is a unique professor who likes to make sure his students understands the lessons being taught in the class all the time. Do all the design challenges and you will surely get an A+.,1
"She does not communicate with students, does not give feedback, especially positive feedback. Will deduct points for ANYthing, and does not tell you much other than what you didn't do right. The topics and curriculum are very interesting but DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She is not a good professor at all.",0
He dropped me without any notice that I was failing. Didnt try to send me a email or tell me to come to office hours so we could talk about me increasing my grade.,0
"Had a bit of a problem with this professor,  I am slated to walk across the stage and get my diploma in 5 days, and the man still has not graded any of our assignments....  I will give credit where it is due, he is very knowledgeable, and intelligent.  But a poor teacher, he slacks very hard and just curves the final exam and passes people.",0
"Good guy, bad professor. He asks very passive aggressive questions and makes students feel bad when they dont have the same political views as him. He cancels class a lot, and his lectures are very long, boring, and repetitive. Easy grade for busy work and can find answers because he doesnt teach what is on the tests.",0
"He made Trigonometry really easy and I was able to pick it up quickly. Nice guy, he makes it really hard to get a bad grade in this class.",1
"So this professor isn't great by any means. Yes, he is kind but only in person. I take online classes because I work a lot and I had to go see him if I had a question because he is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at responding to email. I never received an email. He also didn't start grading until the quarter was practically over. He contradicts himself.",0
Easily my favorite professor. He is funny and makes the lectures and material easier to understand and will help you along the way. Would highly recommend you take this professor.,1
tough,0
"Yea, what the guy below said. Stay away from professor nemat. he's ignorant, and he doesn't care about students learning. Everybody literally cheated, and he doesn't even know it. Dumb old dude.",0
"The worst class I have ever taken. All the lectures were very boring and I found it very hard to pay attention. His mid-term and exams are crazy, he gives you a study guide and if you prepare off of those throughly you will be okay but they are a lot of work. He is very arrogant but does try to relate to students. If you want a good grade must try.",0
"Took her online 8 week course... I loved it. You need to commit to it. Keep in mind this is a Rhetoric and Composition class, so you will need to write. If you are proactive, she appreciates it and really works with you. You can't wait last minute to turn stuff in. I stuck to a schedule and got an A.  I loved her class.",1
Great adjuster. He really helps students reach their adjusting goals. It is refreshing to have a genuinely nice person as a professor!,1
"You have to get past his French accent. Once you get past that, get ready for confusing teaching, 0 clarification, lots of homework (online quizzes graded on accuracy) and a few pop quizzes. He doesn't explain things very well and is quite confusing.",0
"Spaced out is an understatement.  The woman did not know my name until the semester was over, plus I was able to correct her too many times.  In addition, I received the wrong grade at the end of the semester and had to have it changed.  A softie yes, but also out ot lunch.",0
hard teacher and can be rude at times so watch out,0
"This class had an extremely large amount of work to do for an elective. It is very difficult to do well as it has to be perfect and exactly what he wants to hear to do well. There are 4 weekly assignments ( which you have to buy a $100 textbook for) and also a weekly live video session. On top of this there are 3 major assignments, midterm+final.",0
"Her style of teaching is straight to the point, she explains the chapter, gives examples, then has you work out problems. Every day is the same, so it made math fun, I knew exactly what to expect. An amazing teacher!",1
"Luigi's teaching skills are perfect. Glad to have him for my MATH. In class, he solved all of my questions even if I couldn't express it properly or the problems were not really related to the lecture (that's the best of him, very approachable). Outside of class, you will see who is the BUSIEST MAN on earth.",1
"Prof. Brown's ENG 361 Native Writers class was great. There is a lot of reading throughout the term, but I enjoyed each text and the professor was passionate about the material he was teaching and was incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. He grades tough on the essays but gives you the extremely generous opportunity to revise.",1
Nice guy but his class discussions tend to be off topic 90% of the time.  Some of the videos that he showed had more to do with history/political science topics than english.  He also chooses a lot of political and history topics for the essays and term paper.  Grades hard on essays but the midterm and final are pretty easy.,1
"Mr. Juarez has very interesting stories to share based on Family Violence. He is funny at times and loves showing music videos based on the topic being covered. Plus, when you read the textbook, just read what he mentions in class and you will do fine on the exams.",1
"This guy is useless. I took his online class and he never helped you and was a real jerk. He felt as if he was invincible when speaking over e-mail. Oh well, what else do you expect when a coach teaches?",0
"My GPA was a 4.0 until this class. This woman is ridiculous! I received a F for my milestone 3 for my final project. She said I needed to use parenthetical references which I used 8! One solution for bullying I used for the anti-bullying campaign and she said it doesn't tie in! Um, what?! If you are unlucky enough to get her, change that course!!!",0
"Test are difficult, sometime quite different from homeowrk.",0
"This man is the best PE teacher ever. You can hardly show up to class and you will get an A. He is very helpful, he will work with you to improve your skills. Nice, funny, and caring. Take him if you have the chance. He is the best!",1
"Dr. Kosnik was the best professor I have had in my college career so far.  His notes are clear and easy to understand and his lectures are humorous and engaging.  I miss his class.  Ee is awesome at piano and the organ.  Also, he is the cutest, nicest old man ever.  Dr. Kosnik is a boss.",1
Boring lectures.  Assignments are VERY unclear.  She busted 1/3 of my class for plagerism on a website we built so make sure you document your sources.,0
"Lots of lectures. He has a ton of experience in the field, which is a good thing but is also very annoying because even though he is trying to teach, its more like bragging and is not very interesting. Everything you learn in this class comes from the textbook.",1
"Lazy students are complaining! He is strict but a good teacher. We are at college level, no longer kindergarten or primary school. We study the materials and do the homework. You are guaranteed will pass the class with an A. Stop whining!",1
"Just save yourself the headache and take someone else. Not that the class was extremely difficult, but she definitely makes you work for the grade. Very nit-picky about things that don't really matter and is a harsh grader, although most of the work was graded by Connect. Without the Connect assignments, this class would be unmanageable.",1
"Close to retirement & she could care less, skips steps when teaching, Hates 2 show how 2 work problem fully, 2 HW assignments & quizzes online wkly, Shell never know how well u do individually because all work is done & graded online, Test are in class & must show work & thats the only time shell know if u know how 2 do prob & still wont care",0
Lynn Baker is an amazing math teacher! She can mess up at times but she knows exactly what she is doing! She helps other students when they need it and always stay after class to help them! Easy grader as long as you turn in everything on time. This was the only class I enjoyed out of the other classes I had!,1
"The best instructor I have had my entire life. If you show up willing to learn, she will enrich your life endlessly!",1
"Dr. Maher's exams are harder than I would have liked, but his quizzes help with grades, and give you a good idea about what the exams look like. They typically have quite a few short answers/essays, so be prepared to know what you're talking about. Overall, he makes class interesting with the studies he includes, along with cute videos.",1
"Heavy grader, not specific to the point of what should be done.",0
"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Never trust the study guide. If he says something won't be on a test, expect it to be on the test. ",0
"Very enthusiastic professor who cares about what hes teaching. The only grades are 4 tests based off the lectures. He gives out extra credit if you consistently participate in discussions. Need to do the readings to be successful. Its not an easy class, but do the readings and listen to the lectures and youll be fine. A B is easily attainable",1
"Yes, Cindy White is a tough grader esp. if it's a 400 level class, but she's worthwhile. She is brilliant, hilarious, animated, & the most passionate professor I've ever met. She genuinely wants to know what YOU THINK but you'd better think critically. She also drives from MA every day so you know this woman lives to teach. She's a gem.",1
This instructor is a joke. E-mailing for help is pointless as she is very rude in her responses and unprofessional in comments on grades. I dropped her class and re-registered submitting the same quality of work I did in her class and getting a full letter grade higher. I am an A student and very careful to read instructions which she doesn't.,0
"SOC 201 is interesting and, thanks to this professor, inspirational. I'm a conscientious student so I did a lot of studying to earn the A. There are good opportunities for extra points that actually help you study the material. Read the book, take notes, watch the videos, take quizzes. Can't wait for her SOC 222 as well. Join me!",1
Talks about how much he cares for his students and wants to see you succeed... But in the same breath will disrespect you and make you feel dumb for asking a question. I've had him 3 times as a prof since I came to Humber and he's never changed. Good luck if you have him.,0
"Dr. Gelburd is a great Professor! If you're passionate about the arts, I recommend taking one of her classes. She knows her stuff and if you want to learn something, take her class. She's great about individual help and quickly replies with to questions. Anything below a B+ can be rewritten, which not all professors allow! Gelburd is a cool Prof.",1
"You have to buy a connect code for the book. An essay assignment is due the first week. A discussion, quiz and learmart is due every week. He asked alot of us in the discussions, he would ask 4 questions but he would ask other questions within those 4 questions so it came out to be 10+. Easy class, just very tedious and he asks alot from you.",1
"Often misunderstood: In class, she is not only teaching the subject but also a very singular conception of ""the professor"" and of the philosophy of teaching, through a self-conceived postmodern performatic method, that makes use of facial gesture, body language, and vocal expression, plus sartorial and make-up props: A truly revolutionary method.",1
"The guy is funny ill give you that,but he already expects you to be almost perfect in GRAMMER.He calls his class ""grammar land"" fun right? His teaching method is horrible..The final was on a regret we have, I should have wrote about the regret i have for not dropping his class. Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)",0
"She's extremely entitled. She says she is 'strict' under the guise of just being relatively self-important. I say this because she doesn't listen enough to her own students & demeans them. In a speech class, where students have to speak even when they have social anxieties, why is a professional in the subject demoralizing and degrading them?",0
"Mark is one of the best professors I have had! He is so passionate with teaching. His teaching style is dynamic and fun. The lectures always pass by fast. I would totally take him again. you must attend class, but since it's such a fun class i wouldn't want to miss it anyways.",1
"Wow, this is probably the worst teacher i've ever had teach me English.  She claims to be qualified to teach a Pre-IB class, but doesn't understand half of the things she is teaching.  If you can get out of her class DO IT, you do not want to ever experience the terrible thing this woman calls ""teaching"".",0
No Comments,0
I don't know what people are complaining about. The material was pretty straight forward and the final was nothing special; you just had to understand the equation instead of only memorizing it.,1
"Amazing professor, excellent class where I learned lots!  Dr. Fredrickson is extremely helpful and is a great character to work with. Would absolutely take another class with him.",1
"The best teacher I've ever had! She gives study guides that follow the test content-- and if you take the time to study, there's no way you can fail this cliss. She is adorable, funny, and one of a kind! You won't regret a moment in her class.",1
"He is unorganized in the beginning of the semester (with assignments from last semester's due dates appearing on the to-do list on CANVAS) and will not respond to emails. There is an extra credit opportunity for all of the discussion posts, so take advantage of those, quizzes/exams are difficult. I did not use the book, but it would have helped.",0
"Her expectations are unrealistic. It took myself and my fiance tag-teaming this course to get through it, my fiance is a teacher. Every week there are 6 writing assignments. There were so many links to so many different sources of information. It was absolutely ridiculous. If you are going back to school as an adult, you dont have time for this...",0
I can honestly say I liked his sense of humore but I always thought that I had a talent for writing well- untill I took this class. There is NO professor for this course that I would recommend. You will have a crapload of frustrations no matter what. It's not easy.,1
"Mr. Auten is a great teacher, I had his class up at the TUNE extension building last semester. He's a really nice guy who makes those night classes really comfortable and engaging. Easily one of my favorite teachers and classes,  I recommend him wholeheartedly.",1
"I have had three Spanish instructors, and she is the best one yet. Being a natural speaker of the language adds a dimension that assists in learning. We learn not just the language, but the culture as well. She will do whatever is needed to help you learn, not just for the grade, but to actually retain and use it.",1
"Professor Kathleen is an awesome artist and instructor. She cares about her students, very understanding, and takes every chance to give better instruction or clarification. She not only teaches how to draw, but also the thought process as you draw. Highly recommended.",1
"Professor Bailey is a very nice person and very understanding and an easy grader you get all the points by just doing the work. She does give many assignments, about 4 and 1 discussion post (busy work) a week & 4 essays. I recommend taking this class durning the summer & you also read an interesting book.",1
"Mrs. Johnson is an excellent teacher! She expects you to behave like adults, but she is very reasonable and fair. Tests are not difficult if you show up and take notes. She makes the subject very interesting! Great class!",1
"Susan sets you up to succeed! Go to class and take notes and do as much of the homework as you can and you will do well. She also gives practice exams before the tests and they're super helpful. She's a very fair grader, has clear lectures, and she's obviously passionate about stats, which makes it more enjoyable.",1
not so great teacher.,0
"Professor Shapiro is too easy on his students.  Our assignments can be pushed back for weeks, he cancels class often, gets off topic very easily.  Seems to genuinely care about his students but just not a good professor.",0
Good class.  Great teacher.  ,1
"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",0
hands down the best professor at UMD.,1
"Easy A! A speech, few discussions, mid term and final. The reviews for the mid term and final are the exact same. Take him! He is a super chill laid back professor.",1
"class was interesting, tests were very very hard, took the class in the summer and got a D.",1
"TAKE EVERY CLASS YOU CAN WITH DR. HAUCK! He made genetics so fun and interesting. You cannot go wrong with him. You definitely still have to work for his class, it is not an easy A, but still very attainable. He tells you up front everything that you need to get a good grade, and if you do just that you cannot do bad.",1
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or get a tutor. When you ask to get help on a question he will not help you and look at you like you should know everything. He doesn't give you credit for any homework if you miss the class period they checked it in no matter the circumstances.,0
"I took his graduate digital communication systems course. He's a hard professor without a doubt, but he tosses in little jokes, which i enjoyed. you MUST do homework to understand the class. he's very friendly and approachable. he does give BIG curves as well for final grades.",1
"He is a really straightforward professor who really cares for his students. Although his voice is really low, the class is basically self taught. The online homework examples do really help you understand the content better. Quizzes and Homework are online through MathXl. Take advantage of his office hours and you'll most definitely pass the class",1
"Prof. Smith loves the study of Native Americans. The book he requires you to purchase is about Native Americans, and you will watch a couple movies on this subject. However, don't misunderstand this to mean that he is flaky! He is not! Everything you do in his class is a building block for writing in preparation of the final exam. Great teacher!",1
"Excellent professor! Has a passion for math that is contagious. Very understanding and willing to explain any/all questions students have. Didn't use the book, only the access code that goes with it (can be purchased separately online). Do the homework assignments (only a few examples per unit) and study.",1
"Her tone is always condescending. Especially since shes smiling 24/7, even when irritated. Her instructions can be extremely vague but then she's very specific about what she wants from you. If you miss class then that's at least 3 grades going in as a 0 cause she'll put the report that's due the next week in as a 0 as well",0
Did things to cover all you would need to know but if you aren't a woman then he doesn't seem to pay attention to you as much for answering questions or suggestions.,1
"Mrs. Mattox is a really nice lady who has loads of experience in the subject she teaches. It can sometimes feel like a high school class but that's what she's used to teach. She does ""reviews"" for the test that are usually all of the test questions so if you memorize those, the class is a super easy A. SOOO many group projects.",1
"He's a nice teacher. Always cancelled class a lot & let us out early. He said we would have quizzes periodically throughout the semester, but we only had 2. Very easygoing/laid back. He loves when you laugh at his jokes. I'd definitely take one of his classes again.",1
This man is a horrible professor. I have never in my 20 years of living encountered a man so distasteful and rude to their students for absolutely no reason. Then you get to class and you're lucky if he let you know what was going on ahead of time because he can be so useless to be such a nasty man. Very strict attendance policy so be wise,0
"Do his study guides. His test were cake. Like make sure you go to class and listen and take notes, he hints on what he test. The papers he mentions in class are useless, don't read them. There was never a question on them. His questions on the final were the ones that made me smile cause they were easy. The final was hard because of the other guy",1
"RUN. Nice demeanor, however she is new to teaching. Requires odd-ball assignments no one has ever done or heard of. Does not really know what she is doing at times. WRITING INTENSIVE!! Group project/PowerPoint, textbook reading, 20+ pg *purchased* case studies, and Memos all expected all to be worked on at the same time.",0
"The book was boring, but he made up for that with the class discussions.  Overall, this class was fun.  He has an insane vocabulary though... so bring a dictionary if you don't have a big lexicon.",1
Her assignments are very time consuming and she is a very picky marker. Her lectures are boring and she thinks that talking loudly will help us learn.,0
"He is terrible. Tests are your entire grade and the tests are nothing like what he teaches. One mistake and you're screwed. Poor english, poor teacher overall. Avoid this teacher.",0
"Ning is a horrible teacher. I dont know why he is there. I ended up dropping his class, if you dont understand math very well, do not take him. Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself.",0
Every review on this is basically a lie. It is 2 months into the semester and not even the final withdraw date yet and 1/4 of my class is gone. If you cannot teach yourself stay away. If you go to him for help he will get annoyed if you don't understand the material. Always cancels office hours. More than half my class is failing with like a 50 avg,0
"Dave is THE BEST! He is so hilarious and really cares about what he teaches. He's already retired but decided to come back because ""This is what I do for FUN!"". He always had the whole class laughing and kept us engaged. There is a ""quiz"" every class using the iClicker, but half the time he helps with the answer. He's the best.",1
"She is a very clear teacher that makes the subject relatively easy to learn, however you need to work hard.  She teaches off of PowerPoints that you fill in, so it's easy to follow.  Dr. Vanderzalm is always willing to help.  Highly recommend.",1
"he is very good at lecturing and is clear with what he expects from his students. however, he does not give extra credit but is good at his job",1
"Professor Perez  is amazing. If your dreading taking a speech class, fear no more. Sign up for her class!   Attend every class, don't be late, prepare and deliver all your speeches - you will pass her class. Warning - you will be learning in a positive environment!",1
He is the best teacher ever!!! Very helpful and his exams are easy. You get a study guide and if you learn you should get an easy A! TAKE HIM!!!,1
"Alyssa is incredible and makes sure that all students are confident in their work. Despite the numerous papers and homework, the deadlines are reasonable and she is always easy to contact. Great professor (don't forget your jellybeans)!!!",1
"She is an ANGEL. Easily the most entertaining and engaging class I've taken. She's very passionate about comm & rhetoric and teaches in a way you'll remember the info! This is a class you'll actually want to go to and look forward too! She's one of the sweetest & most caring prof I've ever had, TAKE THIS CLASS!",1
This class is super easy. Open book tests and pretty much no homework besides reading. He can get kind of boring once in a while but he's a alright teacher.,1
best class at UNO,1
"Doesn't help you learn the material, she just teaches it one day and moves on to next lesson. YouTube and math lab was the closest thing to really understanding the material. Doesnt have extra credit and doesnt allow make ups on quizzes.",0
"wealth of info, extremely hard tests, no real priority of questions, could be any stupid detail, learned a lot, struggled with questions, not info, but understanding what the Q was asking. somewhat misleading on what was on exam, book heavy. ask to confirm when lecture and book clash. really hard, but makes you really prepared and knowledgeable,",1
Talk about needing to get out of the past,0
He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats,0
Lytle is an amazing human being as well as my favorite professor that I've EVER had; I highly recommend her. Just take her class for fun like I did and you'll see! Her class is where 50 min feels like 5 min.,1
"Dr. Hill is not a very good professor. She gives you a test and then tells you that it's the ""scantron people's"" fault that the tests don't get put into BB until a week and a half after. Do get the book because the practice problems at the end of the chapter are on the tests, as well as the questions from the quizzes. YOU HAVE TO STUDY.",0
"Definitely take Dr. Clark! Weekly discussions (participation grade), 2 exams (midterm and final), and 2 projects. Show up to class when you should and ask questions!",1
Terrible teacher. She puts you down.,0
DON'T TAKE ALYCE HUNTER. She has made it clear that she doesn't care about anyone's situation during this pandemic. Shes a tough grader - no one gets full credit she always takes off one point for spelling/grammar but can't even spell check herself. Group work is mandatory in this ONLINE CLASS. ALWAYS emails back late & super vague/condescending,0
She's not a very helpful professor because she usually reads off the slides. Class is usually boring. Attendance is a must.,1
She is a great professor! you wont have to take notes as she already made work sheets available for her students that you simply fill out. this allows you to cover more material at a time and easy to come back to. She also records her zoom meetings so you can come back and watch previous lectures. Lots of extra credit too.,1
Although she is extremely nice I probably wouldn't take her again. I actually wanted to learn in that class because its for my major but i really don't feel like i learned at all. If your looking for easy tests but not to really learn then she's your girl. Overall the class was a cake walk.,1
"Very good professor. Really loves astronomy, makes the class interesting. Everything is posted online and textbook is free online. Really easy class for general ed .",1
She is amazing,1
"Note: He's semi-retired, only teaches part-time now.  Definitely the best Psych teacher I've ever had. Stars every class with 'joke of the day' (always corny ones), very succinct and straightforward in lectures. Tests are easy if you pay attention and take notes. Engaging and fun. Definitely recommended.",1
"Dr. Johansen is a really great professor. Her test are alright, some questions are pretty difficult because her book is different from the class book. So, there are 3 tests and she drops the lowest one. Also, there is one research paper and presentation. I recomment Dr. Johansen... You'll learn a lot!! Just study, no homework!",1
"Terrible teacher. Didn't grade any assignments until the middle of the quarter. I didn't know I was doing a bad job, so I didn't know I was supposed to improve. I had to drop out because of this. Very late grader, insane amounts of reading and participation. IF YOU REGISTERED IN HIS CLASS, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Especially if you're a freshman.",0
"Mesozoic Era, but went far beyond, and too much detail. She inherited this huge course, so can't blame her. Summer course REQUIRED >= 50%, else fail. One of the lowest final class-grade averages of all my 35+ courses. Open book/notes quizzes fairly easy, but final closed is hard to study for because of the text: NO lecture notes, just text-book.",0
"Dr. Creed is the most dedicated professor at CofC, hands down. He is highly intelligent and will make sure you understand what you need to improve on in his class. I struggle keep up with his class but he is an amazing professor. He is extremely accessible. As long as you work with him, he will work with you. 10/10 recommend as long as you work!",1
This professor promotes his own book and assumes that no one is good enough unless they read his book and go by his own completely impractical marketing dogma,0
"Amazing man. His lectures are definitely something you don't want to miss. They're SO intetesting and enlightening. You definitely can't miss Gerard's lectures or you will not do well on assignments. There are many small assignments, but they are definitely manageable. You NEED a textbook for this class. An A+ is doable if you work hard. ",1
"He's a lot of fun. I was nervous when I thought he would be teaching exclusively in Spanish but he'll say it in Spanish first and repeat in English. It may be difficult for you if you struggle with English already but if you can take memorable notes and have a good speaking-partner if you struggle, it's great.",1
"I made the mistake of taking this class over the summer. The good thing is that it's fast-paced, the bad thing is that he grades super harshly. He is a little unclear in his instruction, he'll give you examples and then penalize you when you follow it. It's really hard to get an A.",1
"Mrs. Noland was such a great teacher! She gave lots of good feedback, sent weekly reminders of the things coming up for that week, wanted your best and was willing to help if needed. I also appreciated how she gave us the freedom to choose the topics for all of our speeches (only 3 total) and learn more about things we find interesting. She's great",1
"Her lectures are very boring, but she is a very sweet lady. I didn't use the textbook at all and just studied off the reviews she would post for the exam. She does give extra credit options and at the end of the semester we graded ourselves on how we think we did with attendance and participation.",1
"Dr G is a great teacher!  He really knows his stuff and wants you to learn.  If you are struggling because chemistry is hard, he is very accessible for help.  Also lots of opportunities for extra credit.  The homework really helps with mastering the material.",1
"The way homework is setup is awful, if you get a question right then try another one for practice it take's away from your hw grade. The hw also is graded week of unlike better professors that let it all be open till the end of the course. Instead of using the regular software for test he make's you use zoom so he can watch you which is odd.",0
"Great looking guy, enjoyed looking at him more than learning the material - no wonder I got a bad grade?",0
"If you have him for microelectronics, do not expect to learn anything from him. My advice is to find a better textbook, and follow an online class so you can learn the the material. When midterm comes, copy every useless and very confusing assignment questions that don't teach you anything on your cheat sheet.",0
"easiest classes ever, online classes, even though it said writing intensive but not much to do this class, easy A",1
"Professor Christensen is a PHENOMENAL professor! He is extremely funny when he teaches, and he is very easygoing. His essays are a piece of cake, and his lectures are interesting. I am so grateful to have him as my English professor during a semester that he says is his last semester of teaching before he retires. Im so happy that I had him.",1
"I wouldn't really recommend him because he has a thick accent and made it really hard to understand him a lot. Plus the material was really dry and he couldn't engage our class a lot. There literally was no sound in our class, just him talking. Take someone else!",0
Julie you're the best!!!,1
Dr. Hoffman is THE BEST!! Don't even think about taking anyone but him. He is more than fair in regards to what he expects you to take away from his lectures. He is extremely engaging and really tries to make everything understandable and fun. He also has office hours after class which are helpful. I LOVED this class and wish I could take it again.,1
"She is the worst. She only has 3 tests, including the final. She takes off so many points if you don't do exactly what she wants but she doesn't even say what she wants. She didn't assign any work and then in the last 3 weeks she made 3 projects due. She just talks for the full hour and 15 minutes.",0
No.,0
"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! Does not respond to emails, does not fix mistakes in grades, and made one of the tests at the last minute! Would strongly not recommend this professor.",0
This class was probably the easiest class I have ever had. Professor Ariail made it a breeze. The assignments were easy and he would reset tests if you accidentally clicked out of them. I highly recommend him. You won't regret it. ,1
"One of the most inconsistent professors when it comes to grading. He grades papers primarily off of quantity over quality, so if you aren't good at writing fluff, he is not the professor for you. He does not have a clear grading criteria and will often base your grade on your performance in class. If you care about your GPA, I would not recommend.",0
4500 words report + 1.5 hr quiz for final. NEVER answer your question properly. Whatever you say is a complaint.,0
Easy class I guess... but he gives a ton of homework and kind of a picky grader..,0
"Hes very nice and wants his students to succeed, but hes a very poor professor. Tests are incredibly hard, lectures are very disorganized and all over the place, and there is a ton of homework every week. If possible take Spanish with another professor, especially if youre taking Spanish 1.",0
Not a very good lecturer.,0
"Dr.Johansen is fairly easy to understand, provides a lot of examples, curteous, and helpful if you ask. always on time and very proffesional. Fun class , great discussions",1
This class was awful for an online class. Lots of assignments and discussions that took weeks to grade. Lots of them were assignments that provided little to no help in actually learning the content. Felt relatively hard for a non biology major class.,0
"Prof. Kolluru is a good professor. However, I believe she is bored with teaching. Her in-class lectures are great, she engages with students. The tough part is the exams. They are nothing like homework or practice material. She will ask you to remember formulas never covered in her class and has questions and has sections designed to trick you.",0
"I liked the class, but he was a really tough grader.  I thought my final grade was unfair given the amount of effort and time spent inthe photolab, but whatev... I still liked the class.",1
"Very rude professor. Her notes were confusing and did not go along with lab. She would roll her eyes and give attitude if asked a question. Slapped the back of my chair because I asked someone for a pencil. She wasnt even lecturing, she was just walking around while we were getting supplies. I recommend not taking her ever.",0
"Prof. Prasad is great. She does give reviews, they just entail what you need to know for the test. Furthermore, she spends an entire class period reviewing. Chemistry is hard but the use of the K-Learns, her lectures, and class / group work is beneficial. I enjoyed this professor very much, she genuinely cares about your success.",1
"This class is way hard. TAs are very bad, too. If you get nice TA, then you will pass. Do not think about getting A from this class.",0
"Kelli was great, lecture is inclusive and encourages students to participate. Slightly easy grader, as long as you do the work according to the standards. She's young so it can be easier to relate with her. However, if no one participates in class, lecture can be a strain and she can get frustrated.",1
"talks too fast, very sassy, talks in third person.  Does not give partial credit.  If one period is out of place or a word is misspelled she marked it as wrong-- many kids are international students so this is difficult for them. I dropped the class and would not take her again if i can avoid it.",0
"worst prof ever, she was not willing to help students and didn't teach anything",0
"I was never good at Math. In fact, I had to retake stats this semester with Susan. I no longer am intimidated by math and currently have an A in the class. She is caring and wants to help her students out. Homework is not extensive and her exams are identical to practice test given in class. TAKE HER!!!!",1
"Worst class I have ever been in, your grade will be determined by three impossible tests and problem sets that are worth about 1% of the final grade. He is is all over the place. Problem sets can only be answered using all of his links, good luck with that. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/PROFESSOR",0
"She's lenient with grading the lab's but when it comes to quizzes they are just horrible! She would give you a random species that you have no information on a few days before the quiz and then expect you to become an expert on it in a few days! Her lectures are just horrid, she usually joins and talks about how hard her second job is mostly.",0
"took her for kickboxing, super fun. got a good sweat, she's funny and makes you feel comfortable. Lots of extra credit if you miss classes",1
"This professor responded quickly to emails and graded quickly. However, She does not provide additional instructions for assignments. So, even though there is a good bit of extra credit, you may end up with ZERO points if you don't complete how she expects it. And if you reach out to ask questions, she is somewhat rude.",0
"Gets angry that people don't take her class seriously, and acts incredibly demeaning to those who ask questions. I wouldn't dare ask a question that she might think is stupid, out of fear that she'll give me a snarky response in an annoyed tone, making sure the whole class knows that ""you should know this"".",0
"She is a tough grader, during lectures she does give out good ideas that you wouldnt normally think about. There are about 1 inside the class essay. I believe overall she is narcissistic and no matter how hard you try; it still isnt good enough for his standards.",0
Very rude and slow,0
I would avoid taking Eric for MTH162. He gets off topic and then speeds through the lecture because he doesn't manage time very well. He assigns an excess amount of homework that you'll have a quiz on and expects it all to be done by the next class. It'll be pretty much a self-taught class. Good luck.,0
No Comments,0
"I took the web course during Spring.  Tests are straight out of Powerpoints.  There will be group projects to do, which is odd, since it is a web course.  It is kind of a pre-accounting course.",1
"He glosses over a lot of basics, but he's happy to explain if you ask.  He tries to keep lectures down to the bare minimum, so definitely ask for more explanation if you need it.  He is extremely clear about what he expects to see 'show your work' wise on tests and quizzes, and he isn't too nit picky.",1
"Very good professor, very inspirational for me. This was my first class I have taken at Oakton, because of Mr. Ragy I kept going.",1
Spent too much time in class trying to get other student's to participate instead of focusing on the ones who cared about being there and getting a decent grade. Most lectures were a waste of time but you couldn't miss class or you'd lose attendance points -- could cause you to fail class. Most content was in online portal and discussion posts.,0
"Thrasher was always late. ALWAYS late. When my grandfather died, she was very understanding and allowed me to retake a test, but other than that, when I had questions I received no help at all. Also, her tests are ridiculously long.",1
Because of sue i lost 10lbs. got a 1.5 on the beep test ended with an 85% somehow. keep up!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
This teacher should be fired. You leave his class with less confidence than when you started because he makes fun of you if you dont understand in front of the whole class.,0
"If you are not fluent in Spanish, you will struggle a lot. He depends on you to ask, and when you ask he might not explain it well. ",0
Great professor,1
"Very intense class. The content is not very easy to understand, and it doesn't help that the lecture examples are way easier than homework questions or midterms/exams. I cannot believe the amount of homework required to be submitted every week, so much paper used in this class. Each question takes up a page. Starts simple, then becomes very hard.",0
I took his course at Carleton and loved it! Interesting coursematerial and fantastic discussions. And he is great prof with a heart of gold.,1
Debate coach. The cheese. They rock but make sure youre keeping up with homework and your debate stuff or else you will feel it.,1
Simply put: one of the best professors you will ever have. Take her class !,1
"Classes were kind of boring, but she is a good teacher. Liberal.",1
Do not take this class. You are paying to teach yourself. The professor does not teach and his LA's teach the course instead. Each LA will give you a different answer and you will end up confused and unsure. I regret having taken this course. The class is also extremely slow and not even the professor can give you a decent answer when you ask.,0
"Professor Gier is an awesome teacher! Make sure to stay on top of the vocabulary and any notes that he goes over in class, ask any questions you may have, and you will do great in his class! He appreciates a higher level of participation in his class, in which you will be compensated for via extra credit assignment availability and such.",1
Took Professor Marlowe two semesters. She's a great professor! Lectures are clear and she gives a study guide for the exams. Very helpful! Definitely would take her class again,1
"I had a lot of good things to say about Russell, but they've been clouded by how she correlates eagerness to use quarantine productively with having all the time in the world. Course never had a set schedule (we don't know in advance what to read, when to meet, etc.) until 18 hours prior. Made life miserable & quarantine time even more uncertain.",0
"He expects you to read and will often give a short quiz (usually 4 or 5 questions) over the material. Personally, I just read sparknotes or shmoop and I got a pretty decent grade in the class (it was a B or A, I can't really remember as I took this course last spring). I would definitely recommend Osborne to anyone!",1
"The WORST professor I've EVER had! absolutely does not care about students success, unhelpful, does not reply to emails and or calls, extremely rude and inconsiderate. AVOID TAKING HIM PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
Wonderful instructor. Attendance is not mandatory but it helps if you show up especially since there are in class assignments that are easy credit. Buchanan wants everyone to learn so he makes his lectures easy to understand and is very friendly. The final is optional but if taken won't affect your grade. Mainly it is to replace a low score.,1
"Metzl teaches at Vandy now. Incredible professor and super interesting class. The guy is so interesting and does so many incredible things outside of teaching, and his lectures are hilarious. It's not much work, no final, and the final project is something that everyone loves engaging in. 100% would take a class with him again. MUST TAKE!!",1
"Her lectures are long, dry, and boring. She is knowledgeable, however; she lacks structure and clarity in both the lectures and exams.  In her Japanese history class, the exams are heavily influenced on Japanese names and terms versus historical events. 60-200 pages assigned to read per week. very tough grader. Waste of time and tuition. ",0
"Mrs. Johnson is my absolute favorite professor so far! She is kind, fair and charismatic! Her tests are pretty long, but the class itself is so interesting! Amazing professor all around! I strongly recommend her to anyone, especially anyone interested in social work. ",1
"Professor Nearing is a great. I took her online and it was easy she gives you the work for the whole semester and all you have to do is 3 fireworks assignments out of the book and a 8 page website from dreamweaver that you have to come up with, also the final exam is very easy 100 questions",1
"boring course,too many things need to remember. don't waste your time.my GPA is 3.5 and got a c in his course.worse grade i ever got. don't expect he will curve Hundreds of slides notes. if you want to suicide, take his ee333.",0
"I love Landrum. He is such a great teacher. As long as you read the short stories and take great notes, you'll do fine. He gets really passionate about the subject and he makes it interesting to keep showing up and listening. I looked forward to his class. I am actually taking him again for 373 a film criticism class and I am excited.",1
"Professor Ruder can be boring if you don't pay attention, but is actually a great teacher if you listen even 10%. Class is very easy (He literally codes your homework on the projector in class) as long as you follow along. Knows alot about coding and if you ask more questions he is always happy to help.",1
"Mr Humphrey has a great personality and is very intelligent. Not too much homework, even though it was a 6-week class. He is very clear about what he wants, and offers rubrics and study guides. Just do what you need to do and youll get a good grade. Not a tough grader at all. It is an important class that I recommend taking as an 18-week.",1
"This lab professor is not helpful at all.  He always changes his mind so don't believe what he say. Every class meeting, you will need to do your teaching presentation. He would pick on people during their presentation. He expect you to know everyting!!! if he ask a quetion and you don't know the anwer to it, he will lower your grade.",0
The only reason why I am passing this class is due to the fact that I teach myself every single chapter. The professor is a nice guy but isn't good at explaining what he is doing on the board and half the time doesn't even know what he's doing himself. I would recommend taking any other professor for chem 2 over this guy.,0
"Definitely one of the more challenging courses I've taken here at Hof. But Guttmann is truly a genius in his field and you will learn more about the world and how the economy works in just one hour of his class, you should absolutely take him, esp. for International Econ. He is the best professor at Hofstra.",1
"I know Ms. Gershuni teaches many classes at the same time, yet she's very helpful, very nice, and very professional in teaching. She's definitely a wonder woman of TIM School. Basically, she has all the qualities that a college instructor should have.",1
She is really nice BUT she gives alot of reading. You need to read for her!!Tests are detailed and she assigns two textbooks so 3 to 4 chapters to read per week. She also has a 5 pg term paper which she does not mention at all but she still expects you to do it AND  a group project where you are assigned a chapter and have to present.,1
he is really strict regarding grades.,0
"Awesome coding hw, but very time consuming and pretty hard. Class is a waste, he explains code in his own word and does not reference his lecture slides he made. His midterm & final will not be anywhere close to the lectures. Horrible coding examples. Its 20 mins of silence while he codes and shows it works and moves on. Does not elaborate the code",0
"Very straightforward, tells you exactly what she wants. The exams are tough but she if you show signs of improvement one bad grade won't kill you. I also agree her accent is very cute.",1
His tests are very difficult. Not because the material is hard but because he does not know how to word the tests. He is very confusing and become defensive when you try to get clarity. I would not recommend taking this class.,0
"Class is very easy, never opened the book, and everything is right on the slides. I never bought a finance calculator, but my TI-84 was good enough. You don't even need to pay attention unless he's going over a problem. Exam reviews are very helpful in knowing what's going to be on the exams. You also get a formula sheet for exams",1
Dr. Fink is great. Learned a lot from working with her. Super supportive to students.,1
"Very strict about grammar us and writing skills on projects. You never have tests but rather assignments to hand in. Doesn't really explain much so you kind of wing the projects but they're ok. Midterm (could be take home, if she wants), group projects, & final business plan (long. don't procrastinate). You calculate your own grade at the end.",1
"Wells is a knowledgeable professor who knows her material well, but she has ridiculous high expectations for her students. Her exams are confusing and sometimes go beyond the scope of her lectures. Hardest class I ever took, I spent so much time studying for every exam and when the tests came along it looked like I never studied.",1
If you need to get an A take him! He gives  you study guides for all exams which are all multiple choice except lab exams which are super easy he gives guides as well.  HW and quizzes online easy use book! Quizzes you get 3 chances and HW is unlimited chances. Super easy cant stress it enough!!!!!,0
"Proffesor Valltos is a very fair grader. Goes directly from the rubric and is very accomodating, just as long as you communicate. The weekly post are extensive (usually 6 questions to be answered in one post) but a requierement. Also, the final is BRUTAL! It definitey takes allll week to complete with lots of research.",1
"Dr. Hinton is funny and kind and always keeps the class hyped but she messed up my grades and I kept checking them but she didnt put them in until after grades were due and I was supposed to end up with a 89 B but somehow I ended up with a C on my transcript. If youre going to take her class, CHECK YOUR GRADES WITH HER TO SEE IF THEY ARE CORRECT",1
"You need to read so many books in his class, even the blogs and wikis are easy but you need to take them every week. His test is not easy for those people whose main language is not English.",0
"The material was difficult, but the professor had good humor and vast knowledge of Latin American culture that he integrated into the linguistic learning. He is a very much effective teacher. He is even more effective during his office hours. The tests are the only thing I would change, as even a slight spelling error gives you a 0 on the question.",1
"Laura's class is extremely unorganized. She introduced a software that we were required to use a week before the end of the semester. On top of that, the assignments are tedious busy work that do not translate into additional learning. She tends to shut down questions when asked, so don't bother. She takes a difficult concept and makes it harder.",0
"He is a smart man he just needs to stop speaking down to his students, this is not elementary school we will be fine with it being said once not three times the same thing at once.",0
"I took her for Psychology of Gender in class. She is very unorganized, she can not keep up with lectures, does not keep up with assignments that are coming up. I understand it's our responsibility to look, but she doesn't instruct how she wants it done, until you do it and gets mad because its not the way she wants it. I do not recommend her!",0
"only one thing to say: a final exam, in college, consisting of 11 fill in the blank questions??????? you decide.",0
"This is the worst teacher ever.  He not only puts the program to shame, he also puts the fire service to shame. Makes many mistakes. Has multiple incorrect answers on tests. Doesn't give feedback and so on. If you are looking to become a firefighter, please do not take him.",0
"Excellent professor!  Couldn't ask for better... very helpful, intelligent, enthusiastic, encouraging, informative... He's just an all-around great guy!  He made learning fun and promoted community in our class.  He taught us the meaning of design well before other professors started to broach the subject 2 or 3 years later.",1
"Took him for Ancient Law and Politics. If you are a very detailed person do not take him. He is very vague and doesn't elaborate on questions that you ask him. He lectures a lot so being alert 100% of the time is crucial. This is a class where it's hard to finesse. An A isn't given to you, you have to work for it.",0
"This one separates the wheat from the chaff. If there ever was a professor/course combo that gave you an idea of what electrical engineering is all about, its this. Extremely difficult, but if you manage to learn it you will be a god. He understands this fact and decides to hit you hard and force you to learn rather then give you a rubber stamp.",1
Best Professor Ever! Like her lectures and the real world examples!,1
"He is great at pushing you!  He was very mean, but I liked that he was honest and reflected how unkind some professionals may be.  You will take away some things and completely discard others. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot; Pearson is just difficult to deal with.",1
Make sure to do the readings because he will notice. Grades are mostly based around participation but he will make sure you participate in discussions.,1
If you want to be thoroughly confused and question your entire life I guess this is the class for you. So many assignments that arent worth much. Kinda feels like a waste of time. I would rather swallow a jean jacket than take this course again,0
"Ayland is an amazing teacher. He cares about the students, and is clear on grading criteria. He wants students to learn the material, and really puts lots of energy into the course. Highly recommend.",1
"I took her for micro in the winter (hybrid) and summer macro fully online. You have to get the txtbook for mindtap assignments, but it's free points so. People did better on the macro exams but because the median was high we actually got curved down but we got curved up with the same curve in micro. Just be aware that the curve can go both ways",1
24 CHAPTERS IN 3 MONTHS!!! ENDLESS READING AND GRADING MAKES 0 SENSE! CRAPPIEST TEACHER! She has an attitude for no reason. She does absolutely nothing for the class and you WILL have to teach yourself everything.,0
His class was my very first college class and he really eased some of my anxiety. His class was super easy to pass. He's very clear about the work that you need to do. The only way you could possibly fail is if you fall behind. Fantastic teacher.,1
"Dr. Meyer's lectures are heavily focused on his personal life, trauma that he has been through and his accomplishments. He has a confusing mix of talking about the terrible things that have happened in his life as well as the things he has accomplished and is proud of. Pretty annoying to listen to, though he is a nice guy.",0
"Very nice and funny but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He will not let you make up for anything, daily quizzes and read one chapter (20+ pages) per homework.",0
"Consider yourself lucky if you get her for 250. Very knowledgeable and passionate about OB. Makes you want to come to class and makes it fun!  Her lectures prep you for exams and she genuinely cares about your experience (lecture and clinical). To sum it up, she rocks!",1
Great professor but she spoiled the Lion King for me,1
"She was always very vague about what she wanted. She expected you to use canvas a lot and from what I could remember would never give you a heads up with something was coming up, I understand that it's our responsibility, but Eng101 is one of the 1st classes you take in college and I didn't know how to use it right away. A heads up would've been n",0
"seems like a great person talks nice will go the extra mile to help understand class materials but she's very serious i think she laughed once or twice during class the whole semester, shes talks ALOT, won't let you out a min early and also doesn't accept late homework no matter what you do if your late for an exam she will rush you",1
All i have to say is he gave us another revamp on how to do math.,1
Dr. Fontenot is a very uninvolved professor. He lectures every class period but is essentially saying the same thing every class time. The class also required at least 5 books when I took it. He does not really give clear instructions on tasks and is reluctant to work with students who need help. He does end class early almost every day though.,0
Too many non-textbook books to read all at once. Basically impossible to truly learn when having to read numerous books and other materials with such a heavy load within each week.,0
"Fast talking, hard to keep up with, and gets off track a lot. I had his 3 hour class and I could not take sitting there listening to him speak! It was so boring and most of the time he did not let us out for a break. His tests are hard. You have to write two essays and he does not grade them generously. He knows what he's talking about, though.",0
"She is a horrible teacher. Not receptive to criticism at all, speeds through the presentations like a game, will have the biggest portion of the test (open response) about stuff you hadn't gotten to. If you attempt to push back on her she will talk to you passive-aggressively. I loved bio so much and she has left me hating it.",0
"I would definitely recommend Mrs. Hanratty. She is kind of hard, but not too demanding and is always willing to help. If you take her class seriously enough, you will do fine. She does not give too much homework, but she holds you to a high standard as every teacher should. Mrs. Hanratty is a very good English teacher.",1
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
This professor wants you to know how to do each writing assignment that she gives to you. I thought we are suppose to learn not come into the class having a background in writing. Even though I am a wonderful writer she still found ways to be very critical of everything I turned in.I would not recommend her class please do not take her.,0
"AMAZING teacher! He really knows his stuff, and his lectures are interesting and thought-provoking. Grade is based entirely on two essay assignments and three exams. The essay assignments are easy, the exams are on the harder side (require very good note-taking). He really wants his students to succeed, and arranges study groups prior to each exam.",1
"very rude teacher, i would never taker again. He was rude and mean to students if they didn't understand the material. There is A LOT of math work involved so be prepared.  There quizzes and the study guides he makes do not at all help one bit.",0
"OK, I realize a lot of people do not like this class, but as someone who does not understand math at all, I thought Rayburn was extremely helpful especially during office hours. The class itself is not easy, but you get to use a notecard on tests and he gives extra credit. I thought he was actually a pretty good teacher.",1
"I had this professor for my calc I and calc II class, I ended up failing both, but not for the lack of trying.  His lecture are very confusing and he spends most of his time moon-walking across the classroom.  I would only recommend him if you are good at teaching yourself and are absent often, he doesn't care about that.",0
Do not take this class. His lecture are boring and his exam extremely difficult. He doesn't know how to teach a class. RUNNNNNNNNNNNNN from this class and from this professor. If you want to fail a class take this one!,0
Stephen is a horrible prof His grading SUCKS. More than 17 people dropped out of the class and maybe 5 made it to the end with probably 2 actually passing the class If you get a tiny part of like a 10 mark question wrong then the entire question is wrong Its basically impossible to pass unless you have a photographic memory doesnt care for student,0
"Show up to class and you will be fine, Definitely do all the homework she assigns and you will pass the class as a lot of it will be on tests. Only issue I ever had with her was me oversleeping during a test which I was up studying for, she did not let me make it up, so I only got 3 tries to get it all instead of 4. Still made an A.",1
"She's a very tough grader but if you thoroughly--and I mean thoroughly--edit and revise your paper's it's more likely to get a better grade. Class was a little boring, and it was mildly tough to pass with a B. She doesn't respond quickly to emails but is willing to help out if needed.",1
"Very applied, very thorough. Great prof",1
Absolutely awful. Not helpful to students who approach and has the most terrible marking scheme. Avoid her class.,0
omg... i did not have a good experience withthis professor. She failed me on a paper but never gives an explanation why. i only saw her once a week and i dreaded everytime i went. i did however make a b in her class suprisingly.,0
"The language barrier will be the toughest part of her class. Her notes are detailed enough to understand the concepts. Do the homework assignments, ask questions, and you will get an A.",1
"One of the best English professors that I have ever had. Makes you look forward to going to class every day. Personable, kind, and has an extremely fast email response time. Very willing to help and accommodate, making the class go as smooth as possible.",1
"Very good proffesor, I totally understood her and very helpful. I recomend you take her classes. I had a very good experience with her and if you try to attend classes and be active you will get what you want. Easy to talk to and an open minded person for many problems.",1
"He is a very tough grader, and it is impossible to get an A on the homework and in the class. Would not recommend taking him",0
Toby is a really nice guy. Wants his students to do well. The class is an easy A if you participate and do the papers.,1
"Excellent professor! His examples in class are straight from the text book. He is very funny also, however a little antisocial. Sometimes for his exams will give you something crazy that you have not seen before.  Easy grader.  He is always 5 - 10 minutes late to class and tries to make up the lost time by forcing the class to stay 5 minutes longer",1

I took dr. Brown for 0700 math and I am taking him again this fall for finite. He is a great teacher . He takes his time explaining and makes sure you grasp concepts the way your supposed to. He is very sweet and easy to talk to if you're having some problems or difficulties.,1
Wonderful prof. You will learn a lot if you pay attention. Most of the teaching comes through real world examples. I graduated 3 years ago and he still helps me out from time to time.,1
BIG Z IS A GOOD GUY,1
He thinks the material is easy and judges students for getting bad grades meanwhile he doesn't teach it correctly. He thinks that if you fail a quiz it's because you didn't try and there's a quiz every week,0
"She is a very sweet professor and will help you if you ask for it, but the class itself is very lecture heavy and can sometimes be boring. The final is a group project, which is easy but the quizzes in class can sometimes be difficult.",1
A nice guy overall. He is easier to pass than most other NCSU profs bc he curves everything heavily. Grading is 95% from 5 exams. He does not indicate what will actually be important so you have to study everything and then might have several questions on info from one slide while entire chapter is ignored. Use outside resources and you'll be fine.,0
"Logan is a great teacher. His lessons are formatted perfectly to copy them as notes. He seems to care about students who show an interest.  He's not very exciting but as long as you pau attention to his lectures and do the homework you'll be golden. Always offers 10% extra credit on tests, 15% on the final.",1
"She's not the best teacher in the credential program, by far. She treats us like we are in her 7th grade class, and she spends more time acting weird than teaching. I'm the type of student who gets 95-100% on every assignment, and she marked me down for the most random reasons. I don't think that's far when she's so vague on what she's looking for.",0
Avoid. You may be on her spit list before you even set foot in the class.,0
Awesome instructor. Very passionate.,1
"He is a good guy but not the greatest professor. His lectures are very unclear and boring and it is very hard to understand him. He has a very strong accent. Although his class is easy and an easy A. Just go to class and you will pass the class. But be prepared to sit through long, boring and unclear lectures.",0
"This professor is dedicated, works hard to get across students, very engaging face to face lectures. He is very fluid between topic, history, people involved, context, application. He is capable of providing texture to the topic that it's very hard to fall asleep in his class. The time will pass by quickly, that is how engaging he is.",1
"Explains clearly and is great with answering questions too. Professional. Straightforward assignments. Likes class discussion/shared opinions. One group project for the class (very simple). Online work can be slightly tricky, but slides/notes help. A bit awkward, but pleasant. A great teacher, period.",1
"He was very picky about work, you would ask him for feedback and he Rufuses to email you and tell you what you are doing wrong. all my assignments are 70 and why I don't know , he hasn't told me",0
"Dr. Prasad is one of the smartest and the most hilarious professors in the university. She makes the lab interesting by giving mnemonics and sometimes funny names to better remember the structures. Some people who say she is hard, we need to understand its Biology class, of course no one will get easy A without studying. Thank you Dr. Prasad",1
"Ronda is a wonderful teacher, very highly recomended.  Although she can come across as a bit reserved in class, and have strong opinions on the right way to do things, she is always open to listening to others ideas (and often says she learns something new),and is always willing to help with projects.  Very inspirational teacher. Highly recommended",1
"He's as good a choice as any. The guy knows his stuff but students think otherwise because he's disorganized in class. He drops one test (or your quiz total), and all his exams are well within the homework territory. As long as you do your homework yourself you should be fine.",1
"No recorded or live lectures, basically teaching yourself the material. Have to watch a show (paid by student) and 1 season per week plus reading and then homework on the show and readings. Little to no engagement with students and assignments seem non-educational and unnecessary. Grading is late & professor is unorganized.",0
"Not the best, but good enough.",1
"She is a great professor. Review the power point she creates in canvas and even though her quizzes in canvas are not part of your grade they are a great tool to study with. Attendance to labs are a must , 10 points for each lab which will boost your grade nicely . She also has great test reviews on canvas to study from. Easy to talk to.",1
No comment,0
Diane is extremely nice but I would not recommend her if you're looking for a professor who will help you out. Tests are basically all she relies on for grades and she doesn't give any extra credit out. She talks about her kids a lot so she gets side tracked and then starts rushing through sections.,0
"A quarter of the class withdrew, and half of what is left is failing extremely bad. AVOID AVOID AVOID. glad i withdrew when i did. horrible professor.",0
"I took lessons from pawkett for 1 semester and it was disappointing. Not a good teacher for ROCKBLUES type stuff. He seemed like more of a classical guy. His lessons are monotonous and a lot of the time it felt like I was learning random things for no reason. Plus he hardly seemed interested throughout the lessons, often ending lessons early. ",0
"If you don't care to learn, don't pick this teacher because he will help you learn. Great teacher. A lot of work, quizzes and essays. All the work will make you smarter, but it can be too much.",1
"Professor Anderson is great. His class is lecture based with short readings assigned. He shows some cool comedy skits that relate to the material. If youre uncomfortable discussing and thinking critically about religion, dont take his philosophy course. Pay attention and participate. He will fail you if you are frequently absent, so show up.",1
"This class was really interesting and great for people who may not be interested by most history classes. Show up to every class, do the readings, and submit your work on time, and you should succeed in this class while also enjoying it! Sigal is a great professor and guy - would definitely recommend this course!",1
I took my first online class with this professor! Amazing. Respond to discussion questions thorough and on time and youll be fine. Quiz every week and one final paper. Hes very prompt with response to emails (little as 4 hrs) and hes there If you have any questions. Great Prof!,1
"For this class, its best that you study a lot and try to finish homework early. The material is difficult but if you stay on top of things you can definitely keep up. Professor Myers is a good teacher but wont respond to any homework questions until after the due date, so don't rely on him. Overall, this was still a good class.",1
"I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he's too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It's a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocket",0
Be prepare to participate.... he takes participation very serious. You get a grade every few weeks for participation. Do not miss class because he will take points off. You need the book for the class. He is very passionate about what he teaches.,0
She is the most inspirational woman I have ever met. The best part of the course is office hours and I'd highly recommend attending each week. She is so full of knowledge and insight. I learned so much from her within and outside the curriculum. I have never had such an approachable and caring professor. ,1
"Each section of homework takes about 2 hours to do but is not too hard and you dont get to use notes on the tests. He goes over the homework and answers any questions at the beginning of each class before you turn in the homework and there were a few different opportunities for extra credit. I think hes a good professor and a nice, funny guy!",1
Great energy and is a lot fun to have as a professor. Never a dull moment in class esp. when it is a speech day!,1
"Currently in his PHY125 class. He has an unrealistic expectation for Non-Science majors. Talks to no end during class, not requiring feedback. A lot of his opinions infiltrate the lesson plan. PROCTORED Quizzes and Tests. The theme is that he simply can't teach. He is smart no denying but doesn't make for a good prof. Get ready to teach yourself.",0
boring lecture..! too long ..! attendance is mandatory ...! can't leave class until he says so.! even he has taken your attendance many more things likes this,0
"I love this teacher, I have had him for 3 classes now, His final projects end to be a lot of work but he is a understanding and proficient teacher. You learn alot in his classes and most of the time he will let you resubmit an assignments if you didn't do well on it.",1
"Just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam, one year out of college. Couldn't have done it without the building blocks learned through Dave's 301 stories/lectures. The guy can teach, and he's comfortable in his own skin. If you want to LEARN the subject, take this class. However, if you plan on going to his office hours, bring a hazmat suit...",1
"It really seemed like This professor just picked up this class in her spare time, but didn't really care about it. She showed up to our lab section once the whole semester, and for about half of the lectures she brought in guest speakers. The homework was inconsistent and seemed arbitrarily selected.",0
"While I didn't think perception was interesting, Dr. Kunz is a great professor. His tests are fair and he seems like an overall good guy. You can tell he is extremely intelligent, but he is still approachable. He doesn't take attendance (in case that's something you're concerned about).",1
Hes so hot its a pleasure being in his class for that only. Butt;) he is also the only teacher in the HRM course. The other are a waste of time and a shame to the profession. This guy is a true teacher. Thanks!!!,1
Do not take this professors online class he will not teach you anything. If you have experience in code you should be able to get a good grade but don't expect to learn much at all.,0
He loves chemistry. I had him at 8am and every morning he put me in a good mood with his excitement and enthusiastic personality. He loves what he does and is very open to talk to students.,1
Not even worth your time,0
"A lot of reading, and have to understand most of it to discuss in class. Research a bit on the general history of Empire Japan beforehand, events and terms will appear a lot and she won't really clarify about them. She will talk and repeat sentences a lot, hard to catch what she wants to say. She is really helpful in writing the final paper though.",1
I didn't think I would like philosophy but I  liked this class. The professor is pretty good. She makes the readings clear and will help a lot with papers so you do better. Fair grader and cares if you actually learn something.,1
"took her for bio lab, she is the nicest TA youll ever meet. shes lenient, nice, and actually gets back to your emails fast. would definitely take her again and would definitely recommend",1
"Stay away from McConnell. His classes are dry, his voice monotone, and his readings tedious. There is not too much work and he is an easy grader, however it's still not worth it. He's v vague in his assignment descriptions and seems to grade many papers without reading them. Even films did not make this class any more enjoyable.",0
She is very understanding and will help you. I took her as hybrid. I never really came to the class because all you do is basically work on the homework and take notes thats all. I would have taken it online if thats what I knew in the beginning we would do. She made this class easy to understand.,1
"Worst class I have ever taken. I wrote a paper that followed ALL the guidelines, but it was failed because my ""views"" were different than what he wanted. Also, the final is four exam essays, 350 words each and 2 hours to do all of it. Mess up? Automatic 0%. Never take this class. Worst teacher I have ever worked with. Save yourself the time.",0
Down to earth teacher. Clear teaching methods. Do your homework and study the textbook and you will pass.,1
Extremely nice!  Class is hard to go to but if you go you will get no lower then a C+.  If you struggle with foreign languages I would take her.  Exams take about 30 min and there is a huge curve (you could get a 45% and get a C on the exam).,1
"Professor Bachmann was really good. She is really corny but hilarious. No tests or hard worksheets. There are 2 essays but fairly easy. Attendance is mandatory, but you'll pass if you miss 2-3 lectures. Just pay attention and take notes. Overall, an easy A.",1
"As a professor, Tom really changed my life. His course made me realize my strengths in math and he is very accommodating and encouraging. He cares about his students and that really made me respect him. The course requires some strong writing skills, unlike most math classes, but Tom is always there to help. Thank you, Tom.",1
"Disorganized, cannot hear a thing in his lectures, grading takes more than a month. His midterms are quite easy but the finals stab your back. He goes off tangent soooooo much it's kind of hard at times to understand if he's lecturing or not.",0
Take her for ENG 101 and 102! she's the best,1
"This was by far the easiest class I have ever taken in my entire life.  He is really easy, too easy. I got an A for his class yet I feel like I wasted my time learning nothing.",1
She grades so hard and is useless. Terrible class and terrible teacher.,0
Great professor! She instructs very well and motivates you. Very knowledge for every level of fitness (in the weight room or her work outs in the gym). This is my second class with Ms. Thompson and I cannot wait for summer session (her cardio/body conditioning courses will be four days a week).,1
He is extrememly easy. I took him for writing 201 and class was a joke. all you did was watch videos and write a couple 500 word essays which you have to. He has to fulfill a  minimum amunt of papers to write. He cares about grammar but he is a good grader.,1
Gerard expects participation in class and in online discussions. If you read the additional material you'll be a star in his class.,1
"This professor is by far the worst human I have come across in my 19 years on this planet. She has no teaching ability and I am fairly certain I learn more in my sleep than I do in her lectures. She docks marks for memorizing the information because she wants you to ""think deeper."" Justifies giving marks like 5.332. Please UBC, find a new professor",0
"100 level course, yet we were asked to write 3 page papers weekly.  Course load is heavy, but then the midterm and final are the only time the text book was actually used in the class.  Graded strictly on grammar, and marked down for things that were direct quotes from citations.  I'm now in a 200 level writing course that requires less.",0
"Avoid!!! Nice lady but she is by far the most unorganized professor I have ever had. Posted every week's assignments late, grading criteria was unexplained until semester's end, and she never graded anything on time- seriously, not once. Can BARELY get a hold of her by email. Posted final paper guidelines 10-days late too. Not worth the headaches.",0
Unrealistic expectations for his students.  INSANELY HARD!,0
"Assigns work and does not discuss them extensively, shows so many irrelevant videos and as long as you are on his good side, you will pass with flying colors. Talks a lot about politics and although he asks for your opinion, he ds not care about it. Terrible teacher, but easy class.",0
She was very helpful. I learned how to swim because of her ,1
"Entire class is based on a group project - unfortunately, I had the worst group. Projects are okay, there was one term paper and a few other assignments (not anything crazy) but like I said entire class is based on your one group project. If you get a good group, you'll be good to go. Marking criteria is not clear / no real schedule to the class",0
"Had Prof Triplett for both MGF 1106 and 1107. Hands down one of the best professors I've had. He wants you to learn the material but also understands that formulas and processes can be awkward to memorize and will let you use notes. Be prepared for a lot of homework, especially if you take a condensed summer class. Great Prof all around.",1
"He is such a smart guy. He is very well-spoken. A lot of ppl in my class didn't like the class because his teaching style are power points and pictures, and he just talks. But i thought it was such an interesting class! You analyze advertising, logos, signs, architecture. Very interesting. I took him again fro Art and History. same teaching style.",1
"As a Human Resources major I was very disappointed. Her lectures are rushed and vague, her online tests have nothing to do with the slides she presents, and the criteria for the group project is illogical. It's not a difficult class, but she doesn't know what she's talking about. Needless to say, I expected more from a PhD in Human Resources.",0
"Great professor. Be prepared to do a lot of work though. He places the learning responsibility square on your shoulders, but is also there to help. He tends to give word banks even when he says ""don't count on it"" just to surprise students. Enjoyed his class a lot.",1
Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm. This class was not made a priority. My advice: avoid her and this class at all costs during the rest of COVID. The only positive thing I can say is that she responds to emails.,0
"Meryl is not a good teacher. It is that simple. Ruined my interest in English which is sad considering my major is Journalism. Very judgmental, and very sarcastic.",0
"She got me into art and I learned alot. She was fun and a great teacher.I look at art in a new way now, and look foward to going to a museum.",1
"The professor is a bit dry in his lecture style, but he is nonetheless a good teacher and provides very interesting material. Show up and put an effort into assignments and you'll be fine.",1
"Online class instructions were a bit confusing, essays graded very differently and harshly, definetely turn in every assignment and on time, but not sure your best effort always gets the best grade in this class.",0
Paje is a really cool guy I'm glad I got him as a professor. He actually cares and is very lenient and understanding. He lets a lot of stuff slide and hes pretty funny too. The class is not hard at all and he gives tips to get through college that will stick with you. Do the discussion questions and chapter quizzes (very easy) and you'll be fine.,1
"She's the best professor in the business management dept. Take her for all your accounting courses. That's what i did from my sophomore year till the end of my junior year. Trust me, you will pass. And she works with ALL students!!!",1
Schubert's Math 5A class was difficult. He expects you to know everything that he's teaching already. He works on problems on the board and basically solves it & talks to himself and asks the class if what he was doing was right and that's basically the whole lecture. He doesn't teach you how to solve the problem or say why he's solving it that way,0
"As a first semester class, it's hard to tell what is expected. Going from nothing to understanding circuit diagrams and binary assembly instructions for a PIC, it really is a testament to the quality of Dr. Duba's teaching. He can be quite fun, but that is his main drawback- he is not the best professor at keeping random side conversions in check.",1
"Dr. Baddar is amazing! You will read stories that deal with different types of people and then discuss them in class, and write papers on the human condition elements that were the most meaningful to you. If you read the few short stories, do the hw, and pay attention in class you'll pass easily. Best professor ever!",1
A really nice person but not a nice professor. The class is poorly taught and the textbook is useless. Homework problems are often impossible to solve and tests are for creative mathematicians. Almost depressed by taking this class.,0
Orgo at TU is a great way to screw yourself. At this point you can take it with anyone because there is an equally likely chance you will get screwed. Jasmin can be pretentious in class to the point where asking questions are not even worth it. He makes up for this by being somewhat approachable in office hours. Average professor.,1
Shes rude. She teaches us stuff in which The class doesnt believe will benefit us. She also tried to get loud with a student because He didnt have his flash drive. Like idk what type of teacher treats there student in such a rude way. Its unacceptable.,0
Do not take this professor under any circumstances. For some reason she believes her students should dedicate most of their time to her class despite it being a Miami plan class for most. The tests are filled with ambiguously worded questions which cause averages in the high 60's and essays are expected throughout the semester. Do not take her.,0
"Does not have the student in mind, not sensitive to lab conditions, short times to complete assignments (3 days sometimes), harsh grading practices, recycles the same two examples, overall poor attitude for a learning setting. Pose a problem- he basically shrugs his shoulders and says you’ll have to figure it out. Worst class experience to date.",0
"Jimmerson goes by the teaching philosophy that all students are empty cups, and she is an overflowing teapot of knowledge. In other words, she is condescending. She is small-minded; if you don't fit into her definition of what makes a person intellectual, she will treat you as if you're inferior to her. If you're not good enough for her, good luck!",0
I love Mrs. Barclift. She is very understanding. She knows what she is talking about and is very interesting. She is more strict in this class than she is in other classes.Most people do not know how to take her outspokeness and crude humor when they first meet her she means no harm.,1
"If you're going to ask us to supply you with stamps and envelopes as a pre-requisite to passing your course then for God sakes man, at least mail us the darn final exams sooner than 4 months after they were initially turned in.  Seriously, get it together dude.",0
"Anyone who says he's a good lecturer, must have had a different prof. He's boring, condescending and vague about things like what's on the exam for no reason. He never recorded his lecture for no reason and never wanted to help us in any way. Snobby and pompous",0
"This class was terrible. He gives no instructions and just expects you to figure out what is due. He is extremely unorganized and never knows what he is suppose to be doing. For the final paper we had to write a research paper based on a group ""project"". We were not given a rubric or any instructions on what exactly he was looking for. Don't take.",0
"he's a very interesting and capable teacher, but can at times be intimidating. if you don't show willingness to learn or improve you won't get anywhere. if you have a true interest, he's a wonderful teacher. take the class into your own hands.. talk, attend class, and know your stuff. tough grader but a great teacher. good accent, and a cutie too",1
"Her readings are extremely boring!!!!! Bring your pillows; she will put you to sleep!!!!!! A Don Quixote groupie, her stupid brownie points are annoying, seriously how old are we? She’s a harsh grader! Avoid taking her!!!!",0
"you basically need to study on your own, lectures are super boring and no quizzes to boost up marks. He is also very picky and a tough grader when it comes to wording for the written part of his exams. If this is your first time taking the course, you should probably get someone else to really explain the information since bio is generally hard",0
"Very nice guy, but not very helpful. The other two portfolio professors Sean and Maria are much more productive with class time, and actually give helpful critique.",0
"Material can be difficult if you weren't paying attention during your ACCT classes. Many students weren't prepared with sufficient ACCT knowledge, and as such suffered. Group project, one paper, and a lot of online homework. Online platform wasn't too helpful, and very tedious, not very helpful for passing the course.",1
"Her lectures can be pretty vague - often they are based around literary-philosophical concepts such as 'form' and 'nature' that are not very well-explained. As a result, it can sometimes feel like she is talking in great detail about something that nobody (even the TA's) have a grasp on.",0
"Sadly the lack of reviews on this guy led me to take his class due to this class being set in the morning. First off, he relies heavily on the book to teach which isnt great because his tests barely reflect what you were taught and was supposed to learn by doing the homework. Also very inconsistent. Overall, take someone else.",0
"Great professor! The course in general is designed to be hard, lots to memorize. She gives all the powerpoints needed and on Zoom, explains them very well. Other than that it's up to you to study and memorize, don't just study the powerpoints, STUDY THE TEXTBOOK CHAPTER IMAGES, it on the practicals!! Great prof tho, good at explaining + answering!",1
he is one of these liberal types who is a throw back to the 60's. all of the stuff he talks about doesn't even make sense today. he needs to bring the course up to the 2000's. always acts like mr nice guy and you get creamed on one of his tests. also a real brown-noser around campus. acts like Mr. Bentley all the time. avoid at all costs.,0
"Lamkin is not a good professor as others students rated.   I took her BIO47 and I learned everything by myself.  She didn't lecture much and her tests are nothing related to what she lectured, hard to get what she means.   Bad teacher in bio, anatomy. ",0
This class isn't exactly difficult although at the end of the semester you are given a news article essay. After waiting three weeks for a grade I was given a 50% after emailing professor Baltodano he was extremely rude and it almost seemed as if I bruised his ego. I ended up falling by .7%. That's right point 7 percent.,0
HORRIBLE PROFESSOR STAY AWAY IF YOU TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR G.P.A! The TA's do all the grading and think they are grading for a PhD Course. Basic information which they make harder than what it should be.   ,0
"A very smart professor with lots of intellectual qualities, yes with too much writing in her class also 3 or 4 heavy tests and like 12 lab quizzes but at the end a professor with to much knowledge in biology and zoology",1
"Coop is interesting, funny, and understanding, yet he is extremely hard to understand and follow even the most basic algorithmic foundations. He s a good person, not a good professor.",0
No Comments,1
Grading scale seems really inconsistent and he is not at all accommodating of students issues; class is super hard and the only support is super crowded TA hours.,0
"I took this class on Summer 2016 and the teacher is awesome. She does have a thick accent but you will understand her. Quizes are open book and can do in groups. All exams are based on study guides. Make sure you don't miss class, you participate, do your homework and study for exams. I would take her again. She's nice and great teacher!",1
Warning. I had a horrible experience with this guy and his class was not what I expected. Be aware. ,0
Class could of been more about what I was expecting to take other than something I was not even expecting to take,0
Professor Jefferies was amazing. I learned so much from taking his course and it helped set the stone for my programming foundation. I wish I would've taken his course prior to taking the JavaScript course as I feel this course are based upon the essentials when learning any new programming language,1
She has a weird grading criteria in which she gives a cumulative final and if you dont pass that even if you have a good standing grade she will fail you. She is awful at explaining and she even puts things on midterms that werent on her study guides and arrogantly tells you she knows it wasnt on there but you can atleast try for partial credit.,0
Terrible teacher. This was the worst class I've taken at Hamline. His jokes are stupid and makes a fool of anyone that raises their hand.,0
"He is a nice person but not so good at lecturing. He is a really strict grader, who has really high expectation to his students. I don't think I will take his course again, because there are so many mandatory small projects. This course is very labor intensive.",0
"Hes an owesome professor... He covers a lot of material over a short period of time,,, but come before class and he will help you understand physics. Its challenging, but he will do all he can so that you succeed in physics. I highly recommend him. He is a kind and owesome teacher. Even if youre late with homework, he will accept it. Best teacher",1
WAY to picky!!!!!!!!,0
"Dr. Alse is an awesome professor!  His Money and Banking course was difficult, perhaps the hardest Economics course I have ever taken.  However, he really knew his stuff and his lectures were really interesting.  Tests were quite difficult.  Be sure to take a few days to study for each exam!",1
He gets life and especialy the life of a student. He does accept late papers but just because he wants you to learn. He is very easy to talk to and very helpful. Take him.,1
I hated this class the first day I walked in she gave us a huge word bank and went through her powerpoint in lab she said ok now learn that 200 vocab what they are and do because we will be working on some different ones next class. It was crazy!,0
"Hard not to pass! She gives 6 quizzes (provides an outline with all of the answers) and 4 essays, minimum 500 words, easy grader.",1
"Great professor!  She is not always clear in answering question or explaining problems, but as long as you pay attention and attend class, you should be fine.  She gives you study guides and reviews before the tests which are very helpful.  For a person who had already taken Calculus in high school, this class was a breeze!",1
Only he does is reading reading off powerpoint and play youtube videos,0
Wow! she is an amazing teacher. Extremely organized and very clear in her explanations. Lots of work but you will learn.,1
She is probably the most disorganized professor I have ever had. Grades from the very beginning of the semester was not entered until last days of the course. I wonder what she does with those 5 months.... It's aggravating because you won't know what grade you have. Email replies have so many typos. Late replies or no replies most of the time.,0
"Easy class. One thing I enjoyed was the topics we covered and the television shows we watched. Take this class, even if you aren't a psych major.",1
"Madame Aunave is one of the kindest professors and long as you participate in class and ask for help when you need it, all she cares about is that you're trying to improve your French. Homework is usually just an activity or two every night that doesn't take longer than 30 min. Only complaint is when she does assign final projects its all at once.",1
Don't take his online class. He takes forever to put in grades. The only grades you have are journals and exams which are both worth 5o points each. He grades really hard and he gives no feedback about how you can do better the next time.,0
"Connor's lectures are extremely boring. All he does is read off of slides that he has already put on Brightspace. When teaching a heavy material subject, a little more enthusiasm and preparation on the teacher's part would be apprectiated. The use of youtube and khan academy is recommended as you will need to teach yourself. Beware: GPA killer",0
She does absolutely nothing for her class or her students and shes supposed to teach how to tend to exceptional learners but doesnt practice it herself . Oxymoron of a professor if you ask me,0
She is very understanding! Don't take her online class if you have procrastination though,1
Took Western Civilizations. Didn't reference the book too much. Gets off topic easily. Hard to understand accent. Pay attention to the review! Alright guy but not a good teacher.,0
This class is fairly easy but the professor doesn't make the topic as interesting. I came in thinking that it would be an interesting class but no.  Don't have to read because he will lecture the reading in class and the whole class is based off the reading.  He is a very nice professor though.  Group members are assigned to you for final project.,1
Sandy is a nice person but a bad professor. She simplifies everything to a level that makes you feel like a child. She takes points off for not showing intermediate steps that are already implied within the formulas that are used. She also gets mad and takes points off of test and quizzes if you use different methods even if the answer is right,0
He was a terrible teacher. Never even taught.. just told us what to look at in the book. He would then give a quiz that no one would get right and insist that it is our fault and that we did indeed learn it when we didn't. Tests are impossible to finish in 50 minutes. Curves the course average to a 75 which means most people get a C.,1

"hes really calm and collected, does a great job at explaining the material and cares about his students. great professor overall. you will not regret taking his class",1
LOVE this professor and the course! If you come to class everyday (which you should since there are exercises due each day) you will learn a lot. She is very helpful and wants students to understand editing. I am taking her again next semester and I can't wait!,1
"This class is an easy A. Since it's an online class u really have to be on top of ur game since she doesn't assign work every week. It's easy to forget ur taking the class. Tests and homework is not hard if u follow the exam samples. The samples are the same as the tests, she just inserts different numbers.",1
his class was all over the place. We had a lot of different books and we would jump all over the material. He would go off on tangents a lot and it felt like what he was saying didn't align with what we were reading. His essay assignments were confusing and he took forever to grade. He's very stuck in his ways and i wouldn't take him again.,0
Great teacher!! I took her class as a hybrid and was able to get an A no problem. Just do the work and you'll be fine. She's really nice and helpful too!!,1
"If you enjoy hearing the word ""um"" incessantly, this class is for you.  Prof Miiler is a terrible teacher.  Don't let her nonsense critiques of your papers fool you...she honestly doesn't know what she's doing.  If I were you, stay away!",0
"She is rude when you asks questions, but I am not sure she realizes it. Does not review for exams, and there is no SI for Bio 2.  She does not make lecture very interesting and her Power Points are awful. ",0
Doesn't know how to teach or do the examples he shows. Jumps all over the place. Constantly says umm and uhh.,0
Insanely hard grader on 8 micro-themes and 1 paper worth 25% of your grade. She's very intelligent but expects us all to teach her something new about the Old Testament which is nearly impossible so unless you're willing to devout your whole life to this one class do not expect an easy A. The midterm + final are long and require lots of writing,0
"This is one of the best instructors I have ever had in my entire life. I enjoyed this class very much, and I appreciated how understanding and open they were. I think if you try your best, ask questions and enjoy the speeches, you will succeed! The speeches weren't hard either, some of them were even fun!",1
"Mr. Daigle is very confusing while lecturing. His lectures do not match with the information in the textbook. His tests are not consistent with lectures. He has a bad attitude towards students, he cusses, and disrespects students. He shouldn't be teaching at all. Do not waste your money on a class that he teaches.",0
"This course was taught by an awful TA. Unfair grading and little help. If you have the chance, just take Physics at a community college. It's insane that UMB charges students so much money, just to be ""taught"" by graduate students who are grumpy because they miss lunch during 11am lab and do not care about the students.",0
"Dr. Zhao is very enthusiastic about the subject and comes prepared for lecture with power point slides (which he up loads to blackboard prior to class). If you utilize his office hours he can be very helpful and he generally cares about his students and their grades. Biochemistry is not an easy subject, so  it does require some time in effort.",1
"One of the worst teachers i've had to deal with during my educational road. Seems unprepared during class, does not know how to lecture either. Constantly goes back on her examples saying forget this forget what i said this and you never get through anything. I suggest studying the material to understand it, because exams aren't math heavy at all.",0
Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,0
"Very knowledgable on subjects and conveys them well. I only had him for a strictly-online course due to everything being shut down, but lectures are VERY full of information that sometimes needed to be viewed twice to fully get all the information needed. Seems funny, probably funnier in person. Homework is straightforward with only one chance.",1
"i failed the class once. but let me tell you, the first time i took the class we had masters students taking the class too. all of the exams were DIFFICULT. you still can pass but you wont be able to get the grade you r wokring for. i took the class again and didnt have any MASTERS students and the class was easy. and i got the grade i worked for. ",0
"Dr. Feagin is an excellent History teacher! Her lectures are extremely organized and she includes fascinating topics.  There is a really big project for the class, but it's meant to be completed in portions over the semester.  The tests are long, but easy if you do the study guide beforehand, otherwise, you will bomb the tests. DO THE STUDY GUIDE",1
"I don't usually give bad reviews but avoid this guy. The group projects were a nightmare. He wanted the class to feel ""real world"" by assigning you to a random group. At one point he thought about making each group ""fire"" a person and then he was going to make another group of the rejects. Lucky that didn't happen. Again don't take him.",0
"Overcomplicates all of the topics, going to class hurts more than it helps. He burns through the material, and the review sessions and practice midterms had nothing to do with the actual test. Gives lots of notes and examples in class, but uses totally different ones on the homework. Would not recommend",0
"Mr. Burt does need to structure his lectures better, but he is not a bad prof. if u expect an A/B in any college class w/o touching the book & only going off some lecture slides and hw, ull never get the grade. If u read the book, & do the hw + the additional probs he gives, ur good. DONT CRAM. The material is not hard but requires time to master",1
"Final exam essay is worth 40%. Apparently, my fall class only had to write a 1000 word essay. Other class have to write 4-5 500 word short essays. A lot of material in 8 weeks, esp online. He personally called me to help though with the final essay. Made me feel more confident. Lined up pretty well with History 1301.",1
Great lectures however the tests are graded completely unfairly by his group of 4 other graders so there is no consistency.  if you can afford the high probability of a C  the material is worth it.,1
She is the best professor I've ever had. She stays on topic and always keeps the lecture super interesting. Very understanding with household problems and will flex to help your succeed.,1
You think it is an easy class until he piles all of the stuff at the end.  An alright teacher.,0
"I love Barbara Wilson! She's very knowledgeable, extremely polite, caring, and thoughtful, and tells great stories. I wish I had her for 111, and wish I could take her for 113.",1
"He doesn't give any time in class for lab, even though there states that there is a time designated for lab. He just breezes through the lecture and expects you to be good with the coding. Doesn't teach coding at all, and expects you to do the labs on your own. There are 4 labs, and one final exam and no homework.",0
"This class was awesome. Very interesting. He did a take home final which was super easy and interesting. There were online quizzes where you could use lecture notes so read carefully. He gave a lot of in class assignments and extra credit. He's funny and all around an understanding, awesome guy. Make sure you go on the cruise though!",1
"her tests are difficult. Even with the ability to look at notes since its an online course, students still did bad because she words her questions odd and makes them difficult to understand. She also grades harshly on the research paper even though its a short, 4 page paper that should have been an easy A. Not an easy online course to take.",0
"Certain topics introduced in ECE 241, such as bit masking, weren't clearly explained by Dr. Day. This required me to go out and research them for myself outside of class. (not necessarily a bad thing!) Dr. Day would occasionally go off on tangents during lectures that were interesting but not part of the curriculum. He is a very fair grader.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
Dr. Kelley is a overall good person but as a Professor she stern and the quizzes can be confusing and hard to pass. She grades her discussion boards thoroughly and harsh. Extra credit is hard to get as well. I cant recommend her for a 1010 class.,0
"I agree that Dr. Childs does NOT know logic. If you have her for a logic course, I advise you switch, she makes it more difficult than necessary.",0
Attended 3 weeks of lecture and then resorted to the homework website to learn everything. Reads out of the book and is very hard to follow. I took this class online and his hand writing was unreadable.,0
"Caring professional, but extremely difficult to keep up during lecture. Comes across as if unprepared and her dry method of facilitation does not help. She has conflicting information on her syllabus and seemingly is using a previous version of text and material; confuses students. Highly encouraged to avoid this professor.",0
"I dont know why he has such a low rating, he isnt even that bad. I was worried about taking him cuz it seemed like he was hard but that is not the case. His lectures are clear and his quizzes and test are based off of homework. I passed with an A, and it wasnt difficult to do so.",1
"He is a good prof, yes his class is lecture heavy, but the long term paper and weekly reading assignments are pretty normal for any history class. The history final is graded very fairly. It is worth 40% of your grade and is graded as such. Not a paper you should leave for the last night. Weekly quizzes are all on quizlet so they are easy to do.",1
"DO not take this professor she is rude and does not care about students doing well in her class. She is not helpful and gives you homework every week, TAKE another professor!!",0
"Her class was so easy. Wrote 2, 1 page essays all year. When you had class all you would do is answer a few textbook questions and she grades very easily!",1
She's a sweetheart and very clear with her explanations. Definitely a great teacher.,1
"She doesn't try to help you when you need it.She graded an assignment I turned in 2x by mistake 2 completely different grades, A AND C!It seemed liked the more questions I tried to ask,the worse my grades were!When I told her I was going to speak to the Dean, she said she would report me 1st and it would get me no where because she was the teacher.",0
"Not very well prepared for class.  We spent most of the class time waiting on him to get his stuff ready and the rest of it talking about things that didn't apply to anything remotely related to the course material.  Tests somewhat difficult, but not too bad.",0
The class is not really that useful. No one really learns anything directly from this class. I would not recommend unless you already have decent knowledge of everything in the book beforehand,0
"This professor was by far the worst of my entire academic career. Lectures are irrelevant. If you are unfortunate and are taking this class, she posts all of her power points on Beach Board and attendance isn't mandatory. Take this time to read the book because this is what you will be tested on. Great personality. Terrible instructor.",0
"When I took this class years ago I hated it and didn't understand anything in the class. Now that I look back on it he had the right idea of covering the material he did. He is a nice guy if you talk to him, just can't explain things well. I passed the CPA exam and this class helped make studying for the exam a little easier. I have had worse.",1
She is a great advisor. And I enjoy being in her class.,1
crazy... too strict on attendance.. too much work...,0
The interesting thing about this teacher is the wide breath and depth of his knowledge. He links together ideas and thinkers in unusual ways. Cares about ideas and the life of the mind and makes you see how important those are to a full life. You need to do the reading and attend class. He does not go over readings like so many professors.,1
"Bliss is so helpful and really strives to allow students to do well. I wouldnt use Skoolers, it honestly doesnt help much for this class. Just know how to do the homework and attend the study sessions and youll get an A!",1
"Her test are HARD!  I made 100 on ALL of her assignments, which are a breeze, but the test are crazy hard!  And if you take the online class be prepared to have to come in for EVERY test...kinda misses the point of online classes!",0
Class has no structure. He comes in with a vague idea of what he wants to teach and he goes all over the place when he starts teaching. Writing on board is all over the place and it's difficult to understand and follow. Has a lot of proofs that he explains once and himself didn't know what was going to be on the exam. Expects us to upper div math.,0
"I was in a 3-hour long lecture and I did not learn anything. He gives and outrageous amount of reading and does not make sure that you genuinely understand the information. He isn't  very concerned with how you do in his class and takes attendance randomly by asking students to answer questions. It's a boring, frustrating class, would not suggest.",0
"Overly anal with grading labs. Cares mostly how organized everything is/how neat it looks. Always finds ways to mark you down,even when tons of effort is put in.Almost impossible for an A out of lab.Partial credit not given on much of tests.It brings your grade down quite a bit. Handwriting very sloppy & fast, makes it hard to get problems right",0
"Professor Tang is amazing! Her lectures are engaging, and she was always willing to help out. I wouldn't consider English a strength of mine, but she was a pretty easyfair grader. Only two papers and one final paper for the class. ",1
"I felt like I was getting a lot out of the text/discussion boards until I took the midterm which completely plummeted my grade. I'm a senior, and an A student. Studied very hard for this test. Questions are very tricky. I didn't feel like the exam was testing my knowledge, but rather, trying to trick me.",0
"Her lectures are based from the textbook so I suggest reading the textbook ahead of time then going to lecture for a clearer understanding. Your grade is based off of 3 exams, 1 group project and a few other assignments, but the assignments vary depending if you have her large lecture or smaller class.",1
"Her lectures are unfocused and you MUST go to class in order to get the information needed to pass. She is enthusiastic about it, but her voice tends to be monotone/soothing so try not to fall asleep...Good luck....",0
"If you've taken ENG 308, here it is again...I think Pam tried to switch things up a little bit, but it was hard to see over the sarcasm and fake smiles.  Good luck!",0
"I had him as my prof; when he loses his temper, he will become a wild aggressive attacker. why is he teaching us?",0
"Professor Felber set the standard for what feedback should be in an online course.  I've only taken 10 online courses so far, but Felber was by far the most helpful professor that I've had.  Her work isn't the easiest, but she is very fair and consistent with her grading.",1
"Honestly, this is one of the best professors here in Cal State Long Beach. no idea why people are saying bad things about this professor. Yes, he makes the class difficult, really difficult. But his explanations are always accurate and concise. If you want to pass, you have to study before lecture; considering 229 is an abstract class. 326 is fun!",1
hard but good,1
Worst Professor at the Citadel. Boring as watching  paint dry. Uses every second of class for terrible lectures. Makes everyone uncomfortable by asking gotcha questions. All academic background with no real world experience. Avoid him at all cost. Little man syndrome run wild.,0
"Professor Olssen is a solid professor, but a tough grader. Guidelines aren't as clear as they can be and comments aren't very helpful. She is, however, a very nice person.",1
"He's so critical when it comes to marking. I got an A+ on my last marketing class, but now in his class I barely passed (this was everyone's problem with him). I will never take his class again. On the other hand, he's a good professor. He teaches really well.",0
"Avoid at all costs! Will tell you to do things one way and then mark you wrong for doing it. I had to turn in 2 homework assignments late because I was sick and he gave me zeroes on both of them because they were ""late"".",0
"The professor taught an online course that was not ADA or 508 compliant. The course had only five assignments in the grade-boo and absolutely no online discussions. If the course ended on a Monday, no assignments were graded until the Saturday before, two days before the course ended.",0
"Professor Wood is just amazing overall! I was really indecisive at first when choosing a professor for my Comstd 2 class because I saw mixed reviews but I'm really glad I chose her. She wants you to succeed! There are 3 speeches, 3 exams, a few quizzes (about 4) and the homework is really easy. Remember to practice, practice, practice!!!!",1
"I enjoyed lectures, even though they were sometimes boring. This professor is a tough grader and the material isn't easy, but he is really good at teaching.",1
Not only does he not curve but a 90% is a B+; how messed up is that? His grading scale actually makes it harder to get an A.  All of the other science classes I have taken have either the normal grading scale or they make an A 87% and above then scale off of that. He is not interested in seeing his students do well.,0
"You can tell Sam is a very smart man, and he genuinely enjoys what he teaches. However lectures are very unstructured and don't follow any slides. You have to pay close attention to catch what's important. If you get a good GSI (which i did not) your discussion section will help you acheive the grade you want. You HAVE to go to lecture to do well.",1
"We only had class twice a week (instead of the scheduled three) because the project is 49% of the grade, but the result was that barely any class time was spent on the material, even though the majority of the textbook was assigned. He changed the project guidelines every time he was asked about them and there was no syllabus for the course. Avoid.",0
"ACCENT HEAVY! I could never understand her, she was constantly asked to repeat herself due to her accent! She would also get frustrated when questions were asked about material. She is a sweet lady, but I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for a quality education.",0
"I took TV production this year and I am learning nothing! Molloy is such a joke for TV and Film. They should call the class, TV production for Dummies. This is a TV, it is square, anything techncal I have no idea how to teach. Talk about a teacher who is crying out for students to like him. Maybe he should change his teaching style and be a so call",0
Great professor. He is very knowledgeable and fair grader.  I would recommend this course.,1
Bruh.,0
"I took this class last semester, and it was terrible. I expected to actually learn. And all I did was read the entire book. This teacher literally reads off slides and expects you to know everything on the test with a little bit of help of a study guide. I wouldn't recommend him at all. Not worth your money!!",0
"I had her for both lecture and lab. She was great for the lectures: her powerpoints and videos were detailed and helpful. With the lab however, she graded extremely hard and did not give helpful feedback. I would not take her again due to this as it brought my overall biology grade down.",1
"For the love of God, do not take him! If you didn't know, he is a world-renowned physicist (not exaggerating), and he is forced to teach so that he can keep his research money flowing in. So please, DO NOT take him! He only cares about his research. His tests are 3 questions (9 parts), and he doesn't curve, even if the class average is a 40. AVOID!",0
"Class was extremely difficult. Attendance is not mandatory and really does not help much other than that he might touch on a couple of conceptual points that may or may not help. Most of the learning needs to be done solving the book problems (Do as many as possible, not just assigned ones). He curves a lot but still easy to fail. Tough subject.",0
"Ms. Booth's class was really easy. She is helpful and an easy grader. Yes, it is a boring class, but the notes are literally word-for-word on the tests. Also, she gave examples that made the concepts easier to understand.",1
"Good professor. You will want to shoot yourself though if you're not into poetry and creative writing, as this is what the literature class evolved into.",1
Dr. Boden's intro to field methods class is HARD. He is an extremely tough grader. He expects your reports to be like those of a professional. Having said that you will learn a TON in this class. The level of knowledge you will get from this 260 class is superior to UNR's 260 class. Just be ready to spend 12 hours on a report and  to get a C on it.,1
"He's great to take for an animation class, but when you suck at drawing, you better drop the class. He is absolutely impossible to talk to outside of class, and his classroom wasn't the greatest focus environment for me, so I only attended if there was something important. He doesn't really tell you what he grades on either. Just gives you a grade.",0
Ram does a great job at making his class as interactive as he can considering the current pandemic. He is always willing to help out any student as he wants us all so succeed. He gave a handful of quizzes and assignments but nothing too crazy. Exams and quizzes are easy if you study and go to class.,1
"Accelerated 2 mo. course. Very hard class. Wasn't much instructions throughout the course. More of a go do it, better be great at it or you're getting a bad grade. The amount of material you are expected to learn throughout this course is ridiculous! Quizzes are EXTREMELY hard! & do not try google. 4 Quizzes. 1 Research Paper. 5 Discussion Boards. ",0
I would recommend her! Very helpful. Explains things very well. In class assignments and homeworks are pretty straight forward. Three exams. The first exam I found difficult just because she has to throw so much at you but the next two are pretty easy. Loved her class! She's passionate at she does and she knows her sports!,1
Tests are much harder than presented material in class.,0
"As a person, Mark is a nice guy who genuinely wants to help. His class, though, is difficult. There are only three exams (each worth 20%) and a final exam with 6 homework assignments. So, if you don't do well on one exam - you're screwed. I heard he is much better in person but if you are taking this class through ZoomU...",1
"Dr. Lyall is informative, knows how to reach students, and makes difficult material accessible. The homework is easy and he's very reasonable and approachable. It's great to have a counseling professor who ""walks the talk"". He actually works in this field and what he teaches is based on experience, not just theory. Take his class! He's excellent.",1
"He is a great teacher, but he isn't organized at all. It took one of the students going to the dean just to get our grades to be put online. He always talks about how our class is in the way of his other classes hes teaching. You do homework and do the lesson the week after. I have a B in the class but its hard teaching ourselves. A&P1",0
"One of the worst decisions you could make in your life to take this prof. Unintelligible, lacks knowledge, and his lectures are all over the place. He shows us useless videos and you literally cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. Project/labs are difficult and asks for more than what he teaches. Literally regret taking him so much.",0
"I dont use this ever, but here I am to warn you to not take David Stone. His average on his exam was a 47% (the first was a 58%), and the final was a 51%. He refused to say what the final exam average was until I asked the TA. He literally sent out a PDF explaining he's not fair bc life isn't fair and hence he wouldn't curve and to just suck it up",0

"One of the best teachers I've had regardless of level. He makes class a joy to go to. Flexible on when the midterms are and he really encourages class discussions. He's also funny as hell, not a class goes by that's not entertaining. Very quotable too.",1
Awesome professor and one of the  best experiences I have had so far at a Math class in UT. His lectures are really helpful and fun and most of the questions on the quizzes and tests are the ones that he has solved in class. Make sure to take notes as it helps a ton during tests and quizzes.,1
"This isn't my hardest class but I'm failing it. I suck at math and I know it, yet I can do molar conversions in chemistry and have a difficult time understanding stats. She sucks at this. Don't take her unless you like teaching yourself. Never gives any study guides for exams and there's a quiz every week. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL FAIL!!!!!!!",0
"Dave is a quick teacher for 141 and 142. He makes you work for it. He goes through material fast and you will need to study outside of class. However, he responds to emails in a timely manner and will make time outside of class for you. He's also flexible if you ask. Do your homework, do the reviews, and the book tests, and you'll get an A!",1
"Dr. Osborne is an amaizng teacher. I had him for ENG 105 and then decided to take his 311 class also. He is hard in the aspect that he does expect you to dig deep into the readings, but I love to do that so it was ok. His grading is harsh sometimes, but as long as you are trying hard he is pretty lenient to help you out grade wise",1
I recommend everyone to take her for ENG 1O1 or ENG 102 if you can. She's literally the best English professor I had. All you have to do is attend class and do all the papers she assigns and do well on the exams and you'll pass. She really cares about her students and tries her best to make sure everyone can get a passing grade.,1
"I took Professor Jewell my senior year for Comp 2. She is an extremely hard grader. She assigns very long papers. She doesn't put your grades on PAL until the very last day of the semester, so I didn't know I was failing until about 2 weeks before the semester ended. She doesn't ever help out, and she's strict on attendance. She will drop you!!",0
"if u dont get biology, DO NOT take this class with her!  she should not be teaching a class designed for NON bio major people!  she uses biological terms each class which arent in the book. (only bio people would know them) exams are HARD!!!!",0
"The class was incredibly easy. I took the class online through dual enrollment. My only complaint was that he was slow to grade essays. by the final week, only 1 of 4 essays had been graded for me so i received very little feedback for the final research paper. Other than that, I would recommend for an easy A.",1
"Deb was an amazing prof, she taught me alot about website design and got me to understand the purpose of the work I was doing. She is also one of the most understanding profs at Ryerson. As long as you do your work and pay attention in class you will do amazing!",1
Staples is a nice guy be expects way too much. Multiple assignments will often be due the same day making it a heavy workload. Lectures are incredibly lengthy and would be a lot shorter and more bearable if he didn't talk about himself so much. The midterms are actually pretty hard; they consist of one essay question and a multiple choice section.,0
"This class is very interesting but her methods of grading are horrendous. She gives you the questions she will ask on the midterm and goes over the answers in lecture, but even when writing all that out and more from the textbook she says it's ""too vague"". She is very hard to talk to about how to improve, and lectures are VERY disorganized.",0
"Professor Perez is a solid instructor. She can be a little snappy sometimes, but she means well. She's tough on attendance and gives minimal but easy hmwk assignments. She also gives extra credit opportunities. Her exams are all info from the slides she lectures in class. Show up, take notes, ask questions (when needed) and you'll do fine.",1
"CHIEUX  !!! pas de classe, commentaires ****es. pédophile, emmerdeur, ne connait rien a sa matiere et veut faire croire qu'il est connaisseur !",0
Really fun prof. Made French grammar interesting. I am excited to take another course from her!,1
"He is mean to the students taking his class, vague while presenting his lectures (at times reading off the slides directly or editing his slides on the spot), and inconsistent in his teaching.  While emphasizing the importance of responsibility, it took him over two months to grade our papers and exams. Each week was a new excuse. Avoid",0
"Professor Wisner is the best English teacher, hands down. Take him for any English class, I promise you won't regret it. ) I've taken him for all mine and wish he taught higher level ones. :( He even dropped a test at the end of the semester which saved me. He is very clear with what he wants each week and the reading and discussions are easy.",1
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"Ok class but being Philosophy you'd think it'd be more serious than just how you 'feel'.  I would prefer if his quizzes and tests actually had to with concepts rather than just to see if you read the book. E.g. ""what was the gender of the protagonist's friend?"" Instead of the actual point of the story. That's what makes this class hard. ",1
"She would be great for high school.
 
 PS her name is spelled Miiller.",0
She is very harsh and a tough grader. Don't be humiliated. She has a lot of expectations. Doesn't give proper instructions. Horrible professor.,0
This professor is spastic and overworked. She does not reply to e mails and has no office hours. Her lectures offer no help on how to teach science and she is often side tracked with off topic stories. She grades hard on senseless things like reflections. Her assignments are not clearly defined. The class was not relevant. I was disappointed.,0
"Prof Allen is an amazing lecturer, EPSC20 is perfect for people who aren't very good at science, he was very understanding and accommodated coursework multiple times during the pandemic. Work is very easy, just stay on top of it and you'll be fine. I didn't do the readings and still passed. Just make sure you understand concepts and history.",1
"His lab rocks! Most main-lecture profs are demonic in lab, but King is great! Grading is easy and classes are short and much less stressful than the other sections. Take this class!",1
David is one of the best professors I have had at Iowa. He truly cares about teaching his students how to be successful in the business world. He doesnt succumb to the political correct safe space speech many teachers unfortunately have adopted. Great guy that knows business. Take his class but be ready to engage or you will not enjoy it.,1
Bob is wonderful and he provides lots of extra credit to help get a great grade. This is a fun and informative class.,1
Really great professor! He tries his best to make lectures fun and interesting. His grading system is very fair and as long as you do all the work its a real easy A. He does his best to help you learn and to help you with anything you don't understand. Very relaxed guy.,1
"this is a research writing class so prepare to write like all the time. she gives good feedback and wants your papers to be good so that helps, if you go to class and just listen to her instructions on the different sections you will understand. Sometimes the class meetings are pointless, but its the not worse thing",1
"I basically taught myself this entire course. He wrote the book himself so it didn't make any difference to go to his class. The material is already so dry, his monotonous voice made even worse. Nice prof but my GPA suffered from this class.",0
"Definitely worth taking this course. His accent is 100% understandable. All of his teaching materials were self-curated (much better than a regurgitated textbook), and always used interesting, relevant examples. Choose partners carefully for your team project. Overall, a great experience (enough to seek out this professor for other courses).",1
This class is definitely a GPA booster. There are weekly assignments but it is only 1-2 pages doubled spaced. One group poster presentation which is easy. One final philosophy paper that has to be 5-7 pages. This class is not hard. No exams.,1
"HARD! does not explain material very well. goes way to fast.  He is so smart that he does not understand basic questions.  SO SMART.  he is funny and a nice guy. you really need to stay on top of things, and you can go to him for help. It's just SOOO much is thrown at you, and fast.",0
"Do not take qualitative methods with him. Your grade is based on three assignments which he does not give instructions on. I'm not even kidding, the final assignment was worth 45% of the final mark, and he gave out a 4 word outline - NO GUIDELINES. Between Turcotte and the TA, there was so much contradicting information given out.",0
"I read the book 3 times, yet the test had no questions from the book. The second test was word for word from quizlet, but the 3rd test had none from quizlet. I have no idea where she gets her questions or what exactly she wants us to know. Difficult is not even the word for her confusing expectations.",0
"He's a terrible professor. His transition from lecture to HW to tests makes no sense. I did so poorly in his class that he made me reconsider my entire major. DO NOT TAKE!!!! His entire class was a waste of time. If you have him, switch!! He has to curve ridiculous amounts and even admitted there were questions on the test none of us could answer.",0
Shes so mean!!! Humiliates her students in front of the class and makes them feel dumb. I left her cpr class wanting to cry. She talks to her students like kids who are in trouble with their parents,0
"This class was a lot of fun. Learning through power points, labs, and lectures. Lectures were presented in a perfect order to allow for a deeper understanding of the biology of our environment. Labs were engaging and unique. Dissecting an owl pellet was my favorite lab. Professor Donahue cares about all her students and supports their successes.",1
"Took History of Paper Structure in the Spring. Amazing class, not too much reading and you really end up with a LOT of handmade paper that you can do anything with! Great for printmaking majors. There is enough time to come in outside class and do more work if you really enjoy it!",1
Cares about her students. If you show that you care about your grade she will be flexible.,1
He is the best math professor I have ever had. Would highly recommend choosing him does not require textbook and does not assign homework.,1
"He is honestly the greatest man you will ever meet. Unless you dont like fun! Yeah he gets off topic sometimes, but hes honestly crazy and its awesome!",1
Dr. Little's Cultural Anthropology class is completely unfair and ridiculous. His test are all short answer and he does not clearly specify what is going to be on the test. (The test are 12 chapters long) There is only one way to do things in his class and it is HIS way. I would not recommend taking him as a professor for any course at CIU.,0
"Took during winter intersession and it was pretty easy. Two case studies, two midterms, and one final. All of it is easy as you can easily skim through the book for nktes and answers. Exams were given a two hour limit and had 20 questions each. Professor Shan is helpful since she reminds the class deadlines.",1
Very nice professor. Always ready to help. I took an online class and never felt like that I am in an online class. Always ready to meet you and very fast in replying emails. I would love to take class with him again and again.,1
"When you think of Ethics it sounds boring at first, but Nuneville does her best and succeeds at keeping students interested and engaged! I loved her and as she is someone working in this field it was nice to learn more about her experiences. You should expect a group project (easy) and 2 tests (yes, study) Tip for enjoying this class: Participate",1
"Currently in my last quarter at  UCI, I can firmly say that Gilmore was one of the worst sociology lecturers I ever had. Often cuts off students and even the TA. Wants things done his way and his way only. A total dinosaur who does not listen to students but instead patronizes them throughout the lecture. A nightmare for the 3 hr. majors seminar.",0
"If you learn well from a teacher who sits behind a projector all class, scribbling on paper, she's your lady.  Half the time you could barely see what she was writing when she was going through examples. Horrible class.",0
"Engelhardt knows his stuff. If you participate in class, it'll help your odds. However, you NEED to study a lot to do well on exams. (6-8 hours for a typical exam is fair for his class). His practice exams will take you by surprise compared to the actual exams. So ask questions, and you might just be successful. Exams have HUGE curves (10-20%).",0
"I wish I knew of this site before taking this teacher.  She is often late for class,  late returning assignments, totally off schedule, lecture has very little to do with English or readings.  Not very personable. Loses your assignments, extremely disorganized. i would not recommend her.",0
"Was really excited to take Leverson as a professor because I had heard that she was great. Was really disappointed because I genuinely didn't learn that much from her, all she did was read off of powerpoints and the study guides that she claimed would be helpful did nothing for the test. Will not take another class of hers.",0
If you have the chance to take him as a teacher I would avoid him. He makes makes things WAY harder than they should be. He gives plenty of worksheets and practice problems to prepare us for tests and then makes the tests unnecessarily hard. Elementary Math should not be a hard topic to teach but he makes it more complicated than it should be.,0
"Terrible teaching ability, nice guy, but the class was a huge frustration, I learned little and there is no lecture just presentations, he needs more organization and teaching ability, he thought he was making the class easy but was making it more difficult.",0
She gives you freedom to choose each speech topic so that you can talk about something you are passionate about. This makes the class a lot more interesting because you can take time to learn more about what you care about as well as hear a lot of interesting information from other students. ,1
I really don't understand the bad reviews. He is very fair with grading. He will take the time to explain things if you need it. He is passionate about chemistry and really wants his students to learn. He will take the time to explain things to you and keeps at it until you get it.,1
"I loved Professor Lamprey. She is such a sweetheart. All the work for this course is online, everything is straight forward and clear and she is always there if you need help. She also adds points to each exam. It is basically impossible to fail if you do the work and do it well. This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. ",1
"She is more of an English teacher than she is music. If you occasionally mistype something, I would not suggest this teacher. I tried reaching out but she rarely responded. When she did, she always had an attitude.",0
"She's a good teacher. I didn't mind having her, but she always had a lot of homework. She is very lenient on the homework though.",1
"Never disagreed more with an art teacher's teaching style. I've had art teachers in the past that simply irk me because their strict guidelines disallowed students from truly expressing themselves through their projects, but Besemer completely discouraged me from wanting to complete her assignments bc of how particular she was abt the outcomes.",0
"Easily one of the best ECE professors at Purdue. I dropped his class the first time because it was so tough for me but my second time around I was able to pass with flying colors and learned so much. He truly is a one of a kind professor and even if you think his class is hard, let him show you the way.",1
"Awesome dude. He speaks a lot about God because it PERTAINS to the readings, not because he just feels like it. He made the readings very interesting and made me want to read as time went on. He's very chill and likes it when you talk with him in class for discussions. Slackers won't do well, if you try, you'll be good. Do the journals!",1
"I've loved all four of the Spanish professors I've had so far at UNT, but she has to be my favorite. Her class isn't super easy, but you will come out of her class SO much better at Spanish. She is always willing to help you and talk to you after class, she teaches things in ways that totally make sense, and she brought us homemade cake twice.",1
"Wonderful teacher, made a tough subject easy to understand. Pay attention and you will pass. Better than other electricity teachers on campus or so I've heard. Make your life a lot easier and take this class.",1
"This class was an Easy A. Dr. Guerra was really good about extending deadlines and making assignments easier for the class. I didn't really learn too much honestly, the content could've been covered in 2 or 3 classes instead of the first semester. Very easy grader, I got A's on everything and she really understands the content. I would suggest her.",1
"This was the most challenging online class I've ever taken! Notes- don't have much info Tests- Not easy to understand (75 Qs, 15 Point), most of the time the notes didn't even have the answer Exercises- long and really confusing (3-5 pgs, 1 point) Discussion Qs- 5-6 Qs asked, you answer 2, long and time consuming! 1 point Save yourself #Honest",0
"Dr. Wilhite is an extremely difficult professor. She's hard to learn from, but if you're interested, you're guaranteed to receive good grades.",0
"Mr Butman is probably the worst teacher ever, drop out before you regret it .",0
"Dean Robiniwich is the best professor I hve ever had. I reccomend to take as many classes from him as you can. He is a huge part of the enviroment in the school, always welcoming and helpful. His classes are geared towards bar passage. He is friendly and helpful and makes this school a great place.",1
Dixon-Brown or DB as we call her gives out a lot of group assignments. Her class is by no means easy but it will definitely help you in the long run. Her projects require community involvement and her quizzes are sporadic. Be ready to work hard and step out of your comfort zone.,1
"He is a very smart guy, but I personally did not really enjoy his lecture style, he gives very long powerpoints (100+ slides) and you have a 3-4 of those for every test. He's not very good at condensing and simplifying his material. All the material on the tests are in his lecture slides, however there is a lot of material so that is not a big help",1
"Brace seems nice at first look, but she's not as cute as she appears. Her lectures are VERY boring, and she never comes to class prepared. She wings half the things she says most of the time. Grading wise, it's confusing. One paper she could be an easy marker, the next it seems like she didn't even read it.",0
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
"He is not an easy professor, you have to take a 3.5 hour test and then a quiz as soon as you walk into class. His quiz are very hard, 95% of the class fail them. You have to memorize 3 to 4 chapters and lectures. He is very hard headed and the questions are created to make you fail. He admitted he enjoys making people squirm. Don't recommend",0
"When you take Honors 210 do yourself a favor and do not take White's & Ritzenhoff's section. Before, this class was only taught by Ritzenhoff, which everyone said was fun. This was the first year with White & she was awful. Gives no assignment guidelines, not available for help with assignments, and then has audacity to tell you not to worry Awful",0
I am generally a very competent student; I have done well with my classes up till now. Ams just does a terrible job explaining things in class. He makes frequent mistakes in lectures. He is very unsympathetic to students who struggle and made me feel like an idiot at office hours. My classmates tell me that he is very unavailable for them.,0
"Took my Inq. Seminar with Professor Bullock. This guy is super helpful and becasue of him I really enjoyed working on my seminar. His comments are really helpful, and I enjoyed this class more than most other history classes I took, despite not really having much interest in Washington and the Cherry Tree (at the beginning of the class).",1
Horrible professor. Dont take him. Very disrespectful and rude to students for no reason. Grades too hard and assigns difficult work.,0
he does NOT teach but super easy A. few journals in class which he barely reads. research paper which he barely read and book review which he did read but all very easy ,0
"The textbook used is terrible and doesn't have an answer key online, the homework isn't properly graded so you can't track your progress, her accent makes it hard to understand lectures, and she assumes we know everything so resorts to writing ""duh"" on the board instead of explaining concepts. For a potential math major, she is a wrong choice.",0
"I passed this class, with little to no help from adam. He speaks in monotone, is extremely difficult to get a hold of, and is extremely vague with his explanations. i tried going to his office hours, but both times he was not there. homework every night but thats expected. Good luck!",0
"Doesn't teach, just reads off of slides. There are vague questions on the exams and he expects you to write down details that he never asked for. Do not take if you value your mental health.",0
"I took 3d Design with him. A genuine guy that loves what he does. Just don't take this class expecting an easy A. His projects make you think analytically and critically, and when it comes time for his infamous critiques, be prepared for criticism. He gives plenty of class time to develop your ideas and is always ready to help if you need him.",1
Inexperienced Boring Lacks context,0
"Great teacher, makes Math understandable for the Math challenged!",1
"You have to go to lecture, and if you don't, you won't be able to catch up easily. The slides are unorganized, and she throws out too much information without enough time to copy it down// nothing makes sense. She doesn't clarify what she means or elaborate on points either.",1
"Professor Mahallati provided practical material that most students are able to use in a variety of other courses/fields. Her course outline and curriculum was clear and user friendly, and she took time to explain the concepts. Enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it.",1
"I had Dr. Guerra for Media Performance 1 and he is absolutely incredible! He's an experienced professional AND he knows how to teach in a way that's engaging, exciting, interactive, and inspiring. Great training for aspiring TV hosts/reporters/anchors/performers/actors. Takes time to give you detailed, helpful feedback. So much respect for Dr. G",1
great professor,1
"never take this class, we learned things in class, and BAM they were not on the exam. very one sided and did not care to hear her opinions.",0
Wish there was another professor to teach this course at Fresno state. She doesn't offer plenty of extra credit which seems reasonable considering her test are extremely hard. You need to study so much for this class. She's tough on her students and expect you to know everything.,0
Wouldn't suggest to anyone,0
"Microbiology is freaking hard. Hardest course I have ever taken and I have excelled at college level courses. He's very understanding and tries to work with you, honestly, a really nice guy! It's not his fault that the material is difficult. He did a good job with dense, hard to understand material.",1
"she is a nice woman, means well, however: she is a VERY VERY POOR teacher. In fact, she doesnt teach. she goes over grammer in the book. explains horribly. responds to every question with: ""IT JUST IS"". though she is very knowledgable (speaks over 6 languages!) she is NOT recommended.",0
"I took his online class over the winter session. it consisted of a group project, reading a few chapters a week, a discussion forum per chapter, and then a unit test per week. Tests are easy as long as you read the material and take good notes, but it is A LOT of reading. Put in effort and you will pass. Overall, great professor, I learned a lot!",1
"Professor O'Quinn is an extremely knowledgeable professor who knows what he is talking about. However, I found his lectures very hard to follow & did not know what points he was trying to get across a lot of the time. His assignments are ambitious & unclear but he is very approachable and brilliant. Take a class with him if you want a challenge.",0
"I was honestly worried about taking this class because it's notoriously hard, but it isn't that bad. You have three HTML coding assignments for your website, a midterm and a final. The tests are pretty difficult, requires you to really read the book and study. Part of them are hard multiple choice and then coding. She does offer extra credit.",1
"There is not enough great things I can say about Professor Chase! You definitely should show up to every class because his lectures are very helpful for exams. But honestly his lectures are so interesting that you will want to show up every class and he tells you exactly what you should study. A True Gem of a Professor, 100% recommend!",1
"Don't take this class...ridiculous amount of material that all seems irrelevant. I'm not afraid of hard work...but 50+ pages per class period is a graduate course. He's rather rude, kinda degrading, his TA for the section is just as terrible and obnoxious so that didn't help. Listen to the ratings for this professor regardless of interest level.",0
"She cares a lot about her students. She likes to know you by name. She has an extra credit opportunity before school even started for 242. That saved my butt. If you ask for help, she will help you. The Lectures are fun!",1
"He assumes you have had experience with coding even though this is an intro class. Tells you to look at Arduino reference pages, which are helpful but you need to learn how to code essentially on your own.",1
"*This course was taken during the Spring 2020 Covid-19 pandemic* Prof. Davidovitch would be much better suited to teach graduate level courses than a second-year physics course. His lectures were confusing and too fast-paced, assuming students already knew more than they did. A great person, but made the course material too difficult.",0
"Show up to class and youll pass, few quizzes usually pretty easy. Does talk a lot in class occasionally will go off topic but eventually will get back to his point. Definitely would take him again though, learned more with him than with my first semester professor.",1
general physics 1 and 2. hard but he scales it so everyone does okay by the end. could be more clear - lectures can be boring. do the study guide problems before exams and try to remember concepts. final was insanely hard but he scaled it so it worked itself out.,0
"He did have some pretty math jokes, and he liked to tell the history of what we learned about.  He didn't really explain anything else.  He would just quickly go through everything without stopping to explain his steps.  Also, his examples did not really help for the homework, and the quizzes were different than both homework and the lecture.",0
You really will work for your grade more than any other class honestly. Try Not to take her class if you have a lot of other classes as well her class requires a lot of time. Studying is mandatory as well good luck youll need it.,0
"Dr. Tops has taken over EGRE 206 and its an improvement from previous professors. Hes very interesting, you wont be bored. But time can be spent more so going over concepts than doing practice problems when in a class like this practice problems help the most. TAs can grade harsh and somewhat unfair, but will give points back. Good class overall",1
Fun class!,1
He is very knowledgeable about the subject. There are only three quizzes and one group presentation that's the entire course work. No homework at all and exams. He is easy. It's an easy A class with this prof he wants students to learn. Would recommend him 100%.,1
"Although i can't stand to listen to him s-l-o-w-l-y p-r-o-n-o-u-n-c-e e-v-e-r-y w-o-r-d, he is very nice, and practically throws the marks at you.  A little dedication is all you need to get an A (Practically no chemistry knowledge required!).",0
American Government is the worst class ever period point blank. Luckily Mr. Swint is a pretty good teachers his classes are just a bit boring because all he does is lecture and you have no homework or in class assignments. Class is manageable he gives a lot of extra credit and if you just study and take good notes the tests are passable.,1
"I have taken her class for both pre-modern and post-modern Japanese history. Though her lectures can tend to be disorganized she is truly passionate about Japanese history and culture, and offers fascinating perspectives. There is a lot of reading, yet it is fascinating material. Would recommend to anyone truly passionate about Japan studies.",1
"I took her class during the pandemic, so it was online, but I had an amazing experience. She really cares about her students and tries her best to make sure we learn the information. She gives great feedback on rough drafts and is also open to suggestions for her class. Prentiss truly pays attention to how the class learns and adjusts accordingly.",1
Take this class if you have to take psych and its not important to your major. Easy A if you do the paper. You dont really have to do good on the paper. She scaled all of our quizzes since everyone scored so low (no one got above a 70). If you really care about psych and want to learn it. Then do not take this class because you wont learn,0
"This was my first class at ASU and it shook me to the core. He is a nice and caring guy but I don't see connections between the lectures and the tests. IF YOU DON'T DO THE READINGS, YOU WILL FAIL THE TESTS. For this class you will a lot of writing and it doesn't get easier. If you form study groups for test then your grade will definitely improve.",0
"Yes, this teacher was very funny. But he was more concerned with quickly cramming   information than going over problems to help the class understand. Answering questions was either hit or miss depending on the amount of topic he had left to cover that day. Maybe not the teaching style that works best for me but I didn't feel like I learned a thing",0
"He's the kind of guy that will stay two hours after his office hour ends just to listen to you cry about your problems, and still motivate you to be the best version of yourself. One of my best friends and he's my professor. One of the coolest guys I've ever met.",1
"very unorganized, and i hate group projects, and in this class everything is a group project",0
"Humber is one of the funniest professors at the school. He is very helpful, and spends most of the class time going over examples. His office hours are very helpful, especially right before tests, as he will literally tell you whats going to be on it. Great teacher. Calc is not an easy class, but taking it with Humber will help your grade. ",1
She is an amazing teacher. You get reflective journals every week which is easy. She is an easy A. I would definitely recommend her!!!!!,1
Number 1,1
"Mrs. Booth is an excellent instructor! If you study the notes from the lectures, you will have a good chance of making a good grade on her tests. She is very funny and loves classroom participation. Mrs. Booth also likes to answer questions and appreciates occasional humor from the students as well. Overall, I would highly recommend her!",1
"She's a busy woman, I've taken her in person class before and loved it. For whatever reason this spring semester, she didn't respond to any students for a few months. She was posting & interacting more on facebook than a class that students pay for. She did eventually apologize but she left us wondering in the dark about our ungraded assignments.",0
"Besemer seems cool at first, but she's actually just rude and should not be a professor whatsover. She also showed up about 15 minutes late to every class.",0
"Really good all around, class starts off slow, but gets more interesting as the semester goes. He really focuses on not leaving anyone behind, which was great for me.",1
"Shes a nice lady, but not the best teacher.  Most of the time our class had no direction.  A lot of people just never came.",0
"Melvin Hall makes you read TONS of redundant material;  over 200 boring pages a week!  His tests have obscure questions that are hard to  answer.  The reading makes you fall asleep while slogging through it.  Avoid this teacher and EPS 550, Marisa Crowley (she uses his tons of reading  material ).  This class is NOT about learning.",0
"a nice person (even tho she may come off rude) she's a really hard grader and gives a lot of work during the last month of the semester, it's overwhelming Get out if you can, the other professors are easy",0
"She is a PhD student, but she is very good at teaching the materials.  It is an easy class. In order to do well, you need to do all the practice questions at least once, and I guarantee it that you will get perfect score on the tests.  ",1
"the worst class i have taken at oberlin.  wow, so painful.  i got As on all my papers and a B+ in the class... she just overlooked it.  said nothing that i couldn't think up or read.  not a fan",0
"Very good instructor, very knowledgeable. He cracks jokes everyday. He can be a little testy sometimes.",1
"I had so much fun in 237(and an A). Go to his lecture, listen to what he says. That'll get you an A. Although exams are usually essay, no worries. Just write what he focused during class",1
"I am NOT a history person, but this class was engaging and easy to understand. It is difficult because hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years are covered in 50 minutes but it's not impossible to keep up. The readings are VERY important, but the exams are fairly easy and predictable. Overall good teacher and valuable class.",1
"Good guy, cares about students",1
No Comments,1
"She's so bad that she doesn't deserve an explanation, just take my word for it and don't take her classes. Spare yourselves.",0
This class is going to be hard in general so if you are going to take it take dr purser! He is a great teacher!! Very relaxed and funny. He is definitely interested in what he teaches and takes it very seriously. He does not rush through lectures and makes sure you understand the material. I would definitely take him again!,1
"Be careful when taking her online class. She is very hard to understand and has a tendency of making the material more difficult than it is. She has also sent out numerous emails threatening students that if there are power outages during testing they will fail the test, no exception. Totally unprofessional and harrasing!",0
"First teaching assignment ever... She was not versed with the textbook and was unwilling to help struggling students understand. Quote: I am not responsible for your learning, I am resposible for your grading",0
"Took him for orgo 1 online for COVID. He put the class onto a strict bell curve based solely on scores on two tests and a final that did not have feedback or regrades. His lectures, which were all made before class started, were extremely confusing. I learned mostly from the book as no other course materials is given. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Didn't feel like I got enough out of the teacher. The class was great and I learned a lot, but I wish the teacher would have helped more. Constantly had to ask for additional instructions. I was extremely ill and he gave me a redo on an assignment, but only for a couple more hours. I wrote him when I was super sick.",0
"Ohh man, this is the most hardworking class i have ever taken.  He expects us to do a lot for one quarter.  Nice guy and sometimes funny.  Our final is a take home which is a 9-10 page assignment and we only get 4 days to complete...it feels that this class is non-stop work",1
"17 questions essays to read and 30 words from glossary to know for each exam, and he takes only 3 questions essays and 5 from the glossary. Very hard!",0
"She was a very caring and personal professor. She was a very easy test giver, and her assignments were to the point and precise. You need to go to class, as your attendance is taken every day, and it is 150 points! Very easy and a nice, relaxing class.",1
You must show up tp every class or points will be taken off. He gives a lot of work and is very strict about having things done a specific way. He also wants you to memorize the entire syllabus and talks the whole class.,0
"help me. no one has any idea what is going on, he rushes through chapters and when they test comes no one knows what's going on. this class is a nightmare, he is also really boring, monotone and plain rude. don't do this to yourself.",0
"This is a simple class, students will get a good grade on the speeches if they prepare and practice a lot. Be prepared for the 2 tests worth 40 percent. You can manage to get an A if you study She had to give us 25 extra credits for the 2nd test because she didn't know the answer to many of the questions and half of the class failed the test",1
"Her class is not structured/unclear of her expectations.LOTS of reading, and some annoying online discussions.If you have the time to submerge in her class take it.+presentation,essay exams. 3 essays book report.class was hostile.Diff, but you will learn!",0
"She was not very clear.. She would start speaking and stop mid-sentence. She may be good at teaching other subjects but speech class is not for her. But one thing I like about her is that when you give your speeches, she doesn't critique you harshly like other professors do.",0
No Comments,1
"Unorganized.  Late.  Makes unrealistic demands - she had to cancel projects and parts of projects because she doesn't know how to make a schedule for summer.  Makes her religious beliefs known, and she's judgmental.  Refuses to talk about controversial topics due to her own beliefs.  Must rely on book for info, attendance required.",0
"If there is a better Professor that Senor Morcillo I have not encountered them. The professor is as understanding as the come, and very patient. He generally wants you to learn the language and does his best to help. He responds quickly by email and will assist in any way he can. Would take again and again if that was possible!!",1
"shes nice but her teaching is bad, she's also hard grader, don't take her if you don't like math coz she doesn't know what she's teaching and IDK why GGC has someone like her",0
"Former mayor of Philly so he has cool guests. The class was very easy and there is a lot of opportunities to really participate and learn about local gov. You truly just have to show up and complete assignments, which are rather short. He gives a unique perspective which I feel is valuable. Definitely very interesting to say the least.",1
"Never and I mean NEVER take this professor. She is a very kind lady, but doesn't teach well. ""What does the book say?"" is her favorite line when you need help. Labs are unorganized and no one had any clue what they were doing. I am a good student and tried my hardest to understand, but it was just impossible. I had to withdrawal.",0
"He is a nice person but a not very good professor. His tests are extremely difficult. Try to do well on the online quizzes, and the BP that's the only thing that can help you have a decent grade in this class.",0
Ridiculous with her grading. Not helpful with quetions or willing to help. Made this online class unbearable. Do not take this course online with her.,0
"Prof à éviter. Les explication ne sont pas claires, il lit les diapositives tout simplement. Les examens ne représentent la matière, (Plus difficile que les exercices fait à la maison). Passe sont temps à se venter de ses expériences professionnelles, rien avoir avec le cours. Un chose bonne: Répond rapidement aux courriels!",0
"I went to Professor Rombo for help figuring out Blackboard and she told me she ""didn't agree with my observations"" and then proceeded to talk about it during class, implying that ""the student"" just couldn't figure It out for themself.",0
"He's a cool guy but the class is basically power points. There are only 3 tests, random days he decides to take attendance, and a final exam, so you have to get a good grade on all of these. he will drop your lowest test score though. he gets mad about people being on their laptops and phones.",0
I will never pick this teacher again. Makes things more difficult than they really are. Places doubt in students instead of encouraging them. Adds more stress to lesson plan than there should be.,0
One of the best teacher's I've had! I loved all of his classes.. He has a story to go along with every lesson which is extremely helpful. He gives you lifestyle/work tips to carry on for life. He basically teaches you how it is in the real world. He covers every chapter in the book along with powerpoints that you can print out. Easy exams,1
"This was an online class and each week, there were anywhere from 2 hours to upwards of 3-4 hours of lectures you had to watch. This is added on top of the weekly lab assignment you have to do. There is a quiz every week, but they're all open note. Tests aren't open note and make sure you study or it's gonna be pretty difficult.",1
Grade is solely based on exams and pop quizzes. He will dock your grade after three absences from the class. Tons of reading but the exams and pop quizzes aren't too difficult as long as you do the readings and pay attention during class. Exams get easier through the semester as you go.,1
"Dr. Field is the best instructor that you will find at UNL. He is laser focused on developing a culture within individual and groups of studnets that he works with. Take as many classes as possible with him. If you have the drive to work hard, desire to succeed, and want to lead then you will really enjoy your time in any of Dr. Field's classes.",1
He is horrible; one of the worst in NJIT if not the worst.Complete disaster!!,0
"THE WORST TEACHER YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. she wont help you no matter what you do, and if you ask her a question in class she will most likely belittle you.",0
"yeah, tell her she's pretty, and you will get a good grade",0
The lab was more straightforward than his class. Just take a prelab and show up for the lab. He is extremely slow at getting through students for grades so you might end up waiting the entire day.,0
"Two weeks into class I dropped out because I had no time to complete my other assignments whatsoever. Lots of reading, lots of writing, and shes a tough grader. She will call you out in class. She does less teaching, and more talking. Will cite someone for plagiarism without warning. Everyone struggled. She had 30 students, then dropped to > 15.",0
good teacher.,1
Such a nice lady but very unclear with expectations. Hard to know what she wants until after grading is complete but allows students to work on the mistakes and resubmit. Read verbatim from slides (has fill in the blanks) and has in class exercises almost every class. Don't recommend but still possible to make a good grade.,0
"Lecture were extremely boring and tough to pay attention to. The tests were online and pretty difficult. It's possible to get an A, and I would take this class again. But it's not a fun one to get through.",0
Just had her for health care ethics- one of my new favorite professors at loyola. she knows what she's talking about and easily one of the best lecturers at loyola....take her- it's such a great class!!,1
"So many unnecessary online quizzes that she does not mention in class, but expects u to know as they are on the syllabus. Toughest grader ion essay and if you expect to get an A in this class, best of luck to you as I don't know a single person in my class that has gotten an A. Super boring lectures as well, almost fell asleep in every single one.",0
"Dr. Searfoss was my favorite English prof. She does a lot with the textbook and she got me to appreciate writing a bit more. She can be really sassy especially if you tell her you didn't know something was due. She really wants you to pass, so she'll help you when she can, but she does make you work for your grade.",1
"Took Public Speaking Spring 15. Class was easy because I took Speech Comm in Fall 12. I somehow still got a B, did the math and it was because of the tests on book material we never specifically reviewed ever in class. If you're not shy in a classroom and can do some research for a speech, this class should be fine for you.",1
This Professor is absolutely amazing! The textbook he picked for the class is a good read!,1
"John Fischer is a very well-spoken professor who teaches very difficult topics, my only complaint is that his tone is very monotone and his tests are long and somewhat difficult so be prepared to come to class, pay attention, and participate.",1
"WORST TEACHER EVERY!! He is horrible. He talks down to students, makes fun of them if they ask questions that he thinks are dumb and only cares about himself. He is unorganized and does not help you one bit. I can't believe SVSU employees someone like him. He is horrible and should be fired! Disappointed in SVSU for keeping someone like that.",0
"It takes a certain personality to be in Prof G's class. He lectures quickly and it is difficult to tell what to write down. This class is extremely hard if you don't ""think like a philosopher."" He allows students to resubmit homework assignment to maximize grades, which I why I was able to do moderately well. He is helpful at office hours though.",1
"Listen. This professor has a decent enough rating on here, so maybe he used to be better; however, whatever he is doing now is NOT WORKING. There are about 10 students in the class left because everyone has already dropped. He's disorganized, forgetful, and will actually make you feel like an idiot in front of everyone for asking questions. AVOID!!",0
"Class is lecture only, but very interesting! If you don't come to class you probably won't get an A, though you may pass. He will write down what you need to know but anything he says is fair game on a test, so pay attention! No homework; grade is based on test scores. If you have any interest in music you will ENJOY this class and instructor!",1
"Great professor I highly recommend her. I  had a wonderful semester. For those of you that plan on taking child development 42 I just want to say that the class sounds difficult at first,but do not panic. Honestly it was the easiest most fun class I have ever taken.",1
He doesn't really use the textbook for assignments but it is useful for grasping the material beyond lectures. Slides are posted on Blackboard and Large homework sets are done every other week. As long as you do the work and take notes you should do fine.,1
"You can tell she's been teaching the same for a long time. All of the assignments are time consuming and repetitive. I've had to map out a full 8 semester schedule, three different times in the first semester. All te assignments are just busy work which is annoying because there is so much of it. This class is just a huge waste of time, avoid it.",0
She's incredibly mean and selfish.,0
Too hard,1
"Ochem is a hard subject to start with, and Dr. Kennedy really tries to help anyway he can. There is a lot of extra credit though, and the option to do homework for more points. Tests are hard, though.",1
"I loved having Yvonne as my professor this semester! She's kind, big hearted and willing to help in any way possible to help you get a good grade! Take Yvonne and listen to her lectures! You can learn a lot if you listen!",1
Prof. James Richards is a hidden gem to Dixie State. Teaching mostly evening courses. He has a great sense of humor and because he is an accounting genius he is able to explain concepts simply.   Prof. Richards is what educators should be. The man could teach his infant daughter how to file taxes. I would,1
"He is hard to understand and gives difficult multiple choice/open ended exams that most people get 50s on. He also fell behind on material. However, all the talk about his curve is true and will raise your grade by like 20%. Do better than the average and you will pass comfortably but it's still orgo, so it definitely isn't a cakewalk.",0
Seiously...easiest course and this prof returns your email ASAP and easy marker...GUARANTEED !!!,1
"The only redeeming factor of this ""seminar"" is that you don't have to attend to get an A.",0
"Professor Woods was a terrible first choice. She over explains way too much, gives enormous amounts of homework that barely count for anything, grades HEAVILY on tests, and thinks the entire world revolves around her class. Had to drop her to save myself from miserable failure.",0
"I despise math, and I have always hated it. This class ended up being my favorite of the semester! Prof. Dodson is really nice, and her lectures were easy to follow. She gives plenty of opportunities to ask questions. There were bi-weekly discussion boards, but they were pretty easy. HW was on MyMathLab, and it was an easy software to use. 10/10!!",1
Survey I is just a piece of cake for me. I got no exam grade below 90 and all homeworks were rated check plus in his class. Read the textbook and review the presentation if you don't understand dude!,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! He lacks a lot of professionalism, a lot of material all at once he's not organized with a curriculum whatsoever. Test are over 125 questions Long, very hard on attendance he has you drop his class after the third absence. No communication with students, very high standards HE CANNOT TEACH! You will learn nothing!!!!!",0
Not a very good class!! 2 months teaching and 1 month homing!!,0
"This form demonstrated the level of frustration of this class perfectly. Is she a professor I like and would like to be friends with? Of course. Would I take this course again? NO. Prof Arnold is a great person, but she isn't very helpful, I felt punished for trying my hardest. It seems like every time I turn around i was senselessly docked points",0
"Very sweet lady. Does speak very low and has an accent, but overall very nice. Her class is not difficult if you pay attention to the powerpoints and lecture. Tests are fairly easy.",1
"Stud of a professor. I'm an econ major and he is by far my favorite econ professor. He goes above and beyond to help out all students and actually cares about his students. He well Skype, email or meet in his office at any hour of the day. Do well on the HWs and know how to work them and you'll make an A. If not a B/C",1
Knox is a good teacher and genuinely wants to now his students. Class is easy there is not much to do except one assignment a week. no lectures which is nice. taken online due to covid,1
"Professor Peterson is a very fair, nice professor. Her assignments were graded fairly and she did not have unrealistic expectations from students. I had her for Comms-116 and the class was great. I would recommend her for any communication class you can get into.",1
"I say this with sadness because I expected the department of Chemistry in William Paterson University to have somewhat decent instructors, but they do not. Yalan Xing by far puts the cherry on top of the cake. She does not care, to say the least and will fail you regardless of her inabilities of explaining the materials for orgo, DO NOT RECOMMEND!",0
Sara is the best teacher I have ever had. I took Social Justice and Social Welfare in the US and it was my favorite class I have ever taken. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed both in the classroom and outside. Her class is very interesting and is an easy A if you actually do the work and pay attention to the powerpoint lecture.,1
Just make sure you do your discussions and you should be fine. His papers need to be Chicago style so make sure you can do that. You can send it to him a couple days early and hell correct your formatting issues. You mostly get your grades from quizzes so make sure you do well. SUPER easy grade. His cat is cute so make sure you ask to see his cat.,1
"So disorganized. Everything she knows about culture is just spilled all over the board and in lectures, and her powerpoints are so messy too. She gives you too many homework assignments that she probably doesn't even look at. This semester, she also wanted us to go to 2 events outside of class for credit, which were pointless.",0
"Almost 100% sure you will regret taking her. She is the worst teacher I haver had in all of my schooling. She doesn't respond to any of her emails or texts. She also grades with her eyes closed, she is very inconsistent and does not provide explanations. She will give you 100% on the first half of the test, and 0 points for the rest. Horrible.",0
"Alex is one of the best professors I've had since being at the university! The material is difficult, but he explains concepts well and responds quickly to e-mails. Not to mention that the difficulty is mediated with test corrections and extra credit opportunities. He made the class interesting and he really seems to know the material!",1
"Online CS-1400 from Professor Jingpeng is pretty easy if you have previous Python experience. You do weekly textbook assignments, 7 Python programming projects, and 3 exams you can take from home. I liked how he sent out weekly announcements. This class is a textbook-reading class, but if you need help, Professor Jingpeng is willing to assist.",1
It's a so so class. I would not take it again though. Too much writing,0
"Dr. Judson is a great professor. You can tell she truly cares about her students, and the material wasn't too difficult. Hybrid class - meet in class one day, online the other. You have to dress business casual because of it being a MKT 230(+) course. Biggest project are two case studies which require reading about 10 page cases, tests are easy.",1
"This is the perfect example of people hating the professor for not being able to understand the material themselves. Programming is a new concept for most, so people blame him when they're struggling in the class. His lectures are very helpful, he goes over the labs (often giving you the answers as well), and has a funny and personality. Take him",1
LOHERY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACCOUNTING PROFESSORS! HE IS WILLING TO HELP AND CRACKS JOKES ANY WAY HE COULD. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND KNOW HIS INFORMATION. TEACHING IS PROBABLY NOT HIS BEST BUT HES WILLING TO HELP ANY WAY HE CAN. I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN,1
"This was the best class ever.  It was extremely hard, but so awesome, and Nancy really knew what she was talking about.  Plus she totes her Australopithecine bones around in a J.Crew bag, which is funny for some reason!",1
"Professor Zank is a wonderful professor and human being. He is a great lecturer, and provides great feedback on paper. However, he does want students to succeed and provides ample opportunities for extra credit if needed. I would take his class again, and take more classes with him. ",1
"*Took this class online due to Covid. This is an easy A as long as you participate. The class is literally gym, just exercise and record a time-lapse or use a Fitbit. Ms.Z is usually pretty chill and half the time won't take off for lateness (because for some reason she wants things turned in at 11PM and not 11:59PM). Also very responsive to emails",1
"Dr Crumpler isn't the best at explaining. He gives plenty of examples and practice but his exams are a whole other thing. He'll go over something for 5 minutes and then put it on a test. Have questions? well, better protect your pride because this man will make you feel stupid with his unnecessary commentary.",0
"He's the sweetest prof ever but i never knew it'd be possible to be this disorganized. Don't be surprised if he does lose or misplace students' marks and documents frequently. Took his class because people say that its an easy A if you put in the work and do his practices problems. However, over half of my class is failing his course.",0
Her class is so boring!!!!!! She needs to make this class more interesting!!!!She gives hw which is extra credit towards her exams so I suggest that you do it. The book is very useful. She is very careless about her students and her exams are hard!,0
"He's a G. First day of class he played the Pixies, I've never met anybody with a more impressive name than Ignacio Infante, his accent is infinitely dope,  he's just a funny and laid back guy. And he definitely knows his shtuff. Essays aren't too bad, I liked the books but you didn't have to read carefully at all if you pay attention in class",1
She tends to stomp on many students if she does not hear the answer that she wants to hear. She doesn't take in other peoples' opinion and expect everyone to agree with her.,0
"I frequently met with Nina for help with my papers (philosophy can be hard), and she gave amazing feedback! She really helped me increase my grade and I ended up with an A. Lots of reading,  but she does a great job making it easy to understand. She's also funny and very kind. She brought cookies every night! Don't skip lectures, can't catch up.",1
"Stay away from this class!!! He expects you to be a genius and teaches the class like we're PhD students. Like bro, how do you expect me to prove all of calculus in a one hour test?!?!?",0
"Avoid this teacher, he's awful.",0
He takes a a long time to understand the abilities of the students he teaches. Does not understand the preparation given by the prerequisite courses and assumes a lot of material not covered by other courses. His homework is achievable but difficult. His exams are tough. Not much feedback initially but was decent by the end of the course.,0
"Professor Zaitsev is the best! I really enjoyed lectures and lab with him on Sunday mornings, the lessons were never dreary and he was very interesting and engaging. He truly knows his stuff. He gives 4 exams(including the final) and drops the lowest grade.  And his book on Amazon makes it extremely easy to follow his lectures.",1
"He's a laid back professor. Especially with attendance. If you read the book, you don't have to show up to all of the classes. Some call him a hard grader, but he actually has his own grading scale that makes his tests easier to pass. Good with getting grades up quick. Occasionally his tests are hard. Don't expect his lectures to be interesting.",0
"Heed these warnings, for they are all true. She even stated in our class that she is not fond of teaching and no longer wants to do it. Doesn't answer emails. She does not give grading criteria for big projects, and then grades very hard. I even lost points for being ""too concise"" on a big project. Is that even possible?",0
"MS. MAGALLON IS ONE OF THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHERS AT CHABOT. VERRRRRY HELPFUL, NICE, SMART, CLEAR, UNDERSTANDING, SEEMS HAPPY TO TEACH NOT LIKE OTHER TEACHERS. A LOT OF GROUP WORK. WHICH MEANS MEETING NEW PEOPLE!! SHE IS THE BEST TEACHER EVER. U WONT REGRET TAKING HER. SIGN URSELF UP FASSSSSSSST!!",1
She is not very good when it comes to teaching and also tends to get off topic a lot which takes away from what we are learning. Does not give very good explanations for assignments that are given to us either.,0
He thinks of himself as the go to source for work advice when in reality he has no work experience or knowledge. He brings politics into class. He also takes off points when grading papers with no explanations.,0
She is more than willing to help you during her office hours. At times in class she seemed to be impatient when a concept was not grasped within a 24hr period. She is however very knowledgable about Spanish and enjoys teaching it. I would recommend her as long as you are able to learn quickly.,1
"The class itself is super easy, but I wasn't the most fond of Gray as a professor. I liked her at first, but from some of the remarks she's made I realized she's kind of an insensitive person. Aside from that, get ready for boring group projects, being treated like a 12 y/o and lectures that seriously drag. Should've taken the 6 week online course",0
"Dennis was probably the only teacher that gave us knowledge of the actual business of art. Not only does he know a lot about the profession of illustration, he brings humor to the classroom and puts you at ease. He rocked!!!",1
She can be very grumpy.,0
"Great prof Extra credit on most exams, homework is graded very leniently, gives plenty of partial credit if you show work.",1
"David is a ""gotcha"" kind of teacher. He often times places items on his tests that he has not gone over in class. He is demeaning and rude when students ask questions during class. Unfortunately, he is the only option for many students who have no choice but to take evening classes. Made easy material difficult. Worst math teacher I have had.",0
"I thought he was really funny at first but once we started getting into learning, there was no effort on this part. He used material from other profs (didn't even bother to change the name) and would only tell us to go home, read, and answer questions. whenever someone made a question he would say ""that was a stupid question"" and not answer. :(",0
Not very helpful outside of class.,0
hard with easy matrial. Very judgemental and opionated. Just lacks a lot as a teacher. Avoid if you can. Waste of money.,0
"Hard work pays off in every class except for this one. If you can't sleep during the night, show up to his class and he will put you to sleep with his lectures. If you can't read, no need to worry because he will read the powerpoint slides for you for the entire class.",0
Mrs. Wedemeyer is A Great Teacher She Is Somewhat Weird But Overall She Cares About What She's Talking About.. I've Taken 2 Different Accounting Courses With Her As My Instructor And I'm Taking Another Class Fall 2016 Where She's My Instructor. I Like Her Style And With Me That's A Great Thing !,1
Good class to take for an elective if you want to work with children! Very caring for her students and you learn a lot in the class but it is fun!,1
"Took him at Scripps. Swift is so kind and caring about his students. He really wants you to learn math. He's traditional in that he lectures on the whiteboard and assigns homework from the book, but his homework is always very helpful and lectures very understandable. He is very available during OH to help if you don't get something in lecture.",1
"Professor Tang is one of the best professors at Wesleyan. She has an amazing personality, incredible intellect, and gives phenomenal lectures.",1
"Prof. Miura is probably the easiest teacher I've ever had. I had him online, so his lectures were incredibly boring. I probably missed half of the lectures (he didn't take attendance), but I just go back on Panopto and set the lecture to 2x speed and I'm fine. 0 quizzes, 4 homework assignments for the whole semester, 3 exams, including final. EZ",1
"His class was the strangest I have ever taken.  He has so many personal issues, all of which he shares, that it's amazing this man functions.  He actually showed up to our class over medicated, and we were afraid he would pass out!  Although it's an easy A, the stuff he puts you through is not worth it.  I can't ephasize this enough- AVOID!!!",0
I have had many tough professors in my college career but this man is by far the worst. His tests are impossible and his communication is subpar. The one good thing I will say is he knows what he is doing in the lab and can give some helpful feedback on how to improve on techniques. Other than that I would recommend taking another professor.,0
I completely disagree with the other review. Anne puts very little effort into this class. Tests come from a test bank of her previous tests. The TA is responsible for everything else. You could easily learn everything taught in this class from youtube. For a 4000 level class Anne is extremely patronizing . Don't waste your time.,0
Hard but good,1
"His powerpoint slides are poorly organized. His explanation does not make sense. The test was hard, and he likes to test on something that he didn't talk about in the class. In the class, he just mumble on and on. The laboratory program is also unorganized and is lack of sufficient guidance. All in all, he doesn't like teaching and not good at it.",0
"WSBE is lucky enough to have him. Hassey adapts his teaching style & expectations to the level of the class, and even requests feedback on what went well and what he could do better.  Highly recommended.",1
"Dr. Pasquesi is a phenomenal English Teacher! It was a true pleasure to be a part of her class. If I had to describe her in one word, that one word would be ""Educator."" Most professors focus on the curriculum and syllabus. Dr. Pasquesi has a high focus on the development and progress of each individual in her classroom.",1
hard class.,1
"It was a difficult class, even with attending every lecture, lab, and tutorial. Dr Roger's is very passionate and I enjoy her lectures, I like that she uses the clicker to make it more interactive as well. You're not going to find an 'easy' chem205 class but she is a fair grader and very open to talk/help her students. Overall a great prof!",1
"He is an opinionated professor yet very educated sometimes goes on tangents during lectures, and lectures are long sometimes hard to follow since so much information is thrown at you. Do not miss the dinner study sessions with him he goes over the whole study guide step by step until you understand right before the exam so it is fresh in your mind.",1
"Lesly is one of the best professors to take online. I just had her for Art 95 last Summer. The hw, quizzes, and projects are fairly easy. Art 95 is worth taking to complete your general ed. She is worth taking for any general ed class.",1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich fail to respond to your question in a timely manner and when he did finally respond the answer mada no sense to the question you had asked. I would not recommend this class unless you have no choice.",0
"She's really sweet, It's hard to pay attention in class because you have a computer in front of you. But she's really helpful if you have any questions or If you want her to check your projects. It's a plus if you have her once a week, you only have to go every other week!! Deff take her class",1
He is a very hard teacher to understand. He does not give you a study guide for either the midterm or final and does not tell you what is on either. He just expects you to study everything he's told you in lecture and material you have read. I barely passed with a C and i am an A student. Take a different teacher if you can.,0
Great teacher for English 2030 for Summer Semester. She has a few assignments due each work but they are not hard. If you put in the work you can pass easily. Her homework assignments are in order so when you do your final paper you understand! make sure you ask questions as she responds to them and helps you become a better writer! Good luck.,1
"Butman is a very tough grader however, is very easy once you get the hang of the essays. Learn from mistakes !!!! First 2 essays were an F and a D. He explained mistakes not to make and once corrected i became a B student. Point is, don't let his attitude make you drop he actually does care about his students in his own way",1
"This guy here really cannot teach. If you don't self teach i guarantee you will fail the course. His exams are easy until you get to the 10 point long answer question. Even if you answer the question correctly you can get a 5/10, this will drop your test mark 1 or 2 letter grades. Literally don't take his class if you care about your mental health",0
I really enjoyed this class. It was a very informative class and Dr. Westover did a great job at explaining things. I would highly recommend him to anyone. There was a lot of work but it was all helpful to the learning.,1
An amazing professor!  I wish there were more profs like her!  Very clear expectations.  No surprises.  Clear and concise.  Personally I think you have to have an IQ below room temperature to fail her lecture class or just truly not care...  ,1
"When I took this class I found it to be pretty boring. However, I work in an accounting firm now and I am SO grateful for the knowledge that Mr. Meixsell imparted on to me. I am an excel wiz. I blow my co-workers minds with easy Microsoft short cuts everyday. Stick with the class. Yes computer stuff can be a drag, but it IS VERY IMPORTANT.",1
"Grading criteria is never clear. Susan has developed a bad attitude towards students and if she doesnt like you, you will know. You have to participate to get in her good books and even then, if your opinion is doesnt match hers she wont like you. She has no passion for the industry at all anymore.",0
Tough Lecturer! Knows his stuff very well and is such an oasis of knowledge. Passionate about what he does and extremely blunt always. Engages students very well with an open heart.,1
"Professor Humber is definitely one of the better math teachers I have had in recent years. While his quizzes and tests were tougher than expected, his lectures were very clear and he presented the information well. While I would never take calculus again, if I had to I would not hesitate to take it with him.",1
I don't even know where to begin. She thinks she's a Messiah of math and don't even know ho to teach and gives too much homework to and its about 250 math problems per week. Please don't take her any math classes NO EVEN JOKING.,0
She is not well suited for her job whatsoever. She assigns very long papers and I highly doubt she even reads all of them all the way. I had my paper given back to me with a grade of 95 (she also circles where the student makes mistakes) and when I was revising the paper I found a couple of errors that she didn't even circle. Did she even read it?,0
Show up and take notes and you are good. You have to take notes by hand but it's not bad. He keeps things interesting and fun. I'm not a history person but he made this class very enjoyable.,1
Do not take his online class. Gives homework problems and expects you to learn it yourself. Only grades are tests and quizzes. He doesn't give any guide how to learn the material. Just 2 minute videos to teach you that barely explain the problems.,0
Professor Disney is a great teacher. She is nice and very helpful. I recommend to take one of her classes in the future!,1
"A fair grader, though she does get harder as the semester goes on. She knows theory like the back of her hand. Took two classes with her and I don't regret it, she is amazing!",1
"If you know how to write a paper then you will do very well in this course because its not college level material. A month into the course we learned what a topic sentence and what a thesis statement were for a whole week. She also says ""pacific"" instead of ""specific"" which makes me not take her opinion on how to use the English language seriously.",0
"If you show up to class everyday, you will pass. We had a bunch of readings to do, and we had pop quizzes (kind of hard), but other than that , he grades fairly. If you work hard, then you will do well. The only thing I don't like about him is that he is kind of rude and snarky.",1
"Dr. Goldman is a great history teacher. She enjoys having passionate and important discussions about history. Her tests are not difficult, and you don't have to memorize any dates. As long as you follow directions and put in effort, you will get an A.",1
"Good professor, he replies fast to emails and clears up any misunderstandings you may have. However, this course is not an easy A, it requires a lot of reading and make sure to do all your discussions! He drops the lowest test score and the final is optional!",1
If your education and your grade is important to you also if you are new to chemistry then then AVOID this professor AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Easiest class I have ever taken. I enjoyed learning as well. I suggest taking this class with a harder class (like micro, anatomy). All exams are open note and open book. Theres no way to fail. I have no idea how he is not 5/5! Great class and professor!",1
"Godwin was the man. He is a great teacher and can really help you in other classes with the techniques he teaches... I would reccomend him to any student anytime.  This is coming from a kid who does no work for anything, but Godwin actually made me want to pay attention... Only thing is you must go to class...",1
"HORRIBLE professor. She's very unclear, hard to follow her lectures. Tests are hard & she purposely tricks you, its NOT type of problems on the study guide or classwork. Im great in math & had a very hard time to keep an A cuz of her teaching style. I had to teach myself almost everything & went to other professors for help. DO NOT TAKE HER",0
"Sachs was awesome and so was his Social Media class. This was the best 2 credit- 7 week course that could possibly be offered. Do the work every week. Simple assignments and quizzes each week. No need to get intimidated by the work, just don't procrastinate & you will be good.  Cheap books.  Answers e-mails fast & helps if you have a question. TAKE",1
I learned some helpful information in this class but I could have googled how to be a director and received the same level of education.,0
"He's not great at lecturing. He has clicker questions, so attendance is mandatory. His tests are taken from the examples in the book, just with different numbers. If you get the right idea in tests, but the wrong numbers he'll give you most of the credit. Tests are typically 3-5 problems with about 3 parts to each. There's also homework on Pearson.",0
Terrible! He is truly all over the place with his ideas and thoughts. His exams do not relate to the lecture or the readings. And why does he make us watch a movie about CORN?!(great nap time though),0
Great professor who cares about students learning. Teaches in a way that is understandable and relatable. If there is a question he makes time before or after class to go through the material again and in a different way to ensure comprehension. I tried to get him for 1107 but my schedule wouldn't allow it. Asset to EFSC!,1
"The worst teacher I've had. If this is your first time taking a college class talk to your advisor and make sure you don't get her. Incredibly vague in her directions and gets upset when you ask for clarification, just citing the directions again. I went into this class with a passion for writing. Not so much anymore. Way too hard for English 101",0
I really enjoyed this class! If you read you will get a good grade!,0
"Honestly, this class was pretty easy. There is only one assignment a week, if that, and we only had 2 big essays. Lectures weren't mandatory and were recorded, all lectures are easy to understand with some tangents. Prof Peters was a tough grader for the essays, but if you do the weekly assignments you should get an A easily! Lots of extra credit.",1
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
Favorite professor in the music department! He cares about his students and is pretty funny!,1
"If you want to take a self taught class this is the one for you. She posts the assignments at the beginning of the course and other than getting grades, once in a while, there is no real interaction. No group discussions. Disorganized materials. Hard to keep motivated. ",0
Dr. hill is a wonderfrull woman. Her goal is to help the students pass while helping them learn. I have enjoyed her class more than any other. She is also very helpful. Her test are hard but she is fair about taking them.,1
"Dr. Moore was definitely a helpful professor. She was very kind and gave great feedback. At the time, I did not like her much just because she was sort of strict with how she ran the class but looking back on it now I understand why she did the things she did. I totally see my writing has improved because of her class. Thank you so much Dr. Moore!",1
An amazing professor with a great personality. Learned about my personality and planned my major and learned about 4yr universities. Workload varies depending on how much of ur college plan youve already figured out. Textbook is VERY straightforward. Weekly meetings not required BUT u should definitely attend them to fully understand hw questions,1
"Very hard to keep up with, knows what he's doing, but not very good at explaining himself. This is the first class I have ever failed. He is also not good at posting grades on blackboard, so you aren't able to see what you have overall in the class. Would not recommend.",0
"A tough grader and will nitpick your assignment for any flaw she can deduct points on. Tests are relatively difficult and you only get 30 minutes to complete them. Does offer extra credit and provides semi-decent feedback on each assignment. Failed to submit final grades for the class by the due date, so I still don't know my grade yet",0
A really great teacher. The subject is really up to you if it makes sense. I struggled in some areas and did fantastic in others. All the homework and test are online which is nice because she has YouTube videos going over each chapter and you can listen while testing.,1
"DO NOT TAKE!! If you expect to be taught the fundamentals in this intro course then do not take this class with this professor. He doesn't teach. 3/4 of my class dropped him including myself. Knowledgeable and nice person, but he is a terrible teacher.",0
I have taken Dr. Hynes for a total of 12 graduate level credits in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling department. He is an excellent professor. His classes are always interesting. He has an excellent sense of humor and engages all of the students. His is readily accessible and very knowledgeable about the subject matter. I recommend his classes.,1
"Intimidated by him at first, but he grows on you quickly because he is so overwhelmingly supportive of you and wants you to succeed. There was a LOT of work, but I have never learned so much in a class. He was a fair grader and explains any mistakes you make. His class really prepares you for Soc270 & up! Hold on to the textbook, it helps later!",1
"Terrific professor, easily the best I had at UCSD. Homeworks are usually quite difficult and don't always mesh perfectly with lecture. That said, Prof. Saintillan was always very accessible and I found going to office hours to be extremely helpful (if not required). His classes won't be a breeze, but they are well worth it in my opinion.",1
"I'm not one to give such a poor review, but this is truly the worst class I've ever taken. He doesn't tell you how to do well, games are often unclear, way too much reading. I was so excited to take an untraditional class, but the stress and confusion was overwhelming. Don't recommend if you need structure, reasonable class load, or applicability",0
"Omg! There are not enough words to say how amazing this woman is! Especially in logic! She is the best! I would not have been able to make an A if it was not for her helpfulness, patience, and the open door she always gave me. I took her for logic and old testament and she is just the best professor ever! If you want a professor that cares and is always there to help, Dr. Childs is the best in this whole world. She taught me so many things!",1
"He is THE BEST. Such a sweet guy that I enjoy going to class. The weekly quizzes seem like a pain, but its good for studying and you will see them on your exams and remember them. The course in general is tough and you need to work for a good mark anyways, but Garyen makes is funny and makes lectures interesting. Iclickers every class (easy marks)!",1
"He does not go through any examples and just shows the answer. Rather learn on my own. Spends way too much time explaining concepts and its hard to follow along since he struggles to speak fluently and constantly says ""uh"". His lectures are the opposite of engaging you'll wanna just teach it yourself and wish you switched to another professor.",0
"Very hard course with him, a lot of the class is failing. Tests are hard (avg grade = 35!. C = 50). OK at teaching (2 out of 5).",0
"Professor Segev is an awesome professor. He is extremely knowledgeable and made hard subject matter enjoyable. You will have to study in order to get a good grade, but if you put in the work and study what he recommends you to study, you will do well. The material is complex and tests are long but straight forward. I wish he taught more classes.",1
"The lectures are booooooring, all she does is read straight from some powerpoints that come with the book. The class is easy and so are the test just learn the vocabulary. She is a nice teacher but needs to make her lecture MORE interesting.",1
One of the best professor's I have ever encountered.  The guy is on top of things and has a personality that matches. You learn a lot and in a way that is memorable. He get's everybody involved and gives excellent constructive criticism that really challenges you not only as a student but as a person in general.,1
Worst instructor I have ever had. Is not clear with dates of tests.,0
"Sarcastic and rude.  Does not care about her students and loves to kick people out of lab for any reason she can find.  Wrote up 25 students for academic dishonesty in one semester. Many of which claim was a false accusation and had to get appealed.  Doesn't grade anything on time, doesn't give good directions, and takes off points any chance given",0
"He cares a lot about students performance, he is very fair and tries his best to benefit students. I took Chem 3021 in winter 2014 and he made me like mechanisms. I was doing bad at the beginning but boost my grade to B+ in the final. I might take 4021 with him but I am scared of stereochemistry. I see him sometimes now I am taking summer school.",1
"Very cool guy, very humble, knows his****, has two masters and a bachelors degree. definitly wayyyy better the Mr.Norris",1
knowledgeable and passionate professor. He creates a class atmosphere that is relaxed and fun. Def will take again.,1
"Hardest class I have ever taken, period. I am a Engineering Major, and this is the worst class i have taken. Teacher is rude and negligent, gives zero warning on Exam dates, gives zero feedback on discussions, the list goes on. I wouldn't want my worst enemy in this class. If you are looking for a easy class like I was, STAY AWAY PLEASE.",0
"He sometimes responds to emails, I have one that's sitting 6 days not responded to at the moment. He missed two of our classes in a row with no forewarning. His lectures were very awkward, and not useful to the class. There was a required text book but it was online and free; Reading it is necessary for the Midterm and Final, but not the lectures.",0
"A very poor professor.  All he does is throw formulas on the board.  He will brush questions off to the side because he has no interest in engaging with students.  Exams are very tough, but he puts his head down and does not care if half of the class cheats.  Overall, quite a shame since the material is very interesting.",0
I had to take this guy's class twice. I failed the first time & failed again this semester. He's very passionate about the subject but he makes it hard for some people to do well in his class. Quizzes are super easy but the tests and homework's are super hard. If you're good at science you'll be fine in his class but if it's your weakest good luck.,0
Very specific with requirements and expectations. Tells you first day of class she does not require attendance but informs you that you will not pass if you do not attend class; specifically lab.,1
"I actually took this class before all of my programming fundamental courses. I was nervous at first, having zero  programming knowledge, but he made the class super easy and fun. i didn't open the book once ( so dont buy). He explains everything thoroughly and with the class. All work is based off of what the class work was. Id take all his classes",1
"Tough class, but interesting.  I liked the class - many did not, but many were not used to college and what it takes.   Flow could be improved.",1
"The best of the best. She has high expectations but will do everything she can to help you meet them. If you communicate with her,  she will be your best resource. Very funny and witty,  and knows the material extremely well. Would give her an A++ on being a fantastic advisor.",1
"Dr Day is a very intelligent man, but he isn't very good at teaching to a class. He fails to break down what he is teaching into easy to learn chunks and instead slathers equations and algorithms up on the projector. Don't expect for him to teach you the MatLab language either, you will have to teach yourself 90% of it.",0
"Do not take his class. It is literally the worst. You can try as hard as you can to make your work look good, and he will still find something completely wrong with it.",0
"The 2-5 pg journal entries each week will keep you up very late if you put them off! Research paper is intense, but can really help your grade if you're lacking in other areas. Attendance is graded, as is participation, so don't expect to coast through! Very rewarding class, you learn a TON!",1
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
"Chooljian is one of the most difficult professors I've ever had. If you're looking for an easy A, this is not the course for you. Chooljian is very respected because you really have to work to earn your grade. She does not give handouts and will not sugar coat anything, but I will be a better nurse because of how much I had to study for this class.",1
Honestly the course is challenging but I love this professor. If you go to class and do most of the reading than  you should be fine. If you go to his office hours he is very helpful he will answer questions and even take the time to help u grasp the content wether it's with helping link my flash cards together with the time period and terms or just plain explaining it to me he was very helpful. Great teacher if u like a little challenge take him!,1
"I hated this class with a passion. He is a cool person but I don't think he is teacher material, or maybe because he hasn't found his groove yet since he was a new teacher. The lectures dragged on, he would get off topic easily and we wouldn't cover all of the material before the tests. Easy A/B but be ready to be miserable.",0
I really do enjoy her class. She is consistently moving around the room and keeps everyone's attention. Sometimes lecture courses can be tough to sit through but everything she says will help on a test.,1
Extremely unclear about EVERYTHING. Doesn't let you pee during class. Reading/paper every night. Busy work assignments.,0
"I really struggled in his class. I only missed a few classes and still had issues understanding what he was teaching. You can tell that he knows the information, it's just sometimes confusing to understand the way he explains things. He always offered to help me in and out of class, but I found it easier to get a tutor.",0
"I don't know if I would recommend this professor. Yes,I passed with an A but I think eveyone in the class did.Did I learn anything? Absolutly not.You better now how to speak spanish if you take a class with him cause he mostly will teach in spanish.He reads straight from the power points and exams are nothing like reviews.",0
Take her class!!! Easiest thing you will do. The whole semester we only had class like 10 times. You really have to try to fail her class.,0
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. I STRUGGLE WITH ESSAYS AND  AS I TOOK HIS ENGLISH 21 CLASS, I FELT LIKE I DID NOT LEARN NOT ONE THING. YES, I PASSED HIS CLASS BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON HOW TO DO A PAPER. EVERYTIME I ASKED HIM FOR HELP HE WOULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY OUT OF THE SUBJECT.",0
He is a cool guy! Just show up once in awhile and turn in your paper. He is really understanding if you can't turn in your paper on time. As long as you turn in something and its decent you don't need to worry. If you just want to pass the class and are not really going to need english for your major take him!!,1
"It seemed like this was the first time she teached in a classroom, but obviously not, after reading everyone else's comments.  She was always at least 5-10 minutes late to class, unorganized, WAY too much work for an intro class, and she couldn't keep the non-interested students from bothering the ones that wanted to learn.",0
Dr. Feige makes the topic very interesting! Approachable and helpful. Make an effort to learn and he will make an effort to help you out.,1
"Her directions are unclear and almost rude. be ready to spend some serious cash on makeup. $80 for the makeup set then another $25 for the ""Lab fee "" when there is not a lab. Required book cost over $200 because it's out of print. Only uses that book cuz friend wrote it.  If you miss a day she will call you out in front of everyone. Horrible teach",0
I took Professor Khans 100A class @SSU and let me tell you... I have had a good experience other than all the homework and reading that I had to do.,1
"This professor is excellent and very easy to talk to!  She goes over the material thoroughly and doesn't hold your hand.  She expects students do their work.  She's strict with deadlines and expectations.  Projects are self-explanatory and kinda fun! Tests are ""open notes"" on 3x5"" cards only - double-sided. Very fair grading scheme! Enjoyed it!!",1
"She lectures RIGHT off of her slides, but includes photos/maps that she refuses to put on D2L so they're inaccessible. Her lectures are the driest I've been to, even though the material is interesting. I had to be 3+ cups of coffee in to not fall asleep during this class.. Save your money and time; avoid this prof like the plague.",0
"Take this course if you want to be treated like a high school student. Students worried more about his harsh grading instead of learning or improving their work. He likes to hear himself speak so classes will feel never-ending. If you disagree with him, you will not get good grades.",0
"I have a 4.0, having taken over 20 classes at Oakton. I love school. She was my worst professor. She went on vacation in the middle of the semester! She failed to answer any of my questions by email about anything, AND she gave me a B when my grades added up to an A and had to change it cause she clearly does not care at all about her students. NO!",0
RUDE. Hard to understand she has a heavy Indian accent. AVOID THIS WOMAN.,0
"The worst organization of any online class I've ever taken, The guidelines for written assignments weren't specific, and at worst contradicted themselves. Does not respond to communication. I felt that it was very poorly organized, and that he was putting in minimal effort. Would not recommend Kurokawa for this class.",0
She gives good lectures - a lot of detail- but her tests are so difficult! She uses very obscure quotes and themes.,0
Birch was very knowledgeable about Latin America.  I enjoyed the videos and case studies we went over.  I would recommend her class and I would take another class from her.,1
"Honestly, easy A if you remember to do all the assignments on BB... which is (not an exaggeration) over 500. At least 5 homework assignments A DAY. Miss something, flat out zero. Is not lenient whatsoever, not even during these tough times. Not empathetic at all. Email her? Expect a response a week later, or no response works well for her too.",0
"Dr. Kiesewetter is my favorite professor! She is extremely intelligent and wants her students to succeed. She provides her students with the material needed, clear notes, and office hours. If you want a good grade, you just need to work hard. If you do not do well in her class, this is your own fault. Also go to class!",1
"Disagree with 162015. My experience was he gave daily feedback in class discussions. He often would answer questions there so everyone would hear the answer not just the person who asked the question. You don't really need to do the reading but participating in the discussion is a must. If you skipped that, you'd be lost. There are no tests. ",1
"Great professor!! I took her class in spring 2019. She really knowledgable works hard to get students involved in learning process. She always offer assistance to struggling students to work on how to improve grades in her class. Very punctual in keeping her notes, grades, announcements etc. definitely recommended!!",1
"Would NOT recomend taking this class. Claimed that seeing our grade online was ""unnecessary"" and when asked for one-on-one help, always had an excuse to get out of helping you. It was obvious that even she wasnt very familiar with the material and when asked questions, she would try and avoid the subject. ",0
"All the stories about him are true as this was my most traumatic academic experience. I literally had to study every day, especially when he might spring a pop quiz on us. Lectures were hard to follow, since he went too fast when using powerpoint slides. His english is incomprehensible at times (achume?). Shockingly helpful during his office hours.",0
Hes alright but his quizzes and projects do little to no boost to your grade and small assignments affect most of the whole grade. The dates for assignments are confusing. Expects you to know when things are due when there was little to no mention to them in class.,0
"very tough...lots of reading and writing. helpful, but an impossible grader",0
"I honestly cannot say anything negative about Dr. Ferreira. She is funny, intelligent, and presents you with every opportunity to pass her course. Show up, participate, and turn in your assignments on time, and you will flourish in her class. She gives some of the most interesting lectures I have ever heard. I hope she is around for my children.",1
"Dr. Simms is very knowledgeable of the subject, but he is not good at explaining things to people who do not understand the subject. He's hard of hearing, asking questions during class is kinda hard unless you literally yell. There was a paper to write, and there was no clear idea of what he wanted, AKA no outline.",0
"Avoid this professor like the plauge. Unclear lecture, unorganized examples in class, constantly is looking stuff up while giving his lecture, and the class is doing so bad that my 72 might end up being an A.",0
"Professor Cordova was great! She only assigns 2 assignments and 4 exams for the whole semester. You have a whole week to do the exams and the assignments are open from the first day so you can get them done ahead of time. Overall, great professor and easy class. Easy A.",1
"horrible teacher! I have trouble staying awake in class, let alone pay attention and try to learn! Finals are beyond anything we've ever done before! Avoid taking his class at all costs. You'll be so much happier without him!",0
"Gerard's class ended up being one of my favourite classes. It takes a lot of work and a lot of creative thinking, but it felt like it was worth it. While you will need the short novel, the textbook is unnecessary. If you do the homework, you won't get below a B- in the course. ",1
Love her!,1
"I took Dr. Batman for UPhys I and really enjoyed the class! He does give a lot of homework, but the practice really helps come test time. He's a fair grader and provides all equations you need on the test. Took lab with him at the same time, and the week of the exam he'd just do practice problems for the test.",1
If you're taking this class for a gen ed then don't take it because it is a lot of work and projects for a gen ed. It's an interesting class and I would recommend it because it's enjoyable but it's a lot more work than I expected.,1
Dr. Zhao is an incredibly good professor. His notes are basically the exams. Offers a 5% boost to overall grade with easy EC assignments. Very helpful in office hours. Go to every single class and you will get a point back on each exam. The only difficult thing about this class was the ACS final. Put in the work and you will get a good grade.,1
"He gives good feedback on work, but don't miss any assignments. You will definitely have to put in effort in order to get a decent grade.",1
A very caring and lovely person all together. She really understands people and loves her job. Remember to leave your phone off or in your car. And don't forget to support SASA by buying a snack or 2.,1
"Falk is a nice man. I appreciate his sincerity in his grading curves. That being said, the book for this class is disorganized, without clear solutions. His tests average about 30-40% for the whole class, and his work seems disorganized and often messy. A very nice professor, but one whose class is often unneccesarily difficult and confusing.",0
"Very understanding, nice teacher, and clear on her lectures. I wish she taught chem 120.",1
"Every grade comes from a group project. There is no individual work, or tests. Be prepared to work together.",1
"Dr. K. is one of the best professors I've had at FGCU. I had her for a graduate class which is less formal than undergrad. The class was not all out of the book, but more life experiences and her past experiences. She is very knowledgeable and experienced in her area. She is very helpful outside the class as well.",1
"He's a good teacher, but kind of boring, as is expected from Chem instructors. If you take his class, do not buy the book - not even for just in case. He provides slide notes in paper, and the online assignments help you practice. Google search works too. I've never studied from the book. I had a 90 by Final time, still waiting on the grade report.",1
"He was very quick to respond to e-mails and gave great study advice! He's an easy grader. Midterm and Final make up 60% of your grade. Even though they're open book, you must read all the material and study/outline to do well on them. The Midterm was harder than the Final. I put in the work and got an A.",1
"I decided to take David's class because of the fact it was an evening class that worked with my schedule. That was a huge mistake, he seems incredibly unorganized, doesn't care to make things clear, teaches as if you learned this 4 times already, and just doesn't care. A student in my class had a concussion and David deemed it not excusable.",0
Very rude and sarcastic ... IF YOU HAVE DREAMS PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS PROF. She will make you feel stupid and that you are unintelligent. She is literally the worse and wont help anyone. She does not deserve to be a professor if she keeps acting like this. She is extremely careless and doesnt teach nothing ... do your self a favor and skip her nam,0
"When I arrived at Suffolk, I was lost and in need of direction. I did not take Professor Monahans Management and Principles class until the third semester of my sophomore year. All I can say is this: if your life requires some direction, then professor Monahan will not disappoint. He has profoundly and positively changed my life. TAKE HIS CLASS!!!",1
Prof Rogoff is most likely a nice lady.. outside of class. Her class is extremely redundant and all over the place. Half the time it is extremely difficult to understand what it is that she is saying.,0
"Half of his lecture notes are nonsensical abbreviations that only make sense to him. Class is very conservative/ Christian based. Very much emphasizes what he agrees with in the class (lectures pro life for a hour and 45 mins, then 15 mins of pro choice coverage). Claims theism is the only logical choice, bases it on the watchmaker theory.",0
"Prof. Miura moved very slowly through lecture, so it was often hard to stay focused. He was a tough grader because he required all definitions and explanations to be exactly like his (oddly-worded) defs/explanations. Exams were conceptual and inconsistent with lecture material. It was helpful to read the textbook outside of class!",0
"West was awesome. Seeing him for the first class of the day really wakes you up. Logic was tough, but just come to class, listen to him explain and you'll get it. He also offers an alternative to the textbook, not sure if he will in the future classes. Easy class and he was very interesting and hilarious to listen to. Take it!",1
"She is clear about the topic, but the homework is difficult. Gives a lot of homework. Is very strict on deadlines, and will not give a second opportunity. I have no desire to take her again. ",1
"I took Tompson after hearing PS101 was an easy-A class at BU. She is not the teacher if you want an easy A. She very engaging and a total genius, but her tests require knowledge from the book and the lectures so a lot of work outside of class is necessary to fully understand. If you want the easy A, consider another professor.",1
No Comments,1
"This teacher has got to be the worst math teacher I've ever had. All of the lectures are on powerpoints- learning math through powerpoints is not ideal and makes things unnecessarily complicated. When she writes on the board, she writes so small that you can't see what she's doing. Save your GPA and choose a different professor.",0
Good professor!,1
Erika is a great teacher. She kept our class going and we had a 3 and a half hour class. She is very intelligent and I enjoyed every minute of her class!! ,1
"Very sweet woman but a bad teacher. I've found myself sitting in class looking at her with my mouth open and my brain being fried by the confusion. she understands that we don't speak Spanish fluently, so she teaches ONLY in Spanish. yea... not good. needless to say, i have 3 classes left and can't even imagine if Ive passed or failed. ",0
"This was an 8am class, but she was one of those teachers who reads the powerpoints to you. The material seems common sense, but when you get the exams, they are tricky and ask random statistical questions. The first exam average was a D that had to be curved 20 points. The worst part of the class is that you are required to take ""clicker quizzes.""",1
"Don't recommend. Since it is a one credit class, it contains too much reading and there is a Final. Besides, the Lecture is too long that it lasts  for about 3 hours, and on SUNDAY!",0
Really tries to help everyone.,1
Liszka was very boring and defensive. She isn't open to other ideas except her own even if they are just theories like evolution. When I stated it was a theory so she got very defensive saying it was FACT. Umm no? So I would not recommend her because she is very bias as a professor. Lecture heavy!,0
"He is a great professor!!! Real easy to get off topic... That is always a good thing. He is really fun, but papers due back to back so be ready for that.",1
"Sara was my lab teacher my freshman year for CHE 131. Definitely take her if you get the chance! She's young, fresh, and relatable she understands this isn't easy stuff and is there for you 100%. Have a question about your lab report or grade? Talk to her and she'll make time for you. Also, I took her at night from 6-9pm and highly recommend it! ",1
This class shouldn't be rated as a 1000 level course. I've taken upper level classes that were way easier. That being said he is a great teacher. He takes a moment to adjust to and figure out what he wants - then you will have to put in work for your grade outside of class. In class discussion are great -but they are heavily guided by him.,1
"the worst teacher you could ever have. she does not teach and expects you to learn the material yourself, keep in mind i did not take a self paces so she should have taught. the first day when a student asked her how we were supposed to answer the questions she said ""you have a phone, look it up yourself"" the worst teacher.",0
Jordan Ochs is a wonderful professor and a pleasure to have as a professor.,1
First of all i definitely could have gotten an A or B+ in this course but grading criteria is so awful and unclear made me get a C+. This instructor is always unclear about what are we doing in the labs and doesn't explain stuff well. If you got a bad group than you are probably gonna have bad grade in the final project. Lectures are boring.,0
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
Dont take her. She doesnt give a crap about her students. I WENT THROUGH SO MUCH and SHE GAVE ME A D. Dont take her if something drastic is happening in your life and all you want to do is stay in school. Just dont. Believe me... she doesnt care.,0
"Prof Du is an excellent professor. He is one of few who actually asks for feedback from his students and changes accordingly. ACCTG 471 was an excellent experience. While you will have to work for your grade, A's are not out of reach with studying and an attitude to actually learn the material. Great class.",1
"Unexpectedly, I had a great time in Phil1. I am neither interested in Philosophy, nor a good writer. Still, I enjoyed professor's McConnel's class. He is an easy grader and always willing to help. The class discussions were always interesting. However, you might find yourself spacing out. He is disorganized, so don't take his class if you hate that",1
"Too many pointless, time and paper wasting assignments. Boring class which is only offered for 2 hrs and 45 min",0
"If I could give her 0 stars, I would. I'm confident she grades with her eyes closed as she is consistently late to all meetings and only ever complains about her second job. Doesn't bother to give feedback on tests/assignments and avoids emails and texts. My worst teacher and will be yours too. I can't describe how horrible she is in 350 characters",0
"She's really harsh and strict, and even though attendance isn't mandatory, she treats it as such. Goes too fast for most of my class to keep up, I kinda just stopped showing up because I missed ONE class and she wouldn't help me out, and I fell behind. I learnt a lot more at home from the textbook. Try a different lab professor!",0
Mr. Bannow is extremely condescending and borderline angry when a question is asked in class. He is obviously a very anxious person and when class gets off track he is visibly annoyed. He will shame you publicly if you give him the chance by asking a question about something he thinks he has covered enough already. You'll learn physics on your own.,0
"Very Very Very, I mean EXTREMELY picky. Nitpicks through anything and everything. The feedback given is good but very petty. She does not know how to use Word to format anything properly but gets mad when you reformat her poorly formatted outline templates.",0
greatness is an understatement of this mans collabor in his ability to educate the youths of tomorrow .,1
"Mr. Riley was a good teacher for the most part, he is nice and approachable and will listen to any questions. Bio 101 was a little hard but it is definitely possible to get an A if you work for it; some people got 95 or 100 on the tests and others got 60s. Overall, he wasnt my fav teacher ever, but hes still a good choice",1
"He has no time for the class, too busy with his day job! Does not grade labs, you have lab exams instead and he is not good about explaining how they work. Never know your grade because he takes forever to return exam grades.",0
She's just a great prof and very approachable.,1
"Chris is a really inspiring lecturer that'll change your life for the better. Learning about motivation is really important and interesting, even to a non-psychology student. The class is really easy if you do all the papers and attend the lectures (they're recorded too!). I would take Niemiec again in a heartbeat",1
Mr. Walling was an excellent teacher. Lots of hands on experience in his career. Interesting. Class participation & homework completion is a must. Hes an awesome teacher. Understanding. Gives extra credit. Would take again.,1
Dr. Andrews was a great professor. He kept the class very interesting with his lectures which worked in numerous videos each class. Overall I looked forward to going to his class and would definitely recommend him to anyone.,1
"do not take this class I repeat do not take this if he is the instructor , really horrible grader , doesn't try to help, talks around the point and can never be straight forward.",0
An easy professor is a disservice to their students and the college; an easy A means no effort or real attention was paid to the material. Kelson will make you work and will make you have both the knowledge and tools to succeed.,1
"Wonderful teacher!!! She explained the problems and made them easy to understand. We used the online course Aleks, the textbook was never even opened. Homework every night. she offered extra credit if you went to the math lab. I passed with an A!",1
"Dr. Reddy is great! The course is hard, but if you go to class and review the exams from previous years you can do well exams. Her lectures are awesome.",1
"Nice guy but I hate his class. A lot of homework and projects. Also, have a midterm and final. he grades really harshly and ridiculous. If you're not very familiar with excel and access microsoft don't take his class.",0
"Way to much work, its a Gen Ed class and he treats it like a senior level philosophy class. He told us all we needed to do was the reading and i still did bad on the exams even though i read all the material. he gave me no helpful advice on how I could improve. I had to drop because I was putting off my other 4 classes just to get Ds on his exams.",0
"I was derading Chemistry - Dr. Nelson made it okay. It was still difficult for me, but he was available to answer questions, provided interesting labs and analogies. He made it much less painful than it could have been.",1
"Took LFS250 with him, and thought that was the worst he could do. Prepare for LFS350, cuz he would give you even more unorganized course websites, even more confusing wordings in online quizzes, and assignments that are totally waste of your time.",0
"Professor Lamprey is awesome, but her directions are not always clear, especially when explaining assignments involving Excel. Become familiar with Excel before taking this course. Other than that, she does a fantastic job teaching about modern-day technology. Tip of the hat!",1
Lab reports are impossible. If you miss a lab or are late you are screwed. Five minutes after lab starts she wont let you turn anything in. She enjoys taking points of of everything. If you have an option do not take this professor.,0
"Professor Hercules is the first professor to help me understand Calculus 2. After taking this class with other professors, I finally understand it. All you have to do is ask questions. GREAT GUY ALL AROUND!",1
"I took begging sculpting and this class was so much fun. She was readily accessible to help. I enjoyed her feedback. We do have art critiques and you just present your art work, overall I loved the class. It was really easy, you just have to be creative, and to show up! She's very leanent on due dates, but don't take advantage of it",1
"Professor Adanu is a great professor and definitely wants to help his students. If you need help, be sure to stop by his office hours because he definitely wants to help you get better and create better ideas for your papers.",1
a,0
"Wonderful teacher and very set in her political views, but still understanding of other peoples views. Also very helpful and will help you with making up assignments, or fixing your grade. Overall loved her class and would take one of them again!",1
"Did not like his lectures, learned on my own. ",0
"She's a nice person, but an awful teacher. She talks waayyy too fast and goes into too much detail about the chapters. The homework/studying is brutal. If you're not a genius, don't bother wasting your time and money on her classes.",0
"Fantastic professor. Not gonna be the easiest class, but it'll be supremely fun. His lectures are fantastic.",1
"WARNING: Fun and charming exterior, has interesting personality however rigid and inflexible interior. Does not offer extra credit. Does not like others challenging her ""Authority"".. Can become defensive when showed the hypocrisy of self. Is a very nice person, until you challenge her authority... Makes jokes about her self and her inelegance",1
Take a class from her at your own risk.  She is very confusing and hard to learn from.  You will be learning everything on your own.  She is unwilling to help students.  Also her test are written in a very confusing style.  I would say try and find another instructor if you can.,0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER DO NOT TAKE! I took Anatomy prior to this class for another college and aced it. He barely speaks English!! You can't understand a word he says, mispronunciates every other word. The whole class is lecture...how can they give a lecture class w/a prof you cant understand?!?!",0
the best class i have taken hands down. 1 paper per week.. that's it! class time was for writing papers.,1
"Is unfriendly and condescending based on mood, quizzes are memorization which dont help with writing or speaking the language. Midterms and finals are from worksheets but even after studying everything he manages to twist the exams so that everything the students studied for werent actually on the exam or were replaced with something else.",0
"Adelle has done an extremely good chance of teaching such a complex and interesting course during the pandemic, I could not recommend her enough. She was engaging, EXTREMELY organized, and her overall way of teaching is basically perfection. I wish more professors were like this.",1
"BY FAR my worst learning experience at Humber College to date. This instructor was an absolute embarrassment to Humber's reputation, and should be removed from the faculty immediately. Only showed up on time for 2 out of 15 classes. When he did arrive he was arrogant and demeaning. He made me feel dumb for asking questions. Unprofessional bully.",0
Mrs. Kondrak is a good teacher it's just that she is monotoned. He voice does not change and she is BORING.,0
Dr. Solano is a super nice funny teacher. The class is a little tough if you have no excel experience but he tries his hardest to make sure you understand whats being taught.,1
"I am not sure why there are negative reviews, I absolutely adore this professor. Of all my classes she gives the smallest amount of reading, goes over everything in class, provides slides, very clear of her expectations. Tests are on what she says they are on. There are no surprises. Would take her again!",1
No word can describe his class. You have to understand mumble and polish accent to know what hes talking about. I dont think he even knows what he's talking about. He speaks the same language as DESIIGNER except monotone and every now and than a moan.,0
"If you love computers and powerpoint, word, excel, and access this class is great. I took it over summer it went by super fast!! great teacher really nice!",1
"Would definitely recommend taking him for chem 2, he gives you tests from previous years to help you study and they tend to be similar which is nice. You won't get an A by just going to class, you have to read the book and do all the homework and you'll be good. He is really good at explaining things if students are confused, really caring guy",1
"Il fonctionne avec le manuel, cad aucun notes de cours aucun power point (a part quelques powerpoint du manuel quil va envoyer par email). La personne est respectable en tant que tel mais sa maniere d'enseigner est mediocre. A eviter, il y a de meilleurs profs pour ce cours a uqam.",0
"Max makes some good jokes in class but he is hard to approach for help. He'll make you feel really dumb when you're asking for help. He doesn't use a textbook or post any practice questions. There is no clear guideline for tests, the average for the midterm was 23% curved to 46%. He calls on you in class and gets mad when no one answers him.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Three tests and a final. THAT'S IT. No quizzes so you don't know how you are doing before the tests, and the tests are only 3 questions. Barely any partial credit, so one question wrong and you have a bad grade. Very smart guy, but cannot get on the students level to teach properly. Flies through the material.",0
"Amazingly subjective grading, recognize that picking your battles in the beginning may very well save your grade in the end. I.E. don't argue about your first grade, argue about midterm and final. Start on projects immediately, they are very difficult for the time constrains provided.",0
"Expect to do lots of online homework (sapling) to understand the material being presented, and self teach.",0
"In 4 years of undergrad and 2 years of grad school this was the worst class and worst professor I ever had. There is a text book, but he literally only uses the inside covers. Dropped the class, but it was mandatory and he was the only one to teach it.",0
"Span. 101 5 wk course in the summer. The professor seems like a nice person where she will answer emails, but I would advise NOT to take her (or maybe any other..) language class during the summer semester, its intense and her workload is insane. Remember, you have to memorize a language in a matter of 5 weeks. Do not recommend.",0
"I found Jamie's lectures hard to follow. When I asked her for help, I was usually left more confused and slightly insulted.  Assignments are fair and the quizzes are very straight forward. If you can figure out what  Jamie wants, you will do well, if not, try to maintain your sanity.",0
"Dr. deBoyrie, is the best finance instructor you will ever encounter. I don't think it is possible learning from any other finance instructor. She is caring, compassionate, and patient. This instructor works very hard to help students learn and succeed, not only with finance but also in life.",1
"I took the hybrid class.  He kept everything up to date on D2L and sent e-mail reminders when an assignment was due.  The assignments are easy to get full credit on.  The tests are matching and multiple choice, but he grades on a curve.  Be sure to study the book and the notes for the tests.",1
This was a fantastic class and really enjoyable!  Pam Page showed a lot of enthusiasm for what she taught and was very approachable and very helpful!,1
"If you have any doubt or question, he will answer back with another question. He does not care about telling you the answer. Lectures are very boring too. The content of the class is good and the programming assignments are nice and challenging.",0
This class is a complete waste of my time. i actually counted one day and in the hour and fifeteen minutes we were in class we got through a half of page of notes and the rest of the time is spent on whatever pops into her mind at the moment. great glass for an elective becasue she gives you the notes for her quizzes so you'd have to try to fail.,0
Forces students to talk even if you don't want to. Kind of rude for no reason and is seen on her phone via the reflection of her glasses when students are presenting on Zoom. She doesn't seem interested whatsoever. This is a completely student-taught class so don't take it if you wanna hear boring students present work they could care less about.,0
Syllabus says you are not allowed to contact the professors. Backtests aren't relevant to what you will be tested on. PILOT tutoring wasn't helpful. 3 exams make your entire grade. Grading system unfair and system to ask for a regrade basically doesn't exist. I took an exam in October and no one ever responded to my regrade request.,0
"She is all over the place, she tries to assign us homework that we've already done. I don't blame her though, all the busy work she gives us is the same. She gave me a 0 on accident and I asked her every class period for two weeks to change the grade on moodle and she still hasn't. Get it together girl.",0
"Prof. Hosley is so nice! Her class is extremely easy, yet very thought provoking and eye opening. She brings in really good guest speakers throughout the semester and she always makes lectures interesting. Show up to class and do the assignments, which are very easy, and you will get an A no problem.",1
Very bland. Hard to stay awake. He skups the small steps and leaves his students confused. If you ask a questio. He never understands what you ask.,0
"Very Swedish, very puntual. Attendance mandatory. Grades paper rigidly, as English is not her 1st lang. Green classoom-no paper required! You can get by without readng, if you take detailed notes in class and study them a lot. Be sure to take note of her real-world application, it comes up in exams. Easy to talk to, tries to help.",1
Jeff explains things well. Study for the test and you should do well. The tests are challenging.,1
"If you have a choice to not take this professor, don't. She seems like genuine human but not a great professor. Never replies to emails!! so good luck! Iv'e sent over 50 emails and heard twice back, and only because I asked her to check during zoom. I don't understand her lectures and she does not record them so if you miss class, good luck!",0
"Lorimer's a good professor when I took her class. Pay attention during lecture cause she goes into a lot of detail. Midterms are somewhat hard but that's if you didn't study. Go to the day before the final, she's very helpful and covers what we learned. Do the readings on Blackboard because there's some questions on the midterms/ final! ",1
"the easiest prof for the easiest class. He does abide the attendance policy so dont skip more than a few times or youll fail. Other than that, his lecture is cool so you do do other hw in the back of the room. He gives all answers to the midterm and final so easy 100s. only 2 concert reports which are easy 100 also",0
FANTASTIC professor!  I recommend him to every single person!!!,1
"Professor Gibbons is a leading nuclear proliferation scholar. She is the real deal. Her wealth of knowledge and professional experience translates to the classroom wonderfully. The readings are difficult, but Gibbons boils them down to a digestible main argument. Gibbons inspires her students-highly recommend.",1
"I really enjoyed Meryl's class, and if I'm being honest, with her teaching style I kind of felt like I was in high school again, Which is not a bad thing! She's a fun and funny teacher who keeps class interesting with making us perform plays and such. The workload is very manageable and I never found myself complaining about her class.",1
He's a really funny guy and a great teacher. The homework (only 4) is directly related to the tests (also only 4) so its easy to get a good grade. Plus he's the only one who teaches Econ at night so I appreciated that. Thanks Daley!,1
Amazing,1
She grades discussion question assign. (which are due once a week) with either a 0 or 100! nothing in between! so just beware! attendance is a must b/c she puts class notes on tests but role isnt taken.Its a LOT of reading too.,1
"At first, Dr. Fontenot came off as very rude and unapproachable, but once you get to know him he's very helpful and is willing to work with you. As long as you pay attention in class and do the things he tells you to do you will get an A. Have to be a good writer. Very few grades given.",1
"I love Mr. Ariail!!! I took his capstone class for my Associates Degree. Great way to finish off the semesters at TCC. He offers a great business simulation that is really fun. He, himself, is very fun and comfortable. I took his class Saturday mornings for 3 hours and looked forward to each one!",1
Talks about race too much....knows a lot about math but doesn't know how to teach It,0

"Peggy only wishes for her students to succeed and find happiness.  Her classroom format is weekly journals, some classroom presentation, but most importantly, getting to know your classmates. The homework might not be what you get out of her class though.  She has guest speakers, and other projects designed to help you figure out career goals.",1
"I loved her. The content is not particularly difficult to grasp, although there is a lot of it. Keep up with your readings and you'll be fine, trust me. She's a great person overall, though. Very kind-hearted. I look forward to taking more classes with Professor Douglas!",1
"An interesting take on education, by challenging current perceptions. It was really fun getting to work with the Elementary school systems was a great way to understand concepts. Will is an amazing and well-informed instructor. Lots of reading, but no textbook, quizzes were a bit hard.",1
"Dr. Jacobson is easily one of the best professors at the college. The workload is light. Her lectures are engaging, lively, and fun. At the end of the semester, you'll walk away from the class intellectually stimulated with a wealth of knowledge that's been distilled from her ability as an instructor, rather than from mountains of arduous homework.",1
"I had Mallinson at CUI for philosophy. He is always so enthusiastic about the topics However, he gets side tracked easily. I attended every class and didn't read any of the 5 assigned texts and still got a B in the class. Tests are easy if you MEMORIZE ANSWERS TO THE REVIEW GAME!!!! make flash cards of them if you want an A",1
Just go to the lecture and you'll be fine. Don't need to take notes. Every assignment is online and you have to go to two concerts within the semester. He's super chill and understanding about absences if you email him a good reason he won't count it towards you. Attendance is mandatory of your grade will slip.,1
what an enthusiastic and wonderful man. meet his daughter immediately.,1
"This is my first review on this site. The professor was THAT awful. Take my word for it and DO NOT take this professor. If you are thinking of dropping his class DO IT NOW, I regret not doing it. He's awful at teaching to be frank. He does not explain the topics well. He will write out answers without showing steps or explaining the foundation.",0
.,0
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. I cannot say it enough times. This man thrives on seeing his students fail. His tests are downright impossible. He is an incredibly tough grader as well. I took the online course and he made us come in to take an exam because he thought we were all cheating. I promise even if you did cheat you'd probably still fail. AVOIDDDDDD!,0
"She is passionate about chem and wants you to succeed. Her ""Chem Survivor Guide"" condenses all pertinent and tested info into one manual, which is also the basis of her lecture. She is extremely approachable and caring, and clear about what she wants on the test. No surprises: pay attention to lecture & take time to study the guide, you'll do well.",1
She is great! Her exams require studying but she is super clear on what is on the exam. She doesn't take attendance. Just pass the test and you're fine,1
"She cares for her students and really wants them to pass. She also breaks down what you have to do well enough to understand, easy going and so joyful. I'd highly recommend her.",1
"This was a very relaxing language class. You follow the book closely up to chapter 7, do homework online, and quizzes in the testing center. Adrian is always willing to help students and even will cut time out of the end of class to help you. If you are a good self learner, study the material, and don't cram the night before you should be fine!",1
"well it has already been said. He is hoooooooooorrible! I dont like his class and wish I wouldnt have taken his class. First of all he reads off of his slides. And because the slides are available online, he does not even allow you time to copy notes. he tests you on on about 4-5 chapters at once and eachchapter is about 40-60 slides. DONT take him",0
Extremely boring. You will hate your life for the hour during which he speaks,0
"He is one of the few good professors,I have had the privilege,to have taken at this University. He is extremely passionate about his field of study. When I saw he was British, I knew he would be great!",1
Professor Wider is a great professor. He's very easy going and understanding. His tests and quizzes are very easy if you do the readings assigned. Would definitely recommend him!,1
"Midterm and exam were 10X harder than they needed to be with hypothetical type questions and things that have no real answer, just his opinion. Vague instructions yet expects a very specific response. Weekly D2L posts were graded hard and impossible to get a good mark. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Her class is hard, but as long as you study for every test, it should be easy to pass.",1
"Most interesting coding assignments I've seen and super generous late assignment policy. Understands students struggles and is no-BS while also understanding. An incredibly knowledgeable & friendly professor. Obviously, don't piss him off. He very available--he's in the class discord. Great guy to talk to. Course is 20% scheme, 5% prolog, 75% C/C++",1
"Vraiment un bon prof, il est calme, posé et sait de quoi il parle. Il faut cependant participer en classe et rester à l'écoute quand il parle. Les examens sont faisable et représente bien la matière enseignée. Si vous l'avez, gardez-le mais allez en cours! la participation est importante",1
She is never clear with what we are suppose to do and she could basically care less if you pass or fail. She is always saying follow directions yet her directions arent even clear. NEVER GET HER!,0
"Although this is the toughest class I've ever taken, MA really cares about her students. She shows it in an odd way because she can be rude or mean at times, but it's only because she wants you to do your best and want to succeed. Be prepared to do lots of homework problems. Read the book, and never get behind. It's impossible to catch up.",0
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it wasn't even for my major. Do NOT choose to take LAS with her. Like another post on here, I did have a 4.0 but I struggled by to get a C with her. Grading on papers is unfair for freshman level non-English majors.",0
-Grammar checks contradicted each other throughout the drafts of an essay. -Directions are mostly unclear and vague. -Talks more about her other jobs than finishing a chapter lecture. -Exams are not based on power-point lectures but unnecessary information from the textbook.,0
"I am shy and i was not comfortable asking a question during the lecture. I went to him after class and he yelled coz ""i should have ask the question when he was talking about the subject"". One of the prof who made me hate chemistry. York doesn't to consider bad reviews to improve students' experience. The other bad exp is Carolyn Hempstead, lol",0
"I was scared to take ACCT 2010, but professor Richards made it fun, easy to understand and my favorite class. I am excited to take the next Accounting class from him!!! He teaches at 7:30 and I am NOT a morning person but waking up for his class is worth it!",1
The course was awesome. Loved the material and the course set up. What was missing was the teacher. No feedback and when we tried to ask questions he would never get back to us. I honestly could not tell you a single thing about the teacher. the course was great but I would choose a more involved teacher to get more out the class. ,1
"Ervin is ridiculous! He might be nice in class and seem helpful but his tests are the hardest I have ever had. I'm an A student and got a C in the class after doing all the homework, going to EVERY class, and studying a ton. Studied forever for the final and still failed! Cheat sheets don't help. Good luck.",0
"Grading was unclear and inconsistent for detailed reports  for the simulation. He assigned a lot of busy work and some that does not seem to have any value or take away for the purpose of the class, wasted time. Group project was a problem, unfair structure and not all students are held accountable for knowing basic concepts prior to the project.",0
Don't expect to do good if this is not your major. You definetly need a piano the exams are extremely hard and the assignments are too advanced for mus 101.  All homework is not explained in class and you have to research in class. Most homeworks are very irrelevant to the coarse and what she teaches. ,0
He is an outstanding professor and very knowledgeable about the business world but youll be working for your grade.  His Capstone class is entailed with case studies every week.  He does try to help you with giving you some extra credit assignments.  He wants you to learn!  You don't leave early at all.  He lectures to every last minute of class.,1
pretty terrible,0
"First two weeks was terrible but after the first Exam it got easier and easier. Prof. Simona gives a lot of Extra Credit. She is heavy with lectures. It was hard to listen to her long lectures at first, then I got used to it and was able to get a solid A.",1
"Well rounded and great professor. Hard marker, but fair. Very informative and has a wonderful sense of humor mixed into her lectures. She is clear and to the point, and always willing to provide extra feedback when asked as well as good feedback on assignments. Very approachable.",1
"Professor Mantell knows her Micro, Microbiology was her actual profession. She is very helpful and patient in lab. Her test requires study time to be successful but if you put the work in it is achievable. Her Powerpoints and lecture notes are all that is required although having at least an older book gives you great reference material.",1
currently taking online class. she is very lecture heavy and hard to understand. Homework is easy but exams are very hard. Class averages are always low. she does offer extra credit a couple times throughout semester to help raise grade. wouldnt recommend.,0
"She is a great teacher, just have to give her a chance. She gives a lot of homework and the class is very independent, however she is always there for questions if needed. I would definitely choose her again!",1
"Not my cup of tea. Assigned a ton of reading, expected really high level in class essays. I say stay away from her.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She has a complete disregard for students that have questions, or do not understand what she is saying. She jumps all over the board without explanation. If this is your Major you might be okay. My favorite comment from her ""You already know this."" Everyone has done this before. When we tell we haven't she skips it.",0
"I took this as an online summer course so it was 6 weeks long. This instructor does not give feedback throughout the online course.   There's a discussion board every unit, but the professor does not respond to them ever. I had no idea of my shanding in class until the day grades were finalized. Would not recommend",0
"Awesome professor, very helpful, very knowledgeable, and really cares about educating others. ",1
"If you are actually looking to learn about Cloud Computing, Professor Auten is your guy. I've never worked with cloud computing professionally, but I did receive some job offers after interviews where I had to talk about a ton of Cloud Concepts (Buckets, AWS, Etc) and I was able to explain them off what I had learned from Professor Auten. Great Guy",1
"Very easy class, but lectures kinda drag sometimes TBH.",1
"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",0
No Comments,1
He's a very good teacher. Class was funny and not boring at all.,1
She is very sweet. Wants everyone to succeed. ,1
"Well, the class in itself was easy. She was very hard to understand, would not give good feedback or review tests. Would not recommend. Even though I got a B, the class was more self taught than taught by a professor.",0
What to say!! I don't know. Truely speaking he has no quality to teach in any north ametican universities. Don't take his courses in future.he has lot of things to learn specially how to behave with the students.,0
i really wanted to take spanish i was so happy when i got the only class and then when i got there it was so hard and i asked for help and he said that i can do it...then after i was doing badly he said drop...after the dead line for money back passed,0
"Honestly, I would take this class again. And, I'm not a math sort of person. Mr. Wildman is eccentric and a little weird at first, but he uses that to his advantage. His quirky analogies and activities help you understand the course material. I would say that one quarter with him beat four years of high school. Don't pass up this opportunity.",1
"Really boring. The class is not that difficult, but she has like a million slides and makes you stay almost the entire time. Her accent is a little thick, and she's not that friendly. Overall, she's okay. We didn't use the textbook a lot, and she made us write both a paper and have a presentation.",0
"Stay away from this ""instructor"". Make yourself a favor.",0
I'm obsessed with this class. I can't help but move ahead in the lectures because they're so interesting! It's helped me to think outside the box. She's very understanding and good at engaging students with visuals and videos and interesting examples. It's 1 reading a week plus 3 assignments and a short final paper. The prompts are actually fun.,1
"Professor Wood encourages students to participate with respect to each other. During the semester we did a group, individual, and a short special occasion speech. In all of them she helps us with the process and the writing ideas to make a confident speech. Make sure you talk to the professor whenever you have issues, she is extremely helpful.",1
very very good,1
Stayed after class for hours helping me with my project.,1
"Professor Wisotski is an awesome human being however, her discussion can be very tedious and slow at times. She really made me work for my essay grade and I never did as good as I did in HONR 101 surprisingly. Sometimes it is difficult to understand paper grades but she's available at office hours to explain",0
test are hard. he takes forever to grade and emails you back after a century has passed. very irritating. doesn't have notes for the class or power points for online class. would not take him again.,0
Worst teacher in the world Do not take the class Doesn't know how to teach confusing Not helpful  Bad gradin,0
Professor Hines means well but doesn't come across clear. Took her class for Diversity in the Workplace.  She talks in circles and is confusing.  If the readings say one thing she says another. Be prepared to take notes and fast. She does not post slides and she only leaves them up for a moment in class. She makes each student repeat what they read,0
I usually try not to judge professors because I know they have other classes but I couldnt let this one go. Shes very unorganized and does not give back your work until the very last minute. Our class didnt find out our grades until the week before the final and it was too late to drop. Do not take.,0
"As a person, she is very kind. She's probably a great PT. However, as a professor, I didn't find her lectures helpful (basic overview of anatomy class) and her online materials were not up to date. She used to boast about professionalism and she had moments were she didn't display that quality. The textbook helped and the notes from her PowerPoint.",0
"Prof. Trombley is a really good prof. She is very specific in her instructions on what she wants. If you do what she asks you will have no problems passing her class. her tests are hard but not that hard. If you put you time in and actually read everything you will pass easily. Her classes are not hard, just she very particular in what she wants.",1
"She's tough. But, if you pay attention in class and participate she'll teach you a lot. There is a lot of papers and quizzes. But, if you work hard she'll help you with your resume, cover letters and help you find an internship.  ",1
"Awful PHD instructor. This class is all about organization and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. Funny how that works, right? Her assignments make absolutely no sense and when you ask for clarification she sighs and rolls her eyes. On top of that, she deducts points for going above and beyond and takes months to grade assignments.",0
"All STAT 201 classes take the same tests & are supposed to follow the same powerpoint notes. Dr. Pannell didnt like the powerpoints so he skips a lot. Which is really frustrating bc you have to go back & learn it yourself. My roommate is in a different STAT class and she got a review for the test, but we didnt get one.. but its the same test?",1
"Overall Professor Perez is pretty cool. He made the class concise and clear, but I guess it helps that I had him for discussion. There is plenty of reading, so if you are one to skip the readings, don't take this class.",1
She is worst professor ever. Really tough to get graded even though u go to class everyday. Take other professor's class. And too many quizzes and exams every other weeks. No make ups tho.,0
Great professor!,1
"She's very helpful and caring but at the same time will go off tangent and spend a lot on proofs. Gives out a ton of homework that will take up a lot time. As with any class, if you put in the dedication and effort you will pass. There will be quizzes every week.",1
"Prof. Ted Stephenson is the best Professor. He helped us find a job by showing us where to apply and how to apply for a job. He always makes his lecture fun and entertaining, which making everyone wanna come to class every week. He always listens to his students and give feedback. He is a fooood LOver !!!",1
"She is the most disorganized professor I have taken in my undergrad education. This means that assignments don't make sense, but she still gives them out like anything. With that, she still is the toughest grader who won't give you any margin for error even though the assignments themselves have so many errors in them. Worst professor...",0
"STAY AWAY!!! from this lady do not take her online for math because she barely explains anything, she just gives you the text book to read and expects you to know. She also is very rude when you ask her about extra credits.",0
"Professor Walter is a nice guy. It is just a very boring class. All he does each class is read word-for-word off his power points. Definitely take him if you want an easy A but if you are actually interested in this subject, do not take him!",0
"Mr. Riley a good guy, but a not so good teacher. He flies through his powerpoints, virtually reading off the slide, and speaks without enthusiasm. He does give out semi-helpful worksheets, but over all I learned more reading the textbook than anything he actually taught up front.",0
"As an English major, I have never disliked an English class as much as I did this one, with this professor.",0
"The majority of my time spent sitting in the class I just think to myself, ""What is this guy talking about?"" For an organizational com course, his lectures are not very organized at all. He has his powerpoints posted online but the points don't make any sense and when he lectures it's all over the place and makes no sense. I wouldn't take again",0
He did let you replace a test grade,0
She is an amazing teacher that will help you. She is the best at memory tricks and explaining things well. There are weekly quizzes but when it comes time for the final it's worth it! If she had any other classes I would take them in a heartbeat. ,1
"Being a nutrition major, I thought I was going to enjoy this ""easy"" class; boy was I wrong. This is a 4 unit class (in a qtr system) and takes more than double the time of my other 2 five unit classes combined(no exaggeration). If you like harsh grading, non-stop hw, and really hard quizestests for only 4 units(qtr system), this is ur teacher!",0
"the worst professor I have ever taken at Quincy college, four and half hours of class time then tons of material to read which is hard to read and to long to remember followed by lots of computer work. honestly should be an online course. Extremely sarcastic when asked questions. Worst course and professor ever!",0
"If you enjoy submitting assignments and being deducted points for your PDF quality, then this is the course for you! Prof. Schap is your typical tenured professor: could care less about his students. Tests are super hard and do not reflect the material taught. TAKE THIS COURSE OVER THE SUMMER AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS!!!!!!",0
"I had Dr. Strange for Conservation, a class he created.  Incredible!!  This was one of the best classes I have taken at UT.  Dr. Strange is funny, passionate, engaging and a downright blast.  I learned so much in this class.  Don't miss this one!!",1
"There are weekly essays (which can get kind of tedious/annoying) and group discussion. He doesn't give any feedback but I've managed to get As in every paper & discussion. For honors, the cutoff for an A is a 94, but, if you try & write well, there should be no issue.",1
"Nearing complained in her retort that ""there's always a few students that complain and she has an exemplary record"". Typical cop out! Doesn't matter, she needs to look in the mirror at herself and realize how cold she is to students. She also needs an ego check very badly. Being a snob does NOT make for a great teacher! Reality check honey!",0
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,0
"She is a great professor. I've had her for many classes. She is very organized and you know exactly what you're doing each class. I loved her ethics in health care class. She will also help with academic guiding and responds to e-mail very quickly. Highly, highly recommend her for any class.",1
"Dave Barrett does not know how to teach this class. Every year he teaches it, he changes the format because it never works well. The homework assignments can take anywhere from 6 to 15 hours yet they are weighted the same! His explanations don't make any sense, but at least he is nice and grades very easily. The worst class in the MBA program.",0
"Professor Hinshaw is very nice and approachable, but I found his class boring and his teaching overrated.  He reads from his powerpoint slides, which makes it useless to go to class, since you can stay home and read them yourself.",1
"She is sweet, funny, and strict at times; well tries to be. You must listen and engage because participation is huge. She grades harder than the topic teacher although Her feedback is kind of vague, so talk to her during office hours to clarify her grading. Dont go to class late. Dont talk too much. Do your homework, its easy.",1
"This instructor said at the semester start that ""the book is wrong and confusing"" but then often recants that statement and says read ""the book it will help you"" he seems to flip-flop between these statements on a daily basis. He often says ""go to the Marc for help"" but then the next day if it is not the work he taught you than you're out of luck.",0
"I actually took this professor for HRM 444. I was really nervous about the amount of group work, but it actually wasn't bad. There is homework every week, but it's a reasonable amount. Gives good feedback, but isn't a super tough grader. Do the work and you will do very well in the class!",1
"Great professor! Especially for all the non-science majors like myself, class was really enjoyable although online course. I loved that professor provided feedback to every single assignment. Her grading criteria is pretty straight forward. I dont think there's any reason anyone wouldnt pass this class",1
"She does not teach well. If you can not learn on your own, do not take this class. Also, she is not good at helping when you need it.",0
She has no idea what she is talking about sometimes and often relies on outdated information. Tests are quite unique and are fairly simple.  Very condescending with no good reason and students have even shown to better comprehend the textbook material. This Prof was the very reason I switched institutions.,0
"Very helpful, makes class easier to understand, professional at her job",1
"She is wonderful! You will learn a lot about public speaking. Really gives you an awareness of everything, big and small, that factors into a good speech; stuff you wouldn't even think of. Very supportive & fun to be around. Everyone in the class will learn each others names quickly, and it creates a really friendly and supportive environment.",1
"Obviously a very smart man, but he showed up to lectures late more often than not and was unprepared for them the vast majority of the time. Taking this class over the summer with him was probably a bad idea, considering the pacing and that he was hardly ever available outside of class.",0
Awesome professor and awesome class.  Lot's of fun and you learn a lot from his experiences.  He tells some great stories.,1
"Prof. Dowding is one of the best professors I've had at BU. He is intimidating at first, especially with his 39-page syllabus (not an exaggeration). He tries to weed out the lazy, and it works. If you're lazy and don't care, don't take the class. He makes you work hard, but it's worth it in the end. He makes the class interesting and fun. ",1
"Her lectures are somewhat interesting, but can be rather boring at times.  She is usually very disorganized and sometimes tells you something and then forgets that she told you.  She is very caring, though, and wants her students to do well.  At times she is not very clear with her feedback on your work and exactly what she expects from you.",0
"Dr. Y. overlooked the physics labs when I took it. My lab section was stuck with an awful TA, Joanna. Everyone complained, but Dr. Y. insisted that it was us and not her. I got a D- in lab and a B+ in lecture. I have a high B average in physics 2 lab+lect. this yr. My grades prove I understand the material yet I was still blamed b/c of an awful TA.",0
he is the best,1
"Good teacher.  Do the work and get an A.  Lots of extra credit, can only miss a few classes.  Acquired good studying skills, learned how to take good notes. Didn't have to take this class and glad I did.  Keep up with easy homework and can get an easy A. Nice teacher",1
Dr. Hansen is probably the most down to earth professor that I have had. He understands that your a busy college student and will work with you when something gets in the way of your work or a field trip. He's really passionate about what he teaches that help out with some of the boring lectures. But Dr. Hansen is by far one of my favorite profesor,1
"I took her Child Development class over the summer. The 40 question chapter homeworks seemed so easy until you really got into them. There is always more than one right answer (all taken right out of the book) and you just have to guess which one she says is ""most correct"" what a joke! She never replies to emails, tests arent like homework. ugh.",0
"The professor used the class as an extension of his ego, funneling all talk through himself, using half of each class to pontificate, and belittling anyone who did not agree with him. He is easy, but nothing is worth spending time with such a character. Learned next to nothing. Very poor professor. Do not take him.",0
"Positive about the class: 1) Work was not hard - a few journals and weekly discussion board - both were interesting. 2) Learned a lot BY READING the textbook. Negatives: 1) exams were HARD - 1 hr, 50 questions, no review, over 8 chapters. 2) He wouldn't always respond emails. 3) He didn't seem to care much about the students. 4) Lectures not good.",1
Klatzke is a great professor. She is very enthusiastic about her topics and always gets you involved in class. Never boring. Easy grader. Only a few very east quizzes (you can use your book)and a midterm and final that are only moderately tough. Speeches are easy and you learn to love it. I would recommend her to anyone.,1
"Instructor Camp is very obviously passionate about the subject he teaches, but he teaches the class as though everyone in there is going to write professionally. He grades very harshly and you will not rate an A if you do not exceed the required number of pages. If you value your GPA and are not into constantly revising papers, I do not recommend.",0
"I really enjoyed this class. A bit repetitive at times, but she's incredibly nice and very helpful. She is willing to help you with anything she can, even issues outside of class. I later did an independent study with her and it was great. Take her class.",1
"This teacher is the worst one I've had in the Comm Department so far. Her practice tests online are super easy and then when you get the in class quiz, they are much harder. This course is only two credits and she makes it way harder than it should be. Impossible to get an A. ",0
My favorite professor of all time! He is so intelligent and really cares for the success of his students. All his exams and quizzes are open note. There is absolutely no way to fail this class. You will learn a lot from him and enjoy doing so! No idea how he doesnt have perfect rating!!!,1
the most unorganized professor. she gets ahead of herself too often and you have to do a peer review which means to grade other peoples homework.. pointless. she also made us have a third exam and a final in the same week (which was a 124 questions.) some of the answers on the exams didn't even have the right answers sometimes. avoid her class.,0
Prof. Chase was easily the best professor Ive had at MJC so far. His lectures are interesting whether youre into astronomy or not. I visited his office hours with a few questions once and he did a great job giving a one on one explanation to make sure I understood the material. The weekly quizzes are a breeze if you study the notes he gives!,1
"Professor Sanchez is a wonderful person who is very passionate about what she is teaching. However, there is an insane amount of homework for this class. Most of the homework is not difficult, but it can be time consuming and tedious. She is a bit disorganized and doesn't grade quickly, but overall it is an easy class.",1
"By far, Francine Dagenais is the WORST professor I've come by at UOttawa, and that's saying something. First off, if you miss more than 2 classes, she will prevent you from doing the exam. Second, her exam requires you to memorize 64 separate pieces, while the final essay is only worth 28% of the final grade. Dagenais is evil. She hates students",0
just say no.,0
"He is a very good lecturer, but his homework and tests are very difficult.  He does consulting work in addition to teaching, so he is impossible to reach if you have questions or need help.  He is very nice and helpful if you can catch him, but good luck!",1
"Great professor. What made the class difficult was the material, not the professor. Her lectures are very interesting and she treats you as if you are all equals and just as intelligent as she is. There is a reason she has a 4.7 on her and for organic chemistry, this teacher should be your number one priority pick.",1
"Professor was very unorganized. Syllabus was changed but not updated, so class didnt know when anything was due or what was expected of assignments because she changes them without notifying the class. Very hard to contact. Does not use e-mail often. Lots of reading, long lectures where she gets distracted and talks of everything but the material.",0
Might be a great researcher but definitely a REALLY bad teacher. Most of his explanations are unclear and messy. Will not answer student questions. Barely available. Cannot solve his own exams without making mistakes.,0
"He was the best math teacher I've ever had throughout high school and college. To put it into better perspective, I took this course spring 2017 and failed with another teacher and retook it fall 2017 and got an A. He will do anything to help you understand or get a good grade. Even resubmit assignments. Very easy going, and a day-brightener",1
"Amazing! One of the best professors I have ever had! Her lectures are valuable and entertaining while her teaching methods should be used as a model for the ideal professor. She provides numerous resources for learning as well as opportunities to correct your work, improve your grade, and achieve an A. I never thought I would enjoy math until now!",1
he singles people out and talks mainly to the females in the class. do not take him,0
Worst mistake to take this guy... absolutely clueless,0
I suck at math and the first time I took this class I didn't pass but this is one of the best math teachers I've had.,1
"Unless you're someone who likes to regurgitate the class discussion in your assignments, don't take Camp. He doesn't allow research or information learned outside of his class; if he didn't say it, he won't grade it fairly. Nice enough guy, but god-awful teacher.",0
"worst prof ever. i got 60/61 required outcomes and he gave me a B. this guy is rude, curses all the time, and is straight up mean to all students. dont take him if you cna help it",0
"Sooo hard. she clearly doesnt know how to teach, students corrected her all the time, and her tests were very hard. I even had tutoring and still failed. and she had assigned seating and in alphabetical order, what is this gradeschool? DO NOT TAKE HER, i took math 125 the next semester and got an A.",0
"Dr. Costanza varies his lecture material and explanation based on his interests, but expects the student to write in-depth papers on each topic every week. Tough quizzes that are weighted to info or details NOT discussed in class. Costanza's rigid ultra-conservative Christianity can be uncomfortable. On plus side, class is repetitive tasks and easy",0
Only a midterm and a final. He didn't get through all the material in my class. Takes notice to people that talk about his book with him. Smart dude but not a very nice guy or a particularly good professor. I would suggest taking someone else because of how painful it was to sit through lectures but it can be an easy A if you try,0
"NLP is a great course. I've never taken a class from a professor so genuinely interested in the topic they were teaching. Lectures are very interesting and the assignments are challenging without being ridiculous. Overall, not too difficult.",1
Matt is a very good teacher. He is very clear and his power points are very good and easy to understand. He really does everything he can to make you succeed. He is easy going and very fair and just a really nice guy. Really enjoyed listening to his lectures. Wish he could teach every class I have to take. ,1
Mr. Luckett is a very arrogant and close minded professor. He refuses to venture outside the book thus making him one dimensional. very little assignments but he grades those assignments as if he was grading a paper due for nationals. Miss one step on his discussion rubric? expect a big ol fat 40 for the grade. i would recommend to stay away.,0
"One of the best profs in the department. Works through obscure and often difficult material methodically, constantly stopping to make sure the class is following. Feels as though she genuinely cares for students and wants each of them to succeed. As with all phil classes, make use of office hours for best grade.",1
"Probably the worst teacher to have instructed this class. Math 221 is already hard enough with a frankly useless book, but to have a teacher essentially reiterate (sometimes verbatim) the book is not helpful. She is extremely fast without being very clear and has trouble solving the homework problems she assigns. Do not take this class with her.",0
This class is SO much work. There are 3 tests and a cumulative final which is optional if you have the average you need to not take it. There is a financial report that is submitted in 2 parts which is VERY time consuming and he doesn't help you on it at all. There are hw's on MyFinanceLab for each chapter. He doesn't explain concepts very well.,0
Dr. Hazell was truly great! I wish that all of my professors were as inspiring as him. This was the first history class I actually enjoyed learning in. Would recommend taking his class x100,1
"Dr. Rix is a great professor, he is really passionate about his subject. If you know his interests, you can get him on really fascinating tangents that stall the class a bit but you learn a lot.  -Lots of Blog Post -Lots of reading -Lots of interacting",1
"Worst professor Ive had. The first two classes were fun, yet Philip Brown is completely scatterbrained, and never stays on topic. Hes inconsiderate of your emails. He barely gives you homework, and when he does its not related to your tests. He doesnt clearly outline testing material. Tests are nitpicked. Too fast in lectures, you cant keep up",0
"She is a great teacher and extremely helpful. Also, Czech is really interesting.",1
Took this course in winter; departmental Final 50% and MindTap works 50%. The Final is 40MC questions in 2 hours. Final is much easier than practice tests. so do the work and you will be fine. Prof is willing to help and respond soon. Make some efforts and you will be fine for this course though she grades based on ranking.,1
"Mary is a very nice lady and is very brilliant and accomplished. However, she was maybe not the best teacher ever for Intro Enviro Geo. It often felt like we weren't actually learning anything, and we were assigned a Lot of reading that was actually never relevant ever. But she is nice and probably good for upper-level geo from what I hear.",0
"Your grade is based on 4 exams alone, doesn't collect homework, give extra credit, or even collect or grade quiz's. There's no room for improvement if you do not do well on all of the exams. He doesn't use MyAccountingLab online but it is there for reference, more than half the students in the class aren't aware of it and neither is he. ",0
Don't do it. Just DON'T,0
"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class",0
"Probably the worst professor  I have had so far at Schulich (MBA). Clearly isn't well suited to teach the MBA curriculum, as all he knows are theories, but has difficulty relating back to relevant work scenarios. AVOID - take with Friendman.",0
Really a horrible instructor for math 95 and higher. She does not know the materials for any of this math class. Really rude in class and yells at students when she made the mistakes. Her office hours are really late and when students goes to her office hours for help. She sleeps in her office hours and yells at students for no reason for material.,0
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
"He almost never had class, but when he did all he talked about was Carnegie and social mobility. Then he would give us online quizzes worth 100 points that were impossible to pass, and I ended up getting a C because he never actually taught but still gave us the weekly quizzes. His tests are all essays and he never gives you your grades back.",0
"Every class was a complete mess. We spent about an hour talking about pure nonsense. She was almost always late. Every paper we did made absolute no sense and her notes were completely illegible, she can't even read it. The only thing I appreciated is the comprehensive steps each paper had, made it easy to write. She's really rude and judgmental.",0
"Great teacher, but she's a hard marker (especially when it comes to papers). The subject material is very repetitive and gets boring after a while. Make sure you read the assigned readings as there are class discussions and a lot of group work. I took the night class btw.",1
"Professor Holt is a very smart teacher. He encourages discussion amongst his students and then moderates the discussion (pointing students towards the correct interpretation). Has a clear and definitive understanding of his material. The classes sometimes get boring because of how student-driven they are, but overall great professor and class.",1
Had a very negative experience with this professor. The class goes for the full 2.5 hours and is unbearably slow. Bases her teaching off slide shows and is VERY lecture heavy. The premise of the class is to build up skills and give a mock-lesson for the class. The professor basically verbally bashed us in-front of the whole class. Not proffessional,0
"Terrible professor. There are blatant discrepancies between explicit policies on the syllabus and feedback on written assignments. Quizzes are based on minute details hidden in dense, utterly boring readings. Do NOT take this class hoping for an interesting perspective on Islam--his teaching will make you never want to touch the subject again.",0
"She helped with all of my assignments and checked everything before I turned them in. I had an A throughout the entire quarter. At the very end of the course she went into the system and changed all of my grades to failing. I emailed her and she accused me of plagiarism. When I reported her, she failed me, but I was still passing. Discrimination.",0
Allyson is super nice and chill but the lectures can be so boring. The class is a pretty easy A though which can tale a weight off your shoulders.,1
"I avoid Misurda at every chance I get, you will not find me willingly taking his class. All his lectures are monotoned, without use of examples or direction. Projects are extremely hard, no structure to the course and lack of examples in class. TA's are more helpful at explaining concepts then the teacher. No piazza even tho class is online.",0
"This is genuinely the worst instructor I have ever had. He is rude, condescending and extremely harsh in his grading. He does not respond to emails and is rarely present during office hours. Class consists of 15 minutes of verbal roll call followed by 20 minutes of a verbatim reading of the already posted notes. Tests are nothing like the homework.",0
"Professor Haldane loves what she teaches. She's great and tries to make the class interesting. However the reading, is beyond long and extremely boring. She gives random exams and constant WTL'S",1
"He rocks!! 100% my favorite teacher Ive had at CSUSM. He is super funny, and his lectures are so entertaining! I was genuinely excited to go to class and I didnt have a particular interest in history to begin with. If you need to take a history GE take Al-Marashi!",1
"Professor McClay is one of the best teacher I have ever taken. She is willing to help you as long as you ask! Come and be on time for her class, study her power points, read the book and you will do great!",1
"Absolutely terrible. She's off topic most of the time, because she's got nothing to teach, since she's got nothing in her brain. It's sad, but it's the truth. If you want a good grade, might as well stay home and read your textbook. ",0
"I am so excited w/ my senior year. Took 446-Epi, loved it, got an ""A"" and now looking forward to his Writing-in-Majors 494 from him. Yes, lots of reading. Yes, lots of writing. Yes, lots of learning. Isn't this what we should want? I want to become a better science writer. He teaches you. If you party, don't take courses from him. I will get an ""A""",1
"This instructor is terrible at getting back to students, grading, and completely unorganized. This was the worst course I have ever had. I would not EVER take a course from this instructor.",0
It was online so I did not expect any communication. All the information I needed was found on the syllabus. She gave a reasonable amount of work (the more assignments the better your grade will be!!) Homework and quizzes are easy. Just make sure you keep up with the deadlines.,1
"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government. He invalidates opinions that aren't his own. If you don't want to be in an echo chamber, I'd suggest another professor.",0
Your not going to have a good time.,0
"Seriously an amazing professor! Yes, he is very lecture heavy so be prepared to take notes, but he makes it interesting!! He makes jokes and relates history to now. I really wish I could take him again! As long as you attend class and take notes to study you are completely fine!",1
"Brilliant to be sure, but very set in his own opinions.  Rough grader--never quite sure what he was looking for.  Will give you a unique outlook on literature though.  Tries to be really intimidating.",1
"Inconsistent & unreliable-says one thing & does another. LAZY-doesn't answer emails unless threatened, didn't update the syllabus from last semester so we had no test dates & no schedule all semester-we never knew when the test was, as of wk 12 still no graded labs or papers. Group projects so he doesn't have to grade more papers. Disappointing.",0
"Great prof--interesting class, considering the stuff going on today.  highly reccommed this guy!!  Find SOCRATES!!",1
"Looking back at the past 5 years of college, Thana was one of the best instructors I had. He made CS very accessible while also challenging me to progress. I also took him for CIS 36B and CIS 27 and I wish I could have taken him for more class still.",1
"I've taken Professor Richmond before and wasn't a huge fan, but I think this semester changed my mind. She's very supportive and is always willing to help if a student is having issues. I wish we had delved more into the material, but I understand that this semester wasn't conducive to that. Would recommend.",1
Great Teacher who really knows his stuff. He has very impressive work and is enthusiastic to share his knowledge with students in the class. This is not a blow-off class the work is hard and time consuming. Great class if you want to really learn about Graphic Design!,1
"The majority of the class focuses on the group project, but in addition there are lessons in between on other things. His class is a good intro into engineering. He does seem unapproachable but deep down he is a funny nice guy and if you do your work he'll give you an A.",1
"students do more teaching then teacher.  even if the student is wrong the teacher doesn't even correct the students. class average for midterm is 68%, most people are failing. I have two As and a B in my other classes and I am barley passing with a C.  takes forever to grade. only half way though semester and not liking it.",0
She never replies to emails,0
Very enthusiastic and gave clear and excellent presentations. Young guy so he is able to relate well to the students. Definitely recommended!,1
Dr. Piland was the worst teacher I've ever had. He made things more difficult than they should have been. He changed his grading point scale multiple times and nobody could keep track of their actual grade. He doesn't answer questions clearly; he just tells you to look it up yourself. Avoid this teacher if you can!!!!,0
"Kosnik is extremely enthusiastic, loves what he does, and enjoys jamming on the piano. Pretty easy A as long as you go to class, pay attention, and do the reading. You have to go go a few concerts and write reviews on them, but it's very easy and there's a chance for extra credit.",1
"Awful, currently in the class right now & cant stand it. Shes extremely rude to students who ask multiple questions. She zooms through showing the class the steps to learn & solve the problems because she can enter everything in excel & use function buttons. Requires you to listen to her online lecture as well lots of homework. WCCCD needs new prof",0
Lectures are useless but random assignments count for 15% of your grade.  Layoun likes to preach ideas that are painfully obvious or that are way too out there.  Lecture consists mostly of putting up passages from the reading and having her read them.  Lots of reading if you actually do it.  easy overall.,0
"While his assignments are presented as difficult, he's actually an easy grader. Technically, everything he assigned I failed to meet the minimum but, he didn't care so long as I tried. Didn't really learn anything but I did get an A. So, there's that.",0
"Kelm is amazing; if you can get him, take him. I took him at Moorpark and CLU, and I wouldn't take anyone else but him. Great guy and fantastic teacher. Talks a mile a minute during lecture but its only b/c he loves what he does, so if you have questions - ASK HIM! He's all about student succeeding and he'll work with you to get your grades up. :)",1
"I saw how crappy her reviews were after starting her class, but after taking her for almost 4 weeks now, she's not as bad as everyone says. She's boring, and grades toughly, but she's definitely not the worst. She won't be your most fun class, but she's not the worst option",0
One of the best teachers I have had. Very caring and helpful. Grades fairly.,1
"pretty confusing professor, it is hard to tell what he wants and your grade can suffer because of it. at the same time however, he seems to adjust his grading by the end of the semester to make up for the weird grades he gives. not the most pleasant experience to constantly be questioning your grade",1
"If you are taking Trigonometry with Prof. Gaworecki, then get ready to spend most of the semester focusing solely on Trig. You will have to keep up with her during lectures and she hands out pop quizzes every other day. (I would recommend studying the homework before class in order to not fail the pop quizzes.) Study weeks before the exams to pass.",0
screw this class!!! worst class i have ever taken at ucr. ridiculous group paper and 4 HARD HARD HARD tests! she is rude and thinks she is better than everybody else,0
Greatest professor you will come across. Inspires us to learn more and experience more about our culture. You're missing out if you're not taking her intro class. I just wish she taught more classes. She kills it still though. Looked forward to class everyday. Why are you still reading this? Go sign up already!! ,1
"Quizzes/test straight from the powerpoints. Didn't need them, though. However... case studies suck, are different from text problems, and don't expect her nor the TA to help, either. She never helped in discussions or private email. I guess she expects the online students to automatically understand the studies, which are 18 points of final grade.",0
"This professor's office hours are extremely limited if you are looking to get extra help. However, if you somehow track him down for extra help in this course, you will not feel respected for he had uncalled for political jabs and degrades your work and thinking process.  Prof. Rogers clearly does not believe in the success of his students.",0
Worst professor I have ever had. Thank god I never have to take this class again.,0
"I took her summer online class. Doesn't accept late work. I am a straight A student, haven't missed a class, and got in contact with her for extra credit submissions, she didn't offer any, and gave me almost nothing on participation. If your major isn't Psychology or anything related, don't take this class.",0
"Jago is the best! Accounting is pretty dry regardless, but he makes sure we get a few laughs in. Not only does he teach the material, but he teaches life skills and keeps us informed of amazing opportunities. This guy actually cares, and he will make sure you do well if you work hard. However beware the second exam is WAY harder. Big letdown. ",1
She is very nice and clear . Her goals r obvious and she tells u exactly what does she want and she is very organized in her materials,1
"One of the best professors I've had, especially since we transitioned online because of the pandemic. Very accessible by email and office hours. Great lectures and wants to help students understand the concept. The test and subject itself isn't easy, and his tests do challenge you. However, if you put in the effort, it's a very rewarding class.",1
great prof,1
She is absolutely horrible. Very unclear on what she would like done. Also very rude. She waits till last minute to tell you exactly what you need done. Would not recommend taking her class!,0
"You need to be able to take jokes. It is not picking on you to be mean, his jokes are to make everyone feel a sense of comfort and does it with good intentions. Can talk a little too much but he's there for you whenever because he actually cares.",1
"Dr. Walker is a great professor. I have taken him for two classes and I have loved him for both. He is a very funny, caring, respected professor. He is always willing to help out and cares for his students deeply. I would definitely recommend taking him.",1
"A real stickler when it comes to attendance and grading and doesn't forgive mistakes at all (won't even reply to emails for explanations). I accidentally turned in a wrong paper and even though he knew, didn't mention anything until giving back my grade and wouldn't accept my actual paper. Jerk. Take this class with a different professor.",0
Bob is a really cool guy and tries to engage students during class but his lectures are just so boring. He posts essentially the same thing through his narrated powerpoints which is better than the lectures AND the textbook. You don't need to read 3 times through but getting ahead early is really important. Overall nice guy just really boring.,1
"I did the homework got a couple 6/10 and a couple of 8/10. Failed about 50% of the quizzes, and ended up with a B+. The final is EXTREMELY easy just memorize all previous tests. You have to do the Homework so make sure you get the syllabus and show up for the quizzes on Fridays. You have to show up 15% is clicker Q's",0
"Professor Sumi is fine if you already know the course material going in. If, however, you have questions or dont understand something going on Sumi becomes openly hostile. She also goes off topic a lot and tends to wander. I was not impressed.",0
Great Prof. The work isn't hard at all. Fair grader. Feedback is great. Loved the class. I would take him again.,1
"Please don't give yourself a heart attack by taking her, this is not fair in pandemic putting so much pressure on students and heavy test and tough in grading. So Big NO! just run away!",0
i think this teacher is ridiculous. He would rather drop students then help them. i know someone that supposedly failed a test and when they asked to see it he told them that he threw it away! he also  belittles students in the class room when they are trying to ask questions and get help,0
"You learn alot, I can't deny. However, the structure of this course is ridiculous. MT and final are each worth 35%, both are 50 MC Qs, and you get an hour for each exam. I've seen level 400 courses that are more forgiving than this. Also, alot of the stuff he tests you on is stuff he never talked about and isn't in the book. Take another professor.",0
I took his class online. Super easy. Only had to turn in 2 papers for the semester.,1
Ms Gray  is a wonderful teacher.  She makes class interesting and fun.  I looked forward to each class I attended and was very depressed when it came to an end.    As a returning student  my experience was so positive I plan to continue taking courses at U.S. I.  I hope that I am fortunate enough to get another teacher with her knowledge & caliber.,1
I decide to take professor choi for fall and let me just tell you she is so the most careless professor i have taken at elac... she doesn't care about her students passing not to mention she'll only provide extra opportunities until the very end of the semester and constantly has typos in her lecture notes. DON'T TAKE HER!!!!,0
"Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit.",0
This professor is really tough. His grading criteria is unclear and he grades harshly. He expects you to take literally everything from his lectures and spit it back out at him. Do not take any of his classes unless you feel like making your GPA drop by several points,0
I just wanna make sure everyone knows to never take this class. Like fr... These positive comments are actually cap. Like please save yourself and do not take this class. If you want to get anything more than a D good luck! YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT IN THE CLASS. LIKE NOT EVEN CAPPING EVERYTHING. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,0
"Teaches out of the book, but does not understand what the book is teaching. Graded heavily by exams that are very difficult. Most of the class was failing, so he made the grade entirely dependent on the final which I got a C on. Extremely boring lectures, monotone.",0
Never available to get help from.  Grades are based off of midterm and final only.  He didn't even know my name!,0
"Most of the grade is based off of essay exams. He gives extra credit that really bumps up your grade. It's not a hard class. No group work, mostly reading and writing. Sometimes class was interesting but it could be dry and boring. He seemed to not care about his job and students but that could have been his quirky sense of humor.",0
Just read from power point slides. Tests were really unfair as many questions weren't even discussed in class. Extremely vague study guide for Final exam. Would not take another class from this instructor.,0
"Great Teacher! I loved his class! Straight forward with you and plays no tricks on tests and quizzes. Study your notes because his tests and quizzes comes right from them, you dont really use the textbook at all.  Overall, good class, just stay on top of your work and youll be good to go!",1
"She's such a nice person and takes time to learn your name. However, I would not recommend this professor. Lectures are very fast paced and EXTREMELY hard to follow. You need to be in class for the material to make any sense, and it's a tough class to want to attend. Expects you to read 5 books throughout the semester and have 4 tests. Would avoid.",0
"There's going to be a lot of reading material as well as discussions, writing assignments, and 1 Book Analysis.  The material is fun and interesting! If you willing to work for it she will even dropen a few low grades.   Example: only have to do 7 out of 9 Discussions, or do 4 out of 5 Writing Assignments.  Take her she's awesome!",1
"Dr. Kunz is by far the best professor, psych or otherwise, I've ever had. The class is super interesting and he is hilarious; which helps. The tests are pretty straightforward as long as you go to class and take good notes. Excellent dude, fun class; a must take! Plus he's hot.",1
"I took English 2332 with him online which most people expect less work because they cannot go to class either working or no transportation.  He gave 3 assignments everyday which is alright, but his tests were confusing and too little time on the online test.  If you're not a reader do not take it with him.!",0
"Even though much of the class was failing, she would say that this was baby bio in comparison to the Biology course she took in college. This was demoralizing and humiliating. She also would discourage nursing students who have children, which I thought was odd because Goodwin is a career-focused college with a lot of students who have families.",0
"Was a nice teacher at first and had a different way of teaching that I respected because not many professors are willing to try something new to help students succeed. However this style of teaching just did not work for me, and after expressing these concerns I guess I triggered him into writing a 5 page paper about how I was a terrible person.",0
"Hybrid course, the days we met in class, we would only go over homework, homework was also difficult. Have to study weeks before test to pass. Try to avoid. Have to use book and program to pass.",0
"MCOM320 is awful no matter who you take it from. Jason is the best you can take it from. He's only 29, still single, and comes from the same stage of life as us but a step ahead, so he incorporates the material into his own entrepreneurial life. The class sucks, but is very rewarding and his feedback is super helpful. Take it from him!",1
"Dr. Fetter is my favorite professor in the Butler MBA program thus far.  It is extremely evident that he genuinely cares about his students.  He tries to lighten up dry classes (such as stats) with humor.  He is clear, concise, do what he says to do and you'll earn an easy A.  He makes himself available to you when you need help.  A++",1
"Unorthodox teaching method, all quizzes are online and timed, and very tough. Study the terms and artifacts on blackboard as often as possible. In class work is a hit or miss, so show up as much as possible. One quiz over each section as well as a short essay, and a final essay that he gives you a week in advance. Study thoroughly for this essay.",1
She is marvelous.,1
"Thick accent, he reads off the power points, gets frustrated when students ask for help, he tries to squeeze in chapters together regardless of the time he has, test are over 125 questions long EACH! Overly obsessed with attendance, if he makes a mistake with your grade he will not change it even on McGraw hill connect. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!",0
"Very much loves his personality, and loves attention. Talks about him more than the actual class. Does not have much experience, and does not have many examples for the class. Give tests, but leaves the room. Intentional late. No care for the students unless they are female. Grabs women in front of all the class, and has not a good reputation......",0
While I won''t deny that I think my writing improved from taking this course I would never recommend a Nelson class to anyone.  He''s very pretentious and he addresses his classes with such an air of superiority as if we are simply lucky that he''s letting us in on his insights about literature and the English language.  I would avoid at all costs,0
"Professor Flores is an activist, intellectual, mental health clinician, and a very pro-student professor-- unlike most at Davis.  I regret not having taken her courses earlier.  On a side note, Yvette, Sergio, and Angie are the best people in the Chicana/o Studies Dept.  Very inspiring individuals.",1
"Love Dr. Anderson! Very energetic and lively. Its strange to see such critical reviews as I have never seen her viciously criticize anyone. If youre serious about literature/English, take her. It will be fun.",1
I took her online for English 101. Professor Bailey was a great communicator and kept us all up to date on the upcoming assignments as well as reminders. She was responsive and gives full credit for the Journals and Discussions as long as you participate. 5 essays and 10 Journals on one novel. Great instructor!,1
"Laura is one of the most unorganized professors I've ever had as a student at UWM. We have assignments from October that are still not graded. Her assignments and quizzes all have typos on them, her instructions for everything are confusing and full of nonsensical words. Good luck if you have to take this class with her.",0
Toughest grader I have ever come across.,0
"Do the readings and you'll be fine. My class had two case simulations, and those cases showed up on the midterm/final. Go to class on the day of the simulation and listen carefully. Other than that, attendance isn't mandatory and lectures are podcasted. Easy course overall.",1
"I love Roberto, and his Australian accent. One of the most supportive professors I have had. His classes were interesting and he did a great job at including all the students. The final was broken into pieces over the quarter, work load was not too heavy and the discussions were super informative. 10/10 would recommend!!",1
"She was definitely helpful and was not necessarily an easy A, but made it easy to get an A. This class definitely requires studying, but other than that, just do your work. She provides amazing study guides and is very helpful. Also, she offers extra credit that can really save your grade. Highly recommend her.",1
not useful,0
Great online course! Weekly short quizzes that were helpful for the exams and Several discussion questions plus she gives some extra credit which is awesome sauce!  If you do your work and do the reading you will pass for sure.,1
"She is very knowledgable, but not really willing to share this knowledge outside of the classroom. Not really helpful during office hours. Her class slides are very general and lack examples and explanations. Again she explains the material good, but not really passionate about it, so her lectures are pretty boring.",0
"For his theo 103 class, just make sure you read and take notes in class because all of the quizzes are online and are based on the notes you take in class. He also is a really nice guy and offers extra credit. Do all of this and you will get an A.",1
"She has quizzes that she makes up herself in her class, and they are often poorly worded and she expects a lot out of students. She expects you to understand many, many, different types of long charts. She also is a tough grader, and I've had times where she completely gave me the wrong grade and said she had me mixed up with another student.",0
"man goes way too fast, mumbles, has horrible handwriting, and just all around sucks",0
"She's an awesome teacher. She's Very caring she really makes sure you understand things so, make sure to ask questions! If you ask for helps she gives it to you and also gives you feedback. English was always a little difficult for me to wrap my head around but she really helped me. Wish I can take her for English 1! doesn't give to much.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Blames students for bad exam grades, never returned any of project grades. Nobody knew how they were doing in the class until the final grades were posted.",0
"Very energetic and upbeat personality.  Enjoyed her class.  She does a solid job of explaining everything, and allows questions at any point during the lecture.  Does a brief review (of the previous class) at the beginning of each lecture.  I found this very helpful if I missed a class.  She is very approachable and kind. She loves her sports too.",1
"Horrible! Gives out worksheets that don't make sense or missing information and don't realize it until someone points it out. Answers very vaguely or his answer isn't helpful at all. Very stressful to work with. Sometimes give you readings that barely if any, helps with the homework. He is the definition of why not everyone should not be a teacher.",0
"Professor Ferrero is SO sweet. She's awkward but you can really tell she loves what she does. Her class is an easy A, but if you want to learn biology you will. Even if you don't need bio for your degree, don't start slacking just because the assignments are easy; there are a lot of in class activities so you have to show up.",1
"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",0
Quizzes everyday and is a tough grader. Her tests are very hard and her tests / quizzes are worded very hard. Don't take her you will hate that class and she makes it so much harder. HW every week and her lectures are so long and boring but you have to stay to get points for the quizzes.,0
"Dr. Stephens's class was the hardest class I had in the semester. She doesn't know how to work a computer very well so her handouts are hard to read and understand. Her directions are unclear! It took me an hour just to comprehend what she was asking me to do and I still didn't do the assignment right, but neither did the majority of the class.",0
"First of all, its not the easiest class in the world, and it certainly didnt help that Rayburn didnt seem to care to actually TEACH the material...pretty much he just told you to do it and whether you not you already knew how to do it or not didnt matter. Hopefully if you take this class, you are able to look at the book and just teach yourself...",0
"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",0
Dr. Jones is an amazing person. I think that she would be a great person to collaborate with if you're interested in community service. As a professor.. not so much. I personally did not like how this class flowed. I loved the main goals and the purpose for this course but I hated the unnecessary assignments. Only got harder when we moved online.,1
"Coop is a great guy. He knows what he's talking about and wants you to succeed. However, he is not clear with where he is going in the lecture sometimes and he also does not do a lot of examples. If you do all of the homework it will help with your understanding, but just be prepared for having to teach yourself some things.",1
Very knowledgable. Went through essays with the professor but failed them each time. Have to give yourself a few days to do the quizzes with them being very long and difficult. Would suggest meeting with her very often to go over your essays over and over till she's very happy with it. Would suggest to show up to every class.,0
"Extremely pleasant and helpful, always willing to listen. Tests are not overly difficult but a good deal of studying is required.",1
"He is such a good professor, very detailed lectures and tells you exactly what you need to study for. The tests are not difficult if you show up to class and pay attention to the lecture. He is very descriptive with the topics given, and if you have any questions, he is willing to answer them in office hours. Highly recommended to take his class.",1
The class is super easy. Go to lecture and do the homework and you'll be set. He bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year. ,1
"Really doesn't care about teaching the course whatsoever. Told our class that half of us may become good engineers and the others would be outright bad ones. Doesn't really read emails for questions, instead responds with rude comments on how we should know certain things that he either hasn't explained yet or explained poorly in class.",0
"I would go to his class once a week out of two days, and when I did go, I sat in the back on the internet the whole time. He rambles on and on about whatever. His tests come straight from his PowerPoints which he posts online. My grade could have been higher if I would have put forth a little more effort. He will talk to you about the tests.",1
pire prof que j'ai eu. rend le cours très difficile volontairement. Évitez ce prof.,0
"The assignments given were very confusing, and not much information is given to complete the assignments. I would not take this class if you are looking for a GPA booster as you put in a lot more work than expected for a first-year course. Would not recommend.",0
"Absolutely hands down the worst professor I've ever had. Not helpful, not available during office hours, completely self involved. Pretentious, teaches theory entirely from one perspective. Also she can be rude and inappropriate. Essentially, she does not care about students, she is not interested in teaching, and she should not be a professor.",0
"If you are genuinely passionate and interested in psychology, this is a great class. The professor wrote the textbook for crying out loud. Taking it as an online class it is very self-directed obviously. Every communication or email received by the professor was pleasant.",1
Her exams are a mess. Some questions I swear is from her nursing practitioner background and nothing to do with the course. Brags about herself,0
"He was a very kind person and tried to make lectures fun and entertaining. This was a difficult class because many of the concepts are more counter intuitive. Parts of the exams were group focused, but it's still on the student to know what's going on. I failed this class the first time and had a different professor. Recommend Loren over anyone",1
"She teaches ""Becoming American"" for an LAS class for freshmen. Very difficult. If you're not amazing at writing, you should probably choose a different LAS class. I had a 4.0 in high school and was lucky to get a C this semester in this class. Not fun.",1
"Great Prof for meteorology. Gives clear feedback on your assignments, the tests are based almost exactly on the lectures and slides. Assignments are challenging but fair. Likes what he does!",1
"Amazing, most brilliant and brightest graduate student!",1
Professor Royce is a very intelligent man but doesn't know how to teach. He is very unclear about what he expects and goes way too fast in class. He's a hard grader and gets frustrated when you ask questions. Avoid if at all possible,0
"I took Professor Antwine's class online. I wish I would have taken this class in- person. There was a lot of information, the tests were difficult. She teaches you how to case brief and that is a skill that will be used a lot in this class. Professor Antwine is an attorney and I wish I would have had the opportunity to take her class in-person.",1
He is slow paced and teaches a few concepts which are good to know. He really want your to understand. I like the fact that he curves the grade very nicely. A very good professor.,1
Dr. Miura did not give a single lecture during this COVID-19 pandemic and was extremely hard to reach during these hard times and during the normal semester. He is not specific nor clear in his grading criteria and when asked for feedback he takes very long to give answer back. Lectures are long and boring! Do not take his class!,0
"This professor literally makes it rain assignments. I'm taking three classes this quarter, and this class takes up more than double the time out of each day than both my other classes combined. Expect to be scratching your head, regretting taking the class, for about 3 hours a day. Resources for help are available on paper, but impractical to use.",0
"DON'T TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!  If you want a sense of dignity and want to feel respected as a person, don't take Rogers.",0
"Dr. Birkett was by far my favorite teacher as a psychology major at NAU. She enlightened me to the amazing world of psychopharm and physiology of psych. She gave me confidence to pursue a career as a clinical psychologist! She is a very dedicated teacher, has amazing classes, and really cares about her students!",1
Great teacher!,1
The content is OK but the prof is helpless. never have homework or extra practice but the final is something beyond the handout,0
"I am warning u all now....this class is not a joke. If u love Anthropology, then take it. She is very passionate and intelligent but there is TONS of work. Like way more than 300 levels. Tons and tons of useless work. Tough readings. Don't take unless u absolutely have to. U will regret it",0
Mehmeti was decent as a teacher. Gives out a copious amount of homework for an introductory course.,1
"Ive always been terrible at understanding math, yet I got an A in this class. Professor Steiner explains everything super clear and always takes the time to make sure everyone is on the same page. Assignments on MyMathLab are really helpful not only for grade but also to study and practice. Looking forward to take this professor again!",1
"He really is a nice guy, he's just not the best teacher. He always gets a befuddled expression when a student asks a question- and half the time he doesn't know what the answer is. There's no rhythm or flow to the progression of material he teaches and nothing is bolded on his slides so it's really difficult to know what he's wanting us to learn.",0
Shes the best prof at the u of a,1
"WARNING: INFORMATIONAL WRITING IS NOT WELCOME. As an engineering major, I write things based around hard evidence, facts, and logic. In other words, I do not like to present unproven theories as factual, because they aren't. However, she likes writing that jumps to conclusions, so if you don't write like a tabloid, you better learn how to B.S.",0
"she is very knowledgeable, if you follow her instructions you will be fine",1
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
"DJB is the best! She made accounting fun and I would definitely take her again. Be prepared for cold calls in class, but don't be scared because she really just wants you to learn. Attendance is not mandatory.",1
"Loved this class, read a lot of young adult novels that I enjoyed as a teen so it was nostalgic. Dr. Keeling is a very friendly, helpful professor but very specific on how she wants things done, such as her papers and journal entries. One novel every week is tough to get through esp. if you have a heavy workload for other classes but it's worth it",1
"Explained terms very well, willing to explain things over and over again to students, regardless how many times has said he it. However you have to be willing to study outside of class. You should read the textbook. If you study using notes from class and the textbooks, there is no reason you should not pass his class.",1
I decide to take Stats with professor because she had really good rating.... her teaching skills are awful and always has typo in her lecture notes. Her homework is useless when it comes it studying so much work for nothing....,0
Long chapters to read in a week's time yet quizzes have 10 questions over all the reading and there's review or a guide beforehand. Questions are also tricky. Does not give any lectures. Discussion participation is a must. This class made me feel incredibly jaded. There's no lectures or learning from the teacher it's just research and reading.,0
"She is amazing, lectures are so detailed. Tests are hard but study and record her lectures and you'll be fine !!",1
"Not helpful at all.  Don't even think about asking questions, will react to you like you are stupid. Very boring teacher. Not recommended at all!",0
"The class itself was fine, he seems like a really nice guy and a nice and easy teacher. That being said he is an older man and doesn't seem to be up to date on terminology. He continually used the word r*tarded, called people who self harm ""cutters"" and blatantly hated people with personality disorders. His class is an easy A but not a safe space.",0
"i love this lady....  she is so sweet, understanding, and always willing to help you. Her discussion are very interesting. she has a good heart and only wants her students to succeed.",1
She extremely cares about her students. She's always there to help you and she will find a way to help you achieve your goals in life.,1
Amazing amazing teacher. Must take to experience the best experience in school,1
"Br. Daniel must be protected at all costs. He's very easy to listen to during lectures, is endearing, and explains things well. It's a pretty easy class as well. 10/10 would recommend for CMP.",1
Very easy teacher. Dont buy the book because she doesn't use it. She gives out material that can be offensive but your mind becomes open by the end of the semester. She lets you write about what you want instead of giving you a structured writing assignment. SHe made writing papers easy.,1
Assigning a massive group project for an online class full of adults who already work full time (which is likely why we are taking online classes) is absurd and infuriating.,0
"He likes to have a lot of classroom participation and is very energetic, but does it in a wrong way. Tries to take feedback from students but lots of times gets lost in what the feedback actually is. Picks on people a lot, and attendance is taken every class, so if you sometimes skip, might not be the best choice.",0
Prof Engelhardt is great! His office hours are extremely helpful.,1
"Martha Steffens is best described as completely, totally, and utterly incompetent.  She doesn't care about her Econ 1051 Journalism class.  And she is completely computer illiterate.  The class is really easy, but she is a bore of a teacher.  Take it, don't go, and just read the power points online.  You'll be fine.",0
"Loved the course and the instructor. Eight assignments, but all very relevant and helpful both for the grade and for personal info.",1
"If you want to pass, you will need to teach yourself. He is extremely smart, but too smart to be teaching lower level. He said our class was a disappointment. also, his study problems were easy and seemed to trick us on the test (Extremely hardunclear)",0
"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass. The exams are way more involved (and graded harder) than you'd think, given how easy the day-to-day work is, so study hard for the midterm and final. Overall, don't love, but it's still a pretty easy class.",0
"READING is a MUST! Don't wait til the last minute to cram stuff. No multiple choice tests, but essays, matchingidentification, maps, etc. Expect pop quizzes & short writing assignments. Read his instructions very carefully. No D2L slides, so take notes. Awesome teacher! Engaging. I learned a ton. I'd take another one of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
"Very clear speaker, but you have to pay VERY close attention to his lectures. I love classics, but I have to say this class does nothing for me. Too many texts to read, and tests take a long time to write. There are also too many definitions to study, but that doesn't guarantee you'll see some ever on a test. He leaves off really important terms.",1
"She knows her material, but not how to teach or grade it. She grades on page space filled rather than quality of content with notes and will give normal scantron tests at home with confusing questions on material not covered in class at all.",0
lool tbt to that one time in class when she said she disliked rap. I was shook. But I needed the course so whateves. She plays songs about whatever drug she's lecturing on before class starts. Her exams aren't easy and she marks hard but the course material itself isn't difficult. Class isn't a total bore even though it's history.,1
"Walks around and disappears for periods during class. Need help? Try not to, she has a hard time focusing and giving advice on how to improve a project. Not much help when learning things on the wheel which happens at the end. Gives suggestions for how she would complete a project even if it isn't the best way.",0
Marvyn is one among those instructors that i would like to have in all my classes. You just need to complete all your assignments and get it corrected and handed back in the following week. His quizzes are easy. He has a lot of spelling test. He does not use moodle so buy your own books. He is hilarious sometimes. But he gives good grades.,1
"He is passionate about what he teaches and stops to ask for any questions. This class is an overview of Sustainable development in other countries so it may be vague sometimes. Show up to guest lectures and DO the readings. although there aren't a lot of them, he does include information from them in the exams.",1
One of the most interesting professors I have ever had. If you get the chance to take a class taught by him I would highly recommend it.,1
"Dr. Veve is a good professor, he truly wants all his students to succeed in his class. Reading the textbook does help, but I made an A without ever reading. The powerpoints and homework are a huge help and a lot of his test questions are pulled from the two. He only grades you on 3 exams, homework/attendance, and the final.",1
One of the worst at NCC Nursing. Her class averages are consistently the lowest by alot(and she doesn't care). She is constantly unprepared for class. Constantly gives work at the last minute. Gives tons of worthless busy work. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. She uses lab for everything but lab activities. Stay away from her!!!,0
"Dr. Staples is an excellent and passionate Instructor. He makes complex elements understandable. Test are tough, but uses homework and online quizzes to prepare you for tests. Labs are tough and time consuming so take the lab after the Lecture so you won't be rushed. Strong Lab partners are a must. Take advantage of extra credit opportunities.",1
"Overly critical & a tough grader. She gives an extreme amount of assignments and is very strict. She gives no leeway at all, so plan to be there for every class, on-time & constantly busy. The way she conducted lab group experiments was awful. If students had the same answers as members of your group, she'd accuse students of cheating. Terrible.",0
"Dr. Jaja is a great professor and if you study and look over lectures you'll pass her exams, because most of what is on the exams she covers in class. She is willing to work with you if your struggling and she really cares about her students. Those leaving negative feedback are likely the ones to expect an A just for showing up.",1
Please do not take this class.  She is the worst!!! The information in the text book was slightly used in class!,0
Wants her own ideas regurgitated back at her and nothing else.,0
"First time taking this professor. Above all, I learned a lot about Spanish literature and its awesome writers. It always involve the students hard work in order to get an A. Dr. Hess  is knowledgeable and makes the class interesting and funny. I highly recommend her.",1
"In order to do good in this class you need to ALL the work and do it exactly right. He takes off points for EVERYTHING. Tests aren't hard, though.",0
Amazing class. He's the most respectful and helpful Professor I have ever had.  As long as you do all of the reading and put in the effort you'll do great in the class. Extra credit is offered throughout the term and he gives excellent feedback. Definitely want to take his another of his classes again in the future.,1
"Grade your papers based on criteria she never mentioned before, or only telling you  after you submitted your paper. Often doesn't care about sound arguments as long as you criticize every thing. Worst professor in four years at the university. ",0
"He would give a list of terms to know which took about an hour to look up, but then none of them would be on the test.  A lot of tricky questions on quiz and upon asking, he would give a BS answer and then knuckle under and give me the points like he was doing me a favor.  Death by power point lecture. I had a 89.6% and he gave me a B anyway. ",0
"Prof wu is a very kind and sweet person. All you need is his ppt slides and lab sessions, you can learn pretty much everything from it. Do not skip the lab sessions. Properly scheduled and planned homework, projects and quiz. He is always ready to clear your doubts in class and outside class too. Would definitely take his classes again.",1
"This prof is very intelligent but is VERY condescending.  He knows how smart he is, but does not simplify his thoughts for his lectures.  Nearly everyone I knew was frequently confused by his lectures.  I will not take a class with him again.",0
One of my favorite professors,1
She is extremely unclear with what she wants for assignments and papers. She is all over the place! She likes to shut down student's ideas. She is easy but not the type of quality teacher I prefer.,0
Take literally anyone else. Chemistry is a strong subject of mine and I am struggling to do well in this class. Get a tutor if you wind up with Brown because he does not teach what's on the test. We spent 2 lectures on a chapter that was supposedly on a test just to find out on the test that it didn't matter. Do not take Dr. Brown,0
I advise only the people who are ging to devote their lives to Bio to continue with it. I got an A in Evo and am now in danger of getting a D in this damn class. Very vague about what's going to be on test and expects you to know EVERY DETAIL. It's a shame 'cause they seem like good people too.,0
"God awful professor, he cant answer a question straight forward for his life. Every time you ask him something he gives you more than his life story and then doesn't even answer the question. He is absolutely unorganized and every time he opened his mouth i cringed at the thought of what would come out. Would not recommend him to anyone. ever.",0
"Gave the final exam. Was challenging, but then I have learnt more in this course than any other at University of Winnipeg!!",1
Worst professor in the world!!!! Do not take her or you will fail!,0
"bias n unfair are the right words! this guy barely teaches..his class is like watching a bad skit of a comedian that already sucks. all he does is make jokes n doesnt teach class..on the positive side, you always get out of class early so depending on what type of student u r u might like him, but if u wanna learn n wanna have a fair grade, AVOID!",0
"Vance makes it seem easy when he lectures, but you are totally unprepared for the test unless you thoroughly read the book. And, with the way he teaches this class, they should make the income tax class a prerequisite. If you don't understand income tax really well, it will be hard to get above a B in this class, no matter how much you study.",1
"I took her summer online class and she gave an extreme amount of homework. Her reading questions were basically all essay questions that were very difficult. She gives way to much reading and work to do for an introduction class. Also when you tried to ask a question she replies with a snarky comment which, made me never ask her anything again.",0
"I have always received an A in every math class I have ever taken. I love math but this professor nearly ruined it for me. Every class is a lecture with note taking but ALL OF THE NOTES ARE WORDS, NO MATH PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. He made something simple seem extremely confusing and he YELLED LOUDLY at us because of it. I didn't go back. Disrespectful!",0
I DO NOT recommend this professor.,0
A real standout professor who really cares about what he teaches. I would highly recommend Professor Reese to any student.,1
"She's so sweet! She's very understanding, and takes a great deal of time to help stuudent's to make sure they understand the material.",1
"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS. In fact, he loves to leave early and leave it up to his TA's to answer 57 questions from a class of 150. Pray that you have Brady as a TA.",0
"A LOT of hw and classwork, test was open note and project was over the course of a couple of months. If you can keep up for the first month the rest of the class will be a breeze. However, Morris is perhaps one of the most vanilla boring lecturers I've had. Bring earbuds to class.",0
He is a very good professor. I had him for my bio140 lab and he was very willing to help anytime I didn't understand something. He allowed a rewrite for the first lab report and if you talk to him about a grade you don't like he will work with you.,1
"Matt Anderson is by far one of the most caring professors at NAU, he is so sweet. If you have him for a lab instructor, you are very lucky. He makes sure all of his students are understanding the material and gives out inspirational tips throughout the whole semester. Keep in mind since it is a lab, you have to go to class to get a good grade.",1
He often went off topic and his lecture slides were terrible. He clearly cares a lot about the material and the students but his lectures have nothing to do with what you're tested on. The multiple choice on both the midterm and the final was very difficult.,0
Maureen is the <b>best</b> teacher I have <i>ever</i> had. I know I can speak for all her students that she is very understanding and helpful.  I have learned so much from her in 2 semesters!,1
"Liked him a lot.  Was hard at first, but his grading and comments are really clear, and he's really helpful in meetings.  Class can be boring but not too bad.",1
"2 Exams worth 60 percent, 14 quizzes worth 40 percent of your grade. He gives you no reviews also no powerpoints. Stay far away from this class.",0
"While mr. Fu is nice and is very knowledgeable about this subject, I feel like he is not a good teacher. I had a hard time understanding him because of his accent and broken English. He seems to prefer outdated ideas over modern ideas so beware of that. He doesn't give very good feedback either. I don't really recommend his classes.",0
"This was a very easy class, and I enjoyed it a lot. Sara allowed us to get to know her as well as the other students in the class. Our projects were fun, and the workload was fairly light. She is a very good teacher to have as an intro to theatre.",1
"She waits until the last minute to give grades and feedback. She tries to be understanding but doesn't really provide help that is well, helpful. Her essay prompts are too specific for an Eng 101 class and the grading criteria is vague hence why she has so much feedback to say. Overall terrible experience, wouldn't recommend. Would give her a zero",0
Worst math class ever! Goes over material too fast. Before you get one thing done he is already starting another.,0
One of the major reasons I have succeeded at UW is because Dr. Xing took me under her wing after a complicated administration type of issue left me a bit stranded. I approached her early on and she has been straight forward and guiding since the day I got to her class. This class is experimental but a big must for quality theory in practice.,1
"She is a good person, very interactive. But whats the point if your grade will suffer. She is very strict and uses her old exams, she doesn't give it back. She is more concerned about her looks (flips hair a thousand times and is always playing with her hair) than the knowledge. Reads from power point, doesn't add on to what she reads.",0
Don't take advanced auditing without taking him!,1
"Dr. Crowley is an exceptional chemistry professor.  I am an older returning adult student who has never taken chemistry classes.  I learned a great deal from her and she would always stay after class to clarify any content we had questions on.  The course was very challenging, but it is set by the ACS, and she has no control over the end test.",1
"I think he is not that much into teaching, and kind of irresponsible. I gave the test for him to regrade, and I never got it back. The materials is hard, and he think we understand everything already, but in fact none of us understand the subject.",0
"You're mostly on your own b/c his lectures vaguely reflect what's on his lengthy exams. He's extremely condenscending and won't even tell you how to prepare for his very tough exams. Harsh, unfair grader and moody. Avoid!",0
I loved this class! She's an easy grader. You will have one powerpoint presentation to present. Study from her lectures and participate in the labs by completing all assignments and you will pass. Dont skip labs! You don't need the lab book only . She is very caring and willing to help you in any way possible.,1
Tries to throw you off on exams. Didn't round up my grade when it was within 0.4%,0
"Qualls is a great professor who really cares about communicating to his students the information and teaching them how to approach history as a discipline. Hes a tough grader but will improve your writing and youll strive to produce a better paper. Very accessible out of class, and his enthusiasm for history is contagious! Class was never dull!",1
"Excellent professor. Wants her to students to understand the course topics. However, Cotes grading strategy is hard to come to terms with. Double check your work! Also, a friendly tip will be: dont email her about a question you received no credit for on your exam or quiz, she will review your whole exam and maybe deduct more points.",0
"He assumed that the student knew too much, was too fast on his examples, and didn't seem interested in talking to his students after class. He was not helpful in the least. I would recommend anyone who may struggle with math to steer clear of him.",0
AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!!!,0
No Comments,0
"Keeps things interesting, cares about students learning. Classwork isn't too hard at all. Attendance is optional, but you get 10 points participation for showing up. Tests are easy. Provides powerpoints, don't have to buy the book if you don't want to. I opened mine once.",1
Hes a great guy. Hes caring to his students that show up to class and make an effort to participate. I learned so much in his class because he made me think. He calls on you randomly so you always have to be prepared. Take his class! You will learn and meet one of the greatest professors at PBSC,1
"She gives you everything you need to be successful, it's up to you to take advantage of it. It's not a hard class at all as long as you put in the work. She posts example videos, has her lectures posted and has the schedule very well laid out. She's very organized which helped me immensely. Jump ahead of the coursework! You'll be glad you did.",1
"Get on his good side and you are golden, otherwise good luck.",0
"Most of the assignments are out of 95 points. When the grades are put in canvas it is out of 100, so the highest you can get is 95/100. Super long lectures but the exam is not that hard as long as you study. Almost 90% of the grades for the semester were not posted to canvas until the week before finals.",0
"Prof Ba is a really easy teacher, I am currently taking him for anatomy 1. You use mcgraw hill connect for hw(have unlimited chances to get 100), quizzes (3 chances for 100), and gives you a study guide the week before your test with the exact questions. No lab reports, has 4 exams for lecture & 2 labs (tissue lab& bone lab).",1
"Trista is a great professor, who has a ton of experience/ knowledge in the field that is shown through her teaching. She truly cares about her students and helping them succeed. I promise the students that left bad reviews are the ones that don't care/pay attention. All you have to do is pay attention in class and you'll learn a lot. Thank Trista!",1
"Although he is a very nice and funny man, I do not recommend him. He moves very fast compared to the other teachers and his lectures were incredibly unclear. He sorta just skims through the chapter and tells you what to look at- doesn't give examples just draws a few sloppy pictures and tells you to do the example on your own. Tests are hard.",0
"Nice lady, but i didn't think she taught very well when it came to Math. I'm taking her again just because her time slot fits my schedule but i would much rather have someone else that fit my learning style. On the nicer side, math is math so if you dont learn from the teacher, maybe youll learn from a tutor. Best of luck! She's very nice though.",0
"Linear algebra: Gupta does nothing to inspire students: reading straight off slides, he teaches computations and definitions s.t. when students like myself try to employ intuition he fails to understand our thought process. Neglects any curiosities you have in topics not directly addressed in the textbook. 3Blue1Brown will be your best friend.",0
"Did not teach us, let the textbook teach us (30 pages each chapter). Weekly homework assignments were like Quizlet. All exams were about super specific info inside the textbook. Easy A for the most part, but damn, I did not learn anything.",0
"Classes are boring, tough and late grading... Get ready to warm coding skills before semester starts. Otherwise hard to catch up !",0
"I was not happy with Mrs. Dudleys teaching. Her lectures are pretty bland, and her grading was very hard. Her labs are rushed and take forever. I would not recommend taking this class if you're looking for an easy A...",0
"MA structures this class in a way that if you want a good grade, it will consume your entire semester. I can't think of the last time I wasn't swamped and worried about what accounting homework I should be doing. She makes things seem more complicated than they are because she knows the material so well. Expect at least 20 hours of homework a week.",0
"I had her for students with special needs and, although she is really nice and helpful, there was a lot of work for the class.  Everyone was confused and stressed out throughout the whole process.  She's a great teacher and really accommodating, but be prepared for tons of work, and be on top of it!",1
"His grading is terrible, most of the people in my class are complaining already. Honestly feels like he lacks the compassion because he marks everything off even if your answers are right. I wouldn't recommend taking him.",0
She's a tough grader but she'll give you feedback that will really improve your signing,1
"THE HARDEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. Dr. Hollis is a fantastic teacher, really enjoyed the lectures. His tests are incredibly hard and you can be blindsided by the minutiae he will ask about. A lot of writing too, no memorization or preparation for how the information will be tested. Labs are a lot of work but easy good grade Quizzes easy to mess up.",1
"Not good. I would understand everything and be able to do the in class problems, but then would get to the test and the problems would be nothing like what we did in class. The test material was always unexpected no matter how much I prepared for the exams.",0
"I'm beyond grateful to have stumbled upon Kate at the onset of pursuing a career in education. 1st though: don't take Kate if you're looking for an easy A. PLEASE do take Kate if your curious about a discipline that's complex, challenging, and messy. She gives you a wealth of knowledge. Take her wisdom and learn from it, future educator.",1
Its a really easy class Professor Wood is very nice and caring I highly recommend and you will have group projects.,1
Very supportive. If you want to study and take interest in class/project he will go overboard to help you. Since my class didn't have lots of student so knew each person by name.,1
It's a passable class but don't bother buying the textbooks. Everything comes from her power points. Also she gives random quizzes to check attendance.,0
"I would not take her again for public speaking. She gets very political and judgmental if you do not have the same political beliefs as her. She should be teaching debate or political science. If you agree with her views you would love her but if not, it sucks. A lot of wasted time in class but heavy questioned tests so you have to pay attention!!",0
Very strict professor AVOID him.,0
"I did not enjoy the class, not relevant course material for a 4th business class. I felt like he spent more time guilt tripping the class about things versus teaching us something of value.",0
Good professor and good course,1
I'm taking her this semester and so far she's amazing. She goes a little too fast sometimes. It that's ok because she's more than willing to meet with you anytime if you have any questions. She also tries to give you as much points as she can even if you get a zero you,1
She is a great english teacher but very picky.,1
"Lectures are fantastic- Tompson is animated and engaging. She has lots of funny anecdotes but can get off track sometimes. This PS101 class has more work than the other sections: mandatory paper, 3 midterms, and a final. However, the lowest midterm score is dropped. However, she is very clear about what'll be on the exams.",1
He is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is witty and funny as well as understanding. His lectures are actually interesting and he plays guitar for his classes sometimes.,1
"He literally teaches from the book. There's no point in showing up to class, your best bet if you end up with this professor is finding someone who already took Calc II and have them help you with the class. Take someone else if you can help it.",0
"Probably one of the worst teachers iv ever had. Currently taking this online and am struggling. No guidance whatsoever. She does not seem like she wants to teach. When you ask a question there is always an attitude. Very lazy. Seems unhappy every time she speaks. There is no lecture, you teach yourself. Same for lab, its a joke. Dont take her.",0
"Only teaches the easiest questions in class and then sends you home with a bunch of hw either much more difficult questions that he didn't even at least brush over and there's even questions that we didn't go over what so ever, overall he's a terrible teacher. Guess that proves that anyone could become a teacher",0
Derek is an extremely personable professor. He also graduated from UE so he consistently maintains a difficulty level on par with other courses. He is also very helpful and will do his best to answer any questions you have.,1
"I loved Professor Ipaye! I looked forward to her lectures, they were very interesting and fun. She makes the information easy to understand and learn. The quizzes and tests are all online and open-book. Highly recommend.",1
The best professor I've had at UT yet! His exams are fairly difficult but there is so much extra credit available its not a big deal. The lectures weren't always the most interesting but the subject matter is something he's passionate about which makes a big difference. Easy recommendation from me for anyone needing this class.,1
"Her class was an easy ""A"" if you completed all your work. She gave out extra credit opportunities too. Worth taking her if you are looking for a GE class that's a stress reliever",1
"If you want to learn absolutely nothing and just listen to him talk and joke about his life, take this course. Easiest class I've EVERRRR taken.............",1
Great professor! Do the work and put in the effort and you will pass. Taking her for a&p two.,1
"Amazing professor, great at teaching!  Fun class with a lot of personal stories that make things very clear.  I learned a lot and would certainly take another class from this professor!",1
He lectures the entire class period and is very boring! He is very scatter-brained and goes off on random stories about his life. His tests are very hard!! and there is a lot of memorization and reading involved! but he did give you study guides for the tests.. that were 30-40 pages long! definitely dont recomend!!,0
"Professor Mantell made doing labs on Labster (online) easier and interesting. For discussions, we reflected on what we learned each week. Reading other students' responses helped me understand important concepts from the course. Her grading was easily understood, and the midterm and final efficiently reflected course material.",1
She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :( She's not a great teacher. Don't take her.,0
"Grading criteria was not clear. Gives extra credit, but she won't post it online. So, it is hard to tell if she's really applying them to your grade.  Not very helpful. When explaining something, it was confusing.",0
"come for a free grade and you will be disappointed. need help, he's your guy, be it for this class or school in general. participate is what I did and complain is what my classmates did, why? because they weren't prepared nor did they participate. I'm tired of complainers when they dont put the effort in.",1
"He is funny but you can't deny his holier-than-thou attitude. He used to disregard me in office hours and participation because he genuinely enjoys humiliating a student who volunteers to contribute in class. Also I once asked him to review my bugged code and he scuffed at me ""your attempt isn't good enough for a rudimentary problem"" So opinionated",0
"Everyone has their niche. Teaching & explaining is not Rogers niche. One of, maybe the worst professor I have ever had!  Take someone else.",0
Just No,0
"The first 60% of the course is a joke.  Quizzes are moderately difficult, but all answers can be googled.  The ""Virtual Emergency"" exercise is easy in theory, unfortunately Ali botched it due to clericaltechnical errors.   The final exam is extremely difficult (and worth 40%), and would require a didactic memory to succeed.  ",0
"EXCELLENT Professor. Amazaing upper-level teaching style. She requires that you read, respond, and discuss which was extremely helpful. Discussion board was obnoxious at times, but really did force you to do the readings. We wrote one huge paper throughout the course of the semester, and it was probably the best paper I have yet to write in college",1
Professor Dattolo is an excellent professor who is always willing to help us. He is available to give us extra help during his free time. His lectures are very clear and he really respects his students. He is the best!,1
"Monotone voice, gives long lectures before and at the end of class. Talked all class period once and then made the class stay after to draw. Gives a lot of homework assignments, and rarely gives A's.",0
I love this teacher she helped me out alot.,1
Easily the worst professor I ever had in college. She is insanely strict and expects you to never make mistakes. Like EVER. There were many nights where I would just start crying because one little thing was inaccurate on my work and she would give the entire assignment an 'F' and be horribly rude about it. She does not communicate well at all.,0
"Try not to take this class if possible. Her lectures are so irrelevant and she often isn't prepared. She canceled class 3x in 3 weeks & we were expected to learn everything on our own. I honestly don't know why I showed up to class. If you are a self teacher and don't want to show up to class, this might be for you. She's very nice but can't teach.",0
She's extremely vague and doesn't really respect students' time.  She also takes attendance.  But she's not the worst prof. ever.,0
"Had her for Personal Fitness Rude, disrespectful. Mocks you when you work out if not up to her standards. It's a 1 credit class and she treats it like three credits. One of the worst teachers I've taken at this college. Think very hard if you're going to have her.",0
"Incredibly boring lectures. I was able to teach myself out of the book and still do well in the class. The group project isn't too bad, but the directions are incredibly unclear and he had to be asked multiple times for things to become clear. Easy class if you read the slides and do practice problems. So boring though. ",0
I truly CANNOT say enough good things about this professor. Even though this was an online course- she was so sweet and helpful. Through her emails and funny posts you can totally tell she's invested in her students and just actually cares. Seriously she's the best!,1
I had Professor Were for two semesters and I always enjoyed her class. The lectures were structured in a way that made French easy and understandable. I had originally planned on just taking this course to get the language requirement out of the way but now I hope to take more French courses in the future.,1
WOW,0
Prof Flores is such a sweet lady. Her 2 midterms were verbatim from the study guide. Just do the reading and you will be fine.,1
His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,0
"He is  very smart and speaks in his own type of way. He really wants what he teaches to stick with you, and I don't know yet but I think it will. You really have to study hard to do well on his tests, but I think it is worth it. ",1
"This woman is the devil.she gives no help. If u ask her what u did wrong her reply will be something ""like u don't listen or NO"".. All she dose is talk about herself. And expect you to know ever line of ever poem or story. I wrote a 8 page paper for her and she gave me a 58 on it and told me that was being generous. I asked what I do wrong her reply ""what didn't you do wrong now get out of my office"".. The lady is hart less.. Take her if you want a F-.",0
"I really enjoyed Harp; he's an engaging lecturer and he uses lots of videos/pictures to really help the content come alive. If you don't come to class +  don't take notes, then you won't do well because his tests are about 85% lecture. But, he wants you to think + if you want to do well and actually learn, you easily can. I'd take his class again. ",1
"I'm sure she's great for upper level classes because I can tell she's caring & intelligent. However, this was so much work for a 100 level class. & I don't think she planned her lessons. I was stuck listening to directionless ramblings twice a week. Take someone else for ENG 104, especially if you've waited until senior year to take it (like me).",0
"So much reading and memorization for a level 200 course. Quizzes are open book, yet they are built to trick you. The final exam is on all course content which is 15 weeks of slideshows, videos, articles and textbook. Teachers are nice but they don't realize how difficult they made this course especially as an elective. Would not recommend at all.",0
Melanie is a teacher who cares about her students her lectures are a bit boring but the slides are very explanatory. Final was easy but REALLY long with 100 multiple choice  worth 50% and 7 LONG answers worth the other 50%.,1
"his way of teaching is very effective, he writes everything on the board and you copy it down. he gives a lot of examples and really wants you to understand the material. however, he is kind of intimidating, and will call you out if you say something stupid. he gets mad when people don't participate, but he is hilarious and a great professor",1
Get quizzes often (worth around 10% of final grade). He has an accent which makes it difficult to comprehend what's being taught.  If you are new to chemistry then do not take this class. He is not straight forward and he can be confusing.   Most of the learning will be done outside of class through homework!,0
"Dr. Xing was so helpful and patient in teaching us in Orgo 2. When everything had to be quickly switched to online, she did an amazing job. You can tell how passionate she is about organic chemistry. Also, she really cares about her students and wants them to do well. I was so lucky to have her.",1
Don't waste your time going to his office hours. He won't hep you and will tell you to learn  it yourself. Better off memorizing the textbook than doing his assignments. Will tell you to drop out if you don't pass the midterm (over 55% will fail it). Breaks the rules every year.,0
"Patrick Cooper's lectures are extremely hard to understand. He spends the majority of the time standing in from of the board blocking his work. He lost three of my quizzes, and our average was very, very low. I have spent the entirety of the semester teaching myself the material.  STAY AWAY.",0
"Mrs. Wight was not a bad professor, but she was very insecure about her teaching, and it showed. She wasnt completely sure how she should do certain things, which made the test and projects confusing. She gave extra credit at the end of the semester.",1
"Brian is really cool and approachable. He gives very helpful, relevant lectures to teach technique and photoshop tools and is willing to support you and help you with your unique direction. Take him for any digital classes you can!",1
"Didn't like that most of math formulas used/execution of math problems couldn't be found in textbook as the slides were from Pearson, not OpenStax (this was confusing). Sometimes impatient with evening class students. Did make effort in explaining problems mid-semester for tests and final exam. Advice, team with classmates and use youtube math.",1
"I've had this professor for AJ 2 & AJ 3 & he is awesome!! One of the best AJ professors at LACC. He has a great teaching method. If you read the chapters and study, it is easy to get good grades.",1
"Had her for litho, then I had Brian and learned how to do litho.  She didn't teach us things, like how to scrape the rollers, and what the chemistry of litho is... basically came out with an idea of the medium but not any proficiency.  not recommended.",0
"open minded, kept class interesting, fair, energetic.",1
"awful prof, awful examiner",0
"Easy (A) class, but he singles people out and attacks them in personal ways, about inappropiate subjects. Not sure if he trying to be funny, or if he is on some sort of power trip? Take at your own risk!!!",0
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
I am not a fan of Frazier. I was always early to class and I always participate but for some reason he did not like me and it was obvious. After every monologue he would bash me. He's not a good person and I definitely would not take him again. Quizzes are online which is nice but he doesn't let you see what you got wrong which is annoying.,0
Wonderful professor! She made my freshman year terrific! I was in her 1502 as well as 1503. She is always there when you need her and will go the extra mile to make sure you understand the material. Would definitely recommended to all incoming freshman!,1
He makes humorous examples to explain economics.,1
He was a very tough grader and he was super excited for you to participate.,0
Useless... inconsistent...unmotivated...ineffective.,0
"Dean is approachable, understanding and overall just a very nice guy to have class with. I've had two classes with him and received a 4.3 in both. With a little effort there's no reason you can't do the same.",1
"really great professor, cares about his students. The tests are fairly difficult, but he offers a lot of extra credit. also does not take attendance, but has questions to be turned in at the end of class that are graded. must read the book to do well on the quizzes.",1
Amazing professor! Highlight of my freshman year!,1
"Take it with some one else. He is a nice guy, but over-complicates topics that should be easy to understand. Awful at explaining the material. If you don't have an innate knack for stats, this class will make your situation even worse.",0
"Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Mocks his students, mean, biased, overall horrible teacher. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!",0
"This Professor is OK, but finding out when assignments are due, what needs to be done for them, and those details, are not able to be found online, or in his syllabus. I wouldn't recommend this class. It's really hard as a three hour, and most people spend the time on Facebook the class is so boring.",0
"the BEST math prof @ CSM! a literal blessing bc he managed to teach ME stats. effectively too. very accessible outside of class and is very patient with you if you dont understand a concept very well. everything is connected so dont worry abt things popping up on tests. long story short, take him for math if you can, you wont regret it",1
"Susan is pretty good. My problem is that she has no problem publicly calling students out when they do something wrong which does not foster a good learning environment. She needs to be better about responding to emails & getting off task. Overall, she's okay. If you like spastic, energetic teachers take her. She does chose favorites though.",1
"Half-way through the semester Meryl tossed out the lesson plans and threw caution to the wind. She left everyone in the dark about the grading for several projects and piled on papers, exams and presentations for the last week of class. She is a wreck organizationally, emotionally, and professionally. Unable to use the computer or moodle. ",0
"Have pop quizzes from the readings you are supposed to do which are kinda hard. I went her for help and she let me redo almost all the quizzes I failed!! She is really caring if you go to her and she wants to see you succeed. However, her classes are so boring and you take at least 7-8 pages of notes every lecture. She does not post the slides...",1
"For someone not interested in math, this class was very dull and seemed to be a lot harder than it would have to be. She seems pleasant enough but doesn't make any attempt to connect to most students. Not a great teacher; take someone else for 125 if you can.",0
Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.,0
"awesome (and im not a history person!) easy class. she is interesting and thorough. I personally did not use the book at all.  I would definitely recommend her,.",1
"Professor Liggin is an amazing professor. The lectures are exciting. attendance is not mandatory but if you skip class, you won't pass. Professor has a bold sense of humor that will keep the class engage if you have questions ask he will answer!!!! Take him, best professor",1
"Monica is really good, she explains the class on a level that you will understand it!  Still not understanding it? She figure a way to break it down for you so that you WILL understand. Need help? Monica was ALWAYS willing to help her students!",1
Very bad professor. Very unclear. Bad english skills. Very bad people.Is better when he doesn't attend.,0
"He seems so nice at first but grading is very harsh, answers to the CM Exerc can be correct but if its not what he is looking for, well too bad he aint giving you a point! Class was via Zoom,he requires cameras and mics at all times for attendance. I dropped after two weeks,it was too much work. PLEASE dont take this class, there are other options!",0
laid back. his lectures are hysterical.,0
"Mr. Smith was very caring and understanding. The course was made up of 1 persuasive essay, 1 research, and 1 final paper that was 9 pages. No quizzes or tests. Always let us out early and had short classes.",1
"This class is supposed to be an introduction to linear algebra, but Falk teaches it like a graduate course.  His schedule was far different, and much harder than other sections of this class.  Tests were only partially related to homework problems, and often required a huge leap in understanding from what was covered in lecture.",0
HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! This man cannot teach. He hardly gives notes/examples which is very essential in accounting. Very boring and cannot answer your questions cuz he doesn't know himself. If you take him you will fail. He's late most of the time and reads from powerpoint print outs. You're guarenteed to fall sleep or stare out the window.,0
"Just say no, and stay away or youll be sorry. I dont even know where to begin on how bad this course is. You will need to teach yourself because what he tests on has nothing to do with the lectures that He drones on about. If youre trying to get into a limited access program then definitely stay far away Because this course could ruin it",0
"He's a talker so take lot's of notes. He gives about 1 quiz a week and sometimes it's a pop quiz so make sure you know what's going on. No tests other than the final and for that you just need to review your quizes so make sure you have the right answers. He gives some easy assignments, but doesn't grade them just for class use so do them for credt",1
She is really mean she has made me and other students i know cry.  The worst part of it all is that she runs like everything so like you cant get away from her.  if i knew a person like that was running the theater program I would never have joined.  time to switch my major,0
Professor Sanchez-Bello is cool and helpful. She does have an accent but you'll be able to understand and get the concept of the course. Her reviews are great. I wish more professors were like her,1
"I was NOT fond of her instructional approach. She seemed to rush through the material. When I asked for assistance or guidance she was not very optimistic or supportive. She's arrogant, not very approachable, judgmental, and called people out when they make a mistake speaking Spanish.  I've never had any issues with any professors, until this lady.",0
"If you take this class just know you will need to read and watch a couple of films. You will have to do homework twice a week based on the readings and the films. However, he only gives you 2 exam (midterm and final) and one short paper. If you have any questions you can e-mail Professor Pfeifer and he will respond right away. Easy A if you read.",1
"Professor Agol is nice, if a little shy. He will help students who reach out to him. Lectures are mostly clear, but also kind of boring (it doesn't help that class is 80 minutes long), but you don't really need to go to them because he posts slides w his markings online. I hardly felt the need to use the textbook, I wish I'd just torrented a copy.",1
She was very nice but did not explain the material that well. At least one person in our class would end up crying out of frustration. I would not take her again.,0
"Prof. Reese, was amazing!!! I enjoyed his class. He has been the best teacher I have ever had in my college career. He is so flexible, understanding, and overall an amazing teacher. I truly wish he taught more subjects, because he is phenomenal! 10/10 recommend! You won't regret your decision of taking his courses.",1
"Professor Quinlan is so sweet. He lectures almost every class, but he's understanding of students' needs and isn't a stickler for attendance. There is one take-home test, a written final, and an extra credit assignment. He prints out his conglomeration of a textbook for you and is very knowledgable about! He doesn't want anyone to do poorly at all!",1
"My favourite prof by far! she is so funny and kind, class is a pleasure attending",1
No Comments,0
She is a very tough teacher. You can learn a lot if you dedicate the time to her courses. She expects you to come prepared to class. If you aren't she will scold you. Find another teacher for this class if possible.,0
"I have had Professor Sumi for financial as well as managerial accounting. I am an Automotive major and these were required classes. Sumi is hard for those who do not come to learn, she will not take disrespect but is one of the nicest people out there, she makes me understand accounting through industry related problems. SHE FORCES YOU EARN IT.",1
"I have never disliked an English class so much, and Im an English major! Mike doesnt like his students and obviously has some insecurity issues because he uses his job to make himself feel better. He has no clear grading criteria, asks for 3 papers a week, gives pop quizzes, and is flat out unprofessional and rude in his feedback. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
"Class is relatively easy if you read the book. Tests are based on items not really from lecture but more so from the book. Teacher doesn't make an effort to be there for students, GSI's are more helpful/nice.",0
"There's a lot of readings to do, but if you read them all and attend all lectures and sections, it's not that hard to get an A. Beware of bad TAs though, because it's an asian-american class the TAs might seem a little anti-white, just take section with a grain of salt",1
Study guides are useless as tests are very different from the guides themselves. The fact that you fail if you get below a 60% in the class even though you have a good enough grade is just odd.,0
She talks very fast and when told to slow down she doesnt. She doesnt make a study guide and doesnt go straight off the book so its very hard to study for tests.,0

"Dr. Simerka is fabulous. Her class certainly requires a bit of reading. However, 53H is an honors level course so this should come as no real surprise. She is super passionate about the class and genuinely cares about her students.",1
There are 5 tests and 2 extra credit opportunities. I advice you to take part of the extra credit to have that as a boost for your grade bc if you flop on all the exams its a wrap for your grade. Knox isn't the worst but he isn't the best either. Assigned seating. The class was interesting as far as speakers & videos. Fairly recommend. Late course.,0
"Dr Pittman was an incredibly kind and helpful woman. She took great care go get to know all of her students, and although her sense of humor could be a bit awkward, it really showed. Her grading practices were fair and she made sure you understood why you recieved the grade you did. Couldnt recommend enough.",1
"If you want an easy English class, take her! There were a few essays and a final group project at the end. She gives short readings for homework and has quizzes on them but if you do the reading they should be easy. If you turn in your essays and do well on the quizzes you should be able to pass the class with an A.",1
I liked Dr. Prasad for chemistry. She is really good at lecturing and helps students to understand difficult concepts. She loves participation and likes when students work problems on the board. She does not give out test reviews and rarely reviews for the test so your notes have to be clear and accurate to study.,1
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
"The only person who could make corporate accounting relatively interested.  He really cares about his students, and I loved taking his class.",1
"if you have to avoid one thing at UConn is this guy. yes you might try your best to understand the class but taking him will take the interest of math out of you. its a no no, never take him, you you will be clue less the all semester and get bad grade.",0
"I hate this class. Group work, forced class discussion, and a lot of homework.",0
take her Class if ur PASSIONATE about reading a bajillion pages of history.,0
Don't take this class with this professor! No grade updates at all so you have no idea where you stand. Required reading doesn't count toward the grade at all.,0
"Horrible Teacher, only reads from the text book and expects too much from people. To give him a bit of credit, he does give us simple homework..at times. His test are also both True-False questions and are always open book. If only he gave a better description he would be a better teacher.",0
"I took an ELI course with Professor Parker and she was extremely helpful. It's not an ""easy"" A, but what part of college should be? It's math and it requires some learning. She is responsive and explains things so students understand. I'd take her again in a heart beat.",1
"Yes, it's possible to get an A but you'll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting, but you have tog get super organized in this class. You'll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible, I'd avoid this class as an 8 week course. You'll definitely always have somethingto do in this class. ",1
"Heyborne is, in my senior opinion, the best professor SUU has to offer.  He gets very engaged with his students and is very invested in his subject material. He was my very first biology professor my freshmen year, and I was lucky enough to have him again my senior year. He's the reason why I kept with it.",1
Homework assignments are very easy to get 100 on. Two group projects that are mostly graded on the idea and not really how you present it. Test are easy if you study sometimes he throws some questions in that are not fair cause they are trick questions.,1
"Very hard class!! Unorganized. Erin looks nice ,but not willing to help. I dont recommend her  if English is not your first language,she lectures too fast. Her tests are tricky and hard. Shouldn't teach Bio160.",0
"Dr. Creed is one of the best teachers on this campus. This class is hard and he makes you work for a good grade. But if you put in the effort and get on his good side, youll be golden.",1
We only meet once a week because this class is mixed mode and we often cut class short. I haven't learned anything that I couldn't just read out of the textbook and he makes the class way too easy. He will do anything to not give you 100% on an assignment even if he contradicts himself. I'm pretty sure he doesnt know anyones name and class is small,0
Useless class full of busy work. Late grading.,0
She really wants you to succeed! 3 exams that she prepares you for but there is a lot of homework. she gives the homework so you have a better chance of getting an A if you arent a good test taker. the homework is simple & straight forward. great person & professor!!,1
"Dr. Galileo was VERY monotone, and I was not interested or engaged. He reads off his powerpoint slides, and expects you to read the book to learn. He is not helpful, and does not answer emails . People say its an easy A (if you actually read the book and practice test), but I 100% preferred BISC401 which other people have said is harder. ",0
"No calculator allowed at all. Homework every night, due the following Monday. About a chapter a week done. Lots of examples and notes in class. Thankfully an older textbook. Tests are necessarily hard but go over every concept in the chapters.",1
"Funny, cares for her students and she pretty easy going. Beautiful also.",1
"Straight Up Awesoem Dude, made learning fun!!!",1
Willing to help if you ask for it but very tough grader. Class was not enjoyable because of the slow pace and boring content.,0
"Wouldn't take him again, he skips around the chapters and talks about what he thinks is important, then he'll put questions on the exams that you didn't cover in class. Really nice guy, but I really hate his teaching style.",0
"Nice man and a great chemist, but I found his lectures to be all over the place. He rushes through examples so fast and skips mathematical steps, so if you plan on just learning from lecture and not reading the book... Good luck. A lot of out of class effort is required for this class, I found it harder than organic.",0
DO NOT TAKE HER! She makes you buy an app and has in class quizzes EVERY DAY and she starts class on the dot and ends on the dot. She will not let you leave and takes attendance before and after class. She words the tests / quizzes in a really uneccesary difficult manner. She is also really rude and her lectures are super boring.  Tests are hard!!,0
grades too hard,0
"god this lady is the devil, simon cowel of the speech word. everything you do is wrong, even if its right. NEVER take this lady.",0
He's a really nice professor. The class overall wasn't too difficult just a lot of studying and you need to pay attention in class. There were quizzes every week not a lot of hw. Class was fun sometimes,1
Best HR course ever taken!,1
Bad at communicating!!,0
"Great class overall! Learned a lot, good lectures, some in class group work but it's not too demanding. Would take again.",1
GREAT professor. Explains how to adjust in a very clear and concise manner.,1
"I don't even know what's going on in the class 95% of the time. He supposedly teaching us data structures but yet he never writes a single line of code in the class. What's going on? He has this code which is all from the textbook, and he ""teaches"" us with that. Assigmts/exams are difficult, and don't get me started on the vids he makes us watch...",0
"Took Engineering Mathematical Analysis with Dr Gueye, and he was absolutely useless. Constantly did examples incorrectly in class, never answered student questions properly and provided incorrect solutions to the lab work. He also planned and marked exams so you would be rushed to complete, make small errors and get 0 for the whole question.",0
"If you want an instructor that will communicate with you, don't take her classes. I e-mailed her a few times and never heard back from her. In the online class there are group discussions once a week. Even when you meet her criteria for acceptable participation, she still deducts points. Tried to ask what I did wrong. No response.",0
"Great. Easy on scoring paper esp classwork and hw ->chance to get full credits. No stress in her class even when you're in a short term or summer session. Class: very comfortable. A lot of group discussion, which really helps in writing your papers bet",1
"There's a reason why this class was still available to add a day before school started! Constantly passive aggressive and will talk down on you. Semi easy, but it wasn't a fun semester at all. Creates a bad environment for writing stories. No talking to classmates, no music, no fun. If you like journalism, go somewhere else.",0
"Will never take this professor again! His quizzes were very tricky, all quizzes had questions that had nothing to do with the assigned chapters. The weekly reports are heavily graded on grammar. Take at your own risk!",0
Actually made stats fun and interesting...a topic that I was not looking forward to learning about after a full day of work! Probably the best lecturer I have had at McGill so far!,1
"She was an amazing teacher! Just study your syllabus do your journal, and it is an easy ride. She brings an interesting side to your studies, a very interesting side!",1
"She's tough.  Take Barbara Miller before taking Larsen. Its lots of work, especially when you want to goof off. P.S:   For all the guys out there, her sons are really cute. But she'll get you to where you wanna go. Lots of information but it will make some sense.",0
"I took his online class spring 2019 his class is an easy A. Gives great feedback, very easy assignments, and if you have any question his very quick to respond to any emails.",1
Mrs. Noland is very merciful when it comes to grading and getting assignments done. One thing that I like about her is that shell nod and mouth to you Good Job when youre finished saying a speech. Shes pretty encouraging and honest when it comes to the end of speeches. She also does a few class games that really benefits public speaking.,1
The best professor I will ever have the pleasure to take at App. He's a perfect teacher who genuinely values everyone's opinion & takes advantage of the class to learn with you. Great conversation inside & outside the classroom. He works hard to make all material applicable to teaching & everything you learn is life-changing.  Take. His. Class.,1
"This class says it is synchronous but the Professor operates as if it were asynchronous. Only requiring that we be present on test days. So that means little to no lectures to explain the work you're expected to know. HW is provided weekly. Test are VERY difficult. 12-15 answers per question on test to choose from, instead of normal 2-3 options.",0
Dr. Singh is very nice and understanding. He enjoys what he teaches and teaches it very well. There are quizzes throughout the semester so show up to class. ,1
"Vet Tech majors, beware. Dr. Woodard, while intelligent, has not a clue on how to teach. Consistently changes his mind about the material. Write down everything. He often veers off topic and rants about how students are not doing the work rather than teaching so that we can complete it. Will make you want to change majors. Just stick it out.",0
"Dr. McLaughlin is a great professor! His lectures are interesting, although a little long (he will elaborate on a single topic for a full hour on some days). He takes attendance and participation VERY seriously, and it does affect your grade in the class. Also, there's about 1 assignment per week, but they're all pretty simple. Would recommend! :)",1
Absolutely terrible and incredibly condescending. Refuses to meet outside of class and makes fun of you when you dont understand,0
The class is normally a community class yet this year it wasn't. Didn't give any test but your grade is made up of the writing you turn in. Not the hardest grader on essays. It was a very easy class. He does not follow the syllabus and we did not use the book. Over all the class is very essay just a lot of writing to do.,1
"He is so confusing the way he teaches class! A lot of reviews say he's scatterbrained; that is completely true. He assumes you know everything he talks about & unless you ask questions, he doesn't really address things you want to know. Assumes you know everything & relies on you reading to learn, he doesn't have lesson plans. I don't recommend.",0
"He is next to impossible to reach outside of class and does not offer office hours. There is no homework besides studying for weekly tests, and he does not accommodate you at all for missing a class. He does not give out any material outside of class so if you missed something he said or missed a paper handed out then too bad.",0
"Maojoudi is a really funny teacher, he has a sense of humor. His tests on the other hand, are SUPER EASY. His tests are basically the study guide so just review that, he also lets you have a cheat sheet. Homework and quizzes are a little heavy in this class. I depended on tutoring to help me pass this class. Basically a self teach class. GOOD LUCK.",1
don't take this class,0
"Great teacher and is very helpful.  Tests can be challenging, but if you want to learn the material he is the teacher to take.",1
"Great professor.  500/510 were great classes.  A lot of work is required, but it is not difficult.  I would definitely take classes with her again.",1
Worst prof. graduating...actually believes too many Finance degrees are awarded at SU.  Likes to fail half the class.,0
Once of my favorite professors of all time! Dudrick makes you want to show up to class because he's utterly adorable. Motivates you to read and learn the material. 4 papers (he's a fair grader) and a slightly harder final. I'd recommend him to anyone- truly a pleasure!!,1
"got a good grade, but bad teacher. kind of an air head. kinda nice. I worked pretty hard for my A, but you could prolly get a decent grade w/out much effort, but lectures can be annoying.",0
"WORST TEACHER I EVER HAD!! so much work! Every day you had to do 5 pages of textbook homework, we had bimonthly quizzes, a midterm and a final. MANDATORY NOT FOR EXTRA HELP, we had hebrew table in which u had to go once a month for ur grade!! she graded ur participation on how much english/hebrew u spoke that day and she doesnt round up ur grades.",0
If your don't show your work exactly like he likes he will not give you any credit. Do not ask questions in class unless you like getting belittled in front of the class. It was a struggle for everyone in my class throughout the course and the only reason most people passed is because he curved the course at the end.,0
"A bit boring at times, but overall he's a fine teacher. He cares about what he's teaching which shows, but the class itself is not for everyone.",1
Amazing prof...funny...not a textbook teacher! Real world stuff--you have to study your notes to get a good grade(ps.I dont know who that other person was rating--totally NOT TRUE),1
"Very helpful...tells you exactly what will be on exams by giving homework assignments. You don't turn them in, but it's whats on the exam. Made a B, and I'm horrible in math!!",1
Awesome prof!,1
"This class is very time consuming. You must pay attention and come to class. If not you will fall behind and fail. He tries to make it clear and simple. He is very laid back. But if you email him, he only answers back half the time. Decent but yet stressful class.",1
"Avoid this teacher at all costs! Major language barrier,unorganized and sucks as a teacher. If he doesn't understand your question, he completely ignores you.",0
"Knows her stuff as far as English goes, but makes a few too many assumptions about other things. If you have a passion for the intricacies of English, more power to you, but not everyone feels this way and often times this class that you'll fail for a couple absences is a waste of time that could be spent on the unclear papers she has you write.",0
"Right now she is it for A&P lectures so you have no choice. Her teaching style is very hard to follow, doesn't make it easier to understand.  Her testquizes are hard.  Feel like she is trying to trick you. If you have to take her use other supplementary material to help you pass this class. You will have to spend ALOT of time studying.",0
Mrs. Ala is amazing and very very nice she has her accent but is understandable. Easy class... Shes funny... I didn't use my text book at all  she sends you notes to black board and she goes based on that and also for the tests. ,1
I took this class during Winter session. This class is split into a discussion and lecture during the same class period. You discuss the readings that were assigned and she gives a lecture on topics similar to the topics read. Very informative and an easy A if you take good notes. All the exams are based on lecture and the book is extra knowledge.,1
"Probably one of the worst profs i've ever had! Doesn't not stick to the textbook she assigned, the class was a complete waste of my time. Takes for ever to mark assignments, and has obscure exam questions. To top it all off, she chews gum and says um throughout the whole lecture...classy! One might question how the H she got a tenure position!?",0
"I literally slept through his class. He joked about people sleeping and actually said ""this class must be great because you come in, sleep, leave and get an A""...exactly what I did.",1
"She's a tough grader, beware of the 2 papers. The lectures are useless - short youtube videos that don't teach you anything at all. Class is useless, break out rooms for group activities to answer 1 question then debrief that 1 question for the rest of class time. Attendance is for marks. Get ready to read the entire textbook and teach yourself!",0
"8 absences, get dropped. Weekly written homework. Advise to switch if possible.",0
"Mrs. Bolt was not very helpful at all. I had her online class and there were problems with Myitlab. You can never get help from them or Mrs. Bolt. She says to Email her if you had a problem but she replies back with a attitude and tries to brush you off. I went on campus to get her help, I saw her helping someone else, you can tell she was annoyed",0
"She is a great professor who brings real life stories in to her lecture and actually keep you interested. however, you shouldn't take clinical ethics with her; there is a lot of work involved and the level of difficulty is high. If you don't have several free hours per week to dedicate to this class i recommend taking it with another professor.",1
****er droped me from his class becasue he had a retarted senior who needed it,0
"I loved epidemiology and have decided to go to get my PhD in this field. No textbook exams--awesome! But, you will read and write a lot, a good thing because he grades grammar. This means you will be a better writer at the end. Ah, I was so hoping to take his section of MBioS494 in spring, but he won't be teaching. Sad. He's super as a professor.",1
"If you are an english ed major, this class will definitely benefit towards building your own ""teaching philosophy."" There is a fine line on teaching someone how to teach, and this class really puts you in the teacher's shoes.",1
absolutely ridiculous grader.  he teaches ANTHROPOLOGY yet tries to grade everything else.. unfairly.,0
He has an interesting character. Very friendly but double faced. Likes nice chicks too and his face gets brighter when nice girl is in the class. He has a 10 point question aka chopping machine where he violates your grades. He doesn't have idea or computer skills. Not able to communicate on D2L and has an arrogant- smart attitude. Do not take him,0
"She was an okay professor, but was really hard to talk to. Every message was a fight and I never felt I said the right things. Glad it is over for me",0
long and boring course,0
"I love Ms. Magallon! She is an excellent teacher and a great person. I did not think her essays were difficult at all, but others may disagree. Receiving feedback from her will help raise your essay grades, so get as much as possible! She is willing to help to her students to make sure they pass.",1
Dr. Liszka is really talented as a lecturer and I enjoyed all of her lectures. U need to take serious notes and she gives some serious exams but I found when I studied I did well and when I didn't study it hurt.,1
"Professor literally lost one of my quizzes and gave me a zero, when I never missed one class and took the quiz. Incredibly disrespectful to students. She tells us to ask her questions and email her then she does not respond to emails. Would never recommend this professor. Many people dropped the course halfway through the semester due to her.",0
"Best Professor! You have to work for your grade but the professor makes it worth. Not an easy A, but very enjoyable.",1
Insanely good. Never thought math could be taught so well.,1
By farrrr my favorite Professor at FAU. She is extremely sweet and caring for her students. She actually checks and answers her canvas messages hella quick too . Attendance is not mandatory but for all three classes I've taken she gives extra credit quizzes that basically are the questions on the exam so if you want the best chance at an A show up!,1
"Gentil, beaucoup d'expérience mais passe trop de temps a nous compter des histoires. Apres ca il défile la matière en 10 minutes et tu dois lire le manuel pour comprendre. si tu fais les exercices tu devrais bien réussir l'exam. Qqun qui a deja fait de la compta ne devrait pas avoir trop de difficulté. Il refuse de repondre aux ques. pr la simul.",0
"I had a lot of trouble in this class. Her assignments made no sense an I often found myself stressing over due dates because she was so unclear about assignments. I love science, but this teacher has made me resent teaching the subject. I dread going to this professors class because she never gives us any breaks and we often have to stay late.",0
"Newhouse really cares about people's opinions. He will listen to you and appreciate everyone's perspective. Even if your class has nothing to do with indigenous people, get ready to learn about indigenous people. Its intertwined in everything he does. Sometimes his expectations are not 100% clear on assignments. His discussions in class are great.",1
"Loses temper easily. Even if you have an excused absence, he will get annoyed and will not let you make up work. My friend told him weeks prior that she had a surgery and he said that was too early to tell THEN later told her if she doesn't take it on the day she was planning on leaving that she will get a letter grade off. Nice guy, rude prof.",0
Don't take her... she is horrible!!!,0
"Took this course online, I think it might have been easier to take in class. Decent marker, but is not really clear on expectations. Assigns 3, 8-paged papers, doesn't care what the content is only penalizes you if its not 8 pages. This course makes you think outside the box, prepare for many personal discussions with the rest of your classmates.",0
"Professor Johansen is a very intelligent,capable,knowlegeable in the subject in which she instructs, learned a lot about myself and about the mental health profession, she is very encouraging about students continuing their education, absolutely loved her class, you have to do the work, nothing comes easy but she is helpful",1
Super funny; one of the few professors who can actually teach; is more than willing to go over stuff the students don't know,1
"Absent and worthless if you have an issue. I had an issue with getting locked out of a test using the lockdown software she required and she refused to do anything about it, making passing very difficult for me. So lazy that she didnt even bother to post announcements weekly either. Do not recommend her.",0
"This is one of those professors that says there's a ""method to their madness"" because they know they're too disorganized to teach properly",0
LA is amazing. She is a giant source of knowledge about anything touching criminology. She has so much experience and she's great at explaining. The tests are fair and easy enough if you do your readings and attend class. Textbook is mandatory but also very enjoyable in general. Would take her again without hesitation. I love her.,1
He was horrible the book would say one thing out in way left field... then in lecture would be something well right field... and the tests... yeah who they hell knows where that came from... never having him as a teacher again,0
"The content she teaches is interesting, but she has ideas about intersectionality and all the problems with that way of thinking (if you know what I mean). Go into her class with skepticism and do not allow yourself to be swayed. People are individuals, not their cultural identity. Just because she is a professor doesn't mean she absolute.",0
very picky,0
"I only had him for a 1-credit pass/fail class, and passed.  By the skin of my teeth.  The class was far more difficult than its credit weight and pass/fail status would imply; it was about abstract concepts in discrete math, and he knew his stuff, but was not very good at communicating it.",0
Tough grader and does not return emails in a timely manner. Would not take again. Nor would I recommend this proffessor. ,0
"His lectures don't line up with anything that will be turned in for a grade. He does do lectures based on the upcoming lab assignment, but that's just him reading the posted document(s) to the class. He posts most material online and usually will just read off of those during lecture. It's an intro course but background knowledge is required.",0
"I don't know if it was because we had to be online, but there was always tons of confusion in this class. He would easily get angry if we didn't know something, even if it was our first day looking at it. He would randomly start ranting about things that weren't related. He didn't show up for class upwards of 5 times with no warning too.",0
Honestly this class was literally the most demanding class out there so if you have anything to do outside of class dont take this guy. His exams were too long didnt give curves more than 80% of the class dropped. I failed this class took another professor and made an A. He just makes this class confusing af take another prof and let google guide u,0
"I took Political social thought with Prof G. Be ready to read and analyze things like The Federalist papers, which is very boring. Also make sure to understand the concepts talked about, his exams are questions asking about these concepts and usually require about a page for each question. Overall good prof. He is also very kind on the eyes",1
"Even though he bashes lecture heavy classes his classes are lecture heavy. The lectures were really boring and no one ever really talked in class because Professor Dotts appears very judgemental of viewpoints outside his own. Class is graded on a few things, but they were easy. If looking for an easy, boring A then take this class.",0
"For someone who hates public speaking, Mrs. Jackson makes this class bearable. Her personality and class structure made the class fun. Grades you on your own personal improvements from each speech. Follow her rubric for each speech and keep up with your quizzes and the A is yours. If you need to take public speaking take it with Mrs. Jackson.",1
His instructions are confusing.,0
"She is a dismal teacher- a combination of incompetence and apathy.  Never returned emails, changed requirements constantly with no warning, let the class know the criteria for grading projects AFTER submission.  I could go on and on.  BTW, she doesn't know her subject - I finally quit trying to dialogue as she just spouted her opinion as fact.",0
"Extremely boring class and the way he lectures makes it even more boring, the guy can never stay on topic and talks about research half of the time. Tests were ridiculous cuz theyre on stuff he says and very boring to listen to. Im changing my major. they need a guy who can stay on topic and make the class more bareable. Did i mention its boring?",0
"Professor Carson was one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He was so caring and helpful. Rather than going straight into talking about school, he made sure to take time to check on each student and even remembered things they told him from days before. He is so kind! Very easy grader but also a great teacher. Looked forward to this class.",1
Amazing teacher. Make sure you go to class or you will fail. She will definitely bring the actor out of you. Will defintely help you cope with stage fright. Very easy DEC class for D. MUST TAKE!!!,1
"She is a nice person,but is not recommended. She had you answer a question out of your GuidedNotebook everyday.So you had to be there to get the points,put tons of HW online. i slept through  the class nearly every day and would have skipped if i could have and still got like a 99% in there.The test are easy did not study for 1 and aced em all!!!!!",0
"RICHARD <33 made me love earthquakes so much, such a good prof, take him please!!",1
"I took Scott for Calculus III during Spring 2018, and he was great. I felt like the tests accurately covered the material that was covered in class, and they were fair. He did curve one midterm, which the curve was very fair. He was always helpful and was good at explaining the material when you needed extra help. Overall, a very good choice!",1
"Experimental is a hard class as is. Dr. McLaughlin does a great job at teaching it. I am doing fairly well, but it is a lot of work. Assignments are do-able it is the quizzes that are hard for me. If you can take this class I would highly recommend McLaughlin. Cares about his students",1
"He REALLY likes to ramble about lots of topics that have nothing to do with music. It was a lot of ""talking at you"". I was annoyed and didn't feel prepared for quizzes. I passed them because he posts the actual quiz on D2L for you to study from but really you can just memorize the answers. Hes real political and a ""attack/blame the government"" guy.",0
"I loved this class. Liz was a great instructor and as long as you read and ask questions you'll be fine. With papers, the key is having the right GSI or you end up with a problem. Liz has rubric that explains paper expectations and my GSI definitely adhered to it. Be prepared to read ALOT -most of the readings were really good but a few were dense",1
"Get ready to write down lots and lots and lots of lecture notes, he doesn't make them available online, honestly never seen a teacher do this before, and then he tells us if you don't study the lecture notes you're not gonna pass, also made us buy the book for $80 in the beginning of the year, never used it once",0
I'm not a science person. Anthropology was the toughest class for me. Her online class is set up so you have spend a substantial amount of time reading her notes online as well as reading the textbooks. ,1
Very good teacher with a clear method. He makes you participate and his classes are light.,1
"Dr Hart was the worst teacher I had in first year. Lectures are useless and very unorganized. She touches on topics briefly and expects you to know the rest from the text. Her exams are confusing and taken fully from the text book. The only redeeming quality is her enthusiasm. There are great BIO profs at UBC, so avoid Miranda. Your GPA will drop.",0
"This is a HORRIBLE professor! Her tests are way too hard for a principles class, she doesn't allow a formula sheet, will not help you if you go to her office for help. The first test most people scored in the 60's and lower. She completely refuses extra credit or curving grades. This is the second time Ive taken this class...and there will be a 3rd",0
If you are not living at home with access to recyclable products this class could become slightly pricey even with trips to the dollar store. If you come to class & work on your projects she will grade you easier. Listen to her tips she will like your project more and she is very nice and makes the class interesting. 1 paper & 1 vocab  quiz,1
"Epley's class is super annoying.  She's nice, although she is borderline insane. Going to class is generally pointless, but it is mandatory for credit. You get points for participation, so throw in some comments to humor her. Her essay topics are incredibly stupid, and the length requirement is entirely too long.  Easy A, I could deal w her again.",0
Worst professor at Uconn. I am regularly an A and high B student but she gave an absurd amount of papers to write and even as a good writer I struggled to get good grades. She acts as though this is the only class on your schedule. Emailing her complaints about the situation and she doesnt care. You have to agree to her beliefs & opinions to pass.,0
One of the worst classes and professors on campus. His teaching is absolutely pathetic. I recommend noone to take him as a professor.,0
She tries to be caring and upfront but her teaching style is not the best. I've learned more from google and youtube videos than from her own lecture videos/discussions. She may make students feel as if they are not trying hard enough even when they may be putting all their time and effort into her class. Quizzes/exams for lab are never returned.,0
"Professor Bonner is very clear about what is expected of you for the class work and attendance wise, he gives quizzes (which he calls opportunities) every week or so with no more than 2 or 3 questions regarding the chapters recently covered in lecture, which are very useful in reviewing for the exams. The lectures are always useful and not boring.",1

"La Profesora Fletcher, I can't say enough nice things about her. She has a great sense of humor and is an extremely talented teacher. She is also very helpful and cares a lot about her students. Spanish is easier for some and harder for others, but if you do your HW you will earn an A. Take her class!!",1
"never on time, frequently misses classes, not helpful, very angry person, at times she is irrational",0
I really do not like the way that Mr. Dasgupta teaches. You really have to teach yourself everything to get an A in this class.,1
"Started to realize towards the end of the semester that her explanations for otherwise simple concepts were quite convoluted and confusing. Chem 206 also has one of the most tedious components ever devised for a course. Final exam did not reflect posted past finals, very unfair. Overall: brilliant prof who means well, but a frustrating class.",0
Dr Kelley was a great instructor. She provides rubrics for assignments and gives great feedback. This was an honors class and we had 10 annotations to do which were kind of hard. Shes very responsive to emails and gives extra credit. She provides all of the notes needed on class instead of a textbook which is great!,1
"He doesn't explain what to do for projects clearly so you might miss up on some. He doesn't stick with the syllabus. The experience was weird to me, I ended up passing with a C.",1
"He is unorganized ppl, you should review all the slides and quizzes, midterms. No textbook need, he is willing to help you. Some question you may nit know until midterms ....",1
"Zarb is a friendly guy, but I don't care for how he'll spend the whole hour going over our homework.  Makes the hour go by very slowly.",1
"She's incredibly anal about grammar when grading your papers. None of my french teachers have been this picky and petty about sentence structure, yet she's an art prof. She cares more about how a paper is written rather than the content. I recommend submitting your papers in English for this class if your French isn't 100% perfect.",0
"I think Dr. J is a very nice person generally, but in terms of her as a professor? I really struggled with her. She practically demanded that we prioritize her class over others, even going as far as to say her class is the most important class we are taking at the moment. She gives an ungodly amount of homework, most of which serves no purpose.",1
"She's super sweet , class is super easy . I really loved the books we read and I don't even read ,",1
"Very respectful, inspirational, gives helpful feedbacks and very thorough. Tabea is not generous with grades. She is very passionate about her students leadership growth, how they impact their communities and the world at large. Tebea is awesome!",1
"I don't recommend this teacher, she seems to treat students like if its high school, for a college course students need to think critically in order to make assignments, but she uses high school techniques such as memorizing things for the exams which is pretty high school, my advise: avoid this teacher too much homework and no points for it.",0
A psychologist who'd rather be a biologist.,0
"Avoid her!!! She changed her style on every course she taught now!(After 2012 summer term)!!It was so hard for quizzes, and paper!! She marked so hard. Although she is a nice prof.Not recommend her at all!!",0
"He only provides instructions - step 1, 2 , and 3, but not walking you through the example which make it harder for students to understand the concept.  The test have only 20 questiuons, and each one is 5%. AND He does not curve!",1
I took him fall 09 and it was a great course. The readings were definitely interesting and he brought his passion and history to class. He's quite funny if you're smart enough to comprehend his jokes and his gotten a lot stricter than I expected but still a great course with him.,1
"Avoid this prof at ALL costs. I'm in my fourth year and this was one of my toughest classes, it was supposed to be an elective. Lectures took me 4 hours to get through, no midterm review, tons of textbook material, HARD and time-constraining tests, and extremely hard marker on essays. She was also short with me when I emailed her a question. AVOID!",0
"Dr. Teekell is amazing!! Hands down the best professor I've had at CNU.  She really cares about her students, and although the workload is a bit overwhelming, it really pays off and you can see the results.  I definitely saw an improvement in my work from the beginning of class to the end.",1
Went over everything in class. Had many homework assignments and each were 5 problems. Gave study guides.,1
he's sooooo mean,0
"Amazing teacher! I took her Bio class many years ago and to this day still remember material she taught. Really likes to see her students succeed. If you do your part and study and turn in assignments, easy A! Highly recommend!",1
Was the worst teacher I have ever had :( Was defensive when you asked for help... received no help! Had to get a tutor to pass the class.,0
"Super nice guy who genuinely wants to teach students about software and information students. Teaching isn't his only job, so my only complaint is that he may seem a little scattered when it comes to an organized schedule and syllabus. Regardless, he is very forgiving when you ask for help and very lenient on grading. Would take again.",1
"She is hands down my favorite teacher. She genuinely cares about her students, and constantly accepts feedback. I have learned and grown so much this semester with her. Absolutely the best! I will miss her next semester.",1
"This isn't an easy class, but he is definitely walks you through everything step-by-step. He listens to your feedback, and may adjust the class based on the needs of his students. Very approachable and kind when leaving comments. Prompt in grading. Great semester, great professor!",1
"I came into this class thinking it would be impossible,  but it was extremely doable and easy. Professor Dodson is an extremely nice woman. She isn't very good about emailing back, but that's the only downfall. Homework can be somewhat hard and participation in the weekly discussion boards is crucial. Otherwise, super easy class.",1
"I would like to see this professor care more about teaching the students about the material rather then grade acomputer generated test. Seems he doesn't want students to be lazy with his course, but yet his leading example is just that, unless you ask for help you will fail, unless you know the material at his level the tests are impossible to pass",0
"As a freshman, I had to take Sociology from Mr. Darman and it was a pretty terrible experience. The class could not be more dead. This guy is the biggest liberal I've ever seen that loves to make up stories that interest almost nobody and talk about his personal life for 2 hours straight. The only learning comes from the text book. Terrible grader.",0
"This guy goes out of his way to be helpful, clear, and concise. This is the best instructor I've had since going back to school. I have tremendous respect for him.",1
No Comments,1
"WORST CLASS EVER TAKEN! This teacher gives NO feedback and does NOT respond to emails; he says to allow up to 5 DAYS to respond to an email?! He should not be allowed to get away with that for an online class. Very hard to communicate with. His assignments are confusing and not clear. I would never take him again, waste of money and time.",0
"She's definitely not helpful. She reads off the powerpoint slides when she teaches. However, her tests are fairly easy because she gives you the study guide which is the only thing you need to study for. Everything on the study guide is on the test. Don't take her if you're accounting major. But if you're not, take her because it's an easy A.",1
You will lose your mind if you know zip about computing science or programming and attend his lectures. Prepare to study a lot outside of class to understand the material.,0
One of the most intelligent professors I have ever met. Slides have clear logic for students to follow. Definitely should take it if you wanna gain some real perspective in bio.,1
Professor Meehan's class is pretty boring but the material you get from the class is more than what she provides on the outlines.  Her tests are straight forward but only study what she talked about in class.  Wouldn't even recommend getting the textbook because she narrows down what you need to know.,0
Amazing professor and he has a lot of experience in the criminal justice system. He is willing to work with you and is a very fair professor. Definitely recommend!,1
"Some teachers lose enthusiasm teaching the same subject year over year; even though he's relatively new, I have confidence that will never be Noel. He is one of the most passionate people I've ever met, and a truly gifted educator. You may struggle if writing intimidates you, but listen to his feedback and do the work. You'l be glad you did.",1
Super nice guy. Enjoyed his class. Do the work and participate and you'll have no problems.,1
"Best math teacher ive ever had.  I am terrible at math, dont understand it aT ALLL!! boyer is great.  He doesnt rush through the material, he spends a whole class or two on just one concept, which really helps.  he teaches well and is easy to understand.  I highly recommend this class to ANYONEE!!! takee it!",1
The worst professor I have ever had. She does nothing but read word for word off a PowerPoint than grades your papers on layout not content. I haven't learned anything from her other than they let anyone teach.,0
"The class was fun. Prof. Goldner a bit of an awkward lecturer, but he clearly knows his stuff. He assigned 4 (pretty interesting) books to read, and you need to write a short essay for each of them, but he drops the lowest grade and grades pretty nicely, so you can get away with skipping one if need be. Tests are mostly multiple choice. Easy A.",1
"I did not like this course. At all. Everything was very complex, and no matter how many times I considered her critique my work was not adequate enough. It was incredibly frustrating and her comments about your work were vague. I do not like her teaching style and I do not recommend her to anyone, psychology major or not. ",1
She is nice and funny but doesnt email back if you email her.  sent multiple emails and still waiting to recieve a response....,0
"in office hours he refused to tell me which multiple choice questions I got wrong (after the exam): how is someone supposed to proactively improve their stratgies and weak areas, if they are not told which questions are wrong. What is the ppoint of picking up an exam that has no marks except for a total on the top. He doesnt even post an answer key",0
Most awful degrading teacher. Fails students at all opportunities. extremely unclear grading criteria. often does not show up to her own lectures. picks on students for incorrect answers. if you don't participate in class discussions she will call you out on it. clicks her teeth constantly.,0
"its her first time teaching, she's very caring, and if you need help she'll do her best.  MC tests ARE evil, its true.  but she is taking class input and wants to make the class better!",1
She makes things unnecessarily complicated. Be prepare for more peer discussion and online resources to understand what's going on.,0
The best professor I've had at UM so far. Classes are interesting and fun. He has a very witty personality and really cares about his students & their success in the class. Grade is based off 6 2-page papers. Attendance in class is extremely important as he covers a lot of what you will need to write the papers. 10/10 would recommend for any class.,1
"If possible, do not take his class. He rarely answers emails or messages and doesn't interact with students at all. His rubric is unclear with 'dramatically exceeding expectations' required to get an A. I understand it's college and it isn't meant to be easy, but this guy is horrible. A month in and he hasn't taught anything himself.",0
I took Professor Errico for Accounting during Summer A and I regret my decision. There are MULTIPLE times that Professor Errico did not have a clue how to do the problems and students had to correct her. I recommend going to her youtube channel BEFORE choosing her class to see if you can handle taking her class. Maybe this was just a bad semester?,0
Excellent teacher! She has a focus in education and really understands how to teach. She offers lots of extra credit and is helpful. She will only lecture for 20 or so minutes and makes sure you understand the material. I think she could teach any subject well. Wish there were more professors like her!,1
"Decent professor. explains things well and easy to talk to. wants you to succeed, you just have to put in the work and go to office hours. His lectures aren't the most interesting and he speaks in a monotone, but if you pay attention and engage you'll be good.",1
Tancredi is a great guy. He clearly knows his stuff very well and clearly loves sharing it with others. He is crystal clear on everything and isn't hard so long as you pay attention. He is easy to talk to and approach and will help you out with anything if you need it. Also an amazing musician. One of my favorite professors.,1
"By far the worst teacher I've ever had. She thinks she's a good teacher... but she's not. She begins every class by telling us we suck and that its our fault for not understanding the material. From a student that has attended every class, I can say shes terrible. Lot's of work, never a break. Maybe if this is your only class you can succeed.",0
"Dr. Cutler means well, but if you get offended easily then beware. She is the type of professor where if you're good in her class, she'll be very nice to you and you'll have no issues. If you aren't so good in your class, she's really rude to you and makes you feel like you're the worst person in the world.",1
She is one of the worst teachers i've ever had in my life. She doesn't know what the hell she is talking about half of the time and repeats herself constantly. Very disorganized and you never get out early!!! She always talks about her family and when she lived in spain. Don't take her class she is HORRIBLE!!!!!,0
"Completely uninspiring and reads pre-prepared notes when lecturing, the lecture lasts about 30-40 minutes. The exams are extensive so just writing down notes will not be enough to prepare you for the exams. The lab consists of her telling you the page in the lab manual and you figuring it out from there.",0
Take this class.,1
Learn the programs bert,0
"She has odd rules, like you can't ask questions after class about the lecture, instead come in for office hours. Her voice always sounded condescending to me, like she was teaching elementary school instead of college. At the same time, her explanations are partially mumbled and said as if she assumes we already learned the material. Would avoid.",0
"Took ACC 3154. Doesn't use the textbook a whole lot but when he does, it's always really helpful. Fantastic prof. Would definitely take a class with him again!",1
Very generous professor to take for first aid. Lectures are amazing and straight to the point. Exams are based on lectures and CPR certification is fun. Mr. Bonilla is a great teacher and i would recommend this class.,1
There is entirely too much work. I worked more in this class than any other. The material is fairly easy. Lectures teach you nothing. You learn everything from the homework. Probably 5-6 hours a week.,0
"not response to student's work, can't hear his talking. always lost student's paper.",0
"Dr. Lewis is a great guy. He really knows his stuff...he is very helpful, and his class is enjoyable. I would definately recommend him to anyone taking CS.",1
"If you don't go to class you will not pass the tests. Lectures and content is easy, it's just the listening part on tests that is what kills you. Very clear about expectations from the start, nice guy but comes off as kinda arrogant. Hard class to have as an 8am. Bring coffee or find a different time.",0
"Be prepared to study 20+ hours a week for a C. She is a passionate teacher, but VERY nitpicky I spent more time reading her rules and grading criteria than the book. Tests are insanely difficult, and class is regimented. Shes all about application of material which is great if you're going into healthcare. If you just need the grade go with Bassett",0
"He is an amazing teacher, very nice, cares about his student and he make sure you understand what he's talking about. grades fairly, he like class discussion. sometimes the class gets boring but it worth it, but EASY CLASS.",1
A very considerate teacher who cares about the expansion of national education. A wonderful teacher!,1
"The class can be easy if you are interested and actually want to learn about severe weather, but I just took it for an easy ace class and it was actually difficult. She uses tophat for everything, her lectures are boring and you don't really use the book (unless you do the assigned reading. I just dont take it.",0
bad,0
"For both Macro and Micro, this class is fairly simple to succeed in. Mr. Daigle does lecture a fair amount, but if you attend class and take notes on the facts he provides you will be successful. This class requires you study your notes and text but if you are willing to put in the work then you will succeed and learn in this class",1
He is hands down the best teacher I had at Pace so far. He is extremely passionate about the subject and its contagious. If you are having trouble with something he is the type of teacher that will go to all ends to make sure you understand. There's a lot of work but he gives you till the end to make up  any missing work up. TAKE HIM!!,1
"I took him fall 2019 and he was an absolute nightmare. I tried reaching myself from the book like i did with him for orgo 1 but couldnt. Not clear test grading it has nothing to do with lectures/hw, basically you are never prepared. I retook it again this semester with Dr. Proulx and got an A+ if that says anything about him vs a good prof.",0
"Attendance is vital to passing the class. The hardest class I have taken so far. Lots of homework, but it balances out your grade because the tests are brutal. Shes a good teacher, but talks very fast and once you fall behind its hard to catch back up. Its a lot of self-teaching as well. Be prepared for any question she asks, theres a lot.",1
"Best lecturer I've seen at U of T; he's clear, funny, and makes Shakespeare interesting. However, he was very quick to anger (don't talktextbrowse the Webfall asleep)--HE WILL CALL YOU OUT. I found his marking tough and his expectations unclear. Extremely arrogant and self-centred.  He expects you to read 14 plays: 4 in 1st term, 10 in 2nd term.",0
No Comments,1
Discussions in this class were actually fun.,1
"Online Class While I've had harder classes, I've never had a more useless teacher. He does nothing to contribute to the class and gives zero feedback on the assignments. If you state your opinion in the discussion board, you get an F for that week. If you feel like self teaching, go for it. Otherwise avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
Fantastic teacher. He really knows his material and is open to discussions after class. His quizes can be quite difficult and alot of reading is to be expected in this class. He lets you use the book and internet for the quizes though. By far my favorite professor thus far.I would certainly recommend his class if political theory is your thing.,1
"Eric was not a great teacher. Half of the time he had to stop and redo his examples because he didn't even know what was going on, he would even often ask us if we knew what we did wrong. Assigns lots of homework and the tests often consist of the more difficult problems with lots of steps.",0
No Comments,0
Amazing!! Very helpful and informative. She cared if we passed her class and took the time to help each of us on a individual level if we requested it. I went to her office on a few occasions and she was more than willing to answer any questions I had for her!! Ask her about the ?tree pose? She will crack up laughing!!!,1
"There is a lot of talking involved.  Her teaching was different.  If you like to talk I suggest you take this class.  A lot of discussion and talking.  Two essays and a presentation plus a easy final.  Overall, class was okay.",1
"Avoid Mook at all cost. Where the other professors/sections curve, Mook did not. Also his class is significantly harder than the other professors to(We learn more material than them). And his lecturing style is atrocious. All he does is make terrible jokes and does no example problems. Final was insanely hard(worth 40% to). HW at timesis impossible",0
"Pretty good teacher.  He always eats a donut every hour on the hour, which I always thought was kind of peculiar.  Then again, I once ate my own **** to win a $3 bet, so who am I to judge.",1
"Sweetest prof out there! He makes stats really accessible to students who have no math/stats background and always provides example questions and past quizzes/exams so you know what to expect when you're tested. He's ALWAYS available for questions, and even had office hours on weekends because he genuinely wants his students to succeed.",1
"Ted Phelps is a wonderful teacher. I took him for Art Appreciation Fall 2016. I never opened my book. If you take notes on what he says you will do just fine. After a section of power points you will test on them, which is about 20 questions. Super easy if you are there to hear his lectures. Professor Phelps is also a nice and funny guy.",1
I do not know how old she is but she is HOOOT,1
Great class!  He was a great professor.  Make sure to do the reading!,1
"This professor is very helpful. If you have any problems, email her and she will get back with you very quickly. She is very understanding and is really on top of her work. She does have an accent, but she is easily understood. Stay on top of your work , and you will do fine. Wish I would've got an A, but oh well.",1
"Stay away, teacher is very tough! expects too much!",0
"I really enjoyed Professor Allen's class. He engaged students to participate and had a funny sarcastic personality. He assigned 5 books, but you can get away with not reading them. Instead of quizzes, you're assigned two weekly blogs and 3 wikis over the course of the semester so its easy to pass.",1
"It's all been said already. He is very knowledgible, but doesn't know how to teach it to students.",0
"Menasco is an awesome professor. He does interesting work with very visual forms of math. He's super chill, but is good at knowing if you don't know what is going on.",1
"off topic. He will play 7 videos a class and none of them will be relevant to the course material. this class has so many assignments where you will be left thinking ""when did I learn this"" and it's probably because you never did. most disorganized course I've been in.",0
"You leave class everyday confused and learn absolutely nothing. You're expected to know what he left off after class. Relies HEAVILY on MyMathLab Homework assingments, which only boosts up your grade by one point. (Don't miss a day on them, it will drop your grade badly!!) Try not to fail any of the four tests, will bomb your grade.",0
He's I really good professor and explains the concepts well. He won't move along until everyone understands the concepts. I would definitely take a course with him again.,1
"If calc is the highest math youre required to take, he makes it easy by replicating the practice tests. And if math is your focus, he creates lesson plans that are logical and easy to study later if you miss the info in class.",1
one of the best Education professor . I take 2 EDU class and I would like it again.,1
"I would not recommend anyone take this class online with this instructor, unless you are already fluent in Spanish. Does not teach,& does not provide feedback at all to students. DO NOT let the words ""Beginning Spanish 2"" fool you, as it is anything but beginning. All instructions are typed in Spanish. I am dropping before it ruins my 4.0 GPA.",0
"Professor Stralka was recommended to me for 0910, as I really needed my hand held through math. Her teaching method was so helpful. She is really one of a kind! She was great at explaining everything step by step to the class and took the time to make sure we understood the material. Diane is a caring, smart, and silly. I'm so glad I took her!",1
"Easily one of the best math teachers in Spokane. There's a lot of homework depending on the class, but it's really simple and you will always pass if you put in the work. Math is my worst subject and he at the very least made it enjoyable to learn. You only need the book for the homework it entails because he's great at getting the message across. ",1
Professor Rosenberg takes long to get things graded and would not fix your grade when there is an error. He will also not care about your grades which is the most irritating part. You should consider yourself lucky if he responds to your email but his responses are useless just like he is. Overall an easy class but a crappy professor.,0
"In my opinion, Alana gave difficult tests. Other than that, the course was fairly easy as long as you went to class and took notes. Alana is really passionate about music, so it makes it easier to pay attention. She makes even the most boring topics sound ten times more interesting, and she really likes to demonstrate by singing in class.",1
"She also made me change my major! she's ridiculous. We spend the whole class talking about what we are going to be ""talking"" about but we never actually cover again. Tests are ridiculous. On her test i got a question wrong because she claimed an animal cell has a cell wall! completely has no control over english!",0
"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading. The study guide that is provided is no help. Whoever is a history major please avoid taking this class. This isnt high school where you can't use the bathroom either during lectures. NO",0
"Dude's a walking meme, love it.",1
I severely dislike this teacher for his lack of effort and bad attitude. Also doesn't respond to any emails even though I emailed him over and over,0
I cannot believe this teacher. She has the audacity to tell me that I cannot make up a test because I didn't have a doctor note for my scheduled C section surgery.I told her this in advance and I didn't get a message back until I delivered my child. She then said that she does not give make up under any circumstances. I feel attacked by this woman,0
Very confusing on what she wanted on papers and was not very helpful. The only positive thing was the work load itself was easy. But she was way to picky on grading.,0
"Ms lee is true professional she is amazing explain everything and you can understand very fast every problems, she goes through steps by steps also she is kind , I would like to take more classes for her",1
"One of the worst professors/teachers I've ever had. Sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Tough grader but also takes a long time to post grades so it's hard to know how well you're doing. Do not take her class unless you have to.",0
"Some days he is hands off and lets the student ""leaders"" lead the newspaper but other days (most days) we are mindless drones just making the stories and pages the way he tells us.  He makes you dumb down your writing then talks to you like your dumb.  I want to write for the NY Times, not the press telegram, thank you!  Made me hate journalism",0
"Long boring lectures with a somewhat uninterested prof. He told us he never actually wanted to teach. Easy online quizzes for grade boosters. Tests are somewhat hard, you must study, but not too difficult to get an A. He seems nice, just not for me.",1
"Ok look.I got like a 95% in this class. Tons of homework and quizzes that prepare you for the exams. You can always contact him to take a quiz that you missed within a week of the quiz. He doesn't post his lectures but his lectures are extremely relevant and useful every time! Don't miss class, you will regret it. Just go to class!!!",1
"If you can avoid taking her online course, then do so. She was one of the worst professors I've ever had. You have a self intro video at the beginning of the year and then an informative speech at the end & if you suck @ giving speeches your grade will suffer. The rest of your grade is easy because it's ""quizzes"" from the reading.",0
She's ok. I wish I didn't take this class.,0
I had Dr. Sam for lab and he is a decent teacher. He has a heavy accent and his lectures are boring but he he knows his stuff and lets you know what is important for the practical. If you study the textbook and the photos online attendance isn't really mandatory.,1
The professor is basically a live textbook (in a good way). If you don't like watching someone solve math problems though you can just read the textbook. Only part that really sucked was the TA. He's super harsh and mis-graded my homework several times.,1
"Really confusing, disorganized, no leniency, makes interesting subject matter boring and almost incomprehensible. Self study, show up, easy A.",0
"Catherine Elliott is an incredible teacher & person. She makes 112 so fun&entertaining; I always looked forward to it. She legitimately made my writing better & her expectations are reasonable (rare quality in teachers these days). As a grad student she understands where we are coming from. Low stress, she's super helpful, not to mention beautiful.",1
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken. He is a great guy, but the exams are borderline impossible no matter how much work you put into studying. The work he has us do and the exams are made so much harder than they have to be. This class is about to destroy my gpa because I didn't listen to the other reviews on here...",0
"Lab quizzes every week, have to know your stuff. Got to his office hours before quizzes also two lab reports, go to him for him to go over what he wants and go through your paper before its due. there are short presentations you do with your lab partner for extra credit",1
"Gets off topic too much, rarely discusses the book, no test review. Hard to pass when we do zero book discussion and watch videos. Cool person but not a quality teacher",0
"This class is a class that shouldn't be hard, but professor hill made it almost impossible. She was never willing to compromise or help you out if you were struggling in the class. Doesn't allow any extra credit and has no exceptions. Only way to get a good grade in this class is to study the book a ton and pay attention in lectures.",0
You dont learn anything about epidemiology and he makes you write 11 page papers weekly.,0
Spanish sucks and there is no reason to make us take high levels of foreign language. this prof made it bearable.,0
Just avoid him.  Take the other professors who understand students and how they learn.,0
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"Took Prof M for summer B. Syllabus was modified for the short time, exams every week with inclusive review. Labs are full points for participation.  Always responded to emails.  She is such a really NICE lady. So show up for labs study the review it's an easy A.",1
Dont take him !,0
"Terrible. Talked about her personal views only, lots of that planned parenthood stuff.",0
"I've taken Intro to Psych., Stress Management Psych., and now Abnormal Psych. with Professor Trombley. She is particular about what she expects from students but it's nothing unreasonable, you simply have to read instructions carefully. I love that she quizzes weekly because I am able to retain more info this way. Take her class, its great.",1
"Unorganized. Objectives a joke of a study guide. Prepare for 75pt exams that turn into 250 pts because she can. Writes her own exams and questions are tricky. She is nice to your face but u can tell she enjoys making everyone squirm. Read your book and answer questions in lecture, she will ask a lot of them and will grade you easier if you answer!",0
"Blanton is the harshest grader ever. Since he used to proof read for an insurance company for decades, he takes off point for any little thing on an essay or summary. For example, he takes off five points for leaving too much space between your name, the date and class subject on an essay. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER, BLANTON. STOP BEING SO RIDICULOUS!",0
Do NOT take this Professor!!! He is passionless and does NOT teach well. You will sit for literally 2 hours in a ZOOM class and listen to the MOST boring lectures... on top of that he does NOT follow logic and is a VERY tough grader... he approaches religious teaching in a bizarre scientific or philosophical way and not how it actually is...,0
"her organizational skills are terrible. She is quick to change the schedule whenever it suits her, without warning the class. The teacher even goes over lessons in class, which have nothing to do with the chapter we have read. She never responds to emails, and is quick to deduct points based off grammar. She's also Always late when grading homeowr.",0
This man is an amzing professor! He puches you to know the text and what you need to know to know the text. Take him if you get the chance.,1
Slow grader,0
"pleasant person, but bad teacher - i get that she wants to be the interactive type but she really, really just needs to get through the material and lecture sometimes. you can do the reading but you'll never know what you thought was wrong because she just doesn't cover all the material in a consistent manner if at all, then boom, it's on the test",0
Falk makes his class unnecessarily difficult. He gives homework on topics that haven't even been mentioned in class until after the homework is due and these topics are not in the textbook he recommended. He runs the class like a graduate class and will spend all your time on his class. He is very understanding about life circumstances though.,0
I love Dr. Grapenthin. She is such a sweetheart and will take the time to help you if you don't understand what is going on. Come to class and you will pass.,1
"Hands down one of the best Profs at CCNY. Her lectures are amazing and she really tried her best to make sure every student understood the material. Go to her office hours because it's really helpful. She gave amazing feedback on my essays, which further enabled me to do better on any other upcoming essay. I highly recommend you take her!",1
This class is interesting if you're an erudite because It's basically self-taught. Doesn't respond to emails or doesn't read them correctly. It's sad because it's a great topic but there was no passion for even showing people how awesome it is.,0
Ben is hilarious and the way his homework is set up online is super helpful. If you use the tools online and come to his lectures  this class is easliey passable.,1
"BUAD 205 is not a difficult class. Attendance is taken for a grade, so by just showing up everyday you can earn 100 points (600 total points in the course). Dr. Ranft is a friendly guy and does an excellent job guiding discussion. ",1
"I took Professor Thompson's summer course of Micro and it was easily the hardest class that I have ever taken. Does NOT give out extra credit, claimed that he did and at the end of course, never gave it out. Tests were timed 1 minute per question. Lectures were unrelated to the material. I was unemployed during Thompson's class and still got a B.",0
"I took elementary span 1 online w. her & it was tragic. Homework was due every week (over 70 assignments, not exaggerating) The class description said it was for people with little to no knowledge of Spanish (me) but the work was for Span 2 speakers. WHATEVER YOU DO STAY AWAY SHE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING AT ALL. I WISH THERE WERE MORE CHARACTERS ...",0
He was very clear. The testing was fair. This doc is sexy.,1
"He is a smart guy, but he basically just reads off all his slides and doesn't explain things clearly. He basically just talks about his own research and shows pictures of his microscope slides, without really explaining the important material. First two exams were not cumulative, and the final was partially cumulative.",1
"I liked Professor LaMothe as a person, but not really as a teacher. This was her first time teaching and I felt like the class was everywhere. She would lecture for two hours and 30 minutes straight and only leave like 20-30 minutes to do a group project that requires way more time than that. Also her TA grades papers and it's based on her opinion.",0
"Very smart man, definitely has considerable knowledge in terms of sound reinforcement. However, his tests are unnecessarily difficult  and most of the questions on the test don't pertain the textbook, lectures, or study guides he hands out. I would not recommenced taking this class if you have no experience working with sounds systems.",0
"Very smart man, but his teaching style wasn't for me. Very strict and assigns a lot of work. You can't miss more than 3 classes or you fail. He is very passionate about Spanish and will help you, but I did feel like he could be rude to some of the students in our class. I probably won't take him again if I can.",0
"She does know her stuff, but when it comes to grades she really needs to relax a little. I came to every class, turned everything in on time and recieved decent grades on everything, but in the end only got a C-. Total bummer and i've always been an A-B student. From the beginning of class she makes it clear that it wont b easy to pass her class.",1
Professor Miura is extremely vague when it comes to lectures. He only skims through basic information rather than developing detail for the material he is teaching. Be sure to do all the work possible outside of class because he will not be specific during class. This was a lab course and it wasn't as detailed as other courses Ive taken at Loyola.,0
"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",0
"Mrs. Elfring is a  great professor! She's very friendly, helpful, and cares about her students. All of her assignments are geared towards the 8-10 page research paper which made writing the paper a lot easier. I would take her again if i could! ",1
I had to choose 1 Star because 0 wasnt an option he is not clear at all and the professor has to many returning students and you would think the college would notice that. He stumbles himself on questions from the textbook and doesnt care if you fail the class or not.,0
"Least helpful professor i have ever had to deal with. Serious manner issues. Dont bother showing up 5 min late, he locks the door. Whole class is scared to ask/answer a question, because he will ridicule you if not up to his standards. Does not give fair warnings about tests, never reviews for tests.",0
"If you have no prior physics background, this class will be impossible. I consider myself to be pretty smart and I was lost from day 1. Doesn't teach just tells you to do the example problems on your own. The tests are easy to fail because the multiple choice are 5 pts each and he barely gives partial credit on the open ended. Very tough class. ",0
He is very lecture heavy and moves WAY too fast during his lectures. You're better off learning the material on your own because he explains stuff in the worst ways.,0
"A very bad instructor. Does not chemistry that well. His math level is a fourth grader. stay away, do not take his class.",0
"um ummmm ummm um um um.... this is all I would hear in lectures. He can sound intelligent but at the same time also sounds like he is just reading the pp. again he says um so much the class started to keep count, up into the 700s....",0
"You have to work for a good grade, lectures are important, he doesn't give out good grades, gives good examples, the book helped me a ton on the homework, TEST ARE HARD. I always feel awful after I take them but the grade turns out better then I think it's going too.",1
PLEASE TAKE THIS TEACHER FOR LECTURE!! Her review sheets are exactly like the actually test and lets you know what is exactly on the test. Straight forward & explains everything to simple terms.,1
"Extremely disorganized professor: lost 100 quizzes (grades never returned), never has enough handouts/quizzes to give students when he needs to, forgets his calculator or other things and makes us waste time. This professor seems completely clueless and it isn't fair to have such professors at University.",0
Drop and wait until he isn't teaching to take the course.,0
"He is way too into the subject which makes the class more difficult. He wants everyone to enjoy the class as much as he does, which is very difficult considering many people take this class as a pre-requisite as an easier math class. He does not use the book except for maybe one or two assignments. Tests are not like study guide. Would not recomm.",0
I did not enjoy taking her. She was confusing in her lectures and assigned way to much work. I never understood an assignment and always had to look up what she supposedly taught us. I do not recommend. ,0
"I was so impressed by the content and the lectures. Every day, I left with something to think about. Very challenging materials to process but worth every minute. You don't know what you don't know about the subject of human rights until you take this course.",1
"This is a course where you have to interact with the Professor often, it is difficult because the Proffesor can sometimes be very rude/condescending. I did get a good mark for the course, however I found the Proff's attitude extremely unnecessary. There was a lot of interesting material to learn, but I would not retake the course with her.",0
Very annoying. Gives zeros on papers for little things such as not having your date right. You can redo them but she takes forever to grade. Boring lectures and gets mad if you dont pay attention. Would not recommend,0
Hardest class ever. The tests and group work were almost impossible. The amount he had to curve this class was absolutely ridiculous. He curved some tests by 4 letter grades and curved the entire class by a letter grade and a half.,0
"All I have to say is good luck! This professor is a very tough grader and gives tons upon tons of homework. There were always various assignments due at one time, whether it be a lab, worksheets, or online homework. I took 20 units last semester and never had as much homework in all of my classes combined than I did for this single class.",0
"If there is any possible way to avoid his classes, DO SO!  He is a very smart man, but has absolutely 0 teaching ability.",0
The class seems easy at first but after taking the tests (online due to COVID). His class pretty hard. There basically no work except for 3 test and a simulation project which I didn't even get an email about when its due. Not the best experience sadly...,0
"We rarely had class due to his absences, which made it very hard to understand his unorganized lecture notes. Class was long and dragging, and don't expect to know what your grade is until after finals. He openly insults all questions, and never gets us feedback in a timely fashion. Avoid him at all costs.",0
professor is amazing and funny. online quickly quizzes based on the chapter questions are not hard you could look in the book and find the answer easily. made a friday 8am lecture not so boring failed the last test before the final and emailed me to retake the test online. the final was online for us so i was able to pass the class with an A,1
"Morano reminds me of Anne Lamott...extremely endearing and neurotic.  A great professor, and also a great person to be around.  She has great critiques on your writing.  Take her.",1
"Mr. Crittenden taught survey of math for the first time when the previous professor fell through. He seems like a genuinely caring man who wants his students to succeed. He writes everything out on the board, helps you if you need it, and lets you retake tests. His lectures can be a bit relaxing but you just need to bring some coffee to class!",1
She was very nice and gave extra credit. Grading was easy. She had 7 missed classes until take points off but if you have proper excuses would excuse. My favorite teacher I had by far!!! I heard all others lowkey sucked. So take her! I still talk to her,1
"Math is my weakest subject, but professor Crocoll was a great professor. It's exam heavy, doesn't require homework, though recommends it for the quizzes. 5 Exams (18-33 questions each,) 17 quizzes. + MAJOR extra credit for (persistent) math lab hours. Also drops lowest score for exams and two lowest scores for quizzes.",1
pretty hard. good luck! youll need some with this course,0
He is a nice guy but his class is difficult. You have quizzes from the book every week and he expects every student to participate in the discussion. You are graded for participation. Sometimes his grading was very hot and cold. He didn't ever have anything good to say about my discussion posts and left long messages as to what I didn't do right.,0
"(eye roll) this guy is the pits. I took accounting in high school, so I was able to teach  myself plus tutoring. There is no point in going to class, so I stopped going after a while and just did the online homework assignments every week. The tests are easy if you do and understand the homework. Teaches accounting through a terrible online book.",0
No Comments,1
"I could go on for pages about what an amazing professor Bill is; I just registered to take my 4th class with him! He lectures a lot, but his lectures are engaging and personal. He genuinely cares about each of his students and wants to see them succeed. Exams are lecture-based so attendance is important, but he is very understanding of circumstance",1
"Everything is pretty much automated.  Very little interaction with teacher, but she expects students in her online class to meet up with up to 6 other people to record essays.",0
"Professor Favara is hands down the best teacher I've had. You have to put in work but if you do all the assignments, read from the textbook, and watch the videos provided it will all make sense and you are guaranteed to get a good grade. She also holds office hours which helps tremendously. Use all the resources available. She is awesome!",1
"Mr. Miura is never available outside of class, I sent him several emails outside of class and only a few were responded to. He is a tough grader and you may get the answer right to his conceptual questions but if its not worded like how he wants you dont do well. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!",0
"This class was a struggle for me. Be prepared for a lot of homework (20 hours a week) and lot's of quizzes. Professor Flahaven knows a lot about what's she's talking about but it can be hard to get help or her to share her knowledge. While I think she is a good person, I would never want to take a class from her again.",0
Mr. Michael is extremely fun and caring. He works with you on any concerns you would have and offers good advice. The only downside is you have to be prepared to reschedule often and make sure you stay on track with your lessons.,1
"She is very politically biased; also made a lot of rude, sarcastic comments to me about my grades when handing back tests, in front of other students no less, without my having said a word to her. Very unprofessional and her tests have nothing to do with the reading or lecture, which is baffling.",0
"Very helpful, intelligent, well cultured from world travels and brings that to class to share. Daily online homework and critical of punctuation and spelling. It is a challenge which one can assume about learning a new language. She wrote the textbook for the class so curriculum is very well organized. Great Proffesor",1
"I genuinely felt sorry for him. Absolutely no one pays attention to him and he basically lectured to one person the entire semester. People sign attendance then leave. However he is soooooo sweet and so understanding. The tests are online with no lockdown browser. I would definitely suggest him, also suggest being nice to him.",1
"If you care about just passing this course, try to get a hold of old exams and keep re-doing them over and over again. If you actually want to learn the content, the lectures are very heavy and he moves very fast. So try to spend 1 hr everyday studying the lectures and understanding everything. The homework is very difficult, so most people cheat",0
"Beba is awesome :)  Sure, she talks about costumer design a lot - but she knows her stuff!  She has done a lot of interestesing things in her career which she shares.  More work in the 2nd half - be prepared to write and see plays!  A few minor reaction papers, too.  Overall enjoyable class!",1
"Drain is the best teacher I ever had. The other comments don't do justice. He explains everything in detail, and constantly helps when there is a need. This other person doesn't know what their talking about.",1
"Really disorganized, although he tries really hard.",0
"He is a really nice guy and always willing to help if one has any questions during office hours or in class. BUT he is a horrible professor by nature.Poor guy was just born that way, not his fault. He does set 250pt at C but given his super hard exams its hard to do",0
"The best professor at Valley College. Infact, she is the best teacher I ever had since grade school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Absolutely the worst professor I've had at Allegheny thus far. Shame on the U of Pitt for awarding him a PhD. The chemistry tutors understand organic better than he does. He is incapable of answering chemistry questions on the spot, lectures are a waste of time,  class material is not the same as test and he's an unfair grader. Don't waste your $",0
Mr. Tyson carries an extremely boring classroom. His prezies are not helpful at all. You need to be ready to put in effort outside of class by reading the textbook and interpreting it. Tests are tough and the questions are weirdly worded. Probably the hardest course I have taken at Missouri State.,0
"A bit disorganized, but tries her best. Very concerned with student progress and approachable.",1
"her class is ok, biggest peeve is her ridiculous assignments, like 14 pgers and 20 pgers single spaced.AND lots of reading. Otherwise though, she is a nice lady, although i've heard from other people she can be terribly sarcastic.",1
Course is very comprehensive but examples are clear and extremely helpful. Professor is very helpful and clarifies any questions.,1
"GREAT! She is really easy and flexible. She accepts late assignments. One research paper, one group presentation and response paper every week. Take her. I  would say it's an easy A.",1
"If you have any interest in studying Political Science, stay away from this professor as she does not teach it. Lois' teaching style is to espouse her own views and belittle yours. Grades are given willy-nilly with contradictory feedback which all but guarantee a stifled learning experience. Steer very clear of this one, fellow students.",0
I took this class online and it was a great experience. She was very easy to work with and made all of the expectations very clear. She was very good about responding to emails promptly and when Myaccounyinglab was down for maintenance she was very good about allowing us extra time for assignments and quizes,1
"Don't buy the text book. You will not use it. His grading is ridiculous. He was absurd with grading, he would do one on one sessions for your essays, make corrections, then mark you down on your final draft once completed. Even though he made those changes. Hes absolutely hysterical. Just make sure you're a unicorn in your writing to get just a C",0
"Rebecca is an INCREDIBLE teacher! Her class is awesome and it really opens your eyes to new perspectives! However, the only  negative thing I have to say about her class is that the textbook is so boring and a pain to read. Additionally, the quizzes are timed and online, and they are SUPER detail oriented - which is a pain.",1
Loved her. She is very kind.,1
"I really enjoyed this class! There is a lot of reading, but class discussions were really great. I did not participate much, but I wish I did more. I really recommend Stevens and this class!",1
Boring classes. Keeps you there the whole period. Uses textbook Heavily and constantly.,1
"Mr. G is honestly the best professor I've ever had. He teaches stuff that is valuable in real life, not just pointless labs. He responds to emails within 5 minutes, and is the most helpful human being in the world. I had him for Cell Bio lab and Genetics Lab and I wish he was my professor for every lab. He makes labs fun and useful.",1
"You ask a simple question in class, you get a long winded, confusing answer. The lectures were extremely disorganized, didn't even follow her own handouts. If you politely approach her with concerns or need for clarification, get ready for some passive aggression. 200+ pages read per class mainly not discussed, but they're definitely on the test.",0
"The best choice for EE205. He is excellent at explaining difficult subjects and concepts, his exams are very fair, straightforward, and similar to the review packet he gives out. He readily accommodates student's needs, and doesn't really give that much homework. He is also very available outside of class and happy to help and answer questions.",1
Class is boring and hes very forgetful.,0
"It seems most people have given up on him. Class is 16/35 full, people keep dropping out, and in the online lectures you'd be lucky to find 9-10 people attending. That should tell you everything about him. Listen to these reviews people.",0
"Don't ask questions unless you like looking stupid in public and being mocked.  His examples in class are all explained in the text making attendance pointless, but he grades on it.   The online homework bites, and his hints don't help.",0
Professor Grunlund knows her work but she makes this subject too hard! Every quiz she gives is timed too! She dont even give you a second chance to take it over like most teachers. Shes also not truthful about whats going to be on the test. She will tell you to study stuff thats going to be on the test but it dont be on it. Kind of deceiving.,0
awesome prof. my inspiration. ,1
She has a Phd in genetics but that doesn't translate well to AP. She is almost as confused by the material as the students. Test questions may be randomly plucked from the text. Only 8 students out of 24 left from all the course drops. Massive amount of material. I study every night for 2 hours or more for the A I currently have. You will struggle.,0
the way she thinks is so ridiculous. I can hardly believe that I willingly signed up for such a class. She also sometimes thinks that your not right when in reality you are.,0
"He's great! really friendly, very approachable, and know a lot about his area. Take his class!",1
Excellent class everybody should take. Dr. Brown is the best professor in the Bio department by far.,1
"Professor Lowi is an amazing professor. She really cares about her students and is very interested in their opinions. She is very learned about the Middle East and this is what makes her class so interesting. However, she assigns a LOT of readings and is a VERY hard grader.",1
She does not answer emails. It is a professor's job to respond to emails.,0
"KMac's lectures are boring as he takes very long to explain each process and he usually does a lot of errors in his calculations. However, he clearly knows a lot about statistics and that's nice. Don't expect your midterm grades to be returned. We're already entering second semester and I still don't have my grade...",1
"Dont waste your time with this professor. Nice person, but terrible teacher. If youre not a strong test taker, you will not survive. Also have fun purchasing a brand new text book, Lab Manual, Lab Guide AND online software (which you wont even use) no opportunity to earn any points other than the 3 100 point exams and quizzes every Mon/Wed.",0
"This guy doesn't cAre about the students, he doesn't have a heart and he will fail you if you don't pass his horrible class. Waste time, waste money he doesNt teach at all. He just read the slides. Don't take him if you wouldn't like to lose your money.",0
Amazing teacher.  Every class is interesting; a great lecturer and discussion starter.  You do need to pay close attention in class if you want to do well on the tests.  He's a tough but fair grader and lets you know how you can improve.  Very friendly.,1
Dr. Thrasher was very helpful. I enjoyed the class.,1
She was very understanding and was a great help in completing my assignments. I couldn't have done it without her help. She provides a lot of help to help you understand the course and is way more than fair in grading. She's a great teacher and I truly did appreciate being her student. I would definitely have her again if I could.,1
Really good and insightfull teacher.  Very relevant application and helpful.,1
Amazing teacher. I was so worried cuz I've heard bad things but he really was excellent!,1
"Absolutely useless online course.  Most of the online resource links don't work, the assignments are posted late but still expected to be on time, and there is no organization.  We went from saying ""Hello, my name is..."" in Week 3 to being expected to introduce ourselves and someone else in a paragraph of French with no lead-in.  Just terrible.",0
"He is the most specific grader I have every seen.  He docks off points for the way one writes their symbols.  I once overheard him tell a student that he will give him/her a zero on the test if he/she writes too small for his liking.  He seems passionate about math and one's understanding of the material.  Good guy, awful grader.",0
"Students discuss the subject, while she moderates. She never taught in the class, thus after paying 5K in uni fees you get opinions of ur peers & understanding from readings She is unable to keep her prejudices out of class & grading. If she dislikes you then it gets difficult Her approach is idealist & not policy based Take another professor",0
Great teacher. Made class fun and enjoyed it.,1
Mrs. Young is a sweet teacher. She want everyone to succeed and will do everything she can to help you get the grade you want in her class. ,1
This professor was a tough grader and very specific in grading . She took a long time to grade assignments which made it very frustrating. When asked for help she forwarded general information to blackboard as oppose to specifically answering my question based on my work. I wish I did not buy the book as well as more of her study guides were used.,0
Tries to teach too much in too short a time and isn't very clear or helpful if you have questions.,0
"Mr. Kula is my favorite teacher. He is strict and an old school teacher, but what is wrong about that?! He is funny, passionate and devoted. He wants you to study so it would benefit you in the future. It is the easiest thing to give students easy/free points, but it takes much more than that for you to succeed. He is not def easy but the best!",1
He really wants to help you learn. Hes new at teaching but knows that and makes the class super fair. Im not good at accounting but this prof is always accessible to help you through the class. He wants you to succeed and get the best grade possible. He makes accounting class better by using real world examples. Hes very kind and approachable.,1
"Super easy class. I am really bad at math but this prof really helps you out. She curves everything. There are a lot of homeworks and a few quizzes and tests, but she goes over almost exactly the qs that are gonna be on them during review. Do have to buy a code for Pearson which is $$$",1
"Shes an amazing teacher, she knows how to answer any questions clearly for you to understand it. Shes great with explaining the concept if you get confused. She always lets you know if there is any difficulty in D2L. Please take her, if you want a GOOD grade, she is the one!!!",1
"Professor Bennett is very approachable, nice, accommodating to her students and is willing to change due dates on major assignments. Her classes mainly consist of group work, but she does let students choose their own group members. If you want to earn a good grade, do yourself the favor of keeping up with all of the canvas discussions.",1
"Do not take this prof she made almost the whole class  fail, the midterms was not what was on the textbook or on her BB slides, try to switch, or drop the course I highly DO NOT reommend!!!",0
"Didn't enjoy the class at all.  The professor wasn't very helpful at all, but in the end, it was an easy A.",0
He called the feedback insulting in class but he needs to listen to what we are saying. This format is not working for most people. He needs to change his grading scale & curve. Not a bell curve just a normal curve that all other teachers do. My last chem teacher added 5% to each test but he waited to announce it until the final. He should do that.,0
Material was hard to understand,0
"She was not able to answer a lot of questions from students because she was  not able to understand them. When she doesn't understand your question, she makes other students to explain, which is sometimes inaccurate and hard to understand because they are also puzzled by inadequate explanation.",0
"I agree with all the postings here.  On a related front, my room mate is a history major and the majors are NOT permitted to take her (I guess this is something of an unwritten rule).  Translation: she is not solid enough for majors, so the general population has to tolerate her.  Do NOT take her if you care about your education.",0
"Dr. Luttrell is very nice, but his method of ""teaching"" is just reading through powerpoint slides. You can skip class and read through everything on your own and understand it just as well. One good thing about his class is that he curves all exams to 75%.",0
"This has been without a doubt the worst fire tech class I have ever taken! It's an online class so we have a quiz every week after completing two discussion boards and reading the textbook. The PowerPoints with ""notes"" are useless since nothing in those notes have anything to do with the questions in the quizzes. Just take it with someone else.",0
"She is a very funny and kind woman. However, I found her grading technique to be incredibly harsh. I have done well in other English and Comp courses, however this class has been a struggle. She is vague on descriptions of assignments. She sometimes also makes you feel stupid when answering questions. ",1
Took his online class and he was incredibly invasive with Lockdown browser for all test and exams. Lots of tests and two final exams. VERY heavy on lecture and horrible youtube version to watch his lecture. I would never take his class ever again. And during Zoom reviews he cuts off individuals when they try to talk as well as speaks over any input,0
This class was made a LOT more difficult than it needed to be. Participation points in her class were 10000x more difficult to get than in any other of the French classes.  She also was very impatient with her students and got frustrated very easily. This class should have been an easy A but unfortunately this wasn't the case,0
"She is way too harsh a grader. She gives assignments for projects and papers, but does not give you any structure for them, just ""do this"". Then she tells you that you did the assignment wrong. I would not recommend her.",0
get a good TA,0
"The material he teaches in class is almost no help when it comes to homework. Then when it comes to tests, reviewing homework, the study guide (which is a list of topics), and writing a sheet of notes seem almost useless, because the problems are not what you prepared for. The good thing is that tests are heavily curved as well as the final grade.",0
"His voice is soft, and hard to hear.  Cantow is lazy, so when he grades, he grades real easy.  Funny guy, too.  Really wants to get done with the lab.  I'd recommend him for lab, easily. (=",0
"Tests are not made by him. So his tests do not mesh with his teaching style. I am a son of a math teacher, and even his math oriented questions were confusing because he does not clearly go over the math part of the course. Personally, I wish there was more math so I could have had a different grasp of the information. Physics can get wordy!",0
"so nice, a sweety. gets excited about rocks.... cant help but be entertaining, lol. easy, helpful, really nice guy. take him!!",1
Doesn't know what she wants to say to the class. Doesn't have any type of lecture plan. Teaches very slow and speaks very low.  ,0
"Tidwell really knows her stuff but she has some trouble teaching it. She stands at the front and reads from the PPs for class. You have to have a quick hand for she doesnt put anything on Canvas because she wants to make sure everyone shows up. She grades attendance every single day, too. This info is really interesting but she made it boring.",1
"Speaks too softly, constantly loses control/attention of the class. Questions his own intelligence in front of class. ""Does that make sense?"" You're the one with the PhD. You tell me. Easy classes. Got a B without trying, caring, or hardly even showing up.",0
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
"Lots and lots of boring lectures, makes bad jokes throughout the school year, easy pass other than that didn't really learn anything",0
"horrible! horrible! horrible! He seems like a cool teacher at first but very confusing on his grading and instructions. 3 test thats tough. Tough grader, long lectures, has favorites but makes you feel uncomfortable about learning.",0
"Prof. Morton is a fabulous instructor, and does everything possible to help students succeed. ",1
"Take this class you wont regret it, this was my first college class and I enjoyed it he is hilarious, the class was pretty long but he would let us get out early. Over all amazing professor one of my favorites.",1
This teacher is great!  She is so helpful and really cares about her students.  If you don't like her theres something wrong with you.  I want to adopt her.,1
"Had Lim for 4 classes, he was my only option for each. I consider him to be the worst professor I had at any point in my college career. I did not receive good feedback on questions I asked. Graded homework did not give feedback. Only benefit seemed to be that many students quit trying, while I did try, leading to me having decent grades. Terrible!",0
Brian is a wonderful teacher and is really passionate about what he does. You get to learn about an aspect of theater that you wouldnt unless you had him. He is easy to understand and is more than willing to help you if there are miscommunications. I highly recommend Brian,1
I'm taking Dr Mukherjee for Calc 2 and he is one the worst professors I could ever have. Only 1 week left in this class. He doesn't offer to help students and never goes over homework or tests so you wont know what the answers are for exams. Blames students for not knowing certain material and he wont teach students. I'll never take him again��,0
"Dr Sam, knows how to explain for everyone to understand especially in the Lab. He takes time to show everyone the parts and make sure we all understand him. If you follow up and attain all his Classes, then be ready to do well in test and exams.",1
"Great teacher! Prof. Wangeman was absent for most of the semester so she carried the lectures! Must go to class! You should use the textbook for the reading, however I didn't (I should have). She gave me high As on weekly questions but when we did the film analysis I got a low B, a little annoying. Willing to work w/ you!",1
"Took it online, the most work I (and the rest of the class) have ever done. Weekly, about 150 pages to read and an average 7 pages SINGLE-SPACED responses, on top of 4 projects. HORRIBLE grader. Completely not worth your time, effort, or GPA. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. it is hard and you cant understand what he says. the class is so boring and he talks about one slide for like 15 minutes!,0
"Do not waste your time or money with this guy. He doesn't care about student needs. Doesn't adjust to feedback from previous reviews, also the overall class is 100 level at best. I highly recommend literally any other professor for COMM220. You will not learn any new information in this class, nor will you be challenged intellectually.",0
One of the Toughest professor at ccny.,0
"There are no tests, only quizzes but the quizzes are crazy specific and hard. She grades really tough on the essays and takes points off for not having the proper format. You watch videos and movies and she is a great person, funny and her lectures are so fun. It is just the papers and quizzes that you really need to be careful with.",1
"Too many and too long quizzes. Really Hard exams. Bad Lecture notes. Bad TA grading. Too many quizzes, too hard exams and bad essay grading. Bad TA. Tough class.",1
Worst online teacher. Im a 4.0 student and he grades DQs super hard.,0
Deluna is a funny amazing professor. Just because he is funny does not mean the class can not get difficult. Theres really only 2 assignments in the class. The test and quizes are hard but only if you dont read the textbook and dont pay attention in class. Pay attention on everything he teaches because it is all on the test. You will love the class,1
"It was his first year teaching Intro Bio, and you could tell. Nice, and presents material well. Still feeling out his curriculum, so some assignments are too much for the time frame. Changes deadlines very frequently- sometimes without informing his students. Tends to make you search for answers instead of just helping you. Needs to proofread.",1
This guy decided to change up his grading policy mid semester thinking it would help students. This was the first time I have ever gotten curved down in a class. He is a new prof and thought a 100 question final was fine and said 300 questions was bad. He is new and doesn't teach. I highly recommend you don't take him,0
"Amazing professor! This was the easiest class of my life. An easy A for sure and you really learn a lot from this professor who is amazing. We had two short presentations and a final paper and that was it! Make sure to go to class, but you don't have to read any of the books or anything. Just show up and thats enough!",1
"He's a nice prof, but papers/ Exams grading are unfair and heavy.",0
I had him for intro to philosophy and it was probably the most mentally stimulating class I've taken.  He is great at promoting thought on the readings while guiding class discussion and interpretation.  He's a really smart guy and class was very interesting.,1
"Dowding is funny and knowledgeable, but he is an extremely tough grader. He cold calls throughout the class and can be condescending at times. It doesn't matter how much time or effort you put it, he will still grade harshly.",0
He isn't the most communicative instructor. Had to ask for the assignment schedule and it isn't laid out well online. Not the most responsive to emails.,0
loveddd her. shes so kind and her tests are fair. def take her. you will not regret it. ,1
"One popquiz the whole semester. Tests were pretty easy in my opinion, just study from the sheet he gives you. DO THE HOMEWORK at the back of the chapter as he spontaneously checks them. Overall, he's offensive. he says inappropriate things in class, but I managed an A without trying too hard.",0
"She doesn't teach us anything. Every weekly class session she talks about her personal life, berates us for not knowing the material she isn't teaching us, and then if we ask her to explain the topics we are supposed to be learning she says ""that isn't her teaching style"". I'm changing majors because of this professors incompetence. AVOID HER",0
Very dry boring class. Harsh grader when it comes to papers. Pay attention to her nitpicky grammar suggestions. I had to work my butt off to get a good grade on her papers.,1
Great class!,1
"his lectures are funny, interesting, and sometimes very moving.  i was not looking forward to this class and i loved it.  considering his quizzes are simple translations and papers get proofread by other students AS WELL AS the prof. and TA you have to be an idiot to do badly.",1
"This guy is awesome. Patient, clear explanations and presentations, very helpful when you need him, calm personality, and best of all, you learn the material without having to bust your brain. Just study and ask him if you have any issues, and he'll gladly help you. Excellent Professor. I'm glad I took him",1
"Tells you the first day that you should quit your job or drop all of your other classes and just have his for the semester! He expects your to study minimum 2-3 hours a day. If you're 100% that you'll be in the medical field, then take it. A lot of people dropped his class within the first week. He made me feel like a dumb college student.",0
"This teacher was not very accessible. Her answers to questions were not clear, and I had to have her clarify most of the time. Since it was an online class, I could read other students' frustration with the same issue. She also took a long time to reply to questions.",0
great teacher. she only plays favorites because only some kids talk and other decide not to so she obviously gets to know the kids who talk more.  there is work to do but she makes it very interesting. i am not the kind of student who goes to class because i like it and i am intrested however this class i liked and was interested in.,1
"! If you ask him a question most times he wont answer and will say well if you read your notes you would know. He also graded extremely hard, gave very difficult exams with over 70 multiple choice questions and short answers. No laptops or talking in class. If you disturb class in any way he will absolutely lose it.",0
"I've taken many online courses, and really do prefer them, but Taking this class was a mistake. If you struggle with math, please please please look for another professor or wait a semester. Your GPA isn't worth it!",0
"She's very sweet and gives a lot of extra credit! 8 free absences and she really does try to help bring your grade up. Strong accent, always energetic.",1
"By far the funniest professor I have ever had. His class is enjoyable, but make sure you pay attention. He will notice, and he will not like you if you don't. The midterm was a little difficult, it's not what you would expect, but if you go in for help, you can do  really well in the class.",1
"I took her class in Winter. She is a very good lecturer. Her note is very clear and easy to understand. I am in a pharmacy school now, and I remember what she taught us! Her class prepares me for pharmacy school!! I cannot thank you her enough. She is one of the best professor in CSULA. MUST TAKE and DO THE WORK and enjoy it!",1
"I've never met a professor so picky about work, I'd understand if this was a more advanced course like thesis 1 or something, but 3D design is a beginners course and he is ruthless with his students, you better make sure nothing in your pieces are off because he picks it apart like crazy, he's a funny guy and chill to talk to but extremely picky",0
REL 1312 She cares about students. Tell funny stories to break up hard material. I would take her again because I learned a lot.,1
"I loved Mrs. Jimmerson! As long as you study the notes that you took in class, the tests will be easy!  She tells random stories in the middle of her lectures, but they are entertaining.  She gives daily quizzes over assigned reading material.  Read everything adn you'll fo great!Overall best English teacher I've had in a very long time!",1
"Sullivan is an interesting person and knows his material, however, I did not enjoy this class at all. If you have the opportunity, take with someone else. Very disorganized! His exams are completely ambiguous and not related to the material. We had a project/paper with no direction. He never answered email and wasn't available during office hours.",0
"Very nice professor. He really likes this subject. ME on the other hand find it pretty long, and boring. It is an easy class, and he really puts an effort into it. Lots of writing to do. one group project",1
No Comments,0
Easy class,1
"I had him online for summer 2020. He is awful. His recorded lectures are him just reading off of his slides. I stopped watching because it was better to read the textbook and make my own notes myself. When asking him questions, he is unclear and I feel like he doesn't really listen to the full question. Quizzes are brutal; exams are fair. Beware!",0
Shes not very clear with her grading rubric as well as being a very tough grader. Shes one of those teachers that thinks her class is the only one youre taking because she piles on the projects all at once.,0
"Take him is you have to. He is a kind person, but very very very boring. It is very lecture heavy and he goes off on tangents that do not pertain to the subject you are learning about. He quizzes you every class and the quizzes do not correlate to the chapters that you read outside of class. He is nice though.",0
pretty easy class,1
You get what you put into the class knowledge wise. You can just show up for the midterm and final and get away with an A . But i would highly encourage you to go. Mensah is one of those professors that really should not be at Howard and took major pay cuts to be here. Though it does not come across all the time he is extremely knowledgeable.,1
"Thad is great! I took him this Summer for Physiology,and he made it awesome. He doesn't waste your time with things you don't need, and is VERY clear about what he expects you to know. It's a hard class, but Thad gives you every opportunity to do well. He's got a good sense of humor, and really knows his stuff. I would highly recommend taking him!",1
"10 weekly journals, 5 chapter tests, 5 online hws, small presentation, & final. I took her class b/c the other reviews. I took 3 years of Spanish in high school so it was a good review for me. She's very sweet, wants her students to do well, and has brought food! The tests are easy and straightforward, she tells us what topics will be on it before.",1
"One of the most boring classes I have ever taken, I was really excited for this class just to catch myself falling asleep every single day. Attendance is super lenient but he makes it very hard to go to class. Zero group activities or any engaging in the classroom, I don't even know a single persons name in my class. Exam study guides are 10 pages.",0
"I did not like Professor Smith. Her lectures were extremely long with obnoxious background music and lost my attention. She brought her personal political views into HISTORY lectures multiple times, but she does communicate with students well. She knows when students are most likely sharing answers. Stay on top of the work, and you will do great.",0
"Professor Weis is one of my only favorite classes , she makes class worth it you actually learn something , she doesnt just put the notes on the smart board she explains it and puts in her own personal examples and jokes she very caring and well would recommend ! Would take her class again if I could",1
"DO NOT TAKE WITH BROWN. The worst professor I have ever had. Lectures are all over the place and have nothing to do with the tests. A monkey could probably teach better than him. He doesnt give two craps about you or your grade, and although he may be smart, I dont know how he still has his job. Good luck getting a passing grade.",0
"We're taking an online program called ReadingPlus and its the WORST. I get it done, but I dont learn anything from it. Has nothing to do with reading really. It FORCES us to speed read. we should be able to read at our own pace. And forces us to advance when we're not ready. The whole program feels like a video game. Horrible program.",0
Professor Montanari is an amazing professor. I would gladly recommend her as an instructor and I would take her courses again. I learned a great deal from her instruction and her methods of assessment helped me to gain new skills and knowledge. She is a fair instructor and she works with her students. She is also incredibly organized.,1
Be prepared for A LOT of work. At least 4 quizzes a week along with assignments and research projects. One week alone we had 6 quizzes and 4 assignments that were not simple. She will help out with resumes and internship questions which was good. Other than that you need to dedicate much time to this class. Look for books online-they are expensive!,0
He's kinda boring.  Acutally pretty boring and his syllabus gives you no direction whatsoever on what to read and when.  He usually takes the full class period and at times goes over.,0
"This professor is frustrating. She is knowledgable and has a neat approach to science instruction. Unfortunately she is rudely sarcastic & unable to ""turn off"" her 7th grade teaching style. She has no interest in credential candidate success. She grades font, margins & spacing to the point of failure. Horrible at communicating in person and email.",0
Great teacher! Fun class and he gives study guides! You do have to work for that A. I would take him again! He usually gives a extra credit opportunity.,1
"Very sweet woman, and extremely there for you if you need help.  She will always make sure to have office hours and review sessions.  Tests are straightforward, straight from her lectures and powerpoints -- barely looked at book and got a good grade.  Would definitely recommend.",1
"Really, really cool dude. Super chill and makes class fun. The work throughout the class I thought was a complete waste. Didn't take anything away from the course, but that had to do with the course, not Eddie. He was an awesome professor and made this class semi-bearable.",1
"This class is an absolute mess. I missed almost half of the listening assignments because he was not clear how to access them. A nice enough guy, but also very unreliable for extra help outside of class, due to his position in the philharmonic. This is the first ever music class where I will likely not do well, and I've been taking music for years.",0
"Unfortunately I didn't get to finish this class, but the teacher was completely understanding and honestly a kind heart, this teacher is very approachable! If you have any issues she is for sure to listen and help you any way that she can. Highly recommend. Class work was extremely easy and not that hard.",1
"I don't recommend at all. U will not know about nothing, unless you struggle by your self.",0
Robyn Proud is an AMAZING professor here at SUNY Oswego.  As an education major she is a must have!  I had her as a 3 hour night class professor and she made the class time fly by.  She in engaging and really cares about all her students.  She has effective teaching experience and is always willing to share with her class.  ,1
"A very, very hard course, which should be expected because it is Advanced level. However, he generally does a good job explaining concepts and is very helpful during office hours. Sometimes it is difficult to stay concentrated during class though.",1
amazing man! totally recommend!!,1
"He's a nice guy but his lectures are just not interesting. He doesn't make much of an effort as a teacher to keep the class interested. He gives online quizzes spontaneously and they're sometimes assigned at the last minute when they do take a bit of time to do because they are difficult. He does give a little bit of extra credit, nothing too big.",0
"US HISTORY 2                  Basically, listen to what he says.  His stories are good, but HE WILL MENTION SUBLIMINALLY the topic the class is suppose to be on regarding history.  Write down those terms, highlight them in the book and you will be fine.",1
very nice and helpful,1
"I loved taking Dr. Fischer's class. His lectures are very dense and it can get a little boring, but as long as you do the readings and go to discussion it'll be fine. His midterms and final were a bit tricky because they're all free response. You really need to understand the material and expand upon it with your own objections and/or agreements.",1
"3 big group projects & 2 tests (mid-term & final). He is a very fair grader, will help you with and review your project before you submit it. Pick a good group, you're stuck with them all semester! He does curve grades at the end of the semester. Marketing is not my major, but he had me very interested in it!",1
"One of the best profs I've had in my year and a half at school. Comes off scary first class or two, but you will learn a ton. Provides good feedback, if you ask the right questions. Lab helps reinforce lecture material. Has no problem talking to you outside of class, as he is at school for the majority of the day. Throws a couple extra credits in.",1
Terrible prof. Does not clarify whats on the exam she will tell us to study the whole book while the exam will be clearly based on a small section of the book. Theres no course outline and she wastes 1hr in a 2hr lecture talking about random nonsense. Lectures and powerpoints have absolutely nothing to do with whats on the exam. STAY AWAY!!!!,0
"Ms. Dixon is a great teacher because of her compassion toward all her students to do well in college. Extra Credit is a way to bring up your grade. Expects attendance with a few excused only,& part of the grade. Easy course,keep up with work & you can Ace it!Learned time management,organization reading faster,grammar review & being a better student",1
I am a senior getting ready to graduate in March and Professor Bradley is by far my favorite professor thus far. She is engaging and draws class participation from everybody. I only hope they allow her to teach one of my remaining clusters.,1
"If you take her class, you'll learn a lot about literature, but at the expense of having to endure her constant humiliation of everyone in the room, her obnoxious rants about ""bozos"" ranging from political leaders to the college staff, and her viciously mean-spirited remarks carried under the banner of being ""frank."" I heard she made a Marine cry.",0
"Andrews is the ****ing man.  Period.  If you have not taken KNES 287 then you are missing out.  How to get an ""A"" in his class: Start your papers at least a week in advance (and possibly consult with your T.A.), and study the key terms he has posted on each section for the test.  I got an A+.",1
"This is by far the best professor I've had in my 3 years of uni. He either likes to teach or he's really good at acting. His lectures are very engaging, he's invested in what you're saying and doesn't belittle you or make you feel bad even if what you say isn't the exact answer he's looking for. An inspiring individual. Take a class with him, trust",1
Ericka is AWESOME!! She makes lecture fun. She's not intimidating or shy at all and cracks jokes throughout the whole 3 hours. Great teacher!,1
"Dr. Beaty-Nosco grades very strictly throughout the first half of the course. I feel that she did not thoughly explain things when questions were asked, it was like she was speaking a different language. Nice lady though. Makes lame jokes, but laugh anyway. Hard tests, must get a 60% or better in all aspects to pass class, and that's with a D.",0
Brooke makes students who struggle with math feel more confident. She has a lot of office hours and responds to emails almost immediately. My only complaint- she spends too much class time helping with homework problems instead of teaching new material. This makes learning the new material feel rushed when she does have plenty of office hours.,1
"Class was alright, but Brandt repeats his weird anecdotes such as buying butter at the grocery store too much. Gets old fast.  Claims attendance is mandatory but only took attendance once. 14 quizzes, lowest 2 get dropped. NOT ALL QUIZ ANSWERS ARE ONLINE. 3 tests - provides 1 makeup during finals, but only if you missed an exam. No extra credit.",0
"really awesome prof. super nice. his class is kinda hard just because of his tests. he purposely makes them really hard to get an A, but offers some extra points. homework assignments are pretty much pass/fail. so just do them. attendance is not mandatory, but you should go. he is planning on changing the course tho. i'd take him again for another",1
"She's very opinionated and you might as well not waste your time disagreeing with her. ONLY take her if you are taking very easy classes because you'll need to dedicate an awful lot of time for her reading assignments, and you can't get away with not doing them. I did learn a lot but it wasn't worth the stress and workload.",0
He is a rude person who uses words to hurt you if you don't understand the material making you feel dumb. when the course is very hard if you dont understand it with difficulty math involved. He slams his hands on tables and doesn't help you if you dont understand sometihng.,0
"she's a cool person, but she tends to ask for too much from an ACA class. Like its a 1 credit class and she doesnt understand some people's circumstances. So i'll be a tough rater, like she's a tough grader.",0
Very passionate about mental health. Expect to complete your readings. Comes off as passive aggressive and slightly rude.,1
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
Aren't we supposed to read and study in college? This is a great class for anyone SERIOUS about becoming a good nurse or health professional. A friend in nursing school recommended Professor Jones. I'm glad I took her class. It helped improve study and reading skills that I have to use in nursing school. Exams were straight out of the book.,1
I had Natalie for Anthro and she made it super fun! Shes a little quirky and sometimes it can be a little boring but take notes anyway. You can use those for your open book tests (multiple choice)! Take advantage of all the extra credit opps (there are enough) and attend all classes to get in class group work credit. Shes amazing!,1
The subject is not horrible with him but you need to go to lecture because he adds a lot to the slides during lecture. What he writes on the white board has a VERY high chance of being on the exams. He gives 'study guides' that are quiet vague but if you find the answers then you are great for the test. Not entertaining but very knowledgable.,1
"Dr. Currier takes a difficult and intimidating-sounding class and makes it into something fun. I had absolutely zero interest in Microbiology prior to her class and am now planning on pursuing a Bachelors in the same subject. Also, I would take her for lab too, the best Micro teacher you will find.",1
"He is absolutely brilliant and expects such brilliance in return. His assignments are challenging and though his marking is difficult, it is fair considering what you are able to take away from his lectures. The effort he asks of you as a student will benefit you in all other English classes. You will walk away from his class feeling accomplished.",1
"Amazing professor. Lectures are very helpful for homework. He is always around to help out with homework, projects, labs, etc. He is pretty laid back which is nice and makes the learning environment much better.",1
"I chose this class as an elective to finish my Masters Degree and just dropped it because the required reading was insane. I was sick the first two weeks of the class and got behind in reading and was never able to catch up. I took notes and highlighted and when it came time to take the test,nothing I had read was on there! I do not recommend.",0
"WORST TEACHER EVER! Seriously. I could not understand a word he was saying. He told us to study one thing, then didn't put it on tests. He even put some stuff on the tests that he didn't go over! In fact, he told us not to study one thing, and then put it on the test! I do not recommend this teacher to ANYONE! Stay far away from this teacher.",0
never take him stay away.  useless professor.,0
"She is the worst professor at the university. In a class about why one ought not to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people, she found it very necessary to do so with regard to her class. She insulted the prior education and viewpoints of the class on a daily basis. She is a hypocrite and a know it all, who doesn't actually know jack.",0
"Prof. Ams is among the worst teachers I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach. He just stands in front of the room and talks at the class. He draws rxn mechanisms, but I don't feel like he ever explains why things are happening the way they are. I would not recommend Ams to anyone. I am certainly going to avoid his classes from now on.",0
"This class is really straight forward. His tests are easy because he gives a study guide and takes a few of those exact questions and puts them on the test. I like the way he lectures, he gets the class involved in discussions. He makes you feel really comfortable to speak up in class and add to the discussion. Overall a great professor",1
"Je l'adore! Elle est très dynamique, ses power-points sont très clairs. Elle nous fait beaucoup participer en classe, on peut dire nos impressions et opinions. Les examens sont représentatifs de la matière vue en classe, aucune pogne. Je la recommande vraiment, elle rend le cours très pertinent et intéressant.",1
"Dr. Bowen was very passionate about his class, however, he was extremely scattered. His tests were almost impossible even with a 5 X 7 note card. The labs were long and confusing. Only two people passed when I took his class, myself included. Unless you have a lot of prior knowledge to the subject, do not take his class.",0
"She was an awesome teacher and made sure to give accurate feedback to give support, she does assign a lot of essays but they are on the lecture given and she was very generous with the grading. I would strongly suggest being in her class, so helpful and I truly enjoyed the teaching.",1
"This course was one of the hardest courses I took. I thought it would've been easy, but it's not. I barely passed this course, only because I was emailing him 24/7, worrying and freaking out I wasn't going to pass. It's A LOT of quizzes and your final is an essay that has a lot of requirements",0
Very great teacher she teaches what she does very well and explains things the way they are without confusing you All your grades are basically posted on online  so you know exactly where you stand Her quizes come with review and you go over the quiz review in class Excellent teacher By far One of my favorites,1
Awesome teacher .,1
"As an English major, I dreaded coming to this class every day. I have never been more dissatisfied with an major required course.",0
Prof. Tortolani is the best professor to get for Italian. She tells you exactly what are going to be on the quizzes and gives you a good study guide for the midterm and final. She is very helpful if you go to her and wants her students to pass. If you can get a professor for Italian get Prof. Tortolani.,1
"great teacher, very nice, very funny, makes class interesting- just don't be late!",1
Fun Class! Quick pace. Lots of info. Read what he puts on blackboard,1
"She's literally thee best. Any questions you have she answers them with no problem at all. very easy to understand, makes everything related to something you know so you can understand the concept better. I would take her again",1
"I took it online but ended up dropping her because I just couldn't take it anymore. There are three exams and 5 HW. A ridiculous long project plus you have to do peer feedback for EVERYTHING. All material comes from the book. Meaning she hardly contributes anything original, even the powerpoints come straight from the book. Lame and boring.",0
Hard grader,0
He knows a lot about Eastern Religions and in Comparative Religion that is what we mainly focused on.  I was very disappointed that we did not spend more than a couple of days on Judaism and Christianity.  Also his lecture on Christianity was very skewed and would not give a non-Christian any idea of what Christianity is about.,1
"She did not believe me when I told her a test was not open for me online and proceeded to give me a 0. I believe this says a lot about her as a person, and I do not recommend you take her class.",0
"He gives extra credit for attendance/in class assignments, and i mean like 100 points worth so go to class. Also, do yourself a favor and use MINITAB instead of R. It isn't free, but much more user-friendly. KNOW THE BOOK DEFINITION OF ""P-VALUE."" It will be on every test. I never missed lecture & still had to do lots of reading outside of class.",1
"Gail is amazing. After the experiences I had with her in lab, if I were sick and scared in the hospital, I would want her as my nurse. She is very candid, caring, and committed to her student's success. I was intimidated by her at first, but I truly cannot say enough good things about her. She is very accessible and helpful outside of class.",1
"Larsen is tough. She truly loves math and teaches like so. But, the pretests always caught everyone off guard. &, the tests were no easy task either. Study enough and it is definitely possible to get that A. Also, don't be afraid to take time and complete the extra credit (most of which is due before the sem starts). & do the HW daily, she checks.",1
"This is the most unorganized teacher I have ever taken in my life! We have (4) 4-5 page papers due within a 6 week time period. And she couldnt figure out how to work the online system for 3 of those weeks. She didnt even grade out first paper until one week before the summer term was over. If you are in unorganized student, you will not make it.",0
"More than half of the class dropped her class and out of 12 of us that were left, about 4 of us had to email the dean about her behavior. On the final she said we have to show work even on multiple choice question b/c if we dont we wont receive credit. Takes points off labs for things such as commas and dots. Also has an envy towards girls",0
Good communication and stayed involved with good feedback.  Do readings and exams weren't hard. Large PowerPoint project at end of class which wasn't hard but takes some time to do. I am looking forward to the next class I have with her and would recommend her. If the workload is too high then maybe you're not ready for collegiate work.,1
"Professor Hinshaw is one of the best professors at Cal. He's funny, brilliant, compelling, and patient. The level of engagement he induces about the lecture material is off the charts. If only he taught more classes--that would be a dream come true.",1
WORST ACCT TEACHER AT CLEMSON!! DOESNT UNDERSTAND THAT ACCOUNTING IS DONE ON THE COMPUTER NOW...NOT BY HAND!! MAKE SURE YOU LOVE WRITING OUT YOUR ACCT PROBLEMS IN A BLUE BOOK BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS TEACHER.,0
PRETTY EASY HE POST ALL THE READINGS AND NOTED THAT YOU NEED FOR EACH WEEK THEN POST THE TEST AND REFLECTION PAPER THAT FRIDAY OF!,1
Not helpful at all! She expects the students to know everything! Don't take her class!,0
"This professor is a total jerk who is only interested in his own opinion. If you type a paper and he doesn't like your view then your grade will definitely suffer. If possible, take anyone else. He is the absolute worst prof. I went to him for clarification on a grade, and he gave no assistance. I am an A student who received a D!",0
"Young, fun and very consistent. Interesting lectures and readings (kind of long articles tho). He knows his field pretty well. But, lots of work to do (two assignments per week). I would take another class with him.",1
"If you are unfortunate to have him for your COB 300 marketing class, JUST CHANGE MAJORS NOW! He is by far, the worst professor I have ever taken. He will tell you to study a certain part of the material, and test on the complete opposite. To make it worse, he took a class in grad school about formatting exams which are ridiculously hard. Good luck!",0
Expects a lot out of you. Need to pay attention and know what you are doing in class to pass assessments. Study groups didn't seem to help me at all.,0
Terrible. Heavy accent. Unorganized. ,0
"She does not teach. She rambles on about irrelevant topics and really does not enjoy being there in class. She basically just wants to get through the material and receive her paycheck. If you want to learn accounting, take someone else. You are stuck fending for yourself in this class, and it is not enjoyable. Easy due to ex cred, but not helpful.",0
"Melanie is a great professor who really knows her stuff. Be prepared to read multiple poems, short stories, and a novel. Be prepared to participate in many group discussion that are in the shape of forums. The course included 4 different styled essays. She only gave extensions if extremely necessary. Overall, a well ran, heavy reading course!",1
"As other reviews state, he's a good dude. He knows lectures suck so he gets the class involved (especially at 7am). Tests are super easy because he lets you use notes, he doesn't believe classes should just be ""learn the material and spit it back"". Highly recommended, will be taking him again next semester. Easy A as long as you do the work.",1
"She's rude. Does not know how to engage in conversation. She looks down on her students. At least, made me feel stupid. I agree with the person who mentioned that she discusses student's personal stories in front of everyone. Very invasive. She also does not challenge the students' thinking. Class is super easy and basic. Didn't learn anything new.",0
"Disrespectful to his students and he repeats himself throughout the semester. He spams you with email everyday and doesn't teach you anything about photography. If attendance wasn't mandatory, there would be no reason to go. He brags about students that he has taught but he only does so he can find more faults in his students.",0
"We do 2-3 sections, online and handwritten homework for those 2-3 sections, online forum posts, & have a test/ ""quiz""(1hr long, 2 pages) in class weekly. We meet for 1 class a week in which she answers 5-6 homework questions before we have the quiz/test. Have to study all material on your own, theres no lecture at all. Wouldn't recommend this class",0
"Take this class, it's so easy. All you have to do is show up and say at least two things a day to get an A.  I didn't really participate so I got a B, but overall he's a very laid back teacher.",1
"His class, tests, and quizzes are the definition of that one meme. Sally has four apples and gives one away.. calculate the mass of the sun.. like bruh Alot of college is self teaching/learning. But this class takes it to the next level. He lectures off slides with no additional context of HW problems. Very few examples and guidance given. avoid",0
"What everyone else said.  Very hard, 5 hrs of homework a night.  A really good teacher willing to help you.",1
Take a different professor. That is all.,0
"Morris straight up didnt care about teaching this course and all he talked about was his job at iRobot. Didnt look over the lectures beforehand, and lectures were a week behind homework for most of the semester so you were learning what you needed to do the day you turned in the homework.",0
Online lectures and textbook did not provide enough information to complete assignments. Instructor not as accessible as needed.,0
Told us all assignments are on hold during move to online which was a 2 week period and then did not change the course load. Actually made us go back and complete assignments that would have been due even though we were not in session for that time period. Can't give him a bad enough rating.,0
"I TOOK HIS ENG100 & ENG103 CLASSES 'CAUSE HE'S THE PERSON WHO MAKES U FEEL COMFORTABLE WHILE U ARE LEARNING HOW TO WRITE AN ESSAY. HE'S  WELL ORGANIZED: U READ, WRITE A LOT, AND DISCUSS THE TOPIC WITH UR CLASSMATES! WHEN I BEGAN HIS CLASS I WAS ABLE TO WRITE A PAGE LONG ESSAY, AFTER HIM I AM ABLE TO WRITE 8 PAGES LONG! ENG LANG ISNT MY NATIVE LANG!",1
"Very confusing about the projects, looks for specific she never mentionned.",0
Nice Prof. - Lectures Are Powerpoint and Out of class work only a reflection due on exam days and a 2 person team project (both easy grades.) Exams are medium difficulty - definitely look over key notes in the book. Overall I think she's great.,1
I really enjoyed Pam and the class.  We learned a lot of helpful information and she made it as fun as she could.  I recommend her highly.,1
"More of a hybrid class. You need mymathlab. the subject is harder for me than most but hes a great teacher, funny and laid back. practicing the math concepts is a must. Hes Not a fan of extra credit so do well on all exams for good measure of your grade.",1
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
"If you don't take notes fast, you probably won't get all of them. The lectures are long and if you miss one class, it's like you missed three.",0
"I did more work outside of this class than all of my other classes combined. We had two textbooks. One for our weekly 500-word blogs + two 250-word comments on other people's blogs, and the other textbook for the online tests. Do not think that just because you get to use the textbook the tests are easy. No. Very difficult to take lecture notes.",0
He never tells you what he wants bc he doesnt want to stifle your creativity then takes off points for stuff that wouldve been clear if he gave rubrics. feedback sucks and gets annoyed when you try to talk to him/clarify things. His lectures are cool and so is he but he rambles and is unhelpful. he doesnt realize that hes condescending ALL THE TIME,0
"Dr. Cote's the worst professor I've ever had. She's arrogant, rude, and a horrible teacher. She just reads off her slides and does NOT engage with the class. She gives problem sets as homework but never goes over them. Be prepared to spend hours teaching yourself EVERYTHING. WPUNJ should fire her, as she puts the school down in every lecture.",0
Professor Leung's lectures were not the most interesting but he really cares about his students and is enthusiastic about teaching. The first exam was difficult but the second two were easier because he'll even show you some of the material from the test before you take it. He records attendance every day even though it doesn't count for anything.,1
"Okay, relatively easy class.  Proffessor Brandt however does not attend office hours, his quizzes the 'TA's make' are made by the book and are ONLINE (with the answers), and he overall doesn't seem to care about his students. The tests are about 50% quiz questions and 50% lecture questions which you can get from the power points he posts online",0
I did not learn anything in this class. If theology is your major run. This class was hard for only being a core credit. He is a tough grader with no rewrites. He gives a paper and a final so prepare.,0
"Take this class and get old test! They are plentiful and almost guarantee an A, assuming you are not partially braindead.",1
"I work FT while going to school FT and I had little to no problem getting good grades in her class. People who say otherwise are just making excuses. You go through the material quickly. It's challenging but not hard, especially if you're into science/bio. Record the lectures if it's too fast for you. She's willing to help you if you help yourself.",1
"Her media literacy class was very interesting. Alot of you're grade is based off papers 3 papers and 2 exams. Exams aren't too difficult, tough grader with papers though. She's very funny and can be at times very over zealous. But its very refreshing compared to alot of the boring teachers at CCSU. I strongly suggest her.",1
Horrible teacher. Does not know how to teach. He teaches as his students know a lot.,0
"Prof. Haidey has an excellent teaching style. However, I wish that he had gone through the suggested problems list for FNCE 3227 BEFORE the Fall 2016 semester even started because the list has problems that test concepts he does not even want students to worry about.",1
"I Love her!!! Didn't want to take bio now I am minoring in it, she is wonderful!!!",1
Such an amazing teacher. Definitely my favorite. Sghe made class so fun. She does this cute little head twist when.... Well you'll see lol.,1
"Her classes are extremely boring.  Although she does let you copy her slide shows from her website, you still have to show up for class... and all she does is read the slide show to you.  And she cant dress appropriately (stomach hanging out) but tells you to dress for your mentor teacher. I dont quite understand that. And group work? come on!",0
I absolutely loved having Professor Ippolito! We learned so much more than just how to give a speech! He really cares about each student and that is the first thing you will learn in his class. C.E.H.R. Be ready to learn all about that acronym!! He has a great way of teaching because he is more like your coach/mentor than your professor! Loved it!,1
"Professor Steiner is a wonderful professor. She cares for her students. Besides this, how she weights assignments is 100% fair. She isn't out to fail you or make the class overly difficult. Though, you still need to put work it obviously. There's 3 tests and 1 final. The final is cumulative. She gives practice tests. Gives extra credit as well.",1
She is really funny and entertaining. Her test are hard but if you look over your notes you will be fine. She is reasonable and is willing to work with you. She makes a big class feel like a small one because she engages students and opens up the floor to here other peoples thoughts and opinions. i recommend her! :),1
"prof gilbert is awesome at what he does. not only is the topic interesting to begin with, but he makes it come to life.. he really knows what he's talking about. more importantly, what he talks about really makes you think. and isn't that what higher education is all about? but be prepared to do some MAD writing for the exams!totally worth it tho!",1
"ENT 3114 ""New Venture Lab"" is all about a semester-long product-prototype & business-plan development group-project assignment. It is almost impossible to get an A. You will need really reliable group members. Standard group sizes are 6 to 8 people; split between 2/3 business students and 1/3 engineering students. It is very stressful. Good luck!",1
"Professor Vannier rambles a bit but is an okay professor. You can easily pass the class by completing the weekly quiz during lectures and briefly skimming the lecture slides. Anything difficult is pretty easy to figure out with at most a couple minutes of searching. The text book is a waste of time, the internet can suffice.",1
"Pretty Hard. Lectures aren't that helpful, but they're not useless either. Homeworks will take at least 1-2 hours. Tests are really hard and not enough time was given. Not many things are graded, so it's hard to end with a good grade. I messed up on the first few hws, which led me to fail the class. I wish there were another prof to retake it with.",0
"Very easy class. Among the 7 exams, he drops the lowest grade and only counts 6 (Online exams + final is not mandatory if you are satisfied with your grade) I didn't use the Textbook even though he said the textbook was required because what we needed to know was on the slides that were presented in class. Recommended",1
"I'll give you an honest critique. The professor is okay at best. He can be funny at times, but I would stay away from him altogether. The class content is bland, he's bland, it's a horrible combination, snore-fest. Class is v difficult, you will have to work your ass off for an A, to get a C, you can get by half-assing it. Stay away please.",0
GREAT LADY!!!!! So helpful you won't believe it. More than a teacher she felt like my friend throughout every counseling session. She really has an awesome and helpful personality.,1
"Stoner is a funny guy but his voice will put you to sleep. BUT GOOD NEWS... he gives his students all the tests back with correct answers at the end of the year so go look on note swap and every quiz, test, and essay question are waiting for you. Bad part is attendance is a must because you have in class quizzes every day",0
"difficult class, but he is an awesome prof and will make you think!! excellent class to take!",1
"She cares and she knows her stuff that's all that matters if you care she cares Cliche, but you get what you give  I recommend her to anyone taking mkt research",1
I am taking his asynchronous class and it is going very well. His videos on YouTube are very helpful. If he makes mistakes he will not penalize the class for it. For our first test it was hard to finish because of the time limit. So when he graded it he dropped some of the questions. So never worry that he will not grade fairly. Hw is on webassign.,1
"Asynchronous, does review once a week of the chapter we read(optional). Weekly quizzes (pre quiz & post lecture quiz) on Cengage. 2 midterms & 1 final, really hard tests. Professors accent is hard to understand.",1
Great professor! Class is fun and you learn a great deal on current topics.   He gives study guides which help too. I'd for sure take this teacher again,1
"I took his class based off of the reviews... wouldn't do it again. You can easily get a C if you dont do anything and you just want to pass. He does boost your grade if your on the edge and his E.C. will get you the next letter grade, otherwise i couldn't EVER understand a word he said and i basically had to try to teach myself the whole course.",0
"One of the best classes I have ever taken. If given the opportunity, take a Drake class. He will make you think in ways you never have before. I have my criticisms but overall it was more than worth taking. It is a bit difficult, but your mind will grow. Do the extra seminar if you want to get to know some very smart people.",1
"Mary is Great!  Very helpful, easy-going and encouraging.  She made Eng 240 fun and interesting.",1
Too much sass. Very disrespectful. she made one of her students cry. Shows no remorse. Speaks in 3rd person. worst accounting teacher  ever. look somewhere else or you will get the worst time of your life.,0
My first essay was a B+ and no matter how much I went to the Writing ctr I get the same grade wc is frustrating she's really nice and kind you have to participate in class and AVOID being late bc she doesnt like it the only thing w/her is w her esay instructions its quite confusing and no matter how you change the roughdraft its the same grade,0
"She is really sweet. I have statistics with her, which is obviously a lot of work, but she makes it as easy as possible. Lectures are very thorough so its easy to understand the material. I took Stat at community college and it was way harder than Dr Reiser-Danners class",1
"She is a very nice teacher, does not put up with rude behavior. Her class was tough, I personally do not recommend her. Majority of the class failed, go to main campus more options. She makes you work in groups a lot. Try your best to keep up and get your book as soon as possible. Midterm  take home, Final  take home or in class(less questions)",0
She is a good teacher. I would take her again.,1
Very difficult for Sociology One.  Gives 6 papers and weekly readings that are more than 60 pages long.  On top of that gives assignments and visit to museum and have to write on those as well.  The readings consume you along with the papers for a level one course.  I would not recommend this teacher,0
"FSE intro to engineering easy class, he has an accent but its not a problem, you dont need to go to the lecture to learn. grades leniently",1
"I just took her online Nutrition class this past summer. I liked having everything available and ready from the first day of the course. She has some videos with instructions available to everyone which I thought was very useful. I suppose someone who has not taken an online class ever before can become overwhelmed, the course is meant for all.",1
She's super sweet and the course was an easy GPA booster.,1
"Lots of reading, but that is generally true of all Econ 101 classes. Overall great professor!",1
"Mr Wildman is the best. Take him if you can, you won't regret it.",1
If you have the availability to take this class online I highly recommend it. This class was one of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken. The professors dosen't count attendance as a grade but takes points off if you aren't there. He has a really snappy attitude and expects you to lead the lecture along with him. Worst class ever.,0
He is a wonderful person but as a teacher he is not as good. He gives a lot of notes so be ready to write. His only grades is tests. Although he drops one they are all very hard. He gives study guides and tells you what to study for but most the time what he tells you study is only a few questions where as what he says not to study is all over it.,0
"Raquel is a cool person, and she says she gets our busy lives outside of class, but her workload says otherwise. What kind of class puts a quiz with 3 hours of information to study for on the same day as a speech? c'mon now, lol nah. Take this class only if you know you have time to put in all of the work for the quizzes. Whats up summer school?!",0
Enjoyable class.,1
"He's a laid back guy with a lot of experience, which he is always willing to share. Don't be fooled though, the exams can be tough. Got a 99 on the first one, a 40 on the second. A reasonable class over all  - not an easy A, but it won't kill you either. He was very empathic about my second test grade and really encouraged me to work harder.",1
She is so sweet. I loved her class. I highly recommend taking her. ,1
"Favorite professor in first semester of college. Easy to talk to, really cool, and great sense of humor. 3 hour class never really went all the way to end. Always given five minute break. Did not always just lecture, gave group work. Reasonable paper grader just do APA format right (Its literally given points) Personally found tests a bit tough",1
"Dr. Jones helps inspire students as writers looking to make a difference in the community and is extremely helpful in every way. She cares about each individual student dearly and see great potential in everyone. The class was fun, if you chose a topic you were seriously passionate about. I would take any other classes she teaches here at BSU.",1
"Out of all my classes I have taken overall, this has been the most disappointing. The overall course setup is very unclear and the lack of explanation on assignments leaves you guessing on what needs to be done. Every test period she was absent from, and the syllabus was changed 5 times and still the final two weeks of class were left ""TBD"".",0
"He is mad boring...it's like watching paint dry..hes a nice guy, but hes an accountant not a teacher so he just tells you how it works instead of teaching it to you..",0
"Easily one of the best professors I've had! She knows her material, is funny, & gets everything graded with feedback for assignments you do (which helps a lot). I had a crazy schedule in a few classes I took with her last semester and she was great at working with me & emailing me back for any questions I had. Take her classes!",1
"She rambles about her personal life most of the time. Pay attention enough to answer correctly and she lets you do what you want. She doesn't answer questions well at all, so you're probably better off getting a tutor.",0
"I am happy that the previous writer on this list has received help from him. However, this is far from the truth, and if the new students will come in his classroom with that mindset they are in for a rude awakening. Just do not take his class, and you'll make yourself a favour.",0
"I took speech with her over 10 years ago. I'm back to warn those of you who are nervous about speaking in front of others. I suggest you find another professor. She never offered any kind support, in fact, she actually created more anxiety causing situations. It almost seemed, to me, as though she enjoys watching people suffer.",0
"Grades distributed to be 50% from 2 midterms and 50% from a final. Medians for both midterms in the 50s, and curves the final median grade to a C+. Every lecture was on multiple or one huge proof, and hopefully you're lucky and study the right ones that are on the midterm/final. No practice tests or hints of what would be on the tests. Confusing.",0
Stockton's philosophy 101 class is a hoot. He makes things fun and interesting as well as provoking interesting questions and ideas. He's a really nice guy and the class is very easy to pass if you just show up.,1
"Took her for fall 2019, got an A. Would really recommend this teacher. As long as you do your work & what she asks youll pass her class with an A. This isnt a hard class, shes a really nice professor just be ready to give speeches.",1
"I thought she was a grear teacher, very helpfull and wants everyone to pass. i thought she was nice and taught well.",1
"hate this class! had tutor, read book, did online stuff and no help from her. learned more from outside group. Horrible teacher!",0
Mike does not like his students. He acts as though students are idiotic unless they know what he is thinking and he is incredibly disorganized. He has no idea what he wants from his papers and gives grades seemingly randomly. He has ruined my love for literature this class. Discussions are bland and boring and he gets annoyed easily.,0
"He is very VERY easy going. The class is more of a think tank where you share your ideas AND GET CREDIT FOR IT. He understands life happens and will give extensions as long as you have a good reason. If I could I would use him for all my classes. If you have the chance to take him, I would recommend him.",1
"Spends a majority of the class ranting on about his own personal opinions and beliefs, has ZERO written explanations on how to do well in his class, will grade poorly for doing anything outside of what he demands but wont tell you all his demands, insulted every member of class no matter skill with no instruction on how to do better. Condescending.",0
Makes math extremely hard. If you want to know how to do the problems you need to rely on the book. He doesnt give extra credit or let you make anything up. He will also grade things very tough and doesnt care how you do on anything. He is also hard to contact at times and will not reply on occasion. Seems like a nice person but not a nice prof.,0
"Best professor in the English department. He obviously cares about his students and made the course fun, interesting, and important. I would argue this class was the most informative American Lit course I have ever taken. His hair is fantastic and he's hilarious. Take him if you can!!",1
Do not take any of her classes. I am in FAMS 160 with her and she is so unorganized and never gives clear directions. She never tells us ahead of time when we have projects or tests and does not follow the syllabus. She also does not have any clear grading criteria and her tests are horrible.,0
He is funny and full of energy.,1
Hate English classes but he managed to get me through it. Very little homework (Matter of a few essays in the span of a quarter) and have to read sometimes for class prep.,1
"I decided to drop her class after the first half of the first semester. Her class may be ""easy,"" but she is such a boring teacher-she reads straight from her notes. She gets WAY off topic WAY too much. It was rather dull at times, and I don't recommend this class for anyone unless you absolutely LOVE history.",0
"Great professor, real world application",1
"TAKE another professor even if you have to wait for next semester. I devoted at least 6-8 hrs daily on chem. You teach yourself. Tests are not similar to worksheets/quizzes as she says. Tests are specifically structured to confuse & throw you off track, no matter how much you study, even switches the periodic table day of exam.",0
"This class met once a week for about 3 hours or so. He spent each time playing music while talking over it trying to describe which genre the music belongs to but Its incredibly hard to memorize which genre a song aligns to when he talks over it the whole time. Some of his teachings are outdated and when you try to correct him, he gets mad",0
Interesting course,1
"Sociology of Aging. I did not like the way the course was set up.  We had to read 1 chapter and write a discussion each week during the semester so there was not much thought going on in the class.  Also, beware that your final may be given to you during the last week of classes and need to be completed within 5 days so manage your time.",1
"Great teacher and nice person. Readings can be a bit existential and hard to understand, but grading is not too hard.",1
He is a very sweet teacher. He very quiet and shy. Attendance isnt mandatory for lecture or recitation. Make sure you go to lab though. Weekly hw but he opens them up at the end of the semster if you miss one. He also gives all his test online but the final is in class. I love him and would totally recommend,1
"Kathy is a tough grader. She refuses to give out A's even if she loves your papers. I didn't learn anything in her class, yet she expects you to be an amazing writing. I want to be taught, and she isn't doing it. ",0
"Professor is extremly knowledgeable. However, it is difficult to ignore his arrogance/attitude. Calls on you to share your opinion, then proceeds to cut you off and not finish your thought while telling you your opinion is wrong. Learned alot in the course but couldn't stand the professor.",0
Very Very Very DIFFICULT! I would not recommend her at all! She is a smart ass and does nothing but sit in her chair and read from the book. She expects us to know very little details from page long poems which is nearly immpossible! Just take someone else...,0
This man clearly does not use a learning plan to prepare for his lectures. Time and time again he will awkwardly asks questions that have nothing to do with the material and google things for the whole 2 hour period. Sobie is also very unclear about what will be on the exams or quizzes and when they will be. Dont take him!,0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
"Professor is nice, kind, and informative. however shes not on time with anything, always adjusting her schedule of the syllabus changing dates for assingments due. talks about her jobs and is constantly asking for feedback which pushes time back for assignments due. Heavy grader for a class to improve for poor writing. DONT TAKE HER!",0
She is one of the best teachers I have encountered at UT. She is willing to reteach things that are unclear and relates material to everyday life. Whenever I have to take a science class I hope she is teaching that course. She is funny. Her notes are exactly what is on the exams. If you pick another teacher over her you are making a huge mistake.,1
"His exams are tricky. There are only 22 multiple choice questions per exam. You need to study the slides carefully, read the chapters thoroughly and take your own notes to get an A. During your presentation, he will ask you questions out of no where so be prepared and know your companies well. He's not very helpful outside or inside the classroom.",0
"Great class. He's a former mayor of Philadelphia and City Council President, so he knows a lot about local government. He doesn't assign much homework, and what he does assign is just a certification that you read something. He does tend to go off on tangents, but they're interesting. Budget simulation at the end of the semester is fun, but hectic.",1
"I don't know what this guy gets out of ruining your GPA and making this class 100 times harder than it is, but he just loves it. Will not help you in any way shape or form. Worst class of my life.",0
She is very clear about her knowledge and  note was very helpful for exam. she gives out tons of extracredit and she gives out what will be on exam. reason why I got A- is because I did not study enough...,1
"Dr. O'Gorman is a great Prof. These older ratings of him from nearly 10 years ago bring his grade down, but it is evident he has become one of the better PLS professors at MC. His tests are a lot of writing, but if you study, it's a great chance to make great grades.",1
"Be ready to dive into the readings! They are absolutely mandatory, and you will be lost if you do not read them. Especially when it comes to the tests, since the questions are not obvious ones. But overall, a nice, very interesting professor.",1
boooooo brian,0
Worst professor I ever took this semester  she's disorganized and confusing ended up getting a D in her class BIG MISTAKE!!,0
I graduate from this program in 2014 and just had to come back to mention that 3 years later and I still resent this man and his attempt at teaching.,0
all you do is read the textbook. the lecture are SOOO short and no help at all. I was really disappointed by this class.,0
"Really tough, not super helpful in office hours. Takes off unnecessary points",0
"Pay attention to the questions he asks in class, and on field trips... understand the question as much as the answer",0
Great teacher. Very clear about what I needed to do to get a good grade. Very helpful if you ask. Some chances for extra credit. He needs to teach A&P 1+2.,1
"I highly suggest for everyone who wants to take Int. Algebra I & II to other professors unless if your schedule is fixed. No mymathlab needed. Though he has a sense of humor and shares his personal stories as he lectures us, I don't like his real attitude when he did me a favor, like erasing a whiteboard. I don't deserve to be treated that way.",0
I think I learned more watching grass grow than being in this class. As an objective person I think his methods of teaching are a complete waste of students valuable time. All we would do is listen to other people's opinions on irrelevant topics. He is also a pretty lazy grader. Lacks constructive criticism and when he does it's a few sloppy words,0
Peter Daley has become one of my favorite teachers.  He has a fun and interesting class.  There are 4 tests and the last test is your final.  the homework is related to exactly what he says in class.,1
She is such a hard grader and is inconsiderate . If you come even 5mins late to class when an assignment is due you will get a zero. Her teaching isn't bad. Gives a lot of handouts,0
"Great professor! Very interesting; obvious that he really cared about the subject (novels from the modern period) and the students. Gave a variety of assignments which really helped to learn the material in different ways, leading to deeper learning. Very fair grader, and always willing to help if you need it. Gave extensive and helpful feedback!",1
"I took BIO203 with Professor Ba and he's an excellent professor that will give you the tools to study hard and his lectures are really worth paying attention to when the first exam is coming up. His exams require paying close attention to details and knowing and memorizing the answers, there is no room for cheating and skipping class.",1
"Hard to understand sometimes (English is her second language) and can be a very difficult class as she moves very very fast expecting you to learn all of the new chapter's vocab in one night. I had to get a tutor, if Spanish is hard for you I wouldn't recommend her but she is very nice and does care about her students learning.",1
Ms. Bland is a very good teacher. I really enjoyed her class.,1
"Terrible professor. Only professor that offers the management specific courses, and they're all online. I wanted to take in person. I know what you're thinking, online is easier right? Absolutely not. He makes them so hard in that he grades everything so tough. TONS OF WORK. Then he gives exams that are so hard and cover 4 chapters at once.",0
"I took her online nutrition class. Really easy! Every exam and quiz has no time limit and you can take each exam twice. If you have a question though, don't expect too much help. She often refers back to notes or asks you to google it. Rarely had any questions though. Course was very easy. Make sure your grammar and spelling is correct though!!",1
Professor O'Donnell is the reason why I can confidently public speak. People hear about her class being extremely difficult and dreadful -- that is not the case at all. I had so much fun in her class. Just follow her guidelines for speeches (easy to do) and you will get an A.,1
This course has been the most difficult class Ive ever taken However max is funny and caring prof even though he doesnt look it The labs in this course were BRUTAL and the midterm was equally bad(46% Ave after curve) the exams need to be more fair he should also consider gives us a heads up on what is explicitly gonna be tested.,0
She is a very lazy teacher. Did not respond to questions in a timely manner. Takes forever to grade her papers. Makes you write an 8 page research paper (APA Style).,0
"Lady expects us to write a 15 page law school policy brief in 2 days. We would have had more time to think about it and write it, if not for her disorganized teaching style and procrastination! She procrastinates so much and never keeps to her promise. Its really hard to keep up with the class because of her.",0
"You need to go to class & review lectures to understand. It seems easy, but his questions require you to know it to perfection. Exams aren't easy, but not impossible. LOTS of point opportunities (i clickers, quizzes, hw, problem sets) that you NEED earn... those will balance out poor test scores. Go to TA office hours and study everyday",1
"I took her because a couple of my friends had her last semester and really liked her. Semester started off kind of slow but then got better. She's pretty chill, knows a lot about the subject and will answer questions. Overall good class",1
He talks very low and monotone which makes it hard to concentrate on what he is saying. He does try to explain but his explanations are hard to understand at times. All homework is online which could be annoying.,0
"There were 30 students in the beginning of the class and two weeks later there's only 7 students. Most students dropped because of the workload and it was so bad that the department head noticed and made her talk with us on how to fix the class. If you want to read a lot of useless text and fail a class, then you should take this class. Don't do it",0
"I don't know if it's Covid or what, but this semester has been a disaster. She doesn't return emails or check in with students for WEEKS. The quizzes are filled with mistakes that she refuses to fix and sent a defensive email when she received feedback about it. Classes are poorly organized. I got more out of my interactions with peers than her.",0
"So I liked the course content even though there'too much reading. Good news! Pop quizzes aren't hard at all. Professor A looked unapproachable and she was sometimes harsh with students. I don't recommend this class, the content was great! but the vibe was just not right.",0
"This guy teaches the class as if we're professional accountants. He moves way too fast, tip-toes around ?'s when u ask them, he is very stuck up and condesending. The material is hard enuff without this fat idiot speeding thru the material and making u feel like an idiot when u ask ?'s. He also sweats alot during class,do yourself a favor AVOID HIM",0
I took 2 Real Estate classes with Professor Lawson. Weekly discussions were interesting and helped to learn the material. I highly recommend his classes.,1
When i emailed her my questions about course material i never received an email back.. and she went on rambling about side stories a lot.,0
"If you put effort into the assignments and read all the material, you will do well in Prof. Lawrence's classes. Since I took an online class I didn't have much interaction with him, but his comments were always helpful. In general, it's frustrating that BYU makes contacting your prof directly virtually impossible, but that's the school's fault.",1
"He assigns homework every night and although it is easy, it is extremely pointless and repetitive. During class, he will call on you and challenge you. Also, he is an extremely hard grader its very difficult to get 100%. Before you can turn in an assignment, you have to visit the writing center. Take this class with a friend, you do peer reviews.",0
"Dr. Lawrence is incredibly kind and considerate, and I think he's a good teacher. He knows what he's talking about, and he's open minded. However, this class is tough. It's a ton of work, and I feel like I missed a lot of good information from the readings because I felt rushed. I liked the content--there was just too much of it.",1
Easy A if you do your weekly online quiz and short reflection. One project and it is a super easy A on the assignment. Should definitely take this class for an easy A. Make sure you check to see if there is an activity to see whether you NEED to go to class.,1
"Kids on here complaining about having to memorize site locations and artifacts... its an archaeology class! She has a wealth of knowledge and is more than willing to elaborate on things if you ask. This course isn't an ""easy A"", that makes some arts students mad. Pro tip: show up, listen and take pictures of figures, you'll get an A, guaranteed!",1
When she lectures you'll have zero clue what she's talking about. She will go rant about anything she feels like and its not related to Sociology at all. As long as you show up for attendance points and print out material she emails out for exams you'll be fine. It's an easy A but I don't understand how she's a professor at YSU.,0
He gave no one in the class an A.,0
"Heavy workload. I've always loved my Spanish Professors, but she was something else. Very difficult to communicate with, very harsh grader, very abrasive. I didn't feel like language learning was the priority; pure academics was. New languages are difficult and unless you have an excellent knowledge of the Spanish Language, be cautious.",0
Professor Draper is extremely organized and insightful. She always meets with students and tries to understand any situation they might have going on. The lectures are amazing and she lets students incorporate their thoughts and opinions. The people who gave her a low rating did not do the homework and missed class.,1
"Dr. Kim is a nice, funny person, but her teaching is difficult to follow. She rushes through slides, spends lots of time writing mechanisms but that's only 13 of the test. First day she told us that if you make a C or higher in her class, you're doing well. Tried multiple times to meet up with her, but she never made an effort. Avoid if possible.",0
"Dr. Isenberg is a kind, funny, and easy going professor who will work with you and answer questions or concerns. Content heavily neuroscience based, so if you are not a psychology major it may be hard. The class lecture is based off power-points, but are not uploaded into canvas so be sure to take notes. There are no study-guides for quiz/test.",1
"If I could give this professor a zero rating, I would. He has absolutely no care in the world for his students and if you go to him with personal concerns he will send your email to the entire class and then tell you to drop the class. STAY AWAY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. He tends to ramble and not actually stay on track to what he's teaching.",0
"She seems like a nice person during lecture, but I emailed her for help on something and she was so rude to me... I would think that someone who has dedicated her life to teaching would be a little nicer about doing her job.",0
No Comments,1
"She is my favorite professor. She is extremely understanding and caring. Just pay attention in class, participate, and take good note and it will be an easy A! I really wish I could take another class with her.",1
"I really did not like this class. I use to love history, but after this class I dont know if i'll ever take another history class at oregon. She says if you know the answers to the questions in the beginning of her lecture slides you'll be fine but her questions are super broad and on the test they are very very specific.",0
I'm currently in this class and it was a big mistake. Teacher goes off topic the whole time. At first its funny but it gets uncomfortable. Have no idea how the exam is going to go and i find learning in this class is difficult to grasp because there is not much emphasis on it. Please do not take this class. Learn elsewhere.,0
Crazy hard grader. Reported everyone for plagiarism for no reason. DONT TAKE,0
He is the BEST!!! TAKE HIM! SIMPLE! He makes Math easy and fun!!! Def recommend this guy.  Also hes crazy funny!,1
"Its a Math class, so theres lots of homework. thats just part of the deal. But she teaches in a very clear, easy to understand way, and gets things graded fairly quickly. I really enjoyed the class and i would love to take more of her courses.",1
"She is a great professor , Took english 1102 online with her she is amazing , extremely helpful , she always emails me back and looks over work if you send it in early. She clarifies very well and her assignments are reasonable . Take her if you can you will not regret it!",1
barely passed this class. She is very strict with attendance and will mark you late even if you were late for 2 minutes.,0
"Show up to class and take notes, the classwork is easy with good group members so pick your group wisely, study guides are allowed on tests and they are on canvas from day 1 so do them in advance, and take advantage of EVERY homework extra credit! Start working on the business presentation with your group in advance to save headache at the end.",1
"Dr. Ramey was a very effective lecturer. I expected to learn the basics about each ""world religion"" but he set the class up in a much different way. While you do learn about many different religions, the class is more focused on analyzing others representations of those religions. An easy class, as well as a good class. Dr. Ramey was awesome!",1
"Zeng is a pretty nice person, but english isn't her first language so occassionally it was confusing when she said certain words. But the class is kinda tough. She does curve and give extra credit but she doesn't do that great a job teaching us material.. she was my only option for this course",0
"Really nice guy...you can stop by his office any time and he will go over the material with you until you understand it.  He is energetic and funny during class, but never calls anyone out. He is not strict about tardiness, but does take attendance daily.  If you take notes and pay attention you will do great.  HINT: make flashcards to study with!",1
"This was, hands down, my favorite class to attend. Catherine is super passionate and knowledgable about the class topic and so much more. There is a lot of reading but it is absolutely worth finding the time to do the readings. She's supah caring and made transitioning to online learning a breeze. Also, she has two really cute cats.",1
"Dr. Ingram is a good man, that I will not argue. However, his lectures can be hard to follow and contain a strong bais in favor of his own political views. If you disagree with those views in your essays, you may not do as well as others.",0
Very very vague assignment instructions. I had no idea what I was doing the entire time in this course. It was mandatory for me but his classes are not mandatory don't take them! He is also really quiet and zones out a lot. He does not explain anything in class or on paper.,0
"I took this class using my math lab so it was essentially a hybrid class. He cared about you learning anything and he would always ask if we had questions. The tests were easy if you did the work. But, his grading technique is super confusing... I would definitely take this professor again. He is really nice.",1
"Very hard,does not give no breaks do not take his class,he does not give feedback. You will fail his class!!",0
"Nice guy, lousy teacher. Get ready to fly through powerpoints, watch a bunch of JMP tutorials, and do random assignments and busywork.",0
fantastic lecturer,1
"Extremely tough when grading tests and quizzes. If a student makes one mistake, all work following it is worth 0 points.",0
"please do not take this class. mostly just laugh about random stuff in class, may be funny but highly inappropriate and does not pertain to class. the laughs are not worth it. this class is not worth it. take your money and time to a teacher who will actually teach and you can learn. you get a study guide but it's lengthy and you are on your own.",0
"HE DOES NOT CURVE. 4 lengthy and involved questions on each exam and his partial credit is a joke. Not allowed to bring a formula sheet. The Class average was 40 both on exams before I dropped. He has admitted to having only two people pass before. He marks homework as ""ok"" easy padding to your grade,but it tells you nothing useful. Avoid.",0
She is really sweet and caring. She is strict certain times but that's reasonable. Gave us extra credit at the end. Always easy to get contact. Tries her best to give us all the things we should get for course. Lovable.,1
He was no real help even when I specifically emailed him for assistance. This was a very frustrating and stressful class. I have no idea if it would even be better taken as a non online course.,0
The weekly quizzes are unfair and nothing like the homework. You spend an average of 4 hours on homework a week. She is not a good teacher and doesn't explain the material well. Just a bad teacher. Avoid her unless you can teach yourself accounting and have a lot of free time in your schedule. ,0
"Its a summer writing class so its def going to seem like a ton of writing. Ive take class with her during the year too and it's also a lot, but spread over a semester doesnt feel so overwhelming! Anyhoo, she really does want you to become a good writer, so if you make an effort, she'll really help you! Also, she's really friendly and funny!",1
"Very poor instructor. Classes consisted of confusing slides and even more confusing explanations. She seemed very disinterested in the material covered. If you read the books and decipher the slides, you'll pass.",0
"Ms. Hutton is knowledgeable about SpEd, but seems to have another agenda...not sure what. She is impersonal, unapproachable, and has a chip on her shoulder. Her appearance is questionable, with unprofessional and unkempt clothing.Also, reading from ppts is not a teaching method.  HCC should take a closer look at this...she is a real turn-off.",0
"Poor professor. Spent the whole semester coming to class and having him ramble for 40 out of the 50 minutes, then try to cram some incomprehensible analysis of whichever book we were currently reading into the last few minutes. Semester project was basically busywork with no guidance, and he refused to give a clear answer, even during office hours.",0
"I attended Prof. Ross' class in 1994 and I have never been as engaged, reflective and verbal in class. He is simply the best teacher I've had and our discussions continued on train 4 downtown after classes. Since then I've taught and become a professor myself, but I'm nothing like Prof. Ross in class. I wish to thank him and recommend him.",1
Anitori was an awesome professor! Loved his lectures and his accent! Explains microbiology in a way you will understand and has a sense of humor. Gives lots of extra credit so take it. I also had him in lab and it was the best lab I have ever had. He is a lot of fun but you will need to work for your A. Just study for the test and you will be fine,1
Angie has the most entertaining lectures I've ever been to. If you're a frosh in HK you have to take her for the intro class and it is the best. Her class is entertaining and interesting but I wouldn't call it 'easy'. She is also a hot af so take that as an excuse to go to every class.,1
"Professor Dixon is a great teacher, but she is a tough grader. She grades on a 7 pt. scale, so she expects a lot from you. Don't procrastinate on anything. Seriously. Your grades will reflect it, and don't be late to class. If you put forth the effort and do the work, you'll learn a lot.  Earning an A isn't too difficult.",1
Awesome teacher. Explains really well. Laid back but makes sure the students get the topics he's teaching.,1
"I've never failed a course until I took this class. I know at least 6 others who failed, and not for lack of trying either. Early in the term I expressed concern for my grade, and he just told me to drop the class, pick another major. He grades tests and essays on an unbelievably hard scale.  I no longer even want to major in psychology.",0
"She is probably one of the top 5 best professor at Westfield State. Not only is she super ultra helpful and gives reasonable but helpful assignments, but she does not favor students and does not say or do anything that will irritate or rub the student the wrong way. ATTENTION ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS MAJORS! Take her, take her, take her!!",1
"There is quite a lot of reading, but Li gives amazing feedback and cares for the students! Loads of extra credit! The textbook is online and is quite the money saver. Make sure to read and watch all material early so you can get a head start on the assignments. The assignments are hefty with 600 words each. The grade you earn is what you work for",1
"This is the most failed class in the Education department here. Her tests are 100 questions and after the first test she will sit down and say ""now you see you can't study for my test you just have to know it."" I believe she said she was retiring this year though so good luck!",0
"There are a lot of homework assignments and quizzes. You can self-teach; watching video lectures is unnecessary. I received a C because I am not strong in math and did not take this class as seriously as I should have. As long as you put in the effort and do all assignments, you will do well. Some quizzes, homeworks, and poppers are dropped at the end.",1
"Awesome, fun laid back teacher. Made classes fun. Bring him chips!",1
If you LOVE plants this class is a lot of fun! Krings won't learn your name but he is a walking encyclopedia and he has a quirky sense of humor that's adorable. Get ready to memorize A LOT. It is not an easy class but very interesting. He is very soft spoken and only gets loud about plants.,1
"This was by far the best experience I have had in college. Professor was knowledgeable, efficient, and sweet. Graded faster than lightning speed. Light coursework, brief assignments, and discussion boards. East tests. Lots of extra credit offered. Take her!!",1
"The class has about 12 labs, run by a different TA for each week. The lectures before the labs were very dry. Make sure you read the lab manuals to complete lab reports. The final exam was extremely difficult and no one expected it. Know everything about everything if you want to do well on the final and get an A in the class.",0
75% of the semester was her having us get in groups and Google the answers to topics ourselves. She doesn't use PowerPoint and talks way to fast and quietly. Hard to follow her and shows up late a lot but takes attendance.,0
"So far throughout my academic career this is by far the worst professor I've EVER had. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He targets students who slightly question him in class. When you ask about your grade in the class he won't tell you how you're doing, he doesn't lecture clearly in class, he's petty. This isn't a challenge, its impossible. Don't waste your time.",0
final exam worth 50% of your grade. Was rude to students who asked questions.,0
in my opinion she really isn't clear on what she wants from your discussion board post or essays until she has gave you your terrible or good grade. very good communication lots of reading and lectures fail a test and your grade will drop like a bad habit.,0
No Comments,0
Really tough quizzes are extremely difficult ,0
"Prof Gilbert is a great prof. I only came to class because he made it and the topics so interesting.  His slides are great so we dont' ""scramble like rabbits!"" His jokes and time for discussion are great! we talked about everything related to tlbg2spirit etc. best part was when we had a ""guest speaker"". :)",1
"Total Recommend anyone take this class with the Professor. She is understanding and helpful to those who do not understand the material. To those who are retaking the class like myself, this is definitely the professor to take it with.",1
"She's not a bad teacher exactly, but she isn't clear on what she wants. She does cancel class sometimes and isn't specific about what answers she wants on exams. I think I'm doing well in the class, but she's very hot and cold depending on the day. There are only a few writing assignments, but the exams are difficult. Participate and it's fine!",0
HORRIBLE got a D in the class. When you ask questions he tells you look in the book doesnt bother to help. pop quiz when he feels no one is participating doesnt even tell you what to study or focus on for the exam. terrible professor doesnt care for the students.,0
Terrible! Completely chaotic class meetings. Discussions are not guided. Most unpleasant class meetings I've experienced. Expectations unclear. Opportunities to excel are few. Just take something else instead.,0
My adviser would not let me drop the class. All he did was rant about conspiracies and the government. He briefly went over material before announcing that we had a test on it the next class. I love music and he made me hate the class. I was extremely disappointed that he gets paid to not teach.,0
"Nice enough guy and knowledgeable but extremely hard to learn from him in an organized way.  He jumps around, and often forgets from class to class what was covered in previous class so likely missing something.  He talks so fast you cant take notes.  And we dont know what we need to know or not know.  Is all over the place.  Should be easy. Not.",0
Did not like her class at all. I had her class last semester and when she would teach she would go off topic and talk really slow. she is rude and reads off of her powerpoints. she does not give out reviews for tests.,0
"Overall this is an easy online course no deadlines but there is tons of reading easy midterm and final, I would take this class again. But if you like multiple choose exams and no papers this is not the  online class for you. You will be required to write papers in this class. The text book is cheap and he provides the rest of the readings.",1
"Loved her, but she was really unorganized, which was her only flaw.",1
He is the best math teacher I could ever get. He knows we have life outside and always helps with assignments. He is quick at replying emails. Very funny and helpful professor. I will highly recommend this class.,1
Took her for ENG 1A as well. Grace Ebron best professor ever! .She encourages students to think critically and answers questions clearly.  As long as you do the work you will succeed.,1
The best professor I've had yet. Very helpful and clear when questions were asked. She's flexible and provides students with many resources in order to pass the class.,1
"Great professor who actually cares about his students. He connects his lectures well to the real world and makes content easy to understand. Tests are a bit tougher than other journalism classes and only have about 30 questions, so not much room for error. You can make up for it by doing the extra credit though.",1
Raja is a little difficult to understand in class. She is passionate about Finance but very quick teacher. She tries to please everyone and be helpful! She gives attendance points. At the end of the semester she bumps your grade up a bunch. Don't drop and she will pass you!!!,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN FOR STOR435. JUST DON'T DO IT YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN AND HE GIVES A HOMEWORK DUE EVERY CLASS PERIOD. He cares not at all about teaching this class,0
"He is a really nice prof, he really cares about every group and how their project is coming along. Every week he will check up on groups and gives good advice on how to plan and complete the project. He is clear and concise and a fair marker.",1
"Professor McCarthy was a really good instructor-- WRTG 106 is an accelerated freshman writing course, and I really felt that I was challenged to test my ability in the class.  Tough grader, but gives really helpful criticism in order to improve (which you can-- rewrites are offered!)  Would recommend her class. ",1
Did not seem to show much enthusiasm in teaching her class and gives large amounts of homework with out properly explaining the lessons clearly.,0
She is very helpful unlike other professors she wants you to pass.,1
"Easily the worst professor I've had at tech. I understand online school this quarter was a drastic change, but oh my. 100 question tests, 60 minutes, and HARD. 10 question quizzes, 5 minutes. Tries far too hard to exert an extreme amount of control, and came off as very untrusting and condescending. Incredibly hard class online this quarter.",0
"Yes, she's a great human being, but she's arguable the worst professor. She does not stick to the syllabus at all and is the most subjective grader there is. She doesn't allow for any creativity because it goes against her beliefs which I think is counterintuitive to an ethnic studies course. Almost impossible to get an A in unless you are her BFF.",0
"The class is easy, but the professor is kind of crappy. She will assign homework on a Sunday night at 11pm and want it done for your 9am class. But then she doesn't take off points for late homework? She curves the quizzes & tests a lot which helps. She only speak in french and always corrects your pronunciation. She randomly calls on you in class.",1
"May seem nice at first and then you realize that she only wants you to agree with her when she poses a in class discussion question, and can in fact be quite rude to students! I felt like she was a bit bias and unprofessional at times. Don't really recommend this class or prof if you don't like how profs are vague when they give a lecture.",0
"Passing Calc. 2 was not easy. But this guy made it possible. Yes, you are going to have a lot of homework, but he goes over everything you need to know. The weekly quizzes are a bummer, but helpful also. Just ask question and do your homework and you will be fine.",1
"This professor made things way too easy. His class wasn't challenging in the least. We hardly did labs and were dismissed early most of the time. Lectures were alright; he's good at simplifying complicated subjects. However, I didn't even spend one second studying for this class and I got an A. That's how easy it was!",0
"Incredibly arrogant and not helpful.  He is right and everyone else is wrong.  His point of view is contrarian and somehow common sense, but highly impractical in real world, which is a place Jagpal infrequently visits.  Rutgers needs a pure marketing class, this is not a marketing class at all - it's a management simulation class.",0
"She was very clear on assignments, the few times I didn't understand the assignment she was very fast to email back and help to solve the problem. Was easy for me to take, only because she was very descriptive and easy to understand. I defiantly took the skills she left me with and use them in life today!",1
"He is an awful professor. He is very condescending, very mundane and boring and makes you feel stupid for asking questions. Advisors and tougher professors alike dislike him and tell students to avoid him at all costs. He's simply not a pleasant man. He doesn't know how to teach students that aren't science majors and teaches them all like they are",0
"To pass this class, you absolutely NEED the textbook. And you better be prepared to do all the exercises she assigns because she randomly collects homework. She can be pretty confusing in her directions which makes it difficult to understand what she wants a lot of the time. She's very sweet but not my favorite professor ever.",0
"Professor who talks to students with respect. Dr. Brown is laid back and has a great attitude. Isn't afraid to crack jokes, but doesn't deviate from the material. I would recommend this Professor to anyone. It made me happy to come to class and engage. Doesn't go out of his way to make the material difficult, but makes it informing.",1
He is the best.,1
"Nice guy. Thick accent. Class was a waste of time. I only went to get extra credit for perfect attendance. Lectures were all powerpoint slides that he later posted online. DON'T BUY THE BOOK! It's not needed at all. If you can turn on a computer, you are probably overqualified for this class.",0
"not the greatest prof, if you work hard you will get a good grade.  You have to pay attention in class no skipping or sleeping.  A lot of work but if you have the time, then hes alrite",0
Favara is one of my favorite professors ever! She is kind & hilarious! Don't be afraid to speak up in her class because that makes for the most interesting discussions! She chooses a wide variety of texts for us to discuss. By being open minded & putting in the time to read you will definitely succeed in this course! Pay attention to readings!,1
"I have taken two of his classes now and I just signed up for a third, I think that says enough right there. He is a great math teacher who is extremely helpful and understanding. The workload is pretty decent but I put the difficulty as a 3 because there's videos to help with almost every question and he will respond promptly to emails.",1
"Good professor, explains things, good class",1
"I was completely lost.  Tests did not accurately reflect the homework.  You had to really understand the concepts (and I did not).  Tests were open notes/book, but it really didn't do much good.  I got a B because I randomly did well on one test, but I didn't learn anything.  My grade was pure luck.  Most of the dept. sucks so I guess he's alright.",0
"Dr. Atkinson is a great professor, mentor and all around good guy. Go to class! He is awesome! He is very helpful during office hours and really cares about his students. ",1
"what a joke. if you cant make it, teach technique out of a textbook",0
"The class wasn't organized at all. Discussions were largely unrewarding and boring. Few, if any, students knew when assignments were due because the syllabus had no relevant information. He made us travel to Orem by 8 am for the final, despite some of us working until 730 am and having no means of transportation. Orem's a 1.5 hour walk.",0
"He was never really organized. Last semester, he planned on covering at least 10 chapters but we ended up barely doing seven. He wasted a lot of time in class fully reviewing an example from the previous lecture or trying to get the microphone to work even though we could hear him fine without it.",0
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
"Not an easy course if you do not have a basic grasp on algebra. He has a specific style of teaching that worked well for me. Just goes through how to solve the problem and that worked for me. The homework is all online and easy to do but there is a lot of it. His grading criteria is easy, fair, and he tries to give every opportunity for success.",1
"Shartin is a really nice guy and always willing to help. Class is very difficult and hard to wrap your head around. However, if you go to at least 1 extra help session and he gets to know you, you will at least get a C. Was failing class and went to extra help for the final and ended up with a C+",1
Zein is probably the worst grader I have heard of. She shoots down questions in class and often rushes through classes in order to finish her lecture. Avoid getting her at all cost.,0
"this class was my least favorite class. the teacher is hot but that doesnt make up for the total lack of personality, he is so boring i wanted to shoot myself in the face every class. plus it is some dumb experimental math class where they give you a bunch of stupid word problems. would never do this class over again",0
"She was really cool, very understanding.A bit strict when it comes to grading papers. I would recommend her class.",1
"Gets offended by people not coming to class in a lecture with over 200 people. This is college, people shouldn't be punished in lecture courses. She does these industry exercises randomly in lecture throughout the semester so it keeps kids coming cause they dont know when they'll happen. First lecture I've never been able to use my phone or laptop.",0
"She can be a difficult grader but overall, this class was pretty easy to pass and still learn a lot. There is a lot of weekly work even though it is an online class so get ready to read and write a LOT more than you do in other classes. You also have to do a research paper which is more like a short 4 page informal paper than anything else.",1
"Mr. Johnson is a wonderful Professor. He cares about his students success, is very flexible, and gives lots of feedback. He gives clear instructions and gives students enough time to complete assignments. I highly recommend his class.",1
"She was great, I was having a rough term and she was very understanding and very helpful!",1
Stewart is very particular. He likes things to be very precise so when doing assignments or essays keep in mind that he wants you to be detailed--almost painstakingly so...,1
I wouldnt suggest taking him! He doesnt give any homework or quizzes! Your entire grade is based on 3 tests the entire semester.,0
"He is very knowledgable about Hawaiian language and wants the students to learn how to speak the way natives speak. You learn a lof of vocab, but each lesson is pretty much the same every day. I personally didn't like that all assignments were turned in online, because there was no follow up on whether it was turned in or not.",1
Nice woman cares lots but makes no sense and impossible to follow. For a gender studies class she was a very closed minded.,0
Jim is a great professor. He knows what he is talking about. Would highly recommend taking his class. I gained a lot of information from this course. One of my favorite professors last semester. He doesn't miss class hardly ever and if he does he will find a sub. Very reliable professor!!,1
"The class was basic in how to use Microsoft Word-2003. Attendance is expected, several projects are assigned, but they are not overwhelming. Book is needed for exercises. Very helpful, willing to assist in any way. Class can be a lot of fun with the right mix of students.",1
"If your goal is to learn something, dont take this class. If you dont want to talk you are screwed, and if you get the answer wrong get ready to be made fun of. Its her way or you get the question wrong. She adds too many steps to everything for no reason. Simplifying is no longer simple. More than 12 people dropped. You teach yourself.",0
"This guy is great. He is kind and willing to help. His accent is pretty strong, but it's okay because it's funny when he says ""disks."" The class is really easy but it's also interesting. Lenient with lab work and homework is online.",1
"His class lecture is always based off the readings so doing them is very helpful for your participation grade. He offered a lot of extra credit. Attendance is mandatory and it will hurt your grade to not show up. There is a lot of talking and presenting, so if you hate talking in Spanish I would not recommend this class. He also gives pop quizzes.",1
He is one of the best professors at Loyola. He is a clear and organized teacher and always willing to help.,1
"Steve was a very clear grader, and tends to grade more on the student's side. He always answered my emails very quickly. This was intermediate algebra, which I was just taking this to fill out my degree (I've gone up to Calculus and was looking for a break), so I didn't think the work was that hard. I also took Steve for Calc I, and he was helpful.",1
the most awesomest Acct Prof:D,1
this class is really easy you don't have to read any of the novels he gives you as long as your take notes in class. however his lectures are so boring you might fall asleep but overall the class is easy and the mid terms and finals are take home,1
"To put it simply, get ready to teach yourself Orgo Chem I and pray that the massive curve at the end of the course will save you. Only 4% of people in my 200+ section made A's.",0
"Dr. LaBelle is the best professor I've had at Chapman. I've taken 5 classes with her, and every time I left her class I felt smarter for being there. If you're struggling, visiting her in office hours will make all the difference as she'll take the time to break it down for you.",1
"Had orgo 2 with her in the summer, it went by really fast so you had to keep studying every day. It's a hard class but she tries to make it easy, gives lots of practice and the exams are what you expect. So much better than the professor I had the first half of the summer, wish I had her for orgo 1 too! Made the DATs a breeze!! Take her class.",1
"If you want to get an F take his class, Prof. Dhan makes you read a lot if you want to pass. If it's your first time taking physics at college you won't pass. IF YOU DONT SHOW UP YOU WONT PASS. I tried so hard to pass but I couldn't.",0
Great Prof! He's very clear and classes are interesting! Fun class,1
"The material on the exams are not based on understanding, but on stupid memorization.  He also injects his political and religious views into a chemistry class--no small feat.  He is extremely arrogant.",0
Worst teacher ever. Literally piles on and I mean PILES on the work. Test are timed in a short period so you get less then a minute on each question and she expects that to be normal. And these are problems you have to write out. Horrible. Do not take,0
"If you miss a lecture, you will be lost. He's really nice when you talk to him and ask him questions. The only problem for me was the group project as my group was not reliable at all and it was worth 40% of the grade. The TAs also have no idea what they are doing. You're lucky if you get a TA who marks according to the prof's instructions.",1
"Overall he is an okay teacher. He is somewhat unwilling to provide help to students, and he talks down to students. However, if you miss class everything is online. Personally, I have not enjoyed him as a professor.",0
"Jon is the best professor I had all semester. He gave fantastic feedback on all the essays I wrote, I earned 2-3 points of extra credit on all in-class writings, as well as all in-class work. I wrote 6 out of class essays, and no homework (except the usual discussion boards every week). He is an absolutely fantastic professor.",1
"She's your typical feminist lady who was raised during the civil rights movement.  Her study guides are easy and take a max of 2-3 hours a week. You literally don't have to go to the lectures, because she isn't going to teach you anything useful.   She believes citing sources are more important than actual understanding of the material.",0
she needs to stay on top of her grades she dosent seem to be able to get them in elearning.,1
"This professor is TERRIBLE. I have never seen a professor grade so harshly on DQs. On top of all of the homework I already have, he makes me stress about them. He is not considerate of personal issues going on in your life either. I would never take this class or professor again. I am a 4.0 student and he makes everything 10x harder with these DQs.",0
Dr. Kaur is one of the nicest and most enthusiastic professors you'll have at WPU. She is very passionate about her job. She will give you readings. Read them if you want to pass the class. They are short and simple. Class was not very demanding; it was relatively easy. Dont ever be late! She hates that. You will love her. Take her!,1
"If you study the test reviews and your notes, you will do fine on tests. If you have questions, be sure to ask them. He's very helpful and willing to help you out if you ask. He wants you to know the material and not just memorize things.",1
DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS OF COMS3001!,0
"One of the nicest professors I have ever had. She is so kind, so fair, and really wants to help you as much as possible. Her grading criteria is extremely clear. Some have been picky about her toughness on APA, but she is transparent about that and gives you all of the tools to help. Take her, seriously. She is really, really sweet.",1
"She's a great teacher and I had two of her classes in one semester which was surprisingly amazing. She makes the class fun and is super helpful if you talk to her about not understanding stuff. There's a quiz every week but she tells you what to study beforehand so really, just do the projects and you're solid. Super passionate about her subject.",1
Lots of reading in the class. There was one major paper which required a lot of background research. He enjoys engaging with the students during discussions and pushing us to think more critically. He grades fairly but tough so make sure you go over your papers multiple times.,1
"He seems like a brilliant physicist but unfortunately he is more concerned with making the class laugh or awe at his math prowess.  The book for this class doesn't seem to corrolate with the lectures, but I suppose I learned something.  I'm just glad I have Mohrman this semester.",0
To say I am a horrible math student is an understatement. I have struggled my whole life with math and have never had a teacher as caring as Tori Ryburn. She is extremely accessible outside of class and truly wants to help. She is very understanding and helpful. I am so fortunate to have had her this semester!,1
"As terrible at math as I am, Professor Conner was wonderful! She is so helpful and willing to help any student out. She does give a lot of homework, but it really helps you to master the material. I would definitely take her again!",1
"he's a nice guy, work oriented. i'm just a fanatic of the field. i just wish he would take interest in all aspects of teaching both inside and outside the cassroom. i've cried i've laughed and i'm still breathing for the moment. take care sir. opportunity knocks at the door, but my knocking seems futile. this sample has too many associated errors.",0
Best RCLS Hands-on Professor at ECU,1
He is not very caring,0
"Pros: Knows the content, Good at giving lectures, Replies to emails promptly. Cons: NO STUDY GUIDES! NO FEEDBACK ON EXAMS! (i.e. missed questions), 20%+ Fill-in-the-blank on all exams (Better know how to spell all your enzymes!). It is just cruel expecting a student to be able to do well in a medical-based class with those 3 cons combined.",0
"Great teacher! His lectures are like stories-interesting.You will write the entire class period,so be prepared for your hands to hurt. Make sure you write down everything he says. His tests consist of a little bit of everything in the notes, so study all of it. As long as you attend class, pay attention, and take notes you will definetly pass.",1
"I loved Pat McKean! His connections in the journalism world are incredible and we had some amazing people come in to talk to the class. There is a lot of writing outside of class as well as in-class assignments. But none of it is crazy long, and it's all straight forward. He gives great writing feedback. I recommend him!",1
"i took her summer class and so every week we did a report, and we had homework everyday. its sooper doable but you have to do all your assignment in order to keep your grade up. but shes very nice and very friendly and will make the class intresting.",1
"I'm normally not the type to be negative. I'm a hard working student and do my best. This wasn't an English class, more like Political. All our papers were on politics. She would spend endless time ""sharing"" her opinion. She gave me and another a C when he didn't even finish the paper and I only had 2 errors in five pages. I do not suggest. Awful.",0
"Six hours of class without a break. The scores of my assignments were almost same as my classmates, but I got C they got B or A-. He doesn't reply email or messages until the day of the class next week. I chose his class because he is the only professor in the summer.",0
His exam reviews are not helpful at all.  Yes there are only three test but there are so much information on those test they will drive you nuts. you expects you to know a lot of the stuff he is suppose to teach you.  If you need this class and there are other teachers teaching it I would try one of them.,0
Be careful of this emotionally manipulative person.,1
Good professor.,1
"Not clear with the syllabus. Does not hand back graded assignments. Skips through power points and says it will be posted on blackboard but never is. Is not willing to listen to students talk in class, kind of speaks over them.",0
Just gave the exam. Fair exam. Great prof who knows how to engage students,1
i was scared to approach her in the class ... the course work was very heavy shes a nice professor but that class was not for me,0
DO NOT TAKE HER this teacher is terrible. She grades homework but doesn't tell you what you did wrong just to look at the notes. The notes are no help just all letters with no descriptions. I've held a 3.5 GPA but not after this class. This is the only class I have failed or gotten below a C. SHE IS TERRIBLE!!! Better be ready to teach yourself!!,0
He's a legend at Penn State. Take this man and get ready to learn a lot.,1
"I had her for two different courses and she was the reason I stayed in school. She is the true definition of the word ""teacher"".  Without her I don't know where I'd be right now.",1
"She teaches really fast and when you don't understand something, she'll be like ""WHAT?  what DON'T you understand?""  A little confusing at times, but she'll help you.  A little short tempered.  Her tests are alright, no trick questions.  She emphasizes on the stuff that's going to be on the tests.  She makes you practice the problems a lot.",1
"Im really surprised at how low her rates are. Out of all the professors I've had she was one of the most inspiring. Unconventional, yes, but I learned a lot from her. I think being challenged to learn in different ways and to trust the process is important, and nobody does this better than her. If you let her, she'll change the way see the world.",1
Very nice as a non major it was a relief to not feel like the art I was putting out had to be as good as the rest of the class because she understood it isn't the same,1
"Very tough grader and very slow when it comes to getting a grade back from her. Not sure whether or not she should be teaching as she never says anything important. Also, don't skip class it counts against your grade if it wasn't for that I wouldn't attend class.",0
"First time prof at csusb. Hw is base off the lectures, the book isnt necessary. Her lectures are long but you receive alot of info on it inorder to do hw. She has quizzes everyday and starts and ends on the dot. You will have to purchase tophat. Tests are easy, she takes some q's off of the quizzes. Work hard you will do well. I barely studied.",1
She was unfair at grading and made the class a living hell.  I now HATE animation class and never want her as a teacher again.  Worse time of my life.  She is good but expects too much from you and the grading is unfair and bias.,0
Maybe online wasn't the best way to take this class. I still enjoyed it and he was easy to reach out to and gave the BEST feedback. Always willing to connect if you needed or wanted to. Tough grader on the essays but the rest was simple if you didn't fall behind.,1
"I do not why MAE dept kept Mook in this department. He basically refuse to provide bare minimum of the content of the course. On top that Mae 340 is a diffcult course. He literally recorded audio for this calculation heavy courses. It is a calculation heavy course, we need to see the math/calculation or order to understand the concepts.",0
"David is incredibley intelligent however not a good prof. Rambles, spends the first hour of lecture playing music videos, repetitive and monotone. The content has the potential to be so much more interesting. This course has really put me off from indigenous studies. However it's an easy A, attendance is not mandatory and marking is very lax.",0
"Lectures became really dry and boring a few weeks in. He also is hard to hear sometimes because he doesnt like to use the mic in class. writing assignments can seem lengthy for those that dont like to write, ranging from 10-15 paragraphs",0
"He is a great lecturer, really knows his stuff, and is super helpful. ",1
"Cant find the words that would be enough to thank her effort and i assure to my own if i gained any presentation skills then its her class, she hit the the right nail in the right spot, although i have not been graded yet, i am not hesistent to take further classes with her",1
"Super nice teacher. He's helpful, and funny. Just make sure you get to class on time and do your work(which is super easy) and you'll pass. Otherwise you're the problem, not him. I don't see how anyone can fail his class.",1
"This was the WORST college professor I have had in my life. I have been in school for years. I am currently going back to further my education. He made sexiest jokes (that weren't even funny), not allowed to drink water, can't wear a hat (not even in the winter), if he sees your phone, he will take your final grade down by one whole letter grade.",0
"He'd be fine for someone who is into reading, analysis, and writing detailed papers but I was really just out here tryna get my 102 credit. He's a good guy but his grading is pretty tough, his directions are so confusing, and you have to read so much of the textbook. So if you can, don't take him but if you're stuck it's not the end of the world.",0
"Absoultely hated this teacher. She does nothing for her students, all she talks about is her dog. She does not care if you pass or fail her class. She does not give any points for anything besides quizzes and tests. DO NOT take this teacher if you want to succeed.",0
First time teaching Photoshop CIS120. Used the book extensively.  Unsure of  how-to stuff.  He moved really fast and tried to please all the Photoshop pros in class instead of teaching an intro class.   I didn't learn much except for the book. Homework was fun so I think he will get  better with experience.,0
Nominally bad at giving feedback on papers and pop quizzes do not focus on the message the story is trying to convey. Grading is also inconsistent and does not give much in the way of feedback.,0
"I like Professor Duina's teaching style a lot, he always encourage student to participate in class and the homework assignment is really ON POINT and clear. Trust me you'll start to appreciate his teaching techniques after the semester ends.",1
"Had her as a chem recitation professor at Rutgers, & she was OK; But our professor had an emergency and couldnt lecture the class one day, so she did it. She teaches the lecture using powerpoint slides and goes so fast. Its rly hard to follow along with her! Shes kind of rude too. She makes thing unnecessarily hard and I really hated how she taught",0
No Comments,1
"I have mixed feelings about this professor. He's a really nice guy and is very accessible, but sometimes he can be unclear when explaining his lectures. Luckily, the lectures are posted so you can go back and review it. My only problem with this class was how harshly the homework was graded. You'll do better on the exams than the HW.",1
"I like Coop as a person, but his lectures leave a lot to be desired. As an engineering student, I don't really care about the theory behind the math, I want to know how to do the problem and he wasn't very effective for that. Overall, wouldn't take him again.",0
"Great! You learn a lot. She will help you and answers e-mails in a timely manner. Plan on writing. You can make an A, but you will work for it.",1
"I have to agree with some of the criticism here. Incredibly intelligent (seriously - very sharp), but if you want to witness an academic cult of personality at its most grovelling, take this class and watch how people who disagree with the professsor (there MUST be other poets than Holderlin and Rilke to examine) get eviscerated.",0
Professor Reynolds grading is very tough!,0
"Professor Baez is extremely nice and helpful. Despite lectures being a bit boring and long, he likes to explain the most as he can to get the point across. Homework is once a week on Saplinglearning, and there are 3 exams. There is also a group project where you are graded individually due wk10. Overall a great class and great prof!",1
"Good teacher, always smiling and happy.",1
What do you do after a political career? Teach at a college! This class will have you staring at the clock. The minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days. There are opportunities to meet members of the political community and the guest speakers are intriguing. Other than that it's an easy A without much learning. #whygottocollegeagain?,0
"LOVED Mr. Allen. He gets a bad rap from people that don't do their work, but if you do your work and go to class then you will easily make an A. The test are straightforward and reflect what we do in class. Really like that he gives us worksheets to do outside of class, and will occasionally give extra credit to those that completed. Take him!!",1
I just took the final and can offically say that this class was a NIGHTMARE! I studied so hard and I still didn't do well. He made chem so difficult to understand. I actually think I know less coming out of this class than I did going in!,0
"Dr. Meche is a good teacher, for sure. It just seems that he expects a lot from his students, & he's a tough grader as well. Participation is definitely mandatory, but his assignments aren't difficult. He also explains how to do all assignments & is very helpful. Participate, complete assignments acc. to directions, ask questions, & you'll be okay.",1
he was the worst. he would not bump me up 1 point to pass the class,0
he is a very helpful teacher. he is funny too! before he give you quizes he will give the answers right before the test. if you make a bad grade on one of your papers he will let you revise it to get a better grade. very easy teacher!!!,1
TAs did all of the work on grading. Class was pretty basic and only discussed problem issues in forensic science. Timed exam (60 mins) on over a thousand plus pages of material and articles. Not a PhD instructor which really takes away from the quality of education at ASU. Did not comment on any assignments but did offer help when needed/asked.,0
Shes good. Old school and she still uses a chalk board. She give a lot of homework but does not really check it unless you were late or absent. Your grade depends on the tests which are a huge chunk of your grade. However everything is on the study guide so youre okay. Attendance isnt enforced but its up to you to learn what you missed.,1
"I dislike this professor with all of my guts. I advise you not to take her. Not even as your last resort. She is tedious, unorganized, and boring. She will drown you in work but barely have enough time to grade them. When the semester ends it's your fault for a bad grade and not her poor teaching.",0
"I have had her for two classes (Eng 001 and Eng 101) and she did a great job in both classes.  A little essay heavy, but over all the readying were interesting and she is a fair grader. Come to class, do the readings, participate and you'll do great.",1
"Traumatizing. Graded by 2 MTs & a final, but you won't have any idea what's on them since they never appeared in lecture or the textbook. Never fully erased the chalkboard. Spoke in ""proofs"" Refused to answer questions. Assumed we knew upper div math. Averages were 50-60 (which he said was good for him). Def run if you ever see his name.",0
"Dr. Paul Coutinho is a fantastic professor and a beautiful human being. What I found exceptional about him is his ability to easily connect with students. He is genuinely interested to get to know a person behind the name. The atmosphere in the class was relaxed and welcoming, and I really enjoyed the way class was conducted and taught.",1
"Tries to be the cool professor, but fails. He fails because he relies almost entirely on PowerPoint and reads off the slides. He often gets lost in his own notes and will just talk without clicking through the slides then finish the lecture and realize clicking through all of them at the end. Ineffective, test-heavy, and unfunny. Avoid if possible.",0
"Alice is so nice! You can tell she genuinely enjoys teaching and loved her students. She's very kind and motherly, but can still be stern. One of the best teachers I've had.",1
Prof was cool but he reads off the powerpoint that he provides.,1
Made this French III class harder than it needed to be in terms of us adding to previously gained knowledge. She could take more time in explaining grammar. But she was okay in general. Going from Mme Vitaglione in French 2 to her was more difficult than it should have been if the point was to have people leave being fluent in French.,0
"Professor Callaway is amazing. She runs a discussion-based class and encourages students to participate. I love her teaching style so muchI really feel like I connected to the texts. She gives amazing feedback on papers and makes her expectations clear for exams. If you have the chance, definitely take a class with Professor Callaway!",1
"Do NOT take this professor. He is very unaccommodating and goes back on his word, said he would accept an assignment, then didn't. He says he cares about his students but does nothing to show that. He even went out of his way to make class SIGNIFICANTLY harder on his students once we changed to all online in the Spring 2020 semester due to COVID-19",0
"Took a 12 week online course during the summer, it was a breeze. I actually learned a lot in the course, Professor Mancini seemed kind and always gave us good tips and facts about health. The class did require a good deal of time, however, all the work was fairly easy. I recommend taking her!!",1
This was the best class I have ever taken. Paul Coutinho was fantastic. He truly cared about all of his students and wanted them to find joy in life. I learned so much. This is the type of class that makes you look at everything differently. I wish everyone could take Coutinho's class!,1
Super nice professor and such an easy class. Shes a very easy grader so its not hard for you not to earn an A. And I love that she always gives great feedback after every essay!,1
"Hes a decent guy but the way he teaches class is ridiculous. Your grade is based off of 2 exams and the final and for the 2 exams he grades so hard. Theres vocab with no word bank, any little detail he takes off points, hes just not a good professor, do everything you can to avoid him in order to save your gpa",0
"Wasn't a fan of the class, she did not seem to care for many people had her select favorites, not a good class for a Caucasian male(history of urban america) class was very anti white",0
"He provides good feedback to each student helping them improve. The assignments help a lot & could be applied to real life situations. The classes are very engaging and he posts videos available to class before the lecture, which helps students more with their learning process. The online textbook was helpful. Very fun and informative course.",1
"I took this fall 2015 as a required FED course for chemical engineering. It was AWFUL. Its 3 hours of pure torture. Monotone, gives no direction, and cant control his class. Its a water-air pipe system, AKA a boring project. Do your work first, then goof off. Oh, and the entire course is a group project (no, you dont pick your group). Good luck -_-",0
"Easy class! Do the study guides using her lecture notes that she posts on Angel and you will Ace every test! Shes also pretty funny but lectures do get boring at times. Shes strict about attendance and due dates but as long as you do the assignments, and on time, you get the credit.",1
"You would think in this day and age a professor would be able to use a computer, but apparently not. This teacher gives messy hand written notes. Gives notes strictly by talking which is hard to understand,talks fast, and just gives his view of the situation. His tests term part and essay part. Marks answers wrong even though they are right.",0
"Don't expect any of your papers graded and have feedback provided; It takes her about 2 weeks to grade things and by that time you'll of already had another 3 essays due. Its absolutely frustrating, on a regular assignment you'll be waiting to get you're grades back for about 5 other things. Avoid if possible.",0
"She is very enthusiastic about her work, however the content she says to study and the questions on the tests don't seem to line up, or the question takes that extra step. Lots of extra-step questions, so you really have to KNOW what you've studied. Tests are hard, though there are few of them. Rushed lecture a bit in my experience. Detail-oriented",0
"if you take her class you will during semester, she does not care student. she is great instructor at PCC I never want to take again.",0
"Graham should never be able to teach a college class again. If you want your GPA to get bent over then take his class. If you want someone who just expects you to learn everything on your own then take Graham, everyone I talked to from my class was also failing all quarter long. Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",0
"The class is straight-forward and as long as you generally keep up, you'll be okay. There is a one-page essay due every couple of weeks, and depending on your TF, they can be graded kinda tough but still reasonable. The only annoying thing about this class was that attendance is an important part of your grade.",1
"This woman, has been the worst of my experience so far. Her tests are weighted, and are either three questions long, or 8 pages long. Her Conduct class is absolutely terrible.I had a passion for political science before taking her class and it is no longer existent. She doesn't care about her students and she gets an A++ on being a terrible advisor",0
"Professor Birch's 4650 & 3050 are structured the same way and its not designed to give you any feedback nor help you improve your understanding. 90% of your grade is based on exams . Average on most exams were between 60-40% so good luck and don't expect him to help you, since all of your work is thrown away!! Guessing is encouraged, No Home Work.",0
"Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor. His teaching style is refreshing, as he always makes us think thoughtfully about why history is taught in a certain way. His lectures are interesting and his jokes were always funny. Take good notes, listen during lecture, use his study guides, read all of the books. It's not as bad as it sounds. He's the best!",1
As long as you attend every class period and do all the homework you will do fine.  The material is not difficult to understand if you are willing to put in the time and effort the class requires. Larsen is always willing to help and tries to explain the material in a way students will understand. You have to put in the study time to do well.,1
Very passionate about his area of study.,1
Absolutely amazing! Love her!!,1
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
I have returned to college after 30 years.  I found Simone Peters was very patient and explained problems thoroughly.,1
"Her teaching style isnt very helpful at all. All she does is show examples of other artists and past student drawings, and sets up things for you to draw and tells you to draw what you see. She doesnt go in depth with explanations and ive never seen her draw anything. This class is for someone who is already somewhat decent at drawing",0
"Extra credit helps. Talks too much. Hard tests, grades on curve which helps.",1
"Great professor, he gives weekly assignments but they're only 150 words and they're easy. His lectures are all online so it's easy to follow along, and he tells  you exactly what's going to be on the test. He has experience in the field, and he knows what he's talking about. He's leaving to go to Worcester State next semester, I'm happy I had him",1
"I had Melaine for Engl100 online and she was a solid choice. The course was fairly easy: 4 essays (in total) and usually 2 forum posts (weekly). She gives great feedback on essays and the marking is clear. Her course requires 3 textbooks, however I only ever used the Wascana Anthology book for the readings.",1
"Ive taken a few of her classes, if you do the work you pass but she is a very frustrating professor. Since she is an abstract artist, she wants every piece to be abstract (regardless of the prompt) and will change your idea herself to suit what she thinks is good. She also plays favorites and can be rude at times. Worst art teacher Ive ever had.",0
"Her tests are very poorly done, are often very confusing and seem that every answer could be right. The material is not hard, but the tests are not clear and becomes problematic.  Bring snacks and coffee to stay awake in class. she gets very off topic very easily and talks a lot about her self. no powerpoint or anything just her talking for 3 hours",0
Excellent professor. Loves his craft and is always looking for ways to improve his class and his students.,1
"May be the odd one, but I've little praise.  Grades good students hard and allows some less brilliant ones to slip through with an ""A"".  I know students who are better grammarians.",1
"I enjoyed the subject and the fact that the class was discussion and not lecture based. Not much reading but there are quizzes every week and attendance is VERY mandatory. He does not give out a lot of papers, only a midterm and final as well as small email hw assignments.",1
Dr. Tour frequently inserts his personal political beliefs into the course. He is unforgiving and does not like most students.,0
"Ok so here's the thing about Arevalo:She can't speak English well but the class is so easy you can teach yourself. Show up for class because she knows when you're not there. She is a relatively nice person, and funny on some occasions. She will NOT repeat herself so you're better off getting the information from someone else. Overall she's not bad",0
"My 4th class with Mike and nothing has changed. Lacks details in lecture topics. Assignments are not as rigorous or technical as I expect. He should cut down on the total assignments and increase the difficulty and quality expected. Currently, the TAs have admitted they grade easy as Mike does not set high benchmarks from students. PS:Lab is a joke",0
Dr. Portaro is awesome! She is super nice and wants to help her students. She speaks clearly and always teaches interesting topics. She's a fair grader as well. ,1
I could not have succeeded in Spanish 2 if it weren't for Professor Dattolo. He prepared me so well and he went out of his way to help all his students succeed. His lectures were very well organized and easy to follow and his kindness and respect towards us really helped.,1
Great instructor!,1
Peggy's a wonderful instructor that brings in a great group of presenters and projects that can help you figure out career and life goals. Peggy also strongly encourages group cohesion and bonding. I've really gotten to know the group of women that I've taken the class with. Peggy is there 4 you too & wants you to succeed. I'll miss this class.,1
Awesome prof and very interesting lectures. She takes times to explain assignments and gives clear instructions. Her lectures are not written though so good to have a buddy and never miss class.,1
Professor Raphael knows the material - plain and simple.  It also helps that he loves the material and Supreme Court jurisprudence.  Class is mostly lecture-based.  Exam is short - two basic fact patterns (with expectation to cite case names).  I would recommend Crim Pro - Adjudication with Professor Raphael.,1
"The lectures are a lot of fun, the exams, not as much. The exams are tough, you either get it right or completely wrong. Most of it is memorization with some math mixed in. Homework is optional, but you'll end up doing it anyway as they are on the exams. Algorithm Analysis is an interesting topic and I think Dr. Lewis does a good job covering it.",1
nice person. frustrating methods of teaching and returning graded work. one hand in assignment and quiz a week that is all for points. haven't gotten most stuff back. tries to be nice to students when they don't understand but really just embarrasses them. take shaw instead.,0
"Second time having this professor for an online class. This time around, there was ABSOLUTELY NO feedback or communication. I've turned in 25 assignments and completed the final and still not one thing has been graded. Super disappointing considering this is an important class for my major.",0
Music theory is a difficult subject but her patience and versatility as a teacher is helpful in making the material easier to understand.  If you do the work and pay attention you will do well in her class.,1
he is not as bad as all of these comments. yes talking to him in person is a bit challenging because he talks over you. you can literally sign in and then leave the class. he gives extra credit and the project is a group presentation (easy). 2 take home finals (really easy grader) other 2 are multiple choice so you get what you get but its easy.,1
Nice guy but an awful teacher. Going to class is a huge waste of time considering he doesn't take attendance and all he does is read from the powerpoints. Half the time it seems like he hardly even knows what he himself is talking about. Very unclear when explaining concepts. Practice problems are rare which makes the tests even harder.,0
Very intimidating. Best to not take.,0
He was an okay professor. Does not explain concepts that well but also not the worst at it. Never responded to any of my e-mails about hw or grading. Grading is done at the end so the entire semester I didnt really know my grade.,1
Amazing guy! Inspired me to shoot to do more after college.,1
Good Teacher,1
"Physics is hard in general. Although it was hard to understand in class, you can't expect to learn everything from him. If you were to take him, be mentally prepared, view his powerpoints. If you really try you can pass with an A",0
"Dr. Hollis is a super tough grader but his lectures are clear and interesting if you like biology. He is definitely a challenge but if you really want to learn, hes a solid choice. Super nice guy in and out of class, and makes an effort to help anyone who needs it.",1
Her class was amazing and she teaches you from the minimal basics. It really did teach me a lot and gave me something to look forward to twice a week. She was very nice. An easy A.,1
TAKE HER!! Easy A++ and she is really caring about all her students. Classes were not mandatory and her tests were all in the slides. Only 4 tests and the final was optional.,1
"Not a difficult class, does not take attendance but homework is due every class. He is funny and really easygoing. There were 4 tests and a final. Grading scale is a bit weird but it is an easy philosophy credit. Ehring has a dry sense of humor but he made me laugh so hard I was almost crying! I want to take I'm for intermediate logic.",1
"No enough words to express how amazing this man is. He is incredible. I have taken 4 classes with him & planning to take the 5th. He will assign books to read, but is very CLEAR about what he wants in his exams, which are usually a midterm and a final only. One term paper. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. His Classes fill out QUICKLY, register as soon as you can!",1
The best psych teacher at ELAC. Very approachable and very understanding. Great lectures and notes. She really likes group work. Makes psych fun and easy to learn. Highly recommend her class!,1
"He is the worst professor I've had in my whole college experience. He expects you to go out of your way to see art pieces, know the proper way to critique it, and makes you write so many papers that are pointless and a waste of time. His grading is so hard, it's almost impossible to get an A anything. If you get him as a professor, GOOD LUCK!",0
"sometimes too impulsive, expects student have a great interest in just his specialization of electrical. doesn't care much if you fail or pass; popular with his see you next year line. heavy on homework. Past questions will save your life, but try to know your stuff",0
"He is such a good professor. Very clear in his lectures, throw in a few jokes, goes at a good pace, good enough where you can keep up. Tests and quizzes are easy if you do the practice problems that he suggests. He will forever be one of my favorite teachers.",1
Covered a lot of different genres in Spanish cinema. He cares about students and wants them to be interested in the lectures. Only critique I have is that he doesnt give much feedback on essays and doesn't give clear prompts for the essays (which can be good because you have freedom to choose). Only a few papers and group discussion on one movie.,1
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
"If you are not electrical engineering, do not take him. He is a research professor, not a teaching professor. I took every AP Physics in high school, did the homework, studied for hours for the test an failed. He gave a 3 question test that was 9 parts total. The class average was a 44% and he does not curve. He does not care about your grade.",0
he was a great teacher. film and short fiction is a really great class and he really loves what he's doing. he's very passionate about it and will def be up to helping you when you need it. and he lets you hand in your 1pg paper late which is nice :-) i would def recommend him!!! take his class!!!!,1
Talks too quietly and has a really thick accent. I asked him THREE TIMES for the answer key to the midterm and still haven't had it. The class isn't too bad but hes just not much of a teacher. If you want a good result study his assignments - his exams are almost exactly the same in format and questions!,0
Brace is a very hard marker but a really nice person.,1
"Dr. Nelson was delightful. His blistering criticism was always specific and helpful, and he is one of the few Davidson profs who actually gives you useful advice for after you graduate. He has a rep for being mean, but he was always kind and truthful with me. And he remembered my name afterwards!",1
"Mr. Valliere takes his attitude from Comp 1 and puts it directly into Comp 2. There are 3-4 papers to do over the course. Each one he gives plenty of time to start, ask questions about it and gives clear grading criteria about what he wants and how to do it. He is funny, understanding, and makes the class super easy. If you want an easy A, take him",1
"Honest review here, Professor Fels is such a Fels. She has no idea how to teach this course because she's a researcher. She brings in guest lecturers that think we're high school students. Our exam was to write 15 pages of complete BS with questions that makes no sense. It Fels good to finish this term cause I can't stand another term with her.",0
"Dr. Xing was a great professor- I was a visiting student and took her class this summer and she was extremely helpful and accommodating. I would go to her with questions on the homework and she would always help a lot, her tests are very fair. Put in the work and go to her office hours often and you will do fine!",1
"He's kind of all over the place, we pretty much focused on the same topic all semester so I didn't feel like I learned all that much. He has a very specific way of thinking so on assignments and tests you have to keep that in mind. Overall I really wish I hadn't taken this class.",0
worst professor i've ever had. though she's interested in the photography she is not very good at teaching the important stuff ie. the photographer/ his background/ ideologies and theories. her assignments are too vague and she grades unfairly.,0
Excellent Professor,1
"She does not look at the students when she lectures. As a professor, she is not specific. She reads off of PowerPoint slides, and without them, there would not be much she can say to the class. I feel very drained in this class because she teaches in a very unenthusiastic manner. This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken in my life.",0
"an amazing professor, take anything with him, it will be worth it",1
"Luv her!!! so easy to follow n very thorough in her explanations! Detailed outlines already printed for you, dont get much easier!!!",1
"If you aspire to be a poet (do they even exist anymore?), or would like to experience what it feels like to learn English inside prison walls, then this is the adjunct warden for you. GOOD LUCK!",0
Professor Bonner is a great teacher who guides students to understand all of the material. He would not leave anyone behind and would answer any questions people had. He is easily the best teacher i have had. I highly recommend you take him if you get a chance!,1
"new to teaching and it ,changes his mind on what needs to be done in assignment hard to know what he wants",0
"Loved her! Very kind, very caring, one easy project, tells you what to focus on for the exams.",1
"Loved his Killer Skies class! He's very funny and allows you to bring in a sheet of notes for each test and even the final! Theres no textbook, but you have to use his ppt slides alot for the HW and cheat sheets. The HW is quite hard tho, even with the ppt slides given to you. But you get unlimited number of tries, and the highest score is taken",1
Jon is just a grad student but he teaches some calc classes. He really makes sure you understand everything and does a good job explaining all of the material. He's a cool guy too.,1
"He is one of my favorite teachers. Prepare to laugh while learning because he is a very funny teacher. He's very helpful, but makes you correct your own mistakes.",1
Great professor all around. She makes the class easy but you do have to do the assignments which aren't too hard. There are incentives for attendance at the end of the semester so some to lecture on time.,1
"Dr. Clasen has not impressed me. His ""lectures"" are just him reading slides. He was responsive at the beginning of the class, but then he just disappeared. Lots of assignments; it's a summer class so it's 3-5 ch/wk and no feedback on any homework and rarely on tests either. YouTube is a better teacher!!! He does give extra credit, which is nice.",0
Very poor attitude towards students. Weighting of material on test was very unfair. Students were given the opportunity to give feedback after the test. Dr. Balshine was only willing to listen to positive comments and when anyone made a negative comment (true and valid) about something she had done she rudely shot them down and ignored this input,0
"Daigle grades on a very high curve, probably because everyone would fail the tests if he didn't. Tests are really long, especially for a 50 minute class period. He is SO boring and I can't even stand to take notes. Hard to study for tests, and there are only 3. Very unclear and hard to follow his lectures. Good luck if you take him...",0
Hands down one of the best teachers I've had. Took A&P one semester with another teacher who failed me by 4 points. I went into his class thinking the same thing was going to happen and it 100% did not. He makes jokes the whole time and it truly makes learning fun. I took his hybrid class and felt like I learned so much from him.,1
"This class was SOO boring, but it's easy. You don't need the textbook and your don't even have to go to class. I don't think I listened to any of his lectures, but I got an A in his class. He talks so quietly. The whole class is based on presentations and 2 online exams.",0
"Only the grace of God was able to deliver me through this course. Just remember, if there is anything you should know about the REAL WORLD, is that you do not owe any form of kindness to someone that makes it a challenge for you. Even for authority.",0
This class was a tough class but if you are willing to put in the effort is a really great class to take! I suggest taking Philosophy with this professor. ,1
"Class is HARD, but Dr. Dave certainly knows how to make learning English interesting and does do through comic strips and modern world examples. There's barely any homework. Just a small paper for each chapter (like 500 words), five quizzes, and the final paper. Final paper is difficult, but I would take his class again in a heartbeat. Also works with you during personal emergencies. Thanks Dr. Marlow!",1
Sanda knows how to design and she's wonderful at that. However she doesn't teach well. She gets mad when students aren't getting it yet we just spend the whole class critiquing and repeating ourselves. She made it clear from the beginning that this class is a lot of effort and time. Not for the unconfident people.,0
"Terri is very nice and is always willing to help her students succeed. She is very personable and extends a hand whenever you need help. Her class was manageable. I would suggest reading the power points in depth as they help you prepare for exams. In labs, you have stations and it can be difficult to get your work done so plan your time properly.",1
You use wileyplus instead of blackboard. It costs extra and honestly is pretty confusing. He barely remembered to post anything on time. Honestly for as little as he did to teach us I think he should have gave us all As. Dont plan to learn anything in his class. Not good for students who do not want to teach themselves the material.,0
Take Voice and Movement !!! It's sweeter than HONEYYYY ����,1
"Takes all the math out of statistics, which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times. Best part of the class is the textbook which Professor Velleman wrote himself. Easy textbook to read.",0
Joy V'Marie gave me the inspiration necessary for me to go on to earn my Masters Degree.,1
The worst Professor i have ever witnessed,0
"Master Fu is an absolute dear; wise and gentle-hearted; humorous, both inentionally and unintentionally; may not impress you right away, but with your heart in the right place you'll see the beauty of John Fu.",1
"Didn't know this guys name until I looked it up. Very disorganized class. He talks the entire class, mostly about nonsense, then tells you to take a pop quiz. His talking makes you doze off and not pay attention to anything. His quizzes will feature questions on things he quickly covered that you wouldn't remember if he didn't tell you to know it.",0
"Christy is a great teacher, but she's one of the few that wants to use up the full 2 hours of class time. Although Christy may not be clear at times during class lectures, she is always available to talk to one on one. I would recommend speaking with her if you are having trouble! Don't feel intimidated and just ask, she's helpful if you try.",1
"He is a very smart teacher, who genuinely cares about his students, and has a very straight forward grading criteria. He gives you feedback throughout the semester and is always there to talk to after class about anything confusing. The ratings on here of this teacher are unfair. Read the lectures BEFORE class and participate everyday!",1
"Professor Hoover is a very patient, detailed teacher who outlines specifically what will be on his exams. Great teacher! I'm definitely taking his class again.",1
"7 assessments (1 being the discussion post which are not weekly), 2 of them are group check in points, 2 of them are group project presentation / evaluation form, 2 research papers. posted in the beginning of the semester can knock them out before the due date. group project of utilizing sustainable facility's. no test !",1
"Waste of time...class is extremely easy, but she discriminates against certain students and likes to have control as if we're in Middle School.  She gets too gassed about being a teacher- class is boring, but an easy A...try to take online if possible.",0
"He moves through class slowly, which can be boring. However it is beneficial, you do develop a strong understanding of the material. He does not give a lot of homework nor the answers to the textbook. Therefore it can be easy to get high 70s too low 80s, but it can be difficult to achieve a higher grade.",1
No Comments,0
"If you can get past his accent, Dr. Tang explains concepts exceptionally clearly. Lectures are well-paced. However, you'll want to write down what he says because slides don't have much text. He does post summaries though. Generous to students. Clickers are easy if you pay attention. Exams are fair. Textbook was not emphasized. Class is +/-.",1
For PHYS270: 1) You read 2-3 sections of a chapter from the book 2) You take a 'reading quiz' on the sections due every Monday and Wednesday an hour before class (basically just like the examples). 3) Homework through masteringphysics due every Wednesday at 11:00PM. This class is incredibly straightforward. You work every day and you barely pass.,1
"Très rapide dans la matière, difficile de suivre adéquatement. Il semble trop connaître sa matière et pense qu'on la connaît déjà aussi on dirait... Moyenne de 53% à l'examen est normal pour lui.",1
Professor Hays is a remarkable instructor.  He allows his students to learn and gain knowledge while relating it to real life situations and challenges.  His sincere concern for his students shows through his teaching.,1
"Steve is alright.  He will lecture, but does not seem confident in what he is teaching.  He sometimes got confused on what he was teaching, and didn't really seem to care if you understood the material.  His tests were really easy though.  I did not really feel like he taught me a lot, and that I did well because my HS calc teacher was 100x better.",0
"She is a great teacher but is very set in her ways.  If you do not agree with her, drop the course.  She expects a lot from you so be aware it is not a fluff course.  Jamie is an amazing resource and connection.",1
"worst professor, giving thousands of homework and expect you to finish it in less than a week. her precal 165 is the worst class to take online, please run, do not take her online",0
This software class is very paper heavy. We take tests and quizzes using scan trons and do homework via paper labs. Also be prepared to keep track of your own grades because he never posts the grades online. He would give us our quizzes and tests back for a few minutes and then make us give them back to him. Good luck learning.,0
"Lectures were riddled with mistakes, annoyed sighs at any question, and a bad internet connection. Refused to acknowledge her poor internet connection even though her RECORDED lectures had plenty of evidence. Make sure you check your graded work because she's careless and makes mistakes on everything. Easy class if you read the text and practice",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER!!!! Her class is only worth 500 points with about 6 assignments, so if you don't do good on an assignment you have no chance of getting a good grade. This class should be an easy A class but she does not explain any assignment, and she is a hard grader. She also takes forever to grade so you never know what you have in the class.",0
The professor spent the majority of each mandatory class meeting to discuss her personal life and forbade working while she discussed her life. The assignments had little-to-nothing to do with the learning and the learning materials were so basic it felt insulting. Terrible emailer and communicator.,0
"Newhouse is the most boring speaker I have ever encountered. Do yourself a favour and take the online INDG class for the 1000 level. Everyone is unorganised, assignments will say one thing but the syllabus says another. If they want people to continue in the indigenous studies stream, they should at least make this course enjoyable.",0
"Dr. Gentry is one of a kind. Instead of lecturing all class, he lets us form our own opinions by debating about the topic at hand. I looked forward to this class everyday. Just do your work and don't half-ass it and you'll pass with flying colors.",1
"She is definitely one of the worst teachers. Shes super rude and does not have that teacher compassion aspect. She does not care about fixing her own mistakes. When asking about correctness on assignments/grades, she totally dismisses what you are telling her when its HER fault that an assignment/grade is incorrect.",0
"Worst Professor I have ever had.  I got an A- in his class but had to study every single day.  After taking final, I couldn't sleep for 4 days until I received my grade because the final was so incredibly hard.  Everyone came out of the final traumatized.  Unfortunately, CCNY makes this course very hard to pass no matter which professor you take.",0
"Couldn't ask for a better teacher. Clear, helpful, gives Extra credit and down to earth. What more can u want?",1
"Condescending, stammering, not interested in discussion or alternative viewpoints...kind of a jerk sometimes. Says the word ""uh"" about five times in every sentence, making him difficult to listen to for more than a few minutes. I will avoid taking any other class with him.",0
Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Completely useless. Does not know anything about graphic design and is horrible at giving feedback. He belittles his students and finds pleasure in embarrassing them in front of the class. Any good reviews on here were probably written by him.,0
This guy is a total jerk. He's told me to my face that his priority is not to the students. Wonder why he's such a bad professor? You will learn nothing from this man. All he cares about is his precious research.,0
"Prof. Wisotzki is one of the best professors I've ever had. She is a wealth of knowledge, is engaging when she lectures, and is passionate about the subject. I am a business major, and I loved the class! If I could take her again, I would. She also takes the class on private tours of the Art Institute!",1
Sure she knows her stuff on political analysis but she is a horrible professor. Pop quizzes on the days most kids are absent(like the day b4 thanksgiving) and 7 memos total in the class. She couldn't care less about her students and literally makes sure they do bad. The class is extremely boring and she makes sure we go overtime every class.,0

dive for dreams or a slogan may topple you (trees are their roots and wind is wind) trust your heart if the seas catch fire (and live by love though the stars walk backward),1
Mr. Luckett's teaching is thorough and matter of fact.   He is extremely knowledgable and expects you to learn the material he dictates.   His passion for Social Work is evident in his teaching style.  I learned a lot in his class.  I loved the structured outline of his class. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.,1
she just hands out A's,0
"Restricts creative freedom. You're practically forced to abstract your work to her liking before you can start painting. Style is redundant, it's mostly collaging images on Photoshop and regurgitating it onto a canvas. The readings and the questions are a pain. Lastly, it's drawing and painting, wish she didn't restrict it to merely painting.",0
"BEST TEACHER EVER! This is a difficult class that involves TONS of memorization, but he uses notes handouts for study tools and everything comes straight off of the notes. He's funny, easy to get along with, and knows a lot! It's hard, but definitely worth taking!",1
"He is a nice professor overall, but he is not a great teacher. He is hard to understand and his tests are very difficult. I believe that the average grade for tests was a D.",0
"Professor Conway does nothing but read off his powerpoints every lecture. There are few opportunities for grades in this class so make them count, especially considering he is a very hard grader. He will pick out the smallest detail in an assignment just so you don't get a 100. Don't take the class if you don't have to.",0
"DO NOT TAKE her class, her test has nothing to do with lecture. ",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I took this class for a breadth and regret doing so. It's is incredibly boring. All she does is drone on and on and no one listens. Awful teaching. There are 5 pop quizzes that the class average is always a 60-70%. If you're going to take this class, take it with a different professor.",0
She loves math. She will get you to like math. She always writes the important information and equations right before class starts.,1
"Very enthusiastic about his lectures, making the course relatively easy to understand and fun.",1
"I really liked Steve personality wise, funny dude, pretty easy to get along with, total nerd, definitely likable. As far as the math goes, it was college level algebra, which is not a basic class, but it's not a really hard class, and I feel its a bit beneath him to teach it, so he teaches it that way and its not always easy to follow for some.",1
Do not take this class! The instructor is rather condescending and his TA is just as horrible. They do not really respect the views of others and talk down to the students. My personal experience was terrible. He is extremely boring and his office hours aren't as helpful as one would expect.,0
I absolutely loved her Personal Fitness class. She was never boring and made the class fun for us. Had a few workout activities to do but I enjoyed it. She really influenced me when it came to exercise and living a healthy lifestyle. I would definitely take her again in a heartbeat. She's great!,1
"Easy A. For a sociology teacher he seems ignorant based on how he talks about women, other cultures, and gay people. Not politically correct. He also allows people to talk, text, come in late, have more than 6 absences, he does not want you to fail. If your a weak student this class is made for you. If you are a good student this class is annoting.",1
"If you want to learn something, do not take him. There is definitely something mentally not right with him, he is constantly off topic. I went to every class, did every assignment like an idiot and got an A. Meanwhile people who never showed got an A- because it was 'easier' for him to deal with. Worst English class and experience ever.",0
"Talks about the same things over and over, but has a exit slip each period over a chapter in the book so you cant skip all the time, otherwise I would. Unnecessary lectures and lots of class participation where everyone around the room says their answer.",0
"Outstanding Professor comparing with my learning experiences in professional courses at Universities in Canada, India and Africa. Great student engaging and performance supporting teaching methodology. An awesome personality who is very professional, helpful, friendly, open minded and supports students to reach our professional goals.",1
His lecture is so boring but his tests are pretty easy. I just study at home on my own and get A+.  I would say that take his course if you want to raise your GPA.,0
"Karen is GREAT. I ended up doing the hybrid class with her and was not disappointed. She always brought a level of energy with her to class that was contagious. She is a tough grader but is very transparent about her expectations from day 1. Online courses can be harder because of self study, but she helps as much as she possibly can. 100%Recommend",1
"He makes you work ridiculously hard for an A, and all of the comments he writes are 100% illegible. I went to his office hours and he could not even read the comments he wrote on my paper. He also gave me a B on a paper because he thought I used an incomplete sentence and then he realized I didn't but  didn't change my grade. He's a nice enough guy",0
"Orser is a lovely woman, however, she is way too tough of a marker and not active online through moodle, feedback was less to none. I think everybody failed one quiz and expects you to read all books ( which are expensive) while having a full courseload and life",0
extremely tough grader. on all assignments I didn't get any higher then a 70% I highly recommended avoiding her class. She takes forever to grade assignments i turned in 3 assignments and she took the entire quarter to grade all of them and took 3 hrs to grade my final.,0
"He's not difficult. The problem I had was his inability to communicate. I would wait many weeks to hear back on emails and phone calls. He grades slowly. By the week of finals, he had not posted some grades from the first weeks of school! I had no idea where I stood in the class, grade wise, and it didn't help that I couldn't get a response",0
She's cool but a super hard grader you won't get higher than a B. Don't take her,0
"You will lose points if you skip his class. But you dont have any choice but to take his class because he is the only graphic design professor, which is infuriating because his sense of design is so off, he thinks textbooks from the 80s are ideal and has no idea about current trends. he still hasnt let me turn in my 1st project!",0
The class was full of long assignments and graded activities with unfair distribution of credits. You will have more than 10 assignments  activities together each takes more than 1 week to finish 1 quiz and 2 exams. He didn''t teach. He just made you work. Don''t know how something works Find out on your own. His feedback was ambiguous. ,0
She talks really fast and doesn't give you much time to take your notes. She is very easy grader on papers I have made 2 A's an 1 B. She is willing to help you. She isn't very good at checking email. She will also tell you that you have to address the emails or else she wont reply Her weekends are her personal time so don't email her then.,1
"This guy is a jerk and a half- he seems like he knows what he's doing in lectures but if you talk to him individually, he'll treat you with utmost disdain.  He shows up at class like 10 minutes late and then blames class being late on the computer and projector and then treats the repair people with comtempt.  What an a$$h0le of an individual.",0
must go to class,1
He's horrible. He's hard to understand and when you ask for help he just shoo's you away. He's all over the place during lecture and the problems are always unfinished.,0
Amazing teacher! I'm seriously trying to find a way to take more classes under him. He KNOWS what he is talking about and makes it interesting with stories that connect with the material. Tests come straight from powerpoints and he does not expect you to know dates. If you don't pass this class then you simply are not even trying at all.,1
"she is nice, she would like to explain everything you dont understand, but she DO NOT explain a lot on grammar and new stuff, because she think the student can read book and do the questions by themselves. moreover, if you would like to practice more oral , you can go to her class, because there is a presentation in each class, sometimes each week.",0
She really makes you work hard for your grade. She's somewhat helpful but doesn't make sense a lot of the time. Easy-ish class. Just felt awkward in her class.,1
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
Really enjoyed his online intro to networking class. Has very good video lectures. There were a lot of labs but I felt everything was fair and I learned what I needed to.,1

"I think people struggle with him because he is their first introduction to a real math class. Expect to get in the 60's on midterms, and there will be a big curve at the end of the quarter. In 21B, we were used to seeing an integral, and mindlessly solve it. In this class, you need to know how the math works; no rote problem solving.",1
"Very Unorganized!! Knows his things well, but cant teach!!",0
"Took her twice, the only English teacher I want now. Was incredibly flexible, kind, and accommodating. She helped me send a petition to the school to dismiss the failing grade I got on my first year because I explained how anxious I was. Second time I passed with flying colors, and discovered my talent for writing because of her. Favorite teacher!",1
"EASY class...all you gotta do is read from the book, tests are straight forward and simple. Theres writing assignments but they are easy because the book helps alot. She is very nice and understanding. I liked her alot and had her for two history classes.",1
"In the beginning she seems like a nice,good professor but the whole semester we did nothing, I learned nothing, struggled with quizzes and tests she let us take home because we did nothing in class, can never get ahold of her out of class, she grades stuff late & I felt I didn't get the grades I should have. Nice lady, but should not be a professor",0
"Way too many assignments for an elective course. He also marks too hard with little to no feedback on the assignments. Each week there's 5 assignments to do. unless you have excess time on your hands, it's difficult to complete. Replies to emails really late and does not take into consideration the fact that students have other courses. Avoid!!",0
One of the best teachers that I have ever had.  Makes sure that every understands everything and is very good at teaching.  He gives many opportunities for extra help on learning the material.  Also he is probably the most fun teacher that I have ever had.  Class is simply fun to attend.,1
"Really easy to talk to, and super nice guy. And, he's had a solid background teaching mathematics in China(?) and also some part in Europe(?) Also very passionate about his field as demonstrated in the interesting, and funny stories he ties into the lectures related to math.",1
He is so boring and scatterbrained he makes his tests harder than they need to be and claims that you have to read the textbook 5 times in order to get a B he doesnt teach and is kind of ignorant and thinks that no one studies and has no sympathy for people. He is super confusing and his tests suck.,0
"Professor Hensley really wants his students to get real-world information from his class, rather than just doing busy work. He is an amazing lecturer, very enthusiastic about business, and gives a lot of constructive criticism. However, there was a TON to do for one class.",1
"As many have said, brilliant physicist, horrible teacher. First day he gave assessment exams because the uni told him his fail rate was too high. There are no 'pre-tests' anymore, no kind of study guide given, just told to do the homework again (loads of homework at that). Only three tests and a final, with no curve.",0
"Very smart, cares deeply for his students, class is interesting ",1
"Patrick McKean is stuck in his very old ways. It's always his way or the high way. If you ask him for help he won't help you, he'll simply say ""I've already given the instructions you've should have paid better attention"".  I felt like I had to teach myself since he spent his dragging lectures talking about his personal life instead of journalism.",0
By far the worst professor I have ever had. I always enjoyed math until I took his class. The average on the first exam was a 64 and the median a 67. The average on the second exam was a 44.5 and the median was a 46. He just puts the book on a projector and reads it to himself then jumps into the example problems without explaining anything.,0
"Very easy  class, 4 Essays and 1 group presentations. Lectures are very  boring , don't expect to watch modern movies very often, usually the movies in focus are black and white or from foreign countries. Easy A as long as your essays are good.",0

This class was a lot of fun and Tim-sensee is awesome. Very easy to talk to - in English and in Japanese. One of my favorite teachers at UAB.,1
I hate to not say nice things about people so I will just say Dr. O'leary makes it non-stressful to go through these classes. Having been out of his classes for a few years now I have relearned everything he did not teach us. Unfortunately you can learn semiconductor devices much better on Google than with Dr. Oleary.,0
"I enjoyed his teaching of AT. He made the topics easy to understand. At times, his lectures did get boring but he teaches life lessons which were helpful. Make sure you know basic math or you will struggle a little, but ask questions, he loves to help. There is a group project and group quizzes. Make sure you take notes! It's essential.",1
"The take-home quizes were based on the book, but attendance was still graded.  A sign that an instructor doesn't know what they're doing.  I dropped the class because I  got sick of extrapolating conclusions that weren't in the book.   If you're not learning anything, then why are you even here?  Seriously, no joke, don't take a class from her.",0
"Northrup not only is dedicated to helping students understand the material, but he also cares about his student's wellbeing. He gives great lectures and makes all the lecture material available online for review. Although at times he can be forgetful, he knows this and takes reminders about things graciously. Overall, the best prof I've ever had",1
"Amazing Professor that take the time to relate textbook reading to real life experiences making learning clear and concise. High expectations, but very amicable to work with students to see them achieve.",1
"Pattern of class is very clear and it's easy to get into a rhythm with the work, Dangerous to fall behind because work can piles up, Tests are written fairly poorly, but they are multiple-choice and she gives you two chances so you can usually figure it out, the KEY to this class is taking notes on EVERY chapter (mostly the main terms and summaries",1
Ethan is a great professor! ENES 100 is designed to be a very challenging course for students early in their engineering journey. Don't be too disappointed if you don't actually understand what is happening. Be sure to go to office hours. He's super accessible outside of class. He truly wants every one of his students to succeed. You'll learn a lot,1
GOOD,1
Chet is a very nice man but he doesnt stay on track with his lessons. He tends to rush through the topic of what hes teaching and doesnt necessarily provide the student with an answer to their question. Chet also makes mistakes when grading exams and often gives you a lower grade than what was deserved.,0
Had a 79% and she wouldn't give me the B-.She's a critic of everything you write.Very intimidating.One of those type of professors that you wish you never had.Unfriendly.Just plain simple t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e.,0
"This guy is great. Honest and funny. He gives valuable real-life advice/information along with class material. Knows his stuff. If you have a chance, take his class.",1
"By far Professor Lee is one of the best teachers I've ever had. His class is fun, challenging, and never ever boring! He really cares about teaching and is always helpful to students. His class is well-planned and he teaches in ways that make me really enjoy going to his class... All in all, I would recommend his class to anyone.",1
class a waste of time. Didn't use textbooks or discuss readings. Allowed some students to monopolize class w/inane diatribe. Did not give constructive criticism on assisnments. Wasted too much class time for group project instead of teaching. I learned nothing from sitting in her class....would recc a different professor.,0
"His questions in class lingered on and on. Unimportant topics that he had some hidden interest in were just driven. His tests were okay. In the essay portion he wants every single last detail. I drew a chart, and cited him word-for-word and still got a 4 out of 6 on one question.",1
"I took her Spring 2016, she started out on a good road but went completely left at the end. She actual taught the last two weeks of the semester. When she began to teacher she was giving a crash lesson. She believes you should be a professional writer not thinking this could be a class you have not taken in thirty years.",0
I did not really understand her explanations during the lectures. Better off studying on your own.,0
This professor is a tough grader but if you do the work and just pay attention he is a really good professor and makes you work for your grade.,1
This class is extremely boring. The material is so dry and she does not make it interesting at allThe grading criteria is non existent and the midterm was 5 short answer questions worth 30%. The day of the midterm she held a review the first half of class? Wouldn't it be typical to have a review prior to midterm in order to study relevant material?,0
"Records and posts lectures and code examples for your reference. About 10 assignments each being fairly difficult, but if you fully understand how to do them then you are fully prepared for the midterm and final. Midterm and final consists of multiple choice questions and a big coding project. Overall, teaching style is perfect. Respected engineer",1
"Marketing 201, or markets and institutions, is a super boring class, but if you are looking to just pass the class deff take schellhorn, and plus you'll learn along the way",1
"He is a very nice guy, and as long as you make an effort to participate in class and try on the tests, he is a pretty liberal grader. However, he is not necessarily the best teacher. Honestly, the only reason I have an A is because of the SI sessions. So if you take him, I highly recommend making time for the SI. Also, he does have a heavy accent.",1
"Prof Humphrey is an excellent instructor! He is such an easy going person. His lectures can be long, but always interesting. I would def recommend.",1
"This lady is a demon...I dreaded going to her class. She told the class do not ask her any questions, she is not a tutor. She gives directions, but sometimes there is notn clarity so u are lost on the assignment. She is a total nightmare!!!!",0
"Ratana is a pretty awful instructor who can struggles to explain the most basic concepts of operating systems. He recycles assignments, quizzes, and tests, and he teaches this class pretty often, so it shouldn't be difficult to find resources from previous semesters. ",0
Dr. Kunz is the best! I actually look forward to going to class because he makes it so interesting. Quizzes every week that are easy and straightforward. Tests come straight from the quizzes. Very easy to do well and you'll learn a lot.,1
Was not considerate when i was out sick Even though it says redos on papers gets one week to complete she told me that I needed to have the final draft due that night as I needed to redo it. It says one week on syllabus and she said that's only after i grade it. she was making me redo it instantly and didn't follow syllabus she made so i dropped it,0
"Very good teacher. Expects you to read. Her lectures won't give you all the answers. Very interesting class! Do the homework! Not only are they worth points but your time as well! I actually learned from it. Very nice teacher. Participate, she loves that and it helps you remember the lecture. Do the reviews! And READ! Trust me. ",1
"Her lectures consisted almost entirely of reading to us the concepts from the book that were going to be on the test.  Reading them.  Word for word.  And repeating them for those who did not have time to write it down the first time, even though it was right there, in the book.",0
He's amazing! The tests are more understanding rather than memorizing. I did micro with Dr. White so this class was a breeze for me,1
"I like him as a person but he is a terrible professor. There is homework everyday and this stuff is complex stuff too. I mostly chegg everything but Im looking at a D to pass in this class. He teaches it like youre in graduate Electrical Engineering college, not an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering. Im glad I can take him only this once.",0
Really good teacher overall. I love going to her class for lectures. The hw and discussions were easy. We only had to do 2 projects but she provides the data for you. I'd highly recommend her.,1
"Definitely a tough class, but worth it. Her notes and lectures are confusing, but if you read and do the online homework you'll understand what's going on.  She even gives you the types of question that will be on the tests so you can practice online. She's always willing to take time out of class to explain something.  Go and show interest.",1
"SO many errors on her tests. EVERY test we had there were at least two questions she had to go and ""consult"" with another instructor about. She is CONSTANTLY talking about irrelevant information (her son and her ""granddog""). Over half of lecture was spent talking about her family. You don't learn in her class!",0
come to class. pay attention. do not disrespect her and she will not disrespect you. its as simple as that.,1
"Although Conrad does give a lot of hw (online and in textbook), the material she assigns actually helps understanding the concepts and prepare you for her exams. She is very organized with her lesson plan; does both PPT and notes style lecture. All prelim exams have a 10pt EC opportunity and 20pt EC for the final. Very generous grading for labs.",1
"Very entertaining, like said before he has lame jokes but are funny in the back of my head. He makes everything so clear and explains everything by step which some people might think as a waste of time but it really helps to just soak in harder steps.",1
"Would ask questions in class/during test and he would say ""I didn't write the powerpoint"" or ""didn't write the test"". Skips through powerpoints all the time. He just doesn't teach well. Obsessed with teaching JMP software but you can't use it for tests?? Nice guy but not a good teacher. AP Stat is only reason I understand the class",0
He's very rude but his work is extremely easy. The majority of the time he will let class out early. He does a review prior to exams. Every question is worded the same as the exam so there's no surprises.,1
"Dr. Curtis is a nice lady but her lectures are all over the place. She does not go over much in class and she makes her test extremely hard. Their are only 3 test, which is basically your whole grade, so if you do bad on one test you are screwed for the rest of the semester. I would not recommend.",0
"Thankfully he sticks to the syllabus day by day. NO use of mathlab, all of our book homework looked like (1-89) EOO (every other odd). He doesn't check for accuracy on the homework. There are few quizzes and although the 3 exams are tough, you can 'correct' them and get hella credit back. If you just read the book and do HW its a simple B/B+.",0
"I have taken Berger-Hill for two classes in one semester and I would take her a thousand times again. Because this is a online course, expect work due every week but her class is very easy, if you received a bad grade, you just didn't care. She give feedback very well and responds quick. TAKE HER! she's amazing!",1
"best teacher ever. I had never liked anything related to science until i met this teacher. the class is easy, the exams are easy just need to study the material from class. i would recommend this teacher.",1
Very confusing professor.,0
"Kula is nice, but BORING! I had him for 4 hours a day, twice a week and that was a challenge! GET MY ACCOUNTING LAB! he doesn't use it in class but its all the h/w problems and they tell you answers and it helps on exams. Exams are pretty fair...gotta know what you're doing though! Accounting is hard...you kinda gotta teach urself if u have kula:((",0
"I started at URI in 2002 and registered for this class every semester and dropped it until Fall 2004.  First assignment I hand wrote and when I turned it in she said ""No, type, type, type."" Instead of being scared off I stuck with it. She always  wasavailable. Dr. Ferguson gave me the firmness I needed. Currently finishing my Doctorate! Thank you.",1
"He is absolutely awful. He doesn't use online resources like d2l, his lectures are not clear, every exam has super low average and he doesn't even tell us where we stand on class. He doesn't post solutions to exams or homework. He is not helpful in office hours either. The syllabus he gave at the beginning of class doesn't even include exam dates.",0
"She's an easy A. Barely have class the entire semester because she cancels a lot. When there is class, she reads through a power point or puts on a movie. There was two big assignments but were an easy A as well. So take her of you don't want to do anything plus she's cool.",1
It's one thing to know the world of philosophy and it's another to know pop culture and think it's the path to understanding. Gentry is as shallow and unoriginal as I've ever taken. Very disappointed and wish I could get my money refunded.,0
Professor Squire is an awesome guy and very knowledgeable. His classes are never the most rigorous but he's often teaching electives so they don't have to be. Exams are multiple choice and coding projects are very manageable. If you're swamped with classes and need to fit in a CS elective any Squire class will be a joy to take.,1
"If you're a disorganized student, this professor is not for you. She is very clear about her expectations, she is very understanding and have great concerns for her students. She do not tolerate lackadaisical behavior, she motivated me. This professor  wanted us to know the work,  gain an education, not a just a grade. I love her teaching style. ",1
"She makes Chemistry EASY. Print power points, read them before class, and you will have no problem following along and passing. Exams are easy if you study power points. She presents material in a way anyone can understand, builds upon material to the next subject which is helpful, and very laid back. Extra credit opportunities. Homework is rare.",1
"Basically it was like he was speaking a different language. Him and his ""games"" were a waste of time. I just stopped going and went off what I learned in HS and passed. Get Busch instead, the difference is like night and day.",0
He's a bad Prof that doesn't know how to teach material. He also showed some kids email in class to everyone saying that he was sick and wanted to email his assignments. Rick then complained about the email for ten minutes. Basically a volleyball coach that for what ever reason for what ever reason was able to land a job as a Prof.,0
One of the best profs I've had.Clear concise and very helpful.Do well on midterm cause final is hard.,1
He went off onto so many tangents that seemed irrelevant to the pieces we had to read. None of the class got to have an input because he was the one always talking. He also was so disorganized and didnt seem like he knew what he was doing. We had a midterm and final.,0
"Professor Kuhlman is very nice and listens to the students. His lectures are horrible. He just reads off a script or textbook. If you don't understand he will clarify for you but, what are we paying for?Funny teacher but not worth the money. There's no challenge in the class, if you need an easy A then its your class.",0
AC 470 is required for my major and I was dreading it. Professor Dugas made it painless and as good as auditing can probably be. Her lectures are entertaining especially for a night bomb. She really cares if her students do well and made sure we understood material before we moved on. The tests are standard across classes and I felt really prepared,1
"I've taken 2 classes with Professor Wheeler and I absolutely love her and her teaching style. This isn't another boring history with memorization, it will make you think critically about history. The TA's are also very helpful in and out of class. Attendance is mandatory though.",1
"Brilliant teacher for those who can hear him. I'm sure it's frustrating if you can't. Keep an open mind, ask questions, and really try to understand what he is getting at! You will learn as much as the openness of your mind allows.",1
Tom is the best professor and teacher during my 2 years in DUKE.,1
"Please take Prof. Dunham he is one of the best Professor I ever had PERIODT! this man needs a raise. Work load is heavy but not hard at all. He is full of knowledge, I enjoyed every class. Do the work, take pride in your work you will pass. He gives great feedback and he is so funny. Cant wait to have him in spring semester!",1
"Best Professor I have ever had! You definitely have to work hard to receive an A in her class, but you can tell Mrs. Feagin wants her students to learn & earn a good grade. Very responsive to emails, very nice, & very helpful. This was an online class, & I think I learned more than I ever have ina history class before.",1
"She's such a cool professor. She's very down to earth and willing to do anything to help you understand the material. She gives a lot of essays, but she isn't a very hard grader. She likes to really get to know her students, she doesn't just see you as an obligation.",1
"This professor literally reads off of his powerpoint and does not teach or explain anything in any way. By far worst professor I have ever and I highly recommend that anyone taking him to get out immediately and switch classes. Otherwise, you will be spoken to like an imbecile and will be teaching yourselves throughout the entire semester.",0
"Difficult to understand the lectures, frustrating to work on tedious projects that aren't graded for content (why bother?) A good suggestion would be to use the Blackboard site more, the calender and grade features especially would be helpful.",0
Barcley is by far one of my favorite professors from WMU. He still gave me an BA-A in the course even though I would pull practical jokes on him. Like sending his snap chat name to his former students and telling them to send him photos of puppies. On the serious note Barcley has helped me to develop as a entrepreneur and a great mentor. -AW,1
"I took this class as an elective. As a hybrid course, it was demanding of critical thinking which was helped to hone that aspect of my learning experience. The professor was very supportive of student learning and concerns.",1
Dr. Berkson is the best! I learned so much taking many of his classes while a Religion major at Hamline. Take at least one of his classes before you graduate or you are really missing out!,1
"Not understanding the negativity in other reviews. Dude's really enthusiastic about his field and knows what he's teaching backwards and forwards. Classes are very lecture-heavy, but I found that alright because he's a very good speaker. Take good notes and get a good mental model of the material, because it's hard to fake it on his tests/projects",1
"Dr. B was a good teacher. He cares for his students and wants them to all succeed in his class. He always makes time to help his students out whenever he can. His class is challenging but manageable if you work for it. Overall, Great teacher for the difficulty of the material.",1
"He puts 0 effort in catching the rampant cheating that was clearly happening with inflated test scores this semester. He could have at least randomized test questions, but it is clear the he is totally OK with punishing honest students.",0
Well respected and honest to his job. Tests you on stuff covered only. No tricks. Nicest guy and will care for you if you are sincere to yourself.,1
Amazing class- material and professor- wise.,1
"Was my first SCC class  summer '15, very glad I took it. She would tell us when the schedule would change & clarified information when asked. Her lectures were interesting & helpful(sometimes got little tiring), went along well with the book.  Her stories were funny too. You MUST attend class.  Reading the book helps, a lot. She knows her stuff.",1
This was at three-credit class with homework as a 5 credit class. But it was worth every minute of it. Stacy Lukensmeyer is always present and has lots to give. She makes herself available after class to help those who need it. I would take this class over again easily. The overall content of the class was incredible. We all learn to work in teams.,1
She is angry and disrespectful. She is the worst teacher at LAGCC. DON'T TAKE HER IF YOU DO YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET IT.,0
I've studied at 4 colleges in 3 countries and Kata is one of the best professors I've had. She is fun and dynamic with her lectures and reading materials. She is clear about what is expected and if she sees you putting in the time and effort you will do well in her class. Make sure to participate in class because that will help a lot. Great Profe!,1
"He might know the subject but has very poor explanatory skills, with a strong Greek Accent that you would barely understand what he's saying. NJIT has no other professor teaching this class so you are out of luck. My friends took this class before me and told me about but NJIT doesn't give a choice when it comes to his classes (696&647)",0
Avoid and take someone else. Was nit-picky about testing on irrelevant details that didn't aid in learning.  Top-down sort of teaching. Ruined clinical for many students I talked to. She may be a good researcher but teaching is another story. 23 of students stopped showing up to lectures because they said they weren't usefuljust read the book.,0
"Every poor review you read about Dr. Kovach is true and I cannot stress enough that no one is exaggerating. His labs were unclear as he didn't give thorough explanations. Remote learning in his class consisted of weekly ""quizzes"", which always had 38+ questions and we really only had the book to study from because his Powerpoints were so vague.",0
"Not the best teacher! There are better 125 teachers at Los Angeles Valley college. Im letting you know! Do not take this teacher , he has attitude and very discouraging. Dont waste your time on him! He uses fear to get the best of you! I recommend You drop Him right away, for your sake . Goodluck !",0
"IDK what everyone is talking about, I took Zann before him (same class)& Zann didn't care at all & I ended up failing. Jingpeng did livestreams so we could ask questions & actually taught. It was great! He stutters but I watched the streams afterword at 1.5& had no problem. He helped me out with projects t me turn some in late Give him a chance!",1
"Good class. Used online textbook, no hard copy needed. Pretty easy math class. Very applicable information.",1
"This guy is funny as hell and if you talk to him outside of class he will always help you out.  He also reminds me of Joe Pesci and curses almost constanly. He also doesn't put up with any crap either.  So, if you're a lazy ass bum like one person that commented earlier then don't take the class.  Probably the funnest class I've had because of him.",1
"She means well, but she had a very hard time with my class. Good deal of online work. There is a lot of self study needed for this class. Its almost like teaching yourself. ",0
"Professor never lectured, just posted videos. His exams were nothing like the homework, it was as if the professor was trying to trick the students rather than test their knowledge. Worst professor I've had at OU so far, he just didn't seem to care about his students at all.",0
One of the most well rounded and knowledgeable people you will ever meet.,1
"I'm a first-year, and doing online classes during first-year has been anything but ideal. Out of all my professors, professor Poole's lectures have been the clearest, and she has done the most to make ensure that we aren't struggling. She is a really good professor, and she posts her lectures in three videos of about 5 minutes, it's super helpful!",1
Great.,1
I absolutely love this man. He makes you understand what he is talking about and tries to make it interesting!! Take him if possible!!,1
Great  teacher. I learned alot in this class. The most interesting class so far in Psy,1
"Dr. Britton is fantastic! She is very helpful and wants to hear what you have to say. Prepare to read, cause the chapters are long and are well covered in the tests, specially the case studies. You have to work hard for it, but you're not alone, the GTA's are awesome and she is too. Totally recommend! ",1
SO. MUCH. CONTENT. You are essentially teaching yourself with this online class and in my opinion this class is probably better taken in person. Reaching out for help does nothing and feedback is very generic. The only positive is that Prof. Kumari is an easy grader on discussion posts but that only helps so much when the tests and quizzes are hard,0
"still not my favorite as a person, but good prof. was very harsh and nitpicky but the semester got easier as it went along. I went to every class, including optional review daysreally helped my grade. 4 papers, online quizzes, VERY short readings, and options for what to write about, easy final. as long as you put the effort in its bad at all.",1
"Great prof. Very nice woman, helpful with assignments, schedules individual conferences with you to discuss your story. Little reading, just writing and workshopping short stores. Easy if you are willing to do the work and are interested in writing and critiquing fiction.",1
The courses I have taken with him are all poorly organized. He would spend one class deriving a formula on the board for you and thinks that he is doing a marvelous job helping you understand. Most of the time he is overcomplicating things making his lectures a waste of time. He has a major stuttering problem and would rather just write equations.,0
"PROF. Ball is an excellent professor, he always makes jokes an make sure you understand everything before moving on to the next topic. I highly recommend him for this course.",1
"Terri is very nice, but she can't really teach. She just reads straight off the PowerPoint and doesn't elaborate on anything. It's pretty much up to you to learn the material on your own. Her tests and quizzes are all multiple choice, but she words her questions weirdly and asks things we don't really cover in class. Avoid if possible.",0
"Tancredi is really chill and passionate about music. The essays are really easy, just make sure to take notes during class. Its hard not to like him, hes sarcastic and funny.",1
"Really great teacher... his take on electronic music, its composition, and history has definitely opened doors for me in terms of writing & listening to music. His approach to teaching is skillful, plus he's a pretty chill dood.",1
"You will teach yourself in this course!!! If you want an easy class, do not take this course! There are three tests and you need to get 270 points total to get an A. Each weekly homework assignment takes 2-3 hours. He does tell you which problems will be on the test though and he lets you out early.",0
Amazing class ! He is understanding and his class is interesting ! Would recommend. I didnt think I would enjoy it because it was my first semester and politics you know . But I was not disappointed and it ended up being by favorite class lol,1
"Took his 230 class (precovid) and now I'm at UCSC, and my upper div biochem series has been SO EASY because of this man. He makes you work for an A, but its bc he cares and wants u to do well post-transfer. I would *NOT* being doing as well as I am in my biochem series w/o this man!! If your taking any biochem post-transfer: TAKE STAPLE'S CLASS!!!",1
"Lectures are extremely fast, no clarification. i would not recommend him.",0
Gives really good lectures but the test will hurt you.,0
Will Valley believes in pedagogical learning through experience and discussion. The LFS core courses are designed to shape students into interdisciplinary learners that do more than simply regurgitate information -- but rather to learn to prepare for uncertainty in the field. Lots of guest lectures. Group grading sucks but amazing prof.,1
"Ms. Kim is not the best professor to take for calc. She has a very strong accent, which makes it difficult to understand her. Even if she didn't have the accent, you still wouldn't be able to understand her. Do yourself a favor a skip this professor",0
"Pat is the best teacher in the Chemistry department, and one of the best at MSU. I was very pretty afraid of going into his physical chemistry class for biologists. He makes the difficult subject easy to understand and actually very interesting. I would any of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
"Very easy class. Tests are easy, presentations are graded easily. I love the way he spoke although half the time I didn't even listen. Great class though, you can learn a lot and it's an easy A.",1
I agree with the student before me - everyone gets an easy A - just show up. Sometimes hard to understand.,0
"I've had bad proffs before but Mr. Haze is very unorganized it's almost unprofessional. He talks a lot about irrelevant things and his directions are so vague and poorly put together be it verbal directions or even written. He doesn't grade timingly ,doesn't keep your grade current,and just generally isn't very direct or responsive when confronted.",0
"Dr. Bailey is very direct. I had him for lab and he wasn't exactly thrilled to help his students. One day he kicked us all out of the lab because he didn't want to wait any longer. However, he is a good professor if you pay attention.",0
"She does not explain text clearly so it is understandable. Doesn't finish explinations, examples, or sentances.  Luckily she doesn't grade too hard but be prepared to read the book and teach yourself.",0
"Dr. Corrigan is one of the greatest professors I've had at Emory. He's absolutely brilliant and cares about his students. He grades leniently, but the feedback is good. He tells you what you could've improved without taking points off. Lectures are incredible. You don't want to miss them.",1
"She was wonderful, if you apply yourself and try hard she will help you as much as she can. She is super smart and knows what she is teaching very well. I would highly encourage a class with her.",1
"Professor Gibbons was very hard to reach beyond class; she seemed to always have an excuse. Readings were a bit dense and lengthy, but were always discussed in class. On paper assignments she was a tough grader. When I finally meet with her to discuss the papers, she tore them apart and offered no constructive criticism. Would not recommend.",0
"One of my favorite teachers I've had in college. Very organized, enthusiastic about the topic, so much so that just walking into the classroom put me in a better mood. If you are taking UD Com courses I recommend keeping an eye out for Mark!",1
"Prof. Acosta was awesome! Specially with the transition to online learning. In the beginning of the semester when we were face to face, her lectured were straight to the point and she went at a decent pace. She answered all the questions I had in class and replied to all of my emails within enough time.",1
"This professor is way too hard to understand. He has a heavy accent and also goes way too fast for the average person, sometimes he even loses his self in the midst of the lesson. I do not recommend anyone to take this class. There is a good chance for an A if you can actually keep up with him, but other than prepare to fail.",0
Great Professor !! You will learn a lot of interesting things in his classes. Take all of them lol,1
"He purposely leaves out content in the slides so that you have to go to class. No participation grades. Interesting subject, uninteresting professor.",0
Literally the worst class I've taken at WCSU. Her grading system is a bust. She is a hard grader & makes you redo your work over & over again. Even meeting with her over Webex is a bust as she just tells you if you don't understand the work then settle for a lower grade. Would never recommend her. This class will end up giving you endless stress.,0
"So respectful, so friendly, and he is the best teacher I have ever seen in my life",1
"I was previously obsessed with Anthropology and took this class as a refresher. Unfortunately, Sullivan caused me to stray away from it from further on. Although he is a charming and interesting person, he is an extremely disorganized professor. Very unclear. Very off-topic. I would not recommend him as a teacher. Chat with him for fun",0
not alot og good to say about this class. Alot of busy work that requires too much time for a gen ed class. She openly embarrasses students that give wrong answers. Takes forever to grade assignments. you have about 12 assignments in progress at once very confusing. Poor time management. the only positive thing is if you do the work you will dook,0
Best person to teach me.,1
"4 major assignments miss one and you are done for. Class is very work/essay heavy. Be prepared to write a lot. No makeups, no extra credit",0
"I loved Patti- she was a great teacher. A real tough grader, definitely not a class to take for an easy A. Quite a few papers, but overall she really made sure I understood the texts and was always open when I needed help.",1
"I took her class for the F/W 2019 year and dropped it because she refuses to use any technology whatsoever. If you miss class even for a valid reason such as a doctor's appointment, a family loss, etc., you're screwed because she doesn't use moodle and doesn't post any content online. She often said she never uses her work email and never responds.",0
"I had him for dual credit History 2nd sem. of high school online. I work diligently and yet..on one paper I received 3 pts out of 40. The tests were on Sundays at 8pm and you had to rush to finish them. He didn't give that many assignments, so each low grade pulled you further and further down.",0
"Dr. Mueller employs a workgroup, experience based, workbook method in Ochem. It does not work. He doesn't teach. The class is absurd. I am getting an A in the class but only because I study the book and other professors notes. You do not learn much in class. He also comes over quite arrogant.",0
"The questions are confusing, the reading material is absurd, and the professor is extremely hard on grading. If you don't answer one part of the 2 or 3 questions it shows drastically on your grade.  Don't take this professor unless you're prepared for a stressful class andor major headache.",0
"Make sure you get a good group for your research project! She is VERY unclear on assignments regarding the project but lets you turn things in late and resubmit things, I was stressed out and worried about this class all semester, but if you are staying on top of stuff you're good. Create a relationship with Olga she is very nice and understanding.",0
"He can fall behind pretty easily. He has changed test dates and assignment dates time and time again. His webpage for assignments is outdated, which has caused confusion for us. He is very knowledgeable on the subject however.",0
"Amazing teacher. Hilarious, helpful, and class is a blast. He definitely goes out of his way to explain hard topics, as long as you ask him to. Challenging course, but he makes it fun.",1
good class!,1
"Worst professor I have ever taken. Contradicts most of what he says which makes writing any essay hard when you don't know exactly what he wants you to do. Always finds something to nitpick on, downgrades just because he doesn't like the way you worded something, even though your way isn't wrong.",0
"If you take her online, all she does is link you to Pearson's my math lab. I find it astonishing that she is getting paid to just have a link in blackboard without even making her own slides. If you can teach yourself statistics, its an easy A. I would recommend Doctor Kasha instead -- he is one of the best!",0
"Lectures mainly consist of powerpoints with the occasional group project. She is very nice and always willing to answer any questions you have. She tries her best to always find a book that is also free online. She has four tests a semester, reading is important but you can get by with skimming as long as you pay attention to the lecture and study.",1
"I really enjoyed this class. Dr Pittman was an excellent professor. She gave frequent feedback on assignments and in a very timely fashion. You can tell she genuinely cares about her students! The course load was not heavy at all, very fair. She had clear guidelines on assignments but also answered emails of questions were asked. Fun class.",1
"I think Mr Bannow means well, but he is not very helpful if you have a question. He horrible at explaining concepts at a basic level and gets defensive and angry if you don't understand. I have learned to just figure things out on my own once I get home! Do not recommend his class, unfortunately he is the only option at the downtown campus!! ",0
Hes a kool dood boi!!,0
Li Liu is homework heavy and her class is incredibly boring. It does feel like a chore and attendance is mandatory for a good participation grade in the class. 10/10 would not recommend this class.,0
"Best professor, I've ever had by far, the best class I've taken in college so far. He's incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and explains everything very distinctly. He tells you just what to expect and never tries to trick you on tests. The lectures are super interesting and he's very funny and charismatic, so you're captivated the entire time.",1
"unclear marking criteria, very slow and boring class. VERY picky when marking written assignments.",0
I don't recommend this professor at all. In her class all she does is scan the book and read directly from it. I can do that in my room on my own time. I have learned nothing from her class. Now I have to find someone else to help me on my work. ,0
Prof. Luallen knows what he's talking about but was not willing to slow the pace of class or cater to anyone not immediately up to speed on material. He moved relentlessly through lectures and delivered tests that had to be curved up from low averages every time. Mentions kegs/beers/frats when possible. His class effectively weeded me out of econ!!,0
"Dr. Lim is a terrible teacher and horrible lecturer BUT, and hear me out on this one, he lets a lot of things slide, especially when he forgets what he was supposed give you (happens a lot). I would reccomend this class if you are good with computers and don't mind learning material yourself...",0
"This is a pretty easy class but Dr. Sullivan is really disorganized which can make it harder. Almost the entire grade is based on a project which although easy is very time consuming and feels like a bunch of busy work. He's a very cool professor though, definitely your stereotypical quirky professor.",0
"I would never recommend Dr. Yang. She is condescending and rude. Unnecessary amount of work. You write, take, and grade your own tests that take HOURS. She is very particular and if things are not done her way, she is judgemental and will tell you you're wrong. Struggles to give compliments to her students or make them feel worthy! Avoid!!!",0
"Catherine is very personable and helpful outside of class. She takes the time to work with each individual. Most of all, she makes the work interesting and is super funny!",1
"I'm surprised at the F13 reviews.Marks explained that this had been his worst term in 20+ years due to many horrendous incidents. He was teaching in pain all semester and doing his best.  He sincerely apologized for not meeting his own standards. Even so, I thought the class was good and would take him again.  He cares. Earlier reviews show that.",1
"He can be pretty intimidating, but just let him know that you aren't scared and he'll love you.  He's still a tough grader though.",1
"Absolutely awful. All he talks about is how academia and the legal profession is left of center. This constant refrain only makes him look insecure and weak. Frankly, if he'd focus on the facts, the truth would be clear. Stop telling us how great you are, its unbecoming.",0
"Extremely helpful, kind, generous, sees that his students understand the concept. Hands out free lunches! One of the best proffs at Mac and definitely the most memorable.",1
"ENG120 is going to be a lot of work no matter who you take it with but she will make it painless, fun, and enjoyable. I've never loved English so much.",1
Dr. McCabe is easily one of the best Bible teachers I've had. His classes are challenging and involve a lot of work but you will get so much out of it. He makes learning a ton of fun and his lectures are very active.,1
"No, this professor is not funny, he's cringey. Quiz topics are to vague to predict for any of his classes, and will not provide you with any review whatsoever. You just have to flatter him to get a decent grade. Don't believe the positive reviews they're very misleading and understate his very apparent flaws as a professor, probably the him tbh...",0
"Completely missed entire units we were supposed to cover. I had her for ENG2 and wrote TWO papers. In ENG1, I wrote 6 papers, that says something. Also have never received a B on a paper until her class, only ever A's. Unfair grader, let's the class take advantage of her, not very helpful/seems annoyed with helping. Unclear expectations. Nice lady",0
Very hard course for a 200 level course. A ton of reading as for the quizzes even though it is open book the questions are extremely tricky. The VOH sessions in general are completely useless they do not provide any relevant information. I would not recommend this course.,0
"LA is an amazing prof!  she is super helpful and explains things amillion times until you understand it.  She always makes herself available for help if you need it.  If you have to take research methods, take it with Leslie Anne!!!",1
"Dr. Liszka is a great professor. University curriculum is supposed to be challenging, that is how we grow into productive adults. Those that complain about a class being ""too hard"" or the instructor as ""terrible"" need to reestablish priorities in life.",1
This professor is the most awful professor in this college. I totally don't understand why this college doesn't fire him. He frequently is too late to come to class and absent all the sudden. He is terrible as a professor and a business person. I am regretting to take his class. He can't care about students.,0
"Horrible teacher! The textbook basically taught you how to do math. He did one example of a lecture and the rest was up to you to figure it out. I love math, but he made me hate it.",0
Very nice guy though a bit on the quiet side. Easy A.,1
Mr.T is a great professor he has amazing lectures and the quizzes are easy if you remember and study from your notes. Id recommend if you dont like Chemistry.,1
I wish I would have taken another professor to be perfectly honest.,0
"Great lecturer.  Even if you aren't interested in the class, you will be by the end of it.  Lectures are very organized and tests are very straightforward with no tricks.",1
No Comments,0
I love Kim Sunsaengnim! She is very easy to learn Korean from and makes the classroom a fun but also very memorable environment. My Korean has come to me so much faster from her class than just trying to learn by myself.,1
"Great lecturer, interesting life stories before class, has a lot of knowledge on policy and law and relates it to everyday life. You can catch up with podcasts which is super helpful if you commute. Readings are not too long compared to other Classes and if you do them and go to class its easy to do well. Test are fair. Super interesting material!",1
absolutely amazing prof. best ive had in my 3 years so far. shes so passionate and knowledgeable about thermo that i wish i majored in cheme instead.,1
"This class seemed a little too difficult for a 101 class, and she definitely had big issues with clarity for me. Helpfulness was sort of hit and miss but she would at least try to help. Would not recommend taking her for your first college English class if you can help it.",0
One of the worst teachers I had.  Doesn't explain much in class.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone,0
"Great Teacher. Some of the math work can be challenging, but he helps you understand it and he won't let you leave until you get at least a 90 on your work.  He is very passionate about his work,and easy to get along with. I highly recommend him!",1
"I absolutely loved Mrs. Kurtz and the way she taught. I passed this class with flying colors. If you do the homework and practice tests and there's no way you can't pass. She was always so happy! The only bad thing is I wish I would've been told to only buy the online code, instead of wasting 200 dollars on a book that I never even opened.",1
Teacher is knowledgeable. Class is lecture heavy via PowerPoint presentations. Quiz and tests are HARD and cover a wide range of topics and concepts that are not always covered in class. LOTS of reading. LOTS of homework. NO lab time given in class. The class started completely full I think only 7 showed for the final exam. Be ready to work hard,1
"If you think logically and have a good math/proof based background, Dr. Buhler's explanations will make a lot of sense. Otherwise, you may have trouble understanding him. However, he is helpful if you have questions, and is willing to listen to student feedback.",1
"You have to attend class and pay attention, but as long as you pay attention in class (ESPECIALLY to the pictures and maps) you'll do fine on the exams. Pretty interesting course and easy connections are drawn between the different civilizations. Would definitely recommend as an easy A to science students.",1
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
"Cramer is brilliant! He's so intelligent and explains everything in detail, with that and studying a day before the tests you should be fine! He's very helpful and understanding, I handed in two papers late because of personal problems and he was so nice about it! A little monotone but he throws in small dry jokes, a very interesting class!",1
"Took her for Psy2012 she's super nice! If you hate people with an accent do not take her... lol she has a really bad accent but i really enjoyed her class! I took her 6 week class and unless your good at writing essays do not take the 6 week with her, its way too fast! but overall  her class was pretty easy.. notes are extremely important!",1
She is fun to listen to and makes me want to go to class. She is polite to her Students.,1
"Took Scott for Trig, would not recommend unless you already know what you're doing and would still hesitate to recommend. He's late for class almost every class. His answer to most questions is 'look in your notes'. If he does answer it there's not much explanation. If you take Scott and plan to understand trig, be ready to learn it from a tutor. ",0
"Tough grader, not helpful at all. Class moves very fast pace. Unless you are already familiar with accounting do not take this class. She expects you to know what you did wrong.  I think she has been teaching to so long she forgets some people are new to the accounting field.",0
"Great teacher!  She is professional & fast paced.  She really cares about the success of her students.  I learned so much from her, I highly recommend her for class, just be prepared to work hard.",1
"Had to drop this class bc after a 51% average on the midterm, he refused to curve and would not help ANYONE. I know like 16 other people who dropped. Material would've been fine with some sympathy and help. He's so unclear",0
The greatest professor I had met in UW!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Extremely lazy.  Worst teacher I have ever had.,0
"The most interesting professor I have met! He is hilarious and if you're having a bad day, your day will get better with his humor. He is very considerate and open minded. Listen to his lectures, do well on group projects, do the group labs and you'll pass.",1
"He is easy. You will pass, but he is EXTREMELY rude. If you are in the class to actually learn, forget it. He will tell you the answer and if you ask why, he will say don't worry about it. If you just want to pass with an A or B, take his class. If you actually want to learn, don't.",0
"WORST TEACHER I have ever had in my life. She went on about how we should already know stuff instead of actually helping us, and the worst part is that she made us do the Kanji on our own time which is terrible because thats my weakest area. DO NOT TAKE HER u will regret it",0
He can be quite rude and sarcastic at times.,0
His resources for success are not helpful and are outdated. Way too many things to navigate throughout the website. Feedback from work arent helpful. Prof responds emails in a long time. The online meetings have nothing to do with what were learning. The criteria and rubrics he left for us to work on for assignments are not resourceful or helpful,0
I took his Intro to Music class and it was the worst teacher I've ever had. Without fail each one of his quizzes would have one or more mistakes. He also refused to put grades in Moodle which made it difficult to know my grade. He is also hard to reach out to. He still has not forwarded the email he sent to everyone but me in my class.,0
"I remember when she had to cancel class early cuz she got food poisoning, but the fact that she still came to teach--- uh wow.  There are no online hw (thx the lord), instead you get w.s. that are straightforward and helpful for the exams. Quizzes are all online (lowest one being dropped). Take her, loved the way she carries herself and her puns.",1
BEST PROFESSOR OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. He is so funny and really cares if his students are understanding what he teaches. He is clearly very passionate about economics and presents the concepts in an extremely clear and digestible way. No homework if you take notes on the lectures and open notes for all assessments. 10/10 would recommend no question.,1
He is very good. He explains very well and has a very good interaction with students.,1
"Professor Juarez is the best! He knows how to teach and I learned a lot in his class! Take him! We had two papers, three exams, three discussion boards, and attendance matters! Also, he is funny!",1
"For anyone saying that Professor Fernandes is ""hard"" probably took PSY 100 looking for an easy A, but that's just not how this classroom is run. She actually cares about the material and cares that her students actually leave her class knowing the material. Of all the adjunct professors I've taken in the psych department, she is by far the best.",1
"Professor Hutton was a very tough grader, It was very hard to fix what she wanted on the rubric because she was not very specific on what she wanted she also quizzes you on what she likes. (EDU 104)",0
"Lectures can feel a bit long, but theyre interesting. Get ready to take a lot of notes because a lot of information is covered and slides are not uploaded to canvas. Readings are mandatory and there are reading quizzes (easy if youve done the assigned readings). Exam grading is fair and she lets you know what you need to do to improve.",1
"I don't know enough about Poole's teaching methods in-person, but online they were really poor. Two lectures split into a mandatory ""active learning session,"" and the other a link to a 10-20 minute long Youtube video. It was very disappointing because the topic of the class was so interesting, but it was difficult to learn with her teaching method.",0
"I like Dustin as a person but his class has horrible grade structure! 90% of your grade will be based on questions and problems that he has never shown you in class. And there is no homework, no tutor, cant see what you did wrong on the exams and Dustin is no help besides telling you that you suck pretty much. No joke, I hope you the best of luck",0
"fair teacher, but she's hard to understand with her accent, and her study guides are poorly done. In class her slides are barely done and she often talks about other things. The course in general didn't make much sense. we had a sub (dr. day) for two classes and learned more with him than I ever did with her",0
Hes a really nice teacher and super chill but the work in the class is busy work and so unecessary sometimes. He gets really upset when no one shares their thoughts so even if you arent thinking anything you better make something up. He grades papers as though its an english course and treats it that way sometimes as well.,1
Amazing teacher! He is one of those teachers who knows exactly what he is talking about and is able to explain things thoroughly because of his knowledge.  Studying is not really needed because he explains everything in class. People say he doesnt help u on anything and he does but when they are dumb questions he lets u figure them out on ur own,1
first impression was a strict b*^!h. turns out Roxy's pretty cool,1
Tests are easy if you do the take home test and review test (he only changes the number in class test) there are 2 easy assignments and like 3-4 homeworks and you need the textbook to do the homework. He is the best and easiest professor! Take him and get an A+,1
she takes her 1 credit class too serious and never replies back too emails :/,0
"Russell certainly cares about her students, but doesn't know much and lets her political bias seep into her classes. She called all Republicans ""Confederates,"" for instance, and when asked question about Shinzo Abe admitted she had never heard of him. She often got distracted in lectures, showing more Game of Thrones videos than actual material.",0
Clear in presenting. Clean slides. Nice.,1
Her class is not too hard but not helpful. She is nice but not really fair.,0
"Terrible professor. Assigns homework that isnt mandatory but helps your grade, then spends all of the class time going over said homework. He doesnt teach. Tests are super hard unless you know the material by heart (and great at it) BUT its probably the easiest class to cheat on tests. If you can find a way to cheat, take this class. If not, dont.",0
This teacher is not good i dont know how his reviews are high. Its a 101 class but he expects you to write like a person who majored in writing essays. He trys so hard to find things to mark you do with. ,0
His tests are online and okay. Take notes and read the articles. His lectures are extrememly boring but he takes attendance so you have to go.,1
"He obviously knows what hes talking about, the lectures were just really hard to pay attention to/boring. The quizzes after every class were really really difficult as well, even though i read every chapter and went to class. It was a lot harder than I expected and i normally love religion classes. wouldnt recommend",0
Lots of homework and quizzes. Had to read chapters of the textbook for very annoying facts and questions. Never even talked or met my professor.,1
When it comes to motivating students Professor Sekta is an absolute genius in delivering motivational speeches. I can't begin to imagine the number of lives this guy has changed. Respect.,1
We didn't learn anything because we never had lectures. During the 2nd week of classes she said she was canceling all classes for the rest of the semester. She told us we would all get A's as long as we didn't tell the Goodwin administration. Told us if we cared about Bio then we should just read the textbook. Please Goodwin do something about this,0
Had her for an online class. She was interactive and quick to respond. Good experience and have decided to take her again. Wish I could take face to face classes. I've heard she's great and I bet she is even better there than an online!,1
I took an Oprah class two semesters or so ago. It was a weird experience. I got the feeling that the class was offered to bolster falling enrollment in the English department. Since when is Oprah an arbiter of literary greatness?,0
"Dr. Mike really wants you to learn and succeed in the course.  He really prepares you for the exams as his section tends to be the highest of all the sections.  He has a dry sense of humor, but can be really sweet at times like a teddy bear!  Also if you are well prepared for umich, his CSP course puts you at the same level as everybody else.",1
haha could not get any worse. You're better off taking this class online because you're going to be teaching yourself the material anyway.,0
Only have 4 in class essays to do and 10 optional experience points. Attendance is mandatory you can not miss one day or your marked down. Also a very hard grader! the average grades are C+ on papers and thats even when you write a thesis with 3 examples and a conclusion with a so what.,0
"I LOVE HER. If I could take her again I would. She assigns a massive group project in the beginning of the semester which was easy. Gives 4 quizzes throughout the semester, and a research project with a group of friends that you pick. I learned a lot in this class and was not overwhelmed at any point of the semester.",1
Tbh his teaching is not that good. He can't explain concepts well and it is confusing even to me as a student who have taken calculus before. But he is very organized in his class and test schedules. He give extra credits. Has a lot of hw to do. Tests are not too difficult. Wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't already know the materials.,0
"DO NOT TAKE! As the poster below me said, his exams are IMPOSSIBLE. I studied a minimum of 10 hours for each exam and am struggling to hold a C. Dont bother asking him whats on the exam, he will just send the class an email listing the names of the chapters covered. He doesn't care if people fail and does little to help those struggling.",0
"My OPINION of Grachev as a teacher: The second-worst professor I've ever had. Not accessible at all. His grading policy is easy, but unfair. Nobody puts much effort into his class, but only approx. 1/3 of the class gets an A. If you get an A, you lucked out..if you get a B, too bad. If you get a C, you probably put forth absolutely no effort.",0
Worst WRC professor  ever. never explains always talking about random stuff. doesnt grade essays untill 2 months later. avoid her at all cost. her ratings were higher when i checked they must have been bs.,0
"Most sporadic, unorganized professor ever. Not clear, changes her mind. Your grade is dependent on whether or not she likes you, emphasizes group work then will give members of the group different grades. Plays favorites. Rudest person I've ever met ",0
"The exams are all multiple choice, and they are the hardest exams in comparison to the other orgo professors. That being said, expect a fat curve at the end 10% for F2020. If you want to learn, take another professor. if you want to get a good grade in orgo, take jasmin!",0
assignments are too hard!!!,0
"I've had professor Jacobo 3 times for 3 different reading classes, I got an A on all 3 classes. She breaks in down well enough for you to understand, and if you still don't understand she'll help you. You can tell she enjoys what she does by how she cares for her students. Sometimes she even gives extra credit to help bring your grade up.",1
"I'm horrible with statistics, but I went to class every day and tried. If you show up and at least try he'll work with you and give you a decent grade. There are a few tests, a group project, and some difficult SPSS assignments. Overall the class wasn't too bad.",1
"No rubric for any assignments and shows you how to do stuff, but doesn't teach what it is you're doing. Almost every class starts at a different time. Instructions and guidelines are unclear and vague.",0
"I took this class by mistake. The school signed me up for this coarse that i don't even need. He doesn't speak clearly, he is to fast, a lot of people dropped this Friday and Saturday class. He is not understanding at all, and he does not comprehend very well. He says mean things to students like oh well you don;t pass not my problem. Fire him!",0
"One of my least favorite professors Ive ever had at UWT and Ive been there for 5 years... Shes all over the place and is NOT accommodating to students that havent taken a political science class before. Way too goofy and unprofessional, and her assignments sheets NEVER match the online instructions or syllabus. This class was miserable.",0
"Les examens sont supers faciles, mais elle est chiante sur la correction des travaux. Ses travaux sont d'ailleurs pas clairs. Elle parle très doucement et ne fait que lire des statistiques et ses powerpoints. On apprend pas grand chose, et c'est un cours super ennuyant.",0
The worst structure ever! she can't even speak in English fluently... she can't teach and she is awful for master level! Unfortunately she is teaching the most important course in Econ!!!!,0
Great teacher and lecturer.  Makes class very interesting and plays alot of relevant videos to keep attention.  I genuinely enjoyed the topic.  It is not an easy A by any means though.  Paper was graded very harsh and the exams are sometimes hard to prepare for.  I enjoyed every class and never missed a lecture.,1
"She is the most horrible instructor I have ever had in my life!  She does't respond to emails, doesn't update d2l, doesn't grade assignments promptly, grading system is a joke, she grades and gives grades on however she wants, and she's not punctual herself but expects that from us.  Literally she makes you read the whole book. hardly lectures",0
easy online class. 5-6 discussion boards where you have to reply and also reply to 2 others. four quizzes 25 pts each. 1 midterm I final both non cumulative. you do need the book bc it is online. easy to pass quizzes if u have all the online notes he has open. not timed so can take how long you want. I would recommend bc its not that much work,1
"Maureen is a very hard marker! This course is a lot of work and participation counts! I suggest not skipping a single class and keeping up with the large amount of readings. If you want to do well, make sure you talk about feminism.. she will talk forever about that topic! Expect over three quarters of the class to drop this course by the end.",0
"Beware she will test you on information that she does not cover, nor say to read in text book. Also you can write what you think is the right answer, but she will mark it wrong. When you ask her for anything she is not approachable, and is arrogant and rude. She puts students down in and out of class, and shouldnt be a professor period.",0
"Horrible. Do not take period. One quiz had an insane hard problem. No way to study for it. Smart book takes way too much time. Double work, online and his. Doesn't grad anything. No idea where you are in the class. Doesn't explain the lab. Lecture heavy, but you are still lost. Had to withdrawal. Will take with Tang, he was much better for Chem 2.",0
"Professor Nuneville is very experienced in the law community, and she brings in several great guest speakers. Shes funny, smart and eager to help with anything you need. She also gives out free answers to the exams. A+.",1
Kinda awkward but funny. he can be a bit random at times. homework everyday and a straightforward guy. You don't understand something ask and he explains. Good professor hope to take him next semester for 121.,1
Very easy and straightforward instructor. You can show up and pass. She has a lot of in class writings but if you miss those she has so much extra credit it is impossible not to pass the class. Textbook online. Weekly journals. EASY Final project. Class was boring though. I just needed the WI credit. Recommend her to anyone needing an easy class.,1
Tom is a really tough grader that cares a lot about his students. SOC 206 is the reason I am a better writer today. Since SOC 206 I have taken multiple other classes with Tom.,1
"He is a complete waste of space what you learn in class does not pertain to the tests, which are based completely off the book. He spends most of his time rambling about nothing and I would have been better off taking a REAL programming class.",0
"I took Africana Studies with Cydya Williams during the Fall 2015 semester. She ended up having to go on maternity leave during the course, so we didn't have much class. Although, while we were in class, she was a fantastic professor. I feel like any student should take Africana Studies because this lady DEFINITELY knows her stuff!",1
"He would rather insult your writing than offer constructive criticism, which takes all the joy right out of creative writing. He forces you to write inside the box unlike better writing classes. His syllabus is hypocritical.",0
"Don't take marketing with her. Night class sucks the way it is; she makes it worse. She reads directly off the powerpoint slides the whole time, but takes attendance for points so you have to go. You'll have a marketing plan that gives hardly any direction & takes hours of outside work & still fail. Her tests are nearly impossible, so good luck.",0
Proffessor Williams is a good person but a BAD examiner. The class is hard The exams are open book open notes but hey .. the notes should be hand written only and the book must be physical one NO EBOOKS. his exams are hard with a 50 minutes time window .. you've better hurry!!,0
"Feel kind of bad making this review but I'm going to be honest... She's a nice professor but the workload for pre-calculus is a bit ridiculous. Anyone who has taken calculus knows that pre-calculus is basically an illegitimate subject, so to dump a huge workload of concepts that will soon be replaced is inefficient and tiresome.",0
"The lectures were SO boring, and class participation was essential - unfortunately, Prof. Cividanes has no idea how to properly foster participation, instead asking questions that were rhetorical or so random that we were at a loss. Expect a lot of work on Latin America (where he's from) He didn't even MENTION foreign aid until week 6.",0
"If I could add another tag, it would be ""Lecture Heavy""",1
"Vraiment un cours chiant, le mieux c'est de lire le manuel (lui la structure de son argumentation est complètement désordonnée). Pour sa défense, il connaît sa matière et ça l'intéresse... mais il arrive pas à intéresser",0
"Dr. Houston is not a good choice. You have to write EXCELLENT papers to get good grades. I had papers critique by professors and adults and till received a ""C"" on it. She doesn't seem like she wants to help and majority of the class left after the 3 month of school!! DO NOT take her because she can make you life miserable and it is not worth it!",0
"Great prof, dry sense of humor is good for the tough course. He's a genius programmer, if you need help, ask him! He will explain it. Some people think he makes students feel dumb for asking questions, but he doesn't, he cares about questions, so he will answer them the best he can.",1
"I thought this class was very interesting but the work load for the class exceeds the credit hours granted. I do not regret taking it, however I would not recommend the class unless you have lots of extra time to read the millions of articles required.",1
"Basically 6 speeches you need to make. Gives you the topic, you pick a subtopic, write about it then present on your day. Picks randomly on first day of presentation. One is a toast that is 2 minutes long. Never have to speak longer than 5 minutes. Recommend for majors who need to publicly speak.",1
I had professor Mathis for poetry and I had a solid B the whole semester(because only grade were the daily worksheets ) until our first test 12 weeks into the semester she grades unrealistic on the paper I got an F because I didnt meet the page requirement. When I went back to redo it I was literally 2 sentences away getting an A in rare,0
An immense waste of time!,0
This class pretty much followed the book exactly. It helped you understand the concepts of programming but the book basically tells you exactly what to do. The assignments are grouped into 3 deadlines so you have to make sure you can keep yourself motivated. He was amazing at returning grades quickly. I always got mine back within 24 hours.,1
"Lectures were a bit boring, and the readings covered basically the entirety of lecture so I found there wasn't much need to attend except to learn the answers to extra credit questions on the test. Discussion covers anything that they reading may not have had in regards to the lecture anyways.",1
all im gonna say is that the mean exam scores were in the low 40's for the ENTIRE CLASS. Highest was in the 50's.,0
"Professor was very intelligent about her subject, however, her teaching style was not fit for such a small class. Also, textbook reading was not only a requirement, we would be required to read in depth and analyze information, almost always requiring a second or third read to answer quizzes correctly. Homework was also extremely difficult.",0
"Expect an easy A. She gives study guides a few days before the test, and then gives you the answers. The questions  on the study guide are EXACTLY the same as the test questions. Her lectures consist of a lot of videos in which another professor is teaching. She also assigned homework that asks questions about the video, and questions from textbook",1
"Avoid this class as it's a lot of work. She is unforgiving of absences/missed work and personal needs. There are many papers to write, projects and debates. She says her online exams are hard and timed and most people fail them and yes, it is completely true. She favors girls/outspoken individuals. There are better classes out there.",1
"Easy A. Obnoxious amount of easy extra credit that will offset bad grades on exams. Final is NON cumulative! Yes, she is hard to understand, but her slides are very clear and exam questions are exact copy of what we did in class.",0
"Mrs. Thrasher is a very nice lady. Her class is very laid back and easy. My only complaint is that her class can get a tad dull, but other than that, she's great!",1
The test was irrelevant to both lectures and labs. Try to avoid.,0
Tests were fairly hard. She got a lot of problems wrong while teaching and would ask the students to check her. Would not take a class from her again!,0
"Professor Jasmin is great. His lectures are easy to understand and he posts everything online. His homework is optional but is a great learning tool. He doesn't require attendance however, he randomly will take it and give extra credit. he curves every exam and the final grade.",1
"great guy and good professor. However, the grading criteria in this class is ridiculous. it is almost impossible to get a 4.0 in this class. the test are not that bad but he gives no concept list ahead of time and there is zero extra credit in the class. if you are worried about your GPA and want to keep it high, I would not recommend his class.",0
"b/c a 400 level seminar, material was hard but he knew that class was not experts and did not expext us to be interested in medieval lit and culture.  very fair grader, a little out there but if you just do the VERY FEW assignments and hand in last paper.  he's very laid back and understanding",1
"I think Prof Arnold on here trolling. There is no way this many people in the class enjoyed the couse. I thought it was a bit of a waste of time. Did I learn a lot? Meh. I certainly wont remember this course in 5 years. The workload is a little much, but its not like anyone really teaches science anymore. If you take her take it during MLB season.",0
"I don't understand most of these negative reviews. He is probably one of the best math teachers I have ever had. He breaks down the information well and makes it easy to understand. I honestly think that if all math teachers taught math like him, more people would be better at math.",1
He goes over the course too fast. He went over a semester worth of course within 2 months. All he did was review for the last month. so bascially skip class? you will not pass or you can just by hitting the books forever. ,0
"Graham is awful. His quizzes are unscheduled and so much of the quiz material isnt taught before the quiz is given. The tests are worth way more than they should be. You can fall as many quizzes as you want and be fine, but if you do bad on one test you may as well kiss your grade goodbye unless you do amazing on everything else.",0
"Jen was an awesome prof for sculpture! We had a super small class, she really made an effort to get to know everyone on a personal level.  Her comments were always constructive and she really values participation. She really knows how to cut through some of the art major slacker bs. She's very knowledgable about the industry which really helps!",1
His response to the events of the pandemic was unfortunate and unprofessional. I was embarrassed for him. Seemed to lack any self-awareness. He provided no course schedule and his materials were unorganized. He was very vague in his communication and defensive when it was brought to his attention that a student was having difficulty with the course,0
"Also had him for higher plants and wetlands. Lower plants too. Excellent professor. Take his classes and getting out of the classroom is guaranteed. Might end up getting a little dirty or wet, but seeing and touching nature is much different from reading about it in a book. Tests can be difficult, so work on his practice questions. Enjoy!",1
"He does in fact grade like a jerk. Ethics is more about perspective, except that his perspective is what will give you a good grade. If you keep to his script and repeat back his own words back to him, he will grade you accurately and this class will be an easy A. I recommend this professor if you're okay with always agreeing with him. 1/10.",0
"Great teacher, the curve is very generous, if you go to class you'll have no problem understanding any content presented in the class.",1
"Online class.  The class is listed under Dr. McHann, the entire class is lectured, graded and instructed by Prof Frost (tough grader).  Gave all 3's because McHann was nonexistent.  Living Case Study of 30 pages, along with a cumulative final exam.  Weekly quiz's and weekly research plus group DQ's.  Spend at least 20+ hours a week.  Good Luck!!!!!",1
"she has a thick accent, sometimes hard to understand. She teaches you one way and ends up telling you not to do it that way. She knows what she is teaching but sucks at explaining the material. I wouldn't take her class again.",0
"She is such a sweet lady and a great professor. She goes out of her way to help you if you ask for it and genuinely cares. There is a lot of reading required for the class but you'll spend the majority of the class discussing it. There are reading quizzes, a midterm, final and a few papers but if you do the reading you'll be fine.",1
"I could not stand this professor. Dashley was one of the worst math teachers I have ever had. She was just completely rude when a student would ask a question. By the end of the semester, no one wanted to participate because she was so degrading in her responses. Also, how she grades your homework is ridiculous...",0
"She is a great professor she explains this very clearly and very well!! Any professor for a math class can teach you to crunch numbers but do you actually understand what you are going and why? Prof. Chambers explains this very well is is clear about how you will be graded she will actually say, ""here is how you need to write it for full credit...",1
"He is AMAZING!! We only had 7 media critiques (at least 350words except for the last one which was 2-3pages), 7 quizzes and online participation on Yellowdig (commenting, posting, liking, etc). I wish I could have taken him in person. If you have a chance to take him, I HIGHLY recommend that you do!",1
"Absolute gem of a professor, an old master of the natural world. Take one of his courses (Higher Plants, Lower Plants, or Ornithology) and you'll walk out feeling like you know everything on the subject. Field trips to all sorts of great places. Just MAKE SURE to study the practice questions and DO NOT walk in late.",1
"Honestly, wasn't terrible, lectures are pretty boring and the tests are all written questions, no multiple choice and it is not the easiest. The only reason it was okay is because he was super lenient about letting me turn in assignments over a month late and got full credit.",1
"He is a great professor, and goes into depth with his lectures. Just make sure you read the assigned chapters and the class will be a piece of cake.",1
Mrs. Liu is very under rated. She has an accent so it can be hard to understand her at first but you get used to it. Her tests are very easy and she is very helpful. She also gives a lot of extra credit. She was one of my favorite math teachers and I would take her again. ,1
"A great all around person/professor. She's amazing, easy to work with, understanding, attentive, passionate about her subject, etc. The material was great (3 essays throughout the semester). She never ever made the class boring. I seriously love her and worked my schedule around so I could take her again, she's just that great. Please take her!!",1
Prof. Shine is a good professor. Hes very knowledgeable and understanding. His lectures are difficult because most of the time he will go off topic then switch back to the topic. Its nice to have the option to redo your midterm until youre happy but its tough when you dont know whats going on. Lost interest quick due to confusion.,0
"She is one of the best teachers. I wish more teachers were like her. She's nice, caring, very respectful and shows that she cares about everyone in the class. She explains the material perfectly and she is very understanding and reasonable. I would have her as a teacher again. She's the best and I enjoyed the class. Thanks Ms. Cambic. BEST TEACHER",1
"Though her class is lecture heavy, she is very good at teaching. She draws out a bunch of diagrams to help you understand. The only reason why people don't pass this course is they don't memorize/study/put in the effort. I took this in the summer for 5 weeks. ASK HER FOR HELP!!! She's really nice. Thank you Dr. Yamazaki!! I learned so much!!",1
He's difficult to adapt to. Had a tough time following his lectures.,0
He has such a monotone voice and i tired to stay interest in the subject but listening to him puts me to sleep. He does crack jokes on a occasions. Gives you a chance to do extra credit. if you miss more then 7 classes your grade drops to by 12%. i wouldn't recommend taking him,0
Arrogant ***!,0
"Clear about what he wants from his students but its alot. Way too many quizes that require meticulous reading of 20+ page almost every week. 2-3 essay assignments each semester on top of that and lots of memorization (ALL of the quiz answers, plus notes) for exams. Too much for a core class even though he lectures well.",0
One of the coolest professors ever. She makes the class welcoming and uses humor. Keep up with your work and enjoy the class discussions!,1
"I took her for approaches to Literature. She is mean, unless you agree with her feminist agenda. I have to give her credit though, she was on a grading committe who changed my grade, so I give her a little credit for that.",0
She grades attendance. Need to present a few times. We had one test and the final was a group presentation which was easy.,1
"A rough prof to take, wouldn't want to take class with him again, cynical.",0
sooo easy and she's a really nice person. very passionate about the subject matter. Can be boring alot but still recommend,1
"great enthusiasm, really encourages participation,makes you really think,which college is about-She has a great career ahead of her-i plan on taking more classes with her-Hope UNO can keep her",1
"Had her for New Venture Lab, really horrible class. The whole class is your group project where you're forced to come up with a new product (something that takes people their whole lives) and make it ready to market in time and accordance with syllabus dates... Unrealistic. Professors seems unorganized as well. Regret taking this class.",0
"Dr. Schnittjer has a reputation for being a difficult teacher. (Something which he seems to be proud of) I wouldn't mind that if his difficulty was actually beneficial for learning, rather than just for the sake of being difficult. Dr. Schnittjer is a kind and very intelligent person. But, he is trivially particular about minor things in grading.",0
"If you are a student who is able to get by 100% on their own, then you won't have a problem with this professor. She offers modules filled with busy work and, if you do ALL of them, you'd do fine in this course. My issue with Ms. Dodson was that she's awful at helping. Doesn't give direct answers and refers you to StatCrunch or says ""it's simple"".",0
"Prior to taking this class, I've never made a B in college. She doesn't teach during class but instead talks about world events like others have mentioned. Grades excessively hard on essays and isn't available for office hours when you need help. AVOID.",0
"He's definitely a tough grader and does not specify at all if you mess up, you can be doing good and all of a sudden he starts giving poor grades and his feedback is nothing but initials of a chart he has. I wouldn't take his class due to the lack of professionalism and compassion as a Social Work professor.",0
"Bob was one of the best professors I have had here at Keene. His class was so interesting and fun that I never wanted to miss class. We did a lot of speeches but, everyone in the class had become more comfortable with speaking. I would recommend Bob to anyone, he not only wants to see his students succeed but also cares for them.",1
This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend....,0
Ms. Carter is  a character! She's is professional BUT don't think that you can take advantage of her cuz SHE WILL NOT HAVE IT! she did favor her Jamaican ppl a little toooo much though! I'm sure they all passed. Some times we would get a little off topic. but all in all she makes the subject fun and interesting. She's a tough grader also,1
"Without a doubt, the worst professor I have ever had in my life.  I got an A, and I have no idea what I learned...I only remember Gen Bio immunolgy after taking her rambling and disjointed class.  Impossible exams and useless lecutres...crazy stories and theories: she called the bio soc-bio med students ""useless brain-dead idiots of Rutgers"" hahaha",0
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN. materials he teaches doesn't make sense.,0
"Ala is amazing! Physics is a hard subject but if you put in the work youll definitely pass! She was always more than willing to help me. Utilize her office hrs! Shes also extremely caring and makes her lectures fun! Take her, you wont regret it!",1
"I had him for I.O. This is a class you must take notes for. He is hard but very clear on what he wants, and will help you.",1
This professor is honestly the worst professor I've ever had. He is very unfair and won't even grade your tests accurately from the university's grading key. Take this professor if you want to be screwed out of not only the grade you deserve but also your hard earned money.,0
Onononn,1
Dr. Falvo represents the ideal teacher that everyone should experience.  He is very insightful and helpful.  He was trained by the best and he performs as well as teaches as one of the best.,1
This instructor is excellent at explaining how papers and research projects should be formatted. He is very willing to help when you need it but he does expect you to do your part of the work. The skills you learn in this class will contribute to your success in other classes. I highly recommend this instructor. ,1
"This man is painfully awful. He is super sarcastic and when asked a questions he will revert it and at as if it is a comedy club. Even though no one will laugh he still sticks to his act. Not very good at teaching at all, flies through content and the whole class gets low scores on quizzes. Awful professor, would not recommend.",0
"This class is thought by 3 different professors. Her section is by far the most difficult. She seems to be really passionate about hip hop, black women, and feminism.   The other 2 professors were easy to understand, to the point, and actually made sense when relating back to the main subject of the class.",0
"In this class I read an ""article"" of sorts and review a power point twice a week. The power point was super helpful and I probably wouldn't have done well without it. If you put in the work and turn things in on time you should get a good grade.",1
"C'est la première fois que je prends la peine de noter un prof. Si vous avez la chance de prendre un nôtre professeur, faites-le. Il est gentil, mais pas claire. Tout le monde est mêlé en cours. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi il y a des gens qui l'ont bien noté. Je trouve le cours très difficile, la raison principale est lui. (J'ai eu 90 en sco1250.)",0
This guy gives a lot of tough love in the classroom.   He made the girl next to me cry one day;  but that is his style.  I would go with someone else next time. He is a little too harsh for my taste. ,0
Absolutely stunning and electrifying lectures!,1
"I've had her for fiction writing and travel writing, and she was wonderful in both. She seemed a bit spacey at first, but she's truly a knowledgeable writer who takes a lot of time to help her students. Her returned papers are always very thoroughly critiqued, she has a sense of a humor, and has a wonderful workshop format. A must-take for writers.",1
He's explains things very clearly and is always willing to answer questions in and after class. I'd definitely recommend a class with him.,1
"Be attentive, read all assignments, answer all points, do discussion posts by extra credit deadline, use GroupMe app for group interaction, be organized. Its tough but doable. His feedback is excellent. Assignments are clear. Great professor & supportive. You put in the work, you get the grade. 21 extra credit points. Fun & interesting class.",1
Get ready to read. The information we learned about was interesting but it was a lot of work. There is one paper and one quiz every week. Its a lot of work for an online class but it was interesting.,1
"Hardest professor I've ever had. I would not recommend taking him. He lectures straight off power points but flies through them like you already know the information. I didn't learn much from this class at all. Quizzes are hard. Tests are hard too, but are communulative throughout the semester. ALOT of studying outside of class. DO NOT TAKE!",0
"She is very passionate and knowledgeable about all things mental health. As a content instructor, the lectures are long and boring and she WILL test you on the smallest of things from her powerpoint and assigned readings. As an clinical instructor, I respect her advice and experience with mental health patients.",1
I had a wonderful experience in her poetry class. She is laid back and cares about you. Critiques were fun. Gives clear info on how you can improve your poems. Easy poetry assignments.,1
"Mrs. Zeoli is a great lady! I've always struggled (and failed) through math courses; she takes all the time you need to help you understand the material fully, is fun and engaging with the class, and teaches at a decent pace. Highly reccommended for anyone who needs extra help passing math!",1
she was a good teacher but she went way to fast even before sandy hit n it just kept get worst n worst that i gave up on the whole class soo she needs to slow things down because my class was 2 hrs she had plenty of time to teach us,0
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
She assigns readings and make sure you read them. She doesn't give study guides or lets you review the hw or tell you what to study. Make sure you go to lectures for attendance and lecture questions on tophat. Screenshot the questions because that's the only time you'll see them. Lectures are beyond boring personally but she's really into it.,0
Bad instructor. Did not teach anything. Says one thing then expects the other. Such a shame he is the only Social Work professor at South Campus. More than 3/4 of my class dropped him.,0
"Prof. Gentille is amazing. Took her Child Life course, and she's terrific. The weekly modules are easy (usually readings and maybe a DB post), there are 2 major hw assignments, 2 tests, and a final. Likes short answer questions, but tests are short and easy. She's very knowledgeable and involved in Child Life, so, if you want the best, take her.",1
Very caring prof! Would def take another course with him. The W  (writing) was frustrating at times though...Assignments were weighed quite heavily and tough at times.,1
"She isn't a tough grader but she's very politically correct. Often brings up discussions about race, discrimination, and the like which can sometimes make you uncomfortable. She's a decent professor overall.",0
"While she may be friendly, she is an unnecessarily strict grader. She told us once that student's complained that they ""never know what she expects of them"" and why that's ridiculous. She has very specific written instructions, but there are unwritten rules behind those instructions that you don't know until it's too late and you're staring at an F",0
Would take classes with him again to this day!!,1
She was a really good professor and I learned a lot.,1
He loves when is students engage in the discussions! Don't be afraid to talk.,1
"BEST English teacher out there. She has really simple assignments and as long as you complete everything on time and correctly, you will receive an A! HIGHLY recommend!!",1
"Thomlinson is straightforward in what he expects. Only grades on the assignments in lab, with one easy species project you present with your partner, and a final exam that is straightforward as well. Everything in his class is group work with your lab partner. So choose wisely. Also, you go to 2 fun field trips. It's impossible to fail the class!!!",1
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE HAD AT DAVIS. Im a math major. Temple is not a good teacher. He may be good at his research, but he is deplorable at teaching. Look at all the other reviews. I cannot think of one thing I like about his class. No textbook, no homework, no feedback, no communication, no planning. Only take him if you are an effective self-teacher",0
"Okay, normally college professors are bland and just assign assignments, grade them, and give help when asked. Professor Reese is completely different. He is outgoing, vibrant, and hilarious. I actually look forward going to his classes, and I never want to skip because of how entertaining he is. He is awesome and take him if you can!",1
"She is an fantastic professor! She makes you laugh, she wants you to pass (only if you do the work). There is no midterm or final exam, no quizzes, but you have to do a research paper about a controversial topic of your choice and you have to do weekly assignments about it. The class is really easy if you choose a topic you are interested in. ",1
"Not much things from lectures got correct on exam. I literally recorded his lecture. If you fall behind people in areas where others did well, you will regret it. Don't waste time to do better than others. Don't confuse him on projects by sorting things differently from others. He wouldn't ask questions and makes bad judgement. No one copies exams",0
Instructor Hebert is a very fair instructor. His course is very well put together. He knows his stuff and clearly explains everything. He makes the class worth taking.,1
"she is awesome ESL professor. she is caring about student a lot, lectures are amazing, the class is easygoing , help you a lot. I love the class that I had with her.",1
don't take her ever . she is not A PROFESSOR  i took her 240 with her last semester. i recommend you to drop her class if you register her class. Take another professor,0
He is a nice and funny guy but I would not take him again. He acts like he offers so much help but really doesn't. You really need to know your stuff to pass this class.,0
"Dr. Cheers definitely picks favorites and picks on students in the class. If you do not stand out in the class during discussion, you will be unacknowledged by him. If you do not participate, you may as well not be in the class at all because of how he treats his students. Definitely participate if you plan on taking this class.",0
"I really enjoyed taking her class, and that's saying something because I HATE math. I will admit there is quite a language barrier, but its really not that difficult to understand her if you try. She give loads of examples and helps with anything you need, you just have to ask. I took her during the summer and I got an A. Thanks Ms. Do!",1
"Class with Professor Perkins was a disappointment. He is knowledgeable about the subject, but he is so blinded by his own political views and biases that he cannot cover it in an appropriate way. Easily triggerable. I wasn't upset with my grade - just with Perkins's hypocritical views that found a way of targeting particular students.",0
No Comments,0
"Best professor ever! Incredibly interesting lectures, time flies by unnoticeably! Dr. Clasen is very knowledgeable and cares about your knowledge as well as your grade. Prepare to work and to study. I haven't worked that hard in a class ever in my life, but I exit it confidently with solid knowledge. Thank you, Dr. Clasen! You taught me well!",1
"She was a very energetic, helpful, and fair teacher.  Some students on here complain about too many surprise quizzes, but they weren't surprises. They are really easy and are every week and there is a lot of extra credit.  Are you gonna believe me or the person who meant ""can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly."" as an insult",1
"Swingley talks a lot about feminism in her classes. Even though it's an editing class, many times we talk about other things besides editing during the class period. I thought I was going to learn about commas, semi-colons, etc., but we only talked about how to address each gender in writing.",0
"easy money for him with no effort since he doesnt teach. Each week he post a few brief videos made in 2018 showing him working on problems, with no context. we have to post in the forum if we dont get it, only to just get answers from him or student with no explanation. just the answer... u learn nothing. lots of test not enough time to finish",0
"Wastes time on stuff not on exam. Forces you to talk in class. Rarely available for help, either doesn't answer email or takes a week, does NOT show up to open office hours. Takes forever to grade things - had over a month to mark a test and paper worth 40%, but only let us know marks day of the final.  Have to take his class? Skip, read the text.",0
"Probably one of the most unorganized people I have ever met. She always showed up late for class and had to fight with the projector. Lectured for about 4 weeks and then sat back and made us do presentations for the rest of the term. She was also not very helpful. The midterm and the exam, however, were really easy.",0
"Andor is a really great professor! I think that he is extremely helpful and a very interesting teacher, bringing excited to the usually boring topics of history!",1
She was a very good teacher and made Accounting easy for me to understand.  She is very helpful and I have heard from numerous students that she is the best Accounting teacher that Westfield has.,1
He is amazing! I would take him for every math course if I could.,1
"Mrs. Roche was very nice, but her class was very frustrating. The TIA tests are hard, but I used quizlet and passed them with As. She focuses more on Microsoft Office, but she does not really help you unless you look desperate. Taking this class online or with a different professor will save you a lot of time.",1
Truly one of the best professors I've ever worked with. He surely knows how to teach. ,1
"Gave papers made classmates revise or else itll hurt your grade.. didnt have class the last two months, still had essays due tho!",0
Nurick is really nice and has an open discussion format for the class. The only grades are participation and three 10pg papers which aren't that hard. Definitely worth taking for an MG elective.,1
"He talks down to his students; it feels like you're in elementary school. All of the assignments are busy-work. He tries to lead discussions, but they always fizzle. Very boring, poorly organized, and too many assignments you don't learn from.",0
"Not accessible outside class (and class was ONLINE!) Brings in a salesperson into lecture just so he can sell us LSAT prep material. I literally PAID to listen to an hour-long ad. Is strict on deadlines, while she herself never follows them. She gave us feedback on our papers 24 hrs before the final was due! Avoid this course. A true WASTE of money",0
Makes learning stress-free. She keeps us up-to-date with emails and is a fair grader. Gives great feedback. She knows her subject and has useful things that she emails us with. A great online course.,1
"she does not teach much on grammar, but she teach you a lot on your oral and let you practice on each class. go to her class if you would like to practice your oral, or avoid her if you want to learn more about grammar. moreover, her exam is more about listening in grammar test, but oral exam is easy",0
One of the worst economics professors i have come across.,0
"Très bon professeur, très expérimenté et explique assez clairement. Il a une personnalité agréable et est plutôt flexible. Faites beaucoup d'exercices du manuel et vous réussirez sans problème.",1
"Sara is a very nice person at heart, but as a teacher I think it is hard to have her. Her grading system is very confusing and doesn't allow for students to keep track, and she makes the class very lecture heavy, which often leads to boredom from students. There is definitely a way to make the class more interesting. Wonderful person, not teacher.",0
It was all Greek to me. When he teaches he expects you to know everything there is to know about Finance when the class is supposed to be an Introduction to Finance. He made it harder than it had to be.,0
"Tends to use internet videos as a tool to teach students and requires students to participate in saying what they learned from the video. If not, a pop quiz is promptly given. Lectures given are over  PowerPoints that are recited word for word.  Doesn't express much enthusiasm in the field of psychology.",0
"If classes are remote for fall term I highly recommend to not take this class, he is not flexible with the time requirements for the speeches, it is really not a public speaking class if it is online. He takes weeks in order to grade speeches and the midterm exam. Lectures relate to the class but I would wait on taking the class if things go remote",0
"He uses Wiley for his class but he does not teach us anything because in every class, he just writes the homework on the board and does not explain the reasoning behind it. Sorry, but not for me, especially that this information will be on the CPA and I gotta teach myself all of it.",0
The lecture was good. Just don't miss the class.,0
"Just go to class and you'll do well. Write solid papers and turn them in ON TIME, EVERY TIME. Go to every paper review day and you'll make an A. Just do the work. Pretty funny, obviously loves what he does.",1
"Literally the best professor I have ever had.  Took Alex for Calc 1 & Calc 2, and she tought me so well that I tutor others using her lecture style.  She presents material so well that an idiot could understand it.  Her homework is hard but she spends HOURS outside of class helping students.  Sacrifices PHD work to assist students. A+++.",1
"Big nerd with a big nerdy ponytail, and an awesome professor. Genuinely loves what he's teaching and it rubs off; very helpful and understanding. One of the best at GCC",1
She made me HATE literature.,0
"Burke's a great guy. Took his advanced historical writing class and had to write a 20 page paper. (If you are a History or Social Studies Major at NKU you will have to write this paper no matter who you take 389 with) If you pay attention to his instruction and the resources he gives you, you'll make it. After the draft, the class is a breeze.",1
"Denise Preston is a really nice and caring person. She kinda goes over the basics in class that I knew in high school and builds upon them. If you thought you were a good writer, think again. Denise Preston will take the time to look at your paper and give good feedback on how to revive it.",1
"If you take one of his classes be prepared for class you will be called upon to answer questions.  You will be embarrassed in front of the class. Be prepared to provide supporting data for answers.  There is alot of discussion as part of this course, but I did not find it to be a supportive environment.",0
Good at presenting concepts clearly in class - especially grammar. gives good feedback as well on exams. Wish we had more communicative activities though. Helpful and doesn't make you feel bad for asking questions.,1
"Dr. Besing is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's always willing to help you outside of class, and while his classes are a lot of work, you'll get a lot out of them if you're willing to do it. His lectures are very high value, and really worth attending. His sense of humor is unique, but he can be funny. Occasionally.",1
"He has a hard time staying on task and I never knew what he was trying to explain. However, once you go along with the craziness, you might enjoy it. He is very easy going and easy to get along with, but understanding his ideas and assignments is another story..",0
BORING,0
"This class, like many of the other reviews show, is a complete mess. There is no communication between temple and his TA's which led to one of the 3 graded assignments to be graded wrong. The only assignments worth grades are the 2 midterms and the final. He rambles a lot and goes off topic in lectures. I only learned from the book. STAY AWAY!",0
Class is not impossible. Do the homework. Study like she suggests and you will have an A. She is a different breed of person but she cares.,1
"Morra is passionate about the topics he covers and wants students to succeed. There are three essays that students are graded on and as long as you take notes, its an easy A. He makes learning fun and of all my professors, he is easily my favorite since he made me actually want to go to class each week. TAKE HIM!!!!",1
"Took him for Lessons from Europe. It was an interesting class and held in a large lecture hall in the AB building, but seats would fill up quickly so try coming in a few minutes early! I enjoyed the class but it's so easy to find yourself scrolling on Facebook a few minutes into class. Notes weren't as thorough so thats where the readings come in",1
She is a very nice teacher she just gives a TON of homework and outside work she is a very fair grader. She will take late work and is very clear about what she wants you to make. As long as you follow directions and take her advice you will do just fine in the class. If your are a not a art student she takes that into consideration while grading.,1
"Her micro class was the most frustrating college experience I've had so far. Her teaching style was just reading off of a power point, I didn't learn a thing during lectures, or in lab. The only way to survive this class is to memorize the textbook word for word. The tests were ridiculous as well. ",0
She is a very hard grader. My team and I received and F on our report. She has her own vision of what a paper should be. Be prepared to not receive the grade that you want.,0
"Overall, super easy class! Make sure you attend every class, she may give random assignments. She is friendly and easygoing. Returns papers back with great feedback. ",1
come prepared to participate or dont bother with this Professor. He earned my respect by making himself available outside of class. He gave me solid advice and that advice is why I'm still in college.,1
Basic assignment. But if youre into not learning this is your guy. Hes nice but very unclear. assignments are very easy but it gets difficult when you're taking a test and have no idea what hes talking about,0
She's a good teacher. She has some good stories and she has a great sense of humor:) recommend,1
Dr. Schaller is inconsistent and confused a group of adult graduate students who had high hopes for her.  Susanna Schaller is not helpfull and profoundly undergrades her students.,0
"Teaches by saying ""Look at your notes."" No help when questions are asked. If you have a good grasp on the subject before the class, he is fine. Not too much homework. If you do not know calculus 2, do not take him.",0
"Terrible professor. Wants students to communicate with him, when you do, if you are incorrect or reflecting a difference of opinion, you are berated in front of the class. Goes off on irrelevant tangents for lengths at a time and then complains that the class is so far behind. His study guide is in his own verbiage so it is difficult to research",0
I took this course as an elective credit. I have strong conservative values and Sara really looks to challenge those and expects you to become a different person. Some topics I strongly disagreed with but felt in a liberal space I couldn't speak up. I found it hard to write the papers for the course b/c there was no material to support my values.,1
"Mrs. Bolt is very knowledgeable about her field of study, that being said i would have to say she doesn't enjoy to teach. She grades extremely hard for a class that is suppose to be simple and it doesn't help that she is unorganized. Mrs. Bolt expects the world of her students but doesn't put in effort into the class",0
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
"Little to no reading from the textbook needed. Class attendance is necessary for passing. Record lectures, listen to the recordings and write notes on the ppts at the same time. Incredibly easy, studied one evening for one of the exams and still obtained an A. ",1
"He's a fossilized piece of animal dung, worst notes ever, hardest tests ever, absolutely no respect for students.  Goes out of his way to make you feel like an idiot if you ask him a question or answer one of his.  Curses technology when he can't figure out that you need to plug the cart INTO THE WALL, NOT BACK INTO THE CART.  PLEASE RETIRE.",0
She is horrible! Doesnt care about the students overall and seems nice at first but be aware!!!,0
Amazingly boring.  Arbitrary grading.,0
"Good prof, He is old fashion and doesn't use lecture slides. Exams are more then fair, he supplies you with a short list of possible short essay questions for review and chooses a select few of those exact questions to be on the exams. Create a google docs with everyone in the class and this course is a easy 80!",1
"Started on campus, was very lecture heavy, speaking almost entirely in French from day one. Transitioned to an online course (Covid) and the lectures/teaching stopped for the most part. Zoom sessions were mainly review for what you learned on your own with VHL/HW. Offers little to no help outside of the classroom. Don't recommend.",0
"He likes to extend class periods as much as possible. He is a very tough grader on homeworks and quizzes. His grading is not very clear and is entirely graded on his judgement. He was much more helpful outside of class. If you're struggling in class, go to the MaRC and it should help.",1
"A lot of online homework and quizzes. The textbook is also online. He is very nice but voice is low and monotone. All notes, pretty much reads off the PowerPoint. Just gives you a basic explanation about the problem. You have to teach yourself. Good thing is the midterm was exactly like study guide so make sure to study that.",0
"Dr. Vohs is great. He's a brilliant professor in my opinion. He's the best lecturer I've taken to date, he's clear and concise, he has good analogies to help students understand what he's teaching. He really dislikes swearing, so avoid swearing in front of him (I accidentally dropped a swear word and now he isn't particularly fond of me)",1
Interesting class but alot of work. You have a TP and a quiz every week. Content was interesting but there is a lot to do.,1
"This is a lecture based class, but you can print the notes he posts online with blanks. Very long winded. Was a interesting class. When I had to write any papers all he graded was the content, he didn't really care as much about the grammar. I enjoyed his class very much. He actually enjoys teaching and LOVES when you ask questions!!!",1
"Class felt somewhat disconnected. She's not really receptive to feedback. If she asks a question in class and nobody knows the answer, she will act as if we are all mentally incapable. Grading is average, she gives partial credit. You must do your homework, she randomly checks it for credit. Quizzes nearly every class. Exams are relatively easy.",0
"THIS DUDE IS THE BEST! Take all the classes you can with him!! He brings in the best guest speakers and truly inspires and motivates you!  His lectures are actually *get ready* FUN TO GO TO! He passes around an attendance sheet so you have to go, but he is funny and relatable in class! Tests are kinda hard, but he gives you exactly what to study!",1
"Great learning experience. Has very unconventional ideas and not mainstream marketing. Good course to understand how to analyze a case from all perspectives including finance and micro-economics. He mixes his cases quite well and his case solutions are intriguing, though may not be practical. Also, clarifies some basic concepts of micro and mktg.",1
"Although Professor Tang's lectures may be boring, he's a fun professor and gives good feedback on group projects. He was very clear on his expectations for the project in what is was to perform.",1
Professor Perez is an amazing professor. Present information clearly and logically. Lectures reinforce reading. I would take him again.,1
"Very odd grading scale, grades off what she thinks is right instead of using the correct rubric",0
No Comments,1
Very nice prof but shouldn't be teaching anymore. You think you understand but during the exam it feels like you don't know anything. Would recommend taking another prof for ECON 227 since it's mandatory for Econ majors. Go to his office hours and work A LOT on your own if you want a good grade.,0
in all honestly she is a good professor but omg she gives out way too many assignments. they are never ending and totally unfair!!! if it wasnt for her excessive assignments she would be a GREAT professor. its like she thinks we have nothing better to do. humanities is BORING!,1
"If you submit your work, she will give you full point for the class work and the home work. You'll get an A, if you do your work and read the book.",1
"Ruder was an okay teacher. My one complaint is that he graded the 2nd half of our project the day that the 3rd part was due, which was not helpful at all. It's like a teacher handing back your rough draft the day the final one is due, and then complaining later that you didn't make any corrections. He is a good teacher, just needs to grade better.",0
He is the one of the BEST math teacher I had in my life. He makes math so easy to understand and he teaches the fast way to get the answers. I took him over the summer so he was more lenient but I would definitely take him for any math that he teaches lol.,1
Challenging classes but great professor.,1
Awesome prof and person. His exams are always really fair and you know what to expect. He always brings in examples from his industry experience and it really helps relate engineering to the real word.,1
Dr. Mckenna is A M A Z I N G!! He is a GREAT. You will be missing a looot if you don't take his classes.,1
supportive and harsh to. you can tell who she likes and who she doesn't. Seomtimes has attitude. Doesn't respond to emails or follow-up on things.,0
Don't bother to take the online class.  You will receive little to no specific or constructive feedback on assignments.  You will do tons of useless busy work.  She will have you write rough drafts that she will not bother to grade or provide feedback on before the final draft of the paper is due. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.,0
"HARD CLASS!! Exciting course, but she really doesn't try and make the class easy. If you value your gpa don't take her. Her tests tend to be really tricky. Fun course but really hard! 2 midterms 1 final 2 papers.",0
"Dr Souaiaia is really knowledgable and friendly. He is accessible at office hours. I look up to him. Make sure to go to lecture! You can't find answers online. Discussions aren't really helpful, which I hope will be improved in the future. I also wish we could get a schedule of lecture topics and dates in the syllabus.",1
"Laid-back guy. Doesn't seem to take teaching very seriously - he canceled class twice to stay home with his son and took a whole week (3 classes) off to complain about the election. He also canceled the final since he ""doesn't believe in exams"". Class is mostly discussion.  Will single out anyone w/ a different opinion, and offers trigger warnings.",0
"Paul is a really good guy, and as long as you pay attention in lectures and study for the two midterms and final, you'll do fine. He is really knowledgable and passionate about the music industry. There is one essay and a few discussion posts and book quizzes, but thats it.",1
"Class is disappointing. Supposed to be a translation class, but time is mostly spent on grammar and vocab. We have to figure it out mostly on our own. She often starts class by yelling at everyone over things that annoy her. Required story book we all purchased has never been opened. No real instruction on translation techniques.",0
financial economics. dont do it.,0
"All of these negative reviews are exaggerated. Yes, it's a difficult class, and he isn't the most ""warm and fuzzy"" guy. Nonetheless, he's very fair with his expectations and you learn A LOT. His priority is preparing you for the CPA exam, which is much more difficult than this course. If you put in the time you'll be fine; it's not rocket science.",1
"I have taken Dr. Bamford three times to date.  She is a wonderful human being, she loves cats and also she is British!  She is very compassionate and loves her job.  If you need a humanity, take her... if you need an elective take her.... She is the BEST! P.S. You will never buy a book for her class.",1
I took her claas and got an A- with little effort. EnvConc Psych was very chalenging though. She's the most kindhearted person ever. I was also her TA. I can't wait to take more of her courses. easy going and laid back.  Her grading is totally straight forward if you do you assignments.  She's young and fun and loves her job.,1
try and avoid. doesn't respond to emails.,0
Dr. Lorton is an amazing professor. I took him for Calc III and he explained the math in ways that were easy to understand. He goes through every step thoroughly so if you are paying attention then you will be able to understand everything pretty easily. Do your homework and study for the tests and you'll be fine.,1
DO NOT take this teacher. He treated me so bad and it was only my first semester. He blamed me for his mistakes countless of times and had always called me out for mistakes he made on my page.  i have never disliked a teacher so much in my entire life. & i wouldn't want any one to be put in this class.,0
"If you want an easy class with not much work, do not take this professor. She has high standards and does not ""dummy down"" her grading because you are at a community college. You will learn a lot if you are willing to work hard, but her standards are high. Other teachers are much easier, but you won't learn as much.",1
"Professor Rasheed is an amazing professor. His exams are simple, so long as you study for them.  Attend class everyday and you should be fine.  Just do the work!!",1
"Don't recommend his class what so ever unless you have time. If you have a busy schedule DO NOT take his class but if you think you are capable go right on ahead. Just know he doesn't give direct answers to your question and he advises that you memorize his syllabus. In class he has really long lectures, pretty big reading and writing assignments.",0
pretty easy teacher but man boring. I couldn't help sleeping. I would have to leave to buy chocolate just to stay awake in that class. If he made the class more interesting maybe I would have taken the time to actually go to it. He is a very lenient teacher and I did learn alot but only when I was awake.,1
"Mr. Ball is the BEST math teacher EVER. He is funny, nice, and wants you to pass. He explains things so perfectly that it's hard to fail. Everyone should take him!",1
She is very sweet and a good portion of the textbook she goes over in power points in class. All the stuff she goes over in class are always on the test and if your not doing so well she allows a lot of extra credit,1
"This professor provides absolutely no value to his profession. He is not available and fears confrontation so he simply does not answer questions. He teaches a subject that promotes being open-minded; however, he is fiercely close-minded. I would not have taken him had I know his history, which is found by typing his name into a search engine.",0
"Dr. Childs is great! I thought logic was going to be very difficult but Dr. Childs does an excellent job explaining the material and making sure everyone understands! She's very understanding and hilarious. If you want an awesome teacher and an A, take Dr. Childs!",1
She manages to turn an interesting subject into an arduous journey through monotony. Her accent cuts right through you and trying to take notes is beyond frustrating. Ridiculous amounts of reading that really doesn't provide a relevant look at current culture.,0
She is the head on Information Systems in FGCU. She is lazy does not want to teach. She is unethical and uses her power to control students. She even creates conflicts in the schedule for students drop her class. She refuses to help and she gives projects with very little clarity. Out of 8 chapters she only talked about 20 minutes about 2 of them b,0
Professor Bogdan leads by example.  He is extremely fair and truly cares that everyone does well.  Hes a pro,1
Horrible,0
"class is easy. tests are online. essay was a final, open notes. she is very nice and knowledgable but I feel like I didn't learn too much from this class. If anything, my spanish got worse. This class isn't a grammar course, but we didn't learn anything. culturally yes, we did learn a bit, but she was boring at times too. never uses a syllabus.",0
Ms. Parker is a teacher that has you teach yourself but expects you to be at every class. She tends to have favorite and tends to them more than the rest of the class. She gets mad when she has to answer questions from people who arent her favorites and usually makes the rest of the class figure it out themselves.,0
"Studied extremely hard but didn't understand anything (as a chem e with a 4.0). In a normal class, I would've failed but got a B because of the huge curve. Brown's presence makes the whole NCSU chem dept look bad. He should not be a professor.",0
"I really like Kathy, and I enjoyed this class, but it's not easy. A lot of reading, a lot of homework, and a lot of tests. On the plus side, there are also cool field trips.",1
"Marchetti's ""flipped classroom"" is the worst. She doesn't teach, and you're graded on the precision of your labs. Aweful class. Avoid at all costs.",0
I loved the style of lectures which were more of a group discussion. It was easy to get involved with the material and give your opinion without judgement. Course was 8 weeks and included a heavy workload but it was doable. Definitely love her teaching style.,1
"Mr. Brooks is a very good teacher. Although, if you do not want to learn I do not recommend taking his class. There is a heavy workload but it pays off in the end. I learned more in Mr.Brooks class than I did in 12 years of school. I recommend taking his class.",1
"Lois is a trainwreck. For an instructor of a class with the stated aim of ""open-mindedness"" and ""objective analysis"" of political systems, she does nothing but  opine. This leads to a poor educational environment. I don't know how anyone could or would recommend Lois' classes to anyone",0
Super smart guy. But doesnt really communicate his knowledge to students well. Not everyone is capable of teaching and this guy is one of them. Just reads the slides to the class then passes out a worksheet. Be prepared to do loads of reading and work on your own. The only reason I passed was having seen most of this material in high school.,0
"lectures are 3 hours and most of the lecture is examples of examples without examples lecture are an hour He is a harsh grader he does make a study guide for quizzes He makes his test straight from the N+ textbook He has ridiculous turn in times, sometimes 2 weeks others 3 days He doesn't give you any lab time, you have to go to the lab on your own",0
"Professor Bauman is the best writing teacher I've ever had. She is extremely helpful and really wants to see her students do well. She expects you to work hard, but her class is fun and you'll learn a lot. I highly recommend her as a teacher.",1
"I had professor Seymour for both History 101 and 102. I am a person who hates history, but his classes are very much enjoyable! History 102 was the best out of the two and he really makes lectures interesting! The work load is not heavy at all. 10/10 recommend.",1
"Wanda Jones is a very nice lady, you can tell she genuinely cares about her students. However, I would not recommend her to anybody. Her teaching style is not adequate for this course. She requires you to show up to every lecture, yet she rarely ever lectures. You have to teach yourself and if you get stuck she is not really good at clarification.",0
For those of you that want to pass English 1A there are many other instructors that teach this class with the student's success in mind. Stay clear of this instructor unless you want to learn English within prison walls. You will buy many books that you won't use. Be prepared for boring lectures.,0
DO NOT take this class if you're in chem 121. The professor is not good at teaching that class. She is disorganized and does not go off the syllabus. The tests are ridiculously hard and you would get a much better grade taking Van Huizen. My lab partner is in VH's class and is much better prepared for everything.,0

"Very hard class. I am a non history major and found this class very difficult, I read all the books he assigned, but had a hard time doing well on his test and quizzes.  The class is interesting, but not worth the low grade that is to be expected.",1
"His tests were almost impossible unless you reallllly understand Physics.  If you made a 7.5/15 on the test, you had a A.  The stuff on the tests isn't covered in class.  I would recommend taking someone else!",1
"I had Dr. Thomas during her first semester teaching. She was amazing! She truly cared about the students in the class and wanted each of us to succeed. It was a lot of studying for the lab quiz each week, but it is doable. She made the more boring or in depth material fun and relatable to us. Also, lots of opportunities for extra credit.",1
"This guy is awful.  He was bad for EE 312, and he's even worse for this class.  He now uses quizzes to see if anyone is paying attention, or at least, showing up to class.  My biggest peeve: he issues a final for the last day of class instead of during the scheduled exam date.  It's unfair, because you can't finish a final in 1:15.  What a jerk!",0
She doesn't remember what she has/hasn't told you so there's a lot of material on the test that she didn't go over or expects you to read in the textbook even though she didn't teach it. You really have to study hard to pass and make good grades.,0
"By far the worst and most boring professor I have had here. The lectures drag on for hours and it's essentially a compilation of random facts barely stitched together. The two exams are made up from the books, and the notes in class are worthless and confusing. The lecture is mostly just rambling and videos. Do not take for an easy A.",0
terrible.,0
"Unfortunately, this is Dr. Strange's last semester teaching, so this doesn't really matter. However, he's an awesome professor! Hands down the most knowledgeable in the field of fisheries. His lectures are entertaining and relevant. He always has funny stories that make the information more relevant to your everyday life. Truly inspiring!",1
Attendance is mandatory. She used to be the director of ESL 1450. Its ironic for an English Second Language instructor to be a racist.,0
"Temple expects students to know really difficult proofs. He can't explain anything to save his life, and his class is awfully managed. He says he's going to cover one thing in the syllabus, and ignores his plan in lecture. In discussions, TAs cover completely unrelated material. This is why professors should not have tenure.",0
"Matthew truly cares about the success of his students, as well as the topics he discusses in class. This class was eye opening and I learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about. Matthew created a class community where we felt like we could discuss issues as a class. 10/10 would recommend him.",1
"Did not enjoy class, talks about theory and derives equations rather than doing an example.  Tests are on applied problems, not theoretical.",0

This course is a tough one. Sister Derby takes a very long time to grade the projects which makes it difficult to improve the next project. She's not very helpful until after the projects are turned in. Again this is frustrating when you are not aware of the many resources available to research until after the project is turned in.,1
"YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP IN LECTURE. Unless you get a good T.A., you probably will have a tough time in this class. He goes off on tangents a lot and is very monotoned. He doesn't use slides either so it's quite boring. Grading consists of 2 midterms, a final, and weekly quizzes in discussion. All of the test are essay questions.",0
"This is NOT an easy A. If you are not fluent in Spanish and want that A, you're going to have to work hard. It's crucial you show up to class! She follows her syllabus religiously and does not remind you when quizzes or assignments are due. It's important to keep track and be organized!  She's tough, but a great professor. ",1
I don't know how the E.E. Department allows this kind of professor to get tenure. He barely speaks English. His lectures are so boring and useless that he now has to do pop quizzes just to make sure that people come to the class. He also is not fare grading. It?s a shame that people like him teach mandatory courses in the curriculum,0
"Prof Epstein is a nice guy and clearly smart, but has NO idea how to teach in a concise manner. His lectures were all over the place, he didn't hold office hours and was hard to get ahold of, and the material on the exams wasn't made clear beforehand. DO NOT take this class if you're just looking for distribution credit/not interested in ling",0
"let me start off on saying how im a straight A student my whole life. i managed to FAIL this class. she eye ball grades each lab, you'll never get higher than a 6/10, lucky if you get a 7. her tests are crazy heavy and the average is always 60%/lower. she does not respond or fix anything, she'll mark you 0 on accident and wont fix it. SAVE UR GPA!",0
"Pretty cool guy easy class. Two open book test, small paper like half a page,and a group debate. Pretty fun overall he has an accent but that's easy to get over definitely take his class. :)",1
Bad professor.,0
"I took Professor Chris for the Winter semester. He was fun, enthusiastic, and his lectures were awesome. He gave cool study guides before the exams which were multiple choice and true/false. Prepare yourself to do outlines for your speeches which are timed, which was the toughest part of the class for me. Overall it was an excellent class!!!",1
"Awesome teacher. Helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and kind.",1
Excellent teacher.  Does NOT try or want to be tricky.  Is available more than her posted office hours.,1
"I don't know what others think, but he is a very good teacher.  He was very even and fair in presenting material, a good mix of visual and lecture too.  Don't believe what others are saying, just take the class and see.",1
"Read previous notes; yeah she gives extra credit if the quizzes are on time but it doesn't really help. Did ALL the Quizzes & Homework w/ a 100% + Extra Crdt, didn't matter! Her test are TRICKY & the Final, TRICKER! 1 post stated she doesn't review test, SHE DOES NOT! Expects U 2 know what she's suppose 2 be teaching! U Will Teach Yourself!",0
"Maria is awesome. 224 was a class that I dreaded and really wanted to take it with a good professor. I am so happy I went with Hegbloom. Her class was fun and she made the work tolerable for such a dry subject. If you still have to take 224, I recommend Maria. She will push you to become a better researcher and a better writer.",1
"she is the worse teacher i have ever had, Her course material is unclear, she does not reply to any of your emails, she does not post anything that makes sense or streamlined with the material she gives. does not keep in contact or even post your overall grade. forget about extra credit, there is none,  she just throw things online and not clear. ",0
"Amazing Prof. She was always helpful, clear, and concise. Her feedback from essays was so helpful, my last essay I received a mark in the 80's. She is dedicated to helping students and wants to see you succeed. She answered all questions I had and didn't leave me guessing/questioning anything. Take English110 with her. Lots of reading but worth it.",1
Great class.  Lots of writing.,1
"Professor Peters is one of the nicest professors you will have in college, I cant say enough great things about her. She made the material very interesting and did her absolute best to engage the class. She is also extremely understanding and kind. I dont really understand why the rest of the reviews are negative, she is an amazing person!",1
Very disorganized. She teaches at the level of the most proficient member of the class and lets the rest fall behind.,1
"This class is the worst spanish course that I have ever taken. We have so much homework for every class and the quizzes are terrible. She is nice, but this class is not worth it. I have gotten an A in every spanish class up to this point. The quizzes have things we never even talked about and the sakai page is so unorganized.",0
"This is one of the best teachers I have had in college. She is by far the most helpful if you are having issues. She will work with you and is understanding if you miss an assignment, just talk to her. She does tend to get off track a lot but in the end we learn the material and have a good time while doing it. She can be strict if someone acts out",1
Attending lecture is not helpful. He always assumes you know something. He puts high expectation on you but does a really poor job teaching us in a understandable and organized way.,0
"He is awesome. He copies and pastes homework questions to the test (only 4 assign. & tests total). He seems to be the only one that understands we have jobs, relationships, and other things other than class so he gives you time. He super nice & makes class interesting. Take his class!",1
"Lectures a lot, but the material is vital.  Every time I was thinking of a question, he would end up answering it a few minutes later.  Very thorough with his explanations. Participation is a heavy factor and only 1 person will get a 100%.  He's fair and willing to help.  E-mails took a few days sometimes.  3 papers 3-5pgs.  Final paper is 5-8pgs",1
"Brett will go out of his way to not help you when you need help. I spent a month trying to arrange a mandatory meeting because I can't make his office hours, he never once suggested a time. Passive aggressive about my EXCUSED absentees until he tried to fail me because of them. Avoid unless your a perfectionist who can stay on his good side.",0
"This guy was a terrible and is always ""right"". He will doc you points for things he didn't ask for. We can't read minds.. you will also never get 100% on anything.I have already learned all of the material before but found a way to doc me points",0
"Dr. Anderson is a very good guy, & it's obvious he cares for the students, but class material is ridiculously difficult.  I personally felt like there was too much information for one semester.  I feel like his BIOL 3250 class should be expanded into 2 semesters because of all of the course material.  There is also a huge and hard paper at the end.",1
She doesn't try to work with you. She has extremely high expectations of her students. I almost feel like she's setting us up for failure. Teaches pretty quickly and hates when you have a question. She also hates repeating herself. I highly suggest you not take her class.,0
"Hes not a bad professor, if you pay attention youll pass. If you participate youll get an A. My problem was with his lectures hes very encryptive. But when it came to the midterm and final he it was a lot less confusing, and its one of those finals that youll pass if you have been doing the readings.",1
She is a tough grader and cares way too much about the assignments. She does not provide enough feedback on how to improve your grade and needs to be a little more relaxed.,0
Trust me. AVOID. Worst experience ever.,0
boring,0
This class wasn't hard as long as you did the work. 2 discussions a week taught by the TA which was fine because they are all really knowledgeable. The semester is split into 2 by having 2 main essays you work on. Plenty of time to do them with a lot of opportunities for feedback. If you take some time to work in this class you'll get an A,1
If you can avoid him please do. He takes forever to grade work and his feedback is not very meaningful or insightful . He does not respond to emails in a timely fashion and if you are lucky to get a response its a condescending one.,0
Does not let you make up missed homework everything online and she doesnt clearly go over everything such as tenses,0
This is the best prof ive ever had. he helps you understand everything so clearly and is so kind. He cares so much about his students and your actual understanding and success in his class! He is the BEST!!,1
I'm currently taking her course online and it's literally the worst online class I've ever taken. I can't keep up with the readings or the assignments. There's no explanation on most work and the modules are hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend anyone to EVER take this class.,0
"If math isnt your strongest subject, please avoid taking her. She is very inpatient, impolite, and very short worded. She also gives lots of homework most of it is hand written homework. She teaches very fast and goes off of the book. Makes you feel very unintelligent when you ask a question. I ended up dropping the class because of it.",0
"Boy oh boy, I have zero clue hoe this man has been a professor for so long. This man intentionally fails his students. I spent 3 hours doing a homework assignment for his class to only receive a 2 out of 10!! I've never met a professor who does this. I'm happy he's retiring, he definitely won't be missed. Definitely appealing to get my money back",0
No Comments,1
She is a very lazy and boring professor. Her power points are packed with information and it is nearly impossible to remember everything for exams. She does allow unlimited notecards on the 2nd and third test. Despite being difficult she took our input into consideration and tried to make the class more fair after the 2nd exam which avgd in the 50s,0
"So, any good comments must have been writtenby this prof; clarity is absent; speaks in phrases, not sentences. There is no cohesion. Should be a libray science instructor or a scheduler for author appearances at bookstores. All her classes are EXACTLY THE SAME! DOesn't anybody check what goes on at ECSU?",0
"I highly recommend takin this class with Wei-Chiao. She has an obvious passion for the subject and is committed to ensuring the experience of the class is effective. It was valuable to receive feedback from her for each assignment. The textbook is a good guide, but most of the content was lecture based. It's all about the interview assignments.",1
Professor Abarra was a very good teacher. He did seem to have his favorites even among those people who did not always show the most respect to him. He really enjoys what he does and conveys that in his teaching. I was scared of statistics before his class and now I'm ready to take it on.,1
The professor is definitely educated when it comes to philosophy but tried way too hard to make the class difficult. I took him for summer b term this year. There is a timed reading quiz for every single reading assigned. He assigns multiple readings every week. About 8-11 assignments due every week. All quizzes and exams have original questions.,0
"the material for this class was very dry! there is no homework  and you do not need a text book either. There is a quiz EVERY week on the material but he does tell you what it will cover. take advantage of making notes on an index card and using it on the weekly quizzes.  Overall, good eye candy.",0
I loved Dr. Carter's class. He is always prepared for class and each class has something that will make you think. One of the best gen eds you can take.,1
Horrible. She is hard to understand and her grading is ridiculous. She has no sympathy and does not care if your not doing good. Barely gives any practice problems. Grades after the curve were still in the 50-60% range. Avoid at all cost.,0
She was so fun and made class very interesting even at 8 am. She wants you to do well and there's no reason that you should get below a B in her class. She keeps it interesting and as long as you talk a lot with the class she's happy!,1
class taken in summer no papers test are all open book even ones done at testing center but they are  difficult which is expected. Extra credit assignments are offered and I would advise you to do them for those few extra points exams do matter so try  to score high. overall the professor was ok and the tutor was very accessible which is helpful,1
"Dr. Hines makes classes entertaining and fun compared to a solid lecture. Also, he helps whenever help is needed. Definitely recommend taking him for any course. Homework is every now and then and really helps highlight the material.",1
"Bremer is a chill professor, however, exams are extremely difficult for a 101 class. He expects you to know everything, and I mean everything. Tests are 50 multiple choice questions and 50 points for short answer. Pass or fail, it's up to you, final is the easiest. Gives breaks and puts on relaxing music. Do the extra credit and well on lab quizs.",1
My opinion is that this professor is not strong in the classroom.,0
She's a pleasant lady but she expects you to remember waaaaay too specific of material that isn't relevant to archaeology. It's more just memorization.,1
She goes out of her way to prevent you from reaching your full potential. She is arrogant and laughs at students who are trying their best but may just need some guidance. She expects you to be a professional researcher like her. Avoid her if possible.,0
"So the class itself is not that hard, most of it is common sense. BUT she is horrible at reading and answering emails, She sends the same email to everyone thinking that they are talking about the same thing. It was supposed to be a two day online class but then she changes everything to one day. Discussion board she grades harshly as well.",0
"She is the best! The sweetest lady you will ever meet. If you just pay attention, show up, don't break he rules, and do the homework you will get and A. Take her!",1
"Grading is not clear... professor does not follow Her own rubrics or syllabus, do not take this professor",0
"The most boring class I have ever taken. He lectures every class. You look around and 90% of the people are either asleep or watching Netflix. This class is nothing but abstract, liberal ideology that makes no sense. But its an easy A honestly.",0
Don't even bother.,0
Professor gives great feedback. Very detailed lecturer and if you go to every class and try he notices.,1
"I actually learned a lot in this class. Dr Barber was awesome - usually in my online classes I dont ever talk to professor but every time I emailed him he got right back to me. I would recommend this for anybody that wants to be a teacher, some stuff I knew already but a lot was new and he made it pretty fun by having to go do Twitter chats",1
"This woman is amazing at teaching, LOVED her!! Highly recommended. It is alot of material but she does a great job at explaining and she also has reviews twice a week to help you if needed outside of class.",1
This has been the worst class ever. Spent countless hours studying and doing his homework. Do not do not take this class if you are not a music major! He loads you with sooooooooo much homework its just busy work and so hard to understand. I usually get As in all my course work and have never struggled in a class so bad.,0
"Professor Tanoukhi is clearly knowledgeable in her field, and a very intelligent woman. However, her teaching style is confusing and often muddled. Does not highlight concepts, but attempts to derive them from quoted text, and does so rather poorly. Rely on the TAs for this class-- they will save you!",0
Took the class about 3 years ago and had to take it 3x.  It was very difficult but Mr Crittenden was extremely helpful and I still appreciate it and hold him in very high regards.  He is by far one of the best teachers GCC has to offer.  Anyone would be lucky to have him as a teacher.,1
"Dr. Bret L. Keeling is one of the best college professors I have ever had. He genuinely cares for his students. The assignments were extremely straight forward and as long as he knew you tried, you got an A. There is literally no reason why you can't do well in his class as long as you show up and hand things in on time.",1
"Super amazing women and super easy class. Theres rarely any homework and the midterm and final were both open book/open laptop. Easy A. Plus, Prof Marshall is an absolute sweetheart. She genuinely cares about the students and wants them to learn. She shows a real interest in our lives and education which is awesome. ",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! She was terrible before the Covid-19 pandemic and worse after, she has heavy tests, high standards and isn't helpful when you're struggling and need help. If you take this class except to teach yourself, she isn't reliable or helpful at all.",0
"Class started out with 35 students, 5 remained and only 3 of them passed. I recommend taking Newman, he is more thorough with his teaching. It is a hard class, I get that, it's college, but Kula's teaching habits weren't for me. I dropped his class and took with a different professor and it was 10x's easier to comprehend.",0
Do not take this class if you aren't passionate about music. She is an inexperienced professor who does not structure the class well for those who aren't familiar with musical concepts. Discussions aren't helpful for the quizzes and she doesn't post lecture slides. A lot of the people in my class agreed this class is too difficult to be a GE class.,0
"I have not taken this class, but I have looked over what she has taught from friends. I am a local administrator for many large businesses in fort myers and from what I have seen she knows nothing about networking or teaching it.",0
Avoid unless you know VHDL. Won't assist you past the first part of the project. Everything else is easy but you will only get a C if you can't do the projects. You will not learn anything.,0
He likes to make lots of jokes and make fun of his students which is cool because we take him as a joke as well. His class is stupid easy. If you do the bare minimum you'll pass with 100% He canceled class often and would end class after 30 minutes. Little to no hw throughout the semester. You can tell he's not passionate about teaching anymore.,0
"This Professor wants to prove he is smarter than everyone else. He tries to make questions tricky, add questions on material you haven't studied yet, and when you ask for help his reply is always ""read your syllabus"". Just so he can say he did not lie to you, to purposely make you fail!!!",0
I had Dr. Gelderloos in the 1970's and I consider him to be a great teacher.  I am in my 60's and he had a real impact on me in regards to how important it is to preserve our environment. One of the best professor's that I ever had.,1
So encouraging,1
"He will not, ""he will not..."" round your 69.15% to a 70.00% even if you are were close in passing the class. Find other Professor that is more considerate. He will not answer your email or ""will just say grades will be out soon!"" You been warned to not take any of his classes. Dont say you never read this... good luck finding a better professor.",0
"She is a good researcher, but defintely not a good lecturer. My mind went blank soon after listening to her. Lecture slides are pointless and reading the textbook is a must to pass. Even if you do so you still miss points due to the unncessary details and confusion you will see the MC questions during the tests. Be warned.",0
"easy but his structure of the class is confusing and unorganized. you literally are completing online h/w course on your own, it grades you automatically. Due dates to assignments were all over the place and he made it difficult to find them and just wants to look at the syllabus. Theres more to teaching than stating to look at the syllabus.",0
"Her class is not so hard ,but she gives a lot writing assignment and the films for the class are an hour .",1
"Tests are based on lectures and he doesn't upload slides. But if you go to class and pay attention, you'll know all the information on the tests.",1
"Dr. Yamazaki is a very knowledgeable teacher and knows the information she is teaching. Occasionally she has a hard time putting the information into understandable terminology instead of bio/physio jargon. She will help her students as much as she can, but you need to put in the work and asks questions if you have them",1
His grading is the worst.  He does not answer quistions.  He explains for himself.  Always make mistakes and then says you can fix it at home.  Too long exams where you cant do them on time.,0
"Class was unruly and prof was not good at managing it. Class was regularly disruptive and off task. I don't think we finished one lecture in its entirety before I decided to drop this class. The subject matter is dope and prof seems to know it well, but it did not translate well into her teaching methodologies.",0
"Prof. Hansen always talked about really interesting topics and if you take good notes and go to all the lectures, you will pass his class with an easy A. His tests are 5 short essay questions but you only have to respond to 4. All the questions should be easily answered if you pay attention and take REALLY GOOD NOTES in class.",1
"After reading the other reviews here, I think we can all agree on the fact that she's absolutely horrible at answering Piazza posts. She never actually answers your questions, she only dodges it, asking you to find the answer yourself (I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't need clarification!!) Lazy and very rude with her comments. One of the worst.",0
"one of the worst profs i ever met he is soo boring staying awake in his lecture is impossible ,the starting material is not bad then it gets hard his midterm was really easy but the FINAL WAS SOOOO HARD  i have no idea where he got it from .AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"Brown is fine. He keeps his voice low and is very reliant on slide presentations that have a LOT of material, and if you miss a day you miss a lot of information not included in the actual pres., but WILL be included on the test. I found him interesting enough, but the class was very boring with him. Tests have a lot of material on them.",0
"He was my advisor and happy to say that he's also someone I email every so often to say ""hi."" His classes were very hands-on, engaging discussion, and use of multimedia. Always willing to help, always available and is an asset to RSC!",1
"This was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken.  Bailey is extremely knowledgable but does not communicate the information well.  Chemistry is hard no matter what, but I got very little help in class.  I had to go to the science lab, and even had to hire a tutor to get a c in the class.  I was thrilled with the c too!",0
"Overall she is an alright teacher, my biggest problem with her is she will only give you credit for the factor label method. The way connect teaches makes much more sense to me but my grade struggles because I have to do it the factor label method, because that's what helped her in school. Other then that she is nit picky about grading.",1
Great professor...not the most exciting class due to material. Got an A by going to class and taking notes bc he tests on a lot of what he says/draws. He uses a clicker system but not often. Tests on concepts and not memorization. Drops your lowest test. Textbook is not necessary. Little curve (2%) so don't depend on it. Not a bad class!,1
Dee is a great teacher but has a smart mouth and is extremely rude towards some students... She makes a huge difference in students and has her picks. Her rude CAN BE VERY OFFENDING!!!,0
"come to participate. come prepared (but then again what class doesnt require you to be prepared). sold guy helped me when I needed help. not all professors will take their time to help you, this guy will if you ask him",1
"Professor Wiley is a great teacher! Follow his syllabus and you will do well. He goes out of his way to explain things and will help you with your assignments before you turn them in. If you have him as an option, definitely take him!",1
"Zero direction.  I learned more from YouTube lectures regarding her assignments than I did from her. Having to show up to her class was a waste of my time and efforts.  I was not there to learn about her personal life, or to hear my classmates read paragraphs of short story handouts. We are ALL adults who know how to read! -Borning",0
"he doesn't care he put resp. on his TAs.  TAs are not helpful. He is unorganized.  His lec. notes don't have title and are bad hand writing.  The TAs were not helpful to answer the questions and hehimself does,t care to listen.  At last some TAs curved and some didn't.  If you don't have to don't take this class. It lowers your grades and takes tim",0
She is unfocused and unfair.,0
Possibly the single stupidest individual I've ever been unfortunate enough to encounter.,0
"He is a very self-righteous person, doesn't believe that he consists of imperfections. Claims he is the best writer, and can do anything better than anyone. Excessively talks about movies and shows. Loves to play Devil's advocate but isn't open minded enough to see other sides. Offers suggestions but will tell you that you're mediocre. Conceited.",0
"Took this class last semester and hated it. I've always been good at Chemistry but prof ams makes very simple concepts hard to understand, and hard concepts impossible to understand by underexplaining. His labs are the same way. Hes really smart but cant teach. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES",0
"WORST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE!! AVOID HIM!!! He's awful, the grading is completely inconsistent, he's hard to understand because of his accent and he's extremely rude sometimes. Don't expect help from him!! He is an awful professor and I wish I never took him. SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN!!",0
Love this class! Professor Hernandez is caring and gives feedback on time and make sure you understand the materials. Just make sure you did all the homework problems and you sure will pass the class and have a good grade.,1
I did not like human animal. She is a tough grader and picks favorites.,0
"Gravitationally challenged, says 'tickle me elmo"" when projector breaks, makes bugs buuny jokes ""use the stragety"" and says calc can be used for human problems too. LOL this guys hilarious but knows his stuff",0
"Very poor lecturer. Makes many mistakes and tries to do problems ""his way"" which ends up confusing students even more since his explanations are never adequate. Too bad there is only ever 1 section for the classes he teaches so theres no way in getting around him. Learn from the textbook or youtube and do ample example problems for each section.",0
The course goals outlined in the syllabus weren't achieved. He went on an unprofessional rant against his colleagues and can be rude to students. I wouldn't have taken this class if it weren't required for my degree. I'd avoid his classes at all costs. Required to buy a textbook that wasn't even used.,0
"Now that I have become a teacher myself, I find that Prof. Warner is the instructor I most frequently find myself emulating.  His conversational and humerous demeanor make him an ideal professor of communications and his upbeat approach to every class, every day is commendable in the profession.",1
Professor Niu is a really nice person and her intentions are to help you but her teaching style is bad. She does not explain in a way you'll understand and may be unclear to comprehend. Do not take her if your math skills are not sharp.,0
also read my rating for her on www.virtualratings.com its more extensive,0
Public Health: Class is fun. Article review and quiz every week.  Midterm and Final are take home essay questions.  Attendance is mandatory.  Fun Class. Great teacher.,1
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
One of the best professors I've had. Usually hate an hour and 15 minute lectures but almost always loved listening to her. She also grades extremely fair and is flexible with a lot of the work as long as you email her. Would love to have her again!,1
Two Exams. Super lazy professor. Doesn't seem to know how to use tech or online systems correctly. Tried to conduct the class via E-mail. Only good thing is that the class is based on two papers. But don't expect to learn anything through his lectures. It's a self teach type circumstance. Oh and he looks like Bob Ross. No joke.,0
"Exams have a lot of ""trick questions"" for no reason. It is also a little troubling that this man can barely form coherent sentences/spell basic words correctly is critiquing writing. In my opinion it is ridiculous to pay thousands for an online class when it seems that your level of education is higher than the professor. Gross",0
"Quizzes are basically all trick questions. Multiple choice questions on the final are mainly straightforward, but some questions are tricky. The short answer questions on the final are about the most irrelevant details out of all the material that was covered (when you're studying, everything you think is useless is probably one of the questions).",0
"I took the full year shakespeare course and barely went to class. ended up with a 70. the lectures that i did go to were very entertaining. he's really funny and witty, he's definitely not a boring lecturer. however, the lectures were definitely too long. ",1
"One of the best math professors I've had! She is very willing to work with everyone and different learning styles. Sometimes the concepts can be confusing, but simply asking her a question will lead to clarification. I would recommend taking her class strongly.",1
"Takes points off for the wrong hue of yellow. If creative choices do not align with her own, points are lost. Spent most of class on non-class topics. Breaks lasted upwards of 45 min., covering new topics with 5 min. left of class, running over. Welcomed outside students into her class to interrupt lectures. Take with someone else.",0
Amazing professor!!!!!,1
Love love love her! Eng 212 is generally a hard upper level class. But she made it so easy! We barely had any work. Her tests and assignments are so easy. She appreciates it if you participate but its not crazy mandatory. Take her you wont regret it.,1
"3 clicker points every single class that are graded on accuracy, not participation. Her lectures and slides had little relevancy to the tests; class notes rarely helped on the study guides, everything was in the textbook. That being said, tests are not too difficult and the study guides, although poorly organized, were helpful. No paper or hw",1
He's Chinese and has a heavy accent. He is very hard to understand and is bad at explaining things. He words everything weird. He should not be allowed to teach an advanced class like biochem. Do not listen to the positive reviews. The only good thing about him is you can get points from hw and he gives 5% worth of extra credit.,0
Don't take orgo II with him if you actually want to learn anything. He forces you to memorize things and his exams don't test your understanding of the material. Also he is so useless at office hours and makes you feel stupid when you go there to get help. Your textbook WILL BE your best friend so be prepared if you plan to take this dude!,0
John Shon's class was a pleasure to be in. He made Accounting interesting and showed he was very knowledgable about the subject matter. His grading criteria is clear and the quizzes and mid-term were easy if you studied and paid attention in class. A good man and pretty funny as well.,1
makes a lot of mistakes. Funny teacher. Likes teaching. Never take it in the morning class.,0
The best teacher ever! She is so caring and she knows a lot of about public speaking. I definitely would love to take her course again. I highly recommend you to take her course!,1
Not good,0
She was really sociable. She joked with the students sometimes too. She was esy going.,1
"She is very knowledgeable, experienced, well read qmd caring. I was very impressed with how prepared she was. She was kinda funny.",1
"Good teacher, definitely a take. Not too difficult and expectations are very reasonable. Pretty good amount of reading, and if you read it all an A should be very easy. Not a tough grader.",1
"DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASSES SHE TEACHES. She should not be an instructor. Her classes do not make any sense, she asks students to explain problems even if we've never covered the material before. I had to hire a private tutor to get through her class because she did not teach and would not meet me during her office hours. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Overall, Dr. Lyons is a great prof. If you enjoy Archaeology or if it is your major, you will likely enjoy the breadth of material covered in her course. However, there is an ungodly amount of information crammed into this course and she goes fast. Notes are minimal and no study guide for exams, so be prepared to memorize a lot of material.",1
Enjoyable online class. Very clear outline and grading criteria. Normal amount of reading + HW. Got super behind because of the hurricane and he was more than accommodating for all of us to turn in very late work + retake exams at no extra penalty. No time limit on test. Very understanding + easy A. Definitely recommend online if you are busy!,1
"Great Professor! Biology is hard so you are gonna have to put some effort into it, but she gives you everything you need to get a good grade. 3 lecture exams, 1 lab exam and a final. The test are pretty fair you just gotta know your stuff. Labs are easy. DO ALL OF THE EXTRA CREDIT. The extra credit can boost you up a whole letter grade.",1
"Lectures are dry and quite boring honestly. As a required class, you'll have to deal with it. Maybe just don't take it as an 8am class and the lectures would be more enjoyable. He seems like a genuinely good and funny guy. I just don't enjoy his lectures.",0
"It's the exact same course as GOV 2301. This guy has a really awful voice and likes to yell at his captive audience. You will be forced to hear about his neighbor's noisy pool pump, Ugg the Thug, and how stupid Sarah Palin/Charlie Sheen/Tea Party/anyone who disagrees with prof. is. Quizzes are easy, answers are online.",0
"Wouldnt suggest him. Very absent minded and unprepared for class. Also pretty unclear about what he expects for case studies and other projects, which makes the class way more challenging than necessary",0
"Very Nice teacher, you need help? Just ask them. Youll need to buy the My Math Lab code and just keep up on homework and youll pass.",1
"BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST, REALLY CARES, FAIR, ABOVE BOARD WITH ALL HE DOES, ONLINE CLASS AND WAS GREAT,,,, GROUP PROJECT IS GREAT BUT LAZY STUDENTS DO NOT HELP BUT ARE DEALT WITH,,,,,TEST HARD BUT ARE DOABLE.....A MUST TAKE CLASS OR CLASSES WIHT PROF. CARR",1
"Dr. Anderson is one of the best professors I have taken at VSU. He is very understanding if you have any issues. He makes a point to get to know everyone on a personal level. Although the class material is difficult, he makes sure everyone has an understanding. Make sure you go to lab, it really helps your grade.",1
Take her class. She's real helpful if you need it.,1
"Ok, kids. I had Mrs. O'Donnell back in the 80's. She was tough, but thank god I took her class. From day one after graduation, I was totally comfortable in front of large groups giving presentations. Think she's tough? Late to work like her class and you'll be fired. Learn from her- you WILL use it.",1
he has us do so many Tableau projects that are peer-reviewed and graded pretty harshly. On top of that you have many readings and you are not allowed to email him or he will lower your course grade. Who does that?!,0
"Sooooo good, best prof. in ASU!!! she will give u all of things what u need in blackboard. Just 3 project for all semester and give u chance if u did not do it will.",1
"I can't stand this class- he teaches the 201 class like a 101 class. Having been in AP English for 2 years, I'm writing in a way that would have been used in my freshman year of High School. The class moves at a slow pace and I am learning nothing. He focuses too much on stereotypes and reinforces them. There is no research- just prove his ideas.",1
"The class is very easy in hindsight. The homework is relatively simple and the tests are mainly just rewritten examples in class or homework. Although the exams are easy, there is no partial credit. My exams were 9-12 questions but if you get an answer wrongs you lose all the points. Getting one question wrong could cost you 16%.",1
Yeah just stay away from this Professor! Really hard to understand her directions at times I wish she would communicate more effectively with her students. Not bad but I would not take her again if I had the choice.,0
"I loved Dr. Grave's energy and enthusiasm, but was not a fan of her teaching style. The class has no real lectures/powerpoints so you basically go to class to do practice questions out of the book with a partner, and have to teach yourself from the book on your own time. If you're taking the class pass/fail its manageable but if not then good luck",0
"Took this course online. I missed the test twice because of misreading the syllabus both times she reopened it for me. Four test, post a discussion once a week and one project.  I would highly recommend taking this class online.  Easy A and good exercises and information in Medical Terminology.  Couldnt have been happier with this class!",1
She is such an amazing professor!! Shes very understanding and patient with her students as they are learning ASL and includes a lot of fun activities in the class. I would 100% recommend anyone who either has to take this class as a requirement or just wants to learn ASL to take it with Professor Hellmann.,1
"he is probably the best lab teacher you could get. all these other ratings are completely accurate too. makes the class as funny as poosible, and also he has the best drawings. 3 tests/2 you can use cheat sheets and an extra credit project. very good. deff. take him!!!",1
Ms Hutton talks in a monotone voice and makes you feel like falling asleep. She flies through the powerpoint and is unclear about assignments. If you miss a class or come in late she marks it down and drops a letter grade..that's what happened to me. If I had taken EDUC 101 with her I would have been turned off to teaching. Take Kimberly Bell!,0
"He's a little bit awkward, but you could see he tries his hardest to prepare us for the realities of the Music Industry. Not really the most interesting and engaging, but there are some important lessons to take away, especially with Copyright and Contracts. I probably wouldn't take him again though.",0
"great professor, funny and helpful",1
"He thinks he is funny, always makes you feel that you are behind. Miss a class and get a zero for assignment. He cares too much about his heavy lecture but not you at all. He does not care if you learn or not.",0
"Ann Mantell is a very sweet lady! The reason I got a C was completely on me, I skipped class every time unless there was a test. Although if she made attendance mandatory I would have been more motivated to show up. Overall, if you take this professor just dont skip class cause it will be extremely hard to learn the material on your own.",1
He is pretty hard to understand. Get the textbook so you will know what is going on. His in-class examples don't make sense and he writes in an unorganized manner. You will have no idea how to calculate your grade because he makes it up as you go through the semester. There are hardly any explained practice problems so you're screwed for the exams.,0
"She used to teach in Elementary school, and she runs her college class that way. She definitely cares for her student, but more in the ""overbearing mother"" kind of way. You might have to swallow your pride in order to pass.",0
"He is an awful professor. You can't understand a word he says because he mumbles so bad. If you ask him a question, he repeats the same thing over and over again that doesn't help at all. He's definitely a big part of physics ""teaching you how to teach yourself"" so don't expect much for lectures. Avoid if possible.",0
"Creed is very smart, but don't take this class if you want to be an unbiased, thoughtful political scientist. As was mentioned, the readings are very heavy, but they are all aligned with his political beliefs, and he will berate anyone who does not agree... And he quite literally made up midterm grades (I have written 10 papers, 3 have been read).",0
"This guy is a f***ing chooch, I tutored half his class and he failed me. He said I cheated for helping the other kids to much.",0
"Fantastic prof. He is so helpful. The classes can be boring at times, but if you're confused about something, he is VERY helpful and explains concepts very well. His speech is a good tone too. His enunciation is very clear, which makes it much easier to understand him.",1
Mehmeti was magnificent. I took this class as an elective and because I figured it would be an easy A. I took a lot out of the class and actually learned about Music History. I enjoyed taking it in the summer because there are many free concerts the city offers and attending 3 concerts is mandatory for this class. Take him!,1
Saas was an awesome professor. He was very laid back and was really lenient. He really does care about his students. He wants everyone to pass. This class is an easy A. Literally just do what is asked of you and turn it in on time and you'll get an A. Not a hard class at all. He's also really funny.,1
Nice guy,1
"Mr. Prey was an amazing teacher and I loved taking his class. It was one of the more challenging classes I've taken, but I did learn a lot. He is very good at telling stories and making lectures interesting and I would take his class again in a heart beat.",1
Out of all my 18 years in school I have to say that she has been the BEST teacher EVER!! She is so understanding and her lesson plans are easy to follow and this is a class you'll miss 100%!!,1
Slightly painful but bearable.,0
"She has no problem shooting you down in front of the class. If you don't have the EXACT same opinion as her it's clear she grades you harsher. She treats you as if your an employee and not a student, she assumes this field of art is what your interested in and has no sympathy for you if you struggle with the class. She's a truly heartless person!!!",0
The biggest problem about him is that he does not give solutions to his HWs. This along with the fact that the TA's dont grade all the hws results in you only getting about a third of the answers to the home works. There just aren't enough examples in his notes to make up for this. ,0
"Hensley is one of the best professors I've had at Iowa. It's not the easiest class, but he is a great person and cares a lot about the success of his students. He cares more about real-life experiences and application than lectures and textbooks. As long as you put forth some effort he'll respect you and help you with anything you need.",1
Prof.Parker is very sweet. I was sick the first 3 weeks of this on line class and was unable to do a lot of work. She was very understanding and willing to help in any way possible. She always took my calls or answered my emails. Her husband even helped me one night with math questions as well. I thought for sure I was going to fail but I passed.,1
"Really good teacher, Knows everything about music. Very helpful. Easy grader, even if ur awful at instruments...grade based all on improvement.  Take for a Fine Arts no doubt!",1
"Test questions very broad but she marked looking for specifics. Wasted a lot of time, went into overtime or had to finish because people would leave. Lecture was disorganized and she never summarized. She got distracted easily then lost track of the lecture. Did not seem to want to give a lot of time to helping students when it was needed.",0
"Eyeopening learning about the music industry. Paul is an expert on it. Very funny guy, makes the students think. Long powerpoint lectures that are not put online so take notes. Quizes and responses are very easy. Midterms/Final are half mult. choice half written, know the study guide and you'll do fine. 1 research paper, start early, its long",1
Most boring teacher. He does  not know anything. He keeps teaching and students don't get anything.,0
WORSTTTTTTTTTTTTT              DO NOT TAKE HIMMMMMMM,0
"He is good in explaining things if you just ask him. He is polite and as said before, he does examples from the text in lectures and he'll be happy to go over h.w. problems before they are due. he's cool",1
I wish I went with Falzone on this one. He's not approachable or helpful at all. He doesn't care about his students.,0
"She tries and fails to relate to students. She lectures about the exact same topic day after day, ad nauseam. She is probably one of the most boring lecturers Ive ever had to sit through.",0
I had him for at least 5 or 6 classes and he really does know what he is talking about so listen....and if you have questions....he will answer them.  Wonderful professor....just listen and learn.,1
"She's a great teacher. You will have to go to class for notes (they are fill in the blank). She gives study guides that follow what's on the test (they are really long though). She also gives quizzes that are only for extra credit points. However, some lectures are very easy and she spends too much time going through them.",1
"She's an extremely flexible and understanding professor in terms of accommodating the students. As long as you make sure to communicate with her, you are sure to pass the class with a good grade. On top of that she's very enthusiastic and jovial about her lectures which keeps it from getting boring.",1
"A huge wieny. She made my life miserable. Her class policies suck and she is not understanding at all. I hated attending class and she barely even taught anything. She was rude, ignorant and did not even offer to help when my grade was failing. Never take her. It will be the worst decision you have ever made",0
"She is really hard to understand on her video lectures. Also, she often times works on the homework in her video lectures and gets the question answers wrong.  That's worrisome. She takes forever to upload her video lectures. Really nice person, but not the best professor. If you don't like doing HW and quizzes last minute do not take her. ",0
"Professor Israel did great at teaching online. Make sure you watch all of the lectures and take lots of notes on them. Homework is KEY in doing well in this class. If you try on the homework, you will get a good grade easily. First midterm was easy, and the second midterm/final was fine. Ask questions during/after lecture if you are confused.",1
"If you want an easy A, take this class. There are 3 tests and the final all of which are online. He takes attendance randomly 5 times during the semester. Get ready to be bored as he reads verbatim to the slides that he does post online. You definitely do not need the textbook, so don't waste your money. Easy A, decent professor, no homework.",1
"I'd heard such great things about Dr. Anitori and was sorely disappointed by his teaching. He puts the most random information on his weekly exams, which are only 20 questions. You are not allowed to study from previous tests for your cumulative final, you can't question him or else he humiliates you, and there is a lack of organization in lab time",0
"All he does is read off powerpoints and show youtube videos. He's a nice guy and means no harm, but he's just not a good teacher. He allows a cheat sheet for tests, and has all homework and quizzes online so your grade can't be that bad. But I wouldn't recommend to most people",0
"Dr. DuBois is an excellent professor who goes to great lengths for her students to understand. She is patient and understanding when it comes to questions or doubts. However, her exams are difficult as they cover most of what she explained in her lectures as well as additional meticulous details that the book clarifies.Pay attention and take notes!",1
"Dr. Graham is one of the best teachers I've had. He explains things in a clear fashion, often explaining in a "" how I would do it"" fashion. Never shoots down students ideas or questions, but explores them. Lots of pop quizzes, but you are able to opt out of them if you want. He does not assign homework either. I highly recommend that you take him.",1
"Dr. Hinton knows what she is saying, but it's kind of hard to understand if you don't know biology already. There are four tests and she curves them. She messed up reviewing for our final, so she doubled our highest test grade for our final grade. YMMV",1
Expect to spend many hours on homework. Type of Professor to choose the hardest questions from the homework to put on the exams so be prepared. A few subjects here and there that are'nt covered in the book which is a bit annoying but overall he's a decent Professor and you will learn A LOT in this class if you put in the work. Lenient grader!,1
"Taking one of his classes will definitely improve your writing. His lectures are never dry but its unclear as to whether his theories on the lit are brilliant or bull... great if your prepared for a challenge, but otherwise I would take Kuzmanovich for American lit and take Nelson for a class in his field - short fiction",1
"horrible teacher. if she doesn't like you( your grade will suffer. being forced to listen to the non-sense she spits is not worth 3 credits. plus she was the dumbest person in the room but it gets worse,boring classes, biased teacher,unorganized,dont take",0
I wanted to learn about foreign policy instead we learned about gender and social stuff. Is a bit snarky and elitist. Not always clear. Would avoid for foreign policy.,0
"Absolutely aweful. the comments I've read so far are SPOT ON. I was kicked out of his class this semester because I'd finally had enough of him being so disrespectful to not only me, but my classmates. Always bringing up the subject of abortions and how ""if you don't want the baby, you can give it up for adoption.""teaching strategies were confusing",0
"Professor Kraft is one of the best english professors! I thought his class was going to be hard since I don't like English, but he makes it interesting. Received an A for my first time in an English class. Would take his class again!",1
She does not respond to emails. The instructions for the big assignments are not given until the end of the semester. The big assignments are very difficult. Wish we could have received them earlier. She waits until the end of the semester to grade.,0
"Don't take this, I love writing and she made my experience horrible, she speaks in a condescending tone and makes you feel as if your opinions do not matter",0
her complete and total lack of meme knowledge was completely inappropriate. i give 1.5/10,0
"Definitely does assign A LOT of reading (20+ pages per class) however, i read maybe twice and got an A. The only major grades are the midterm, final, and research paper. She gives you a list of all the terms you have to remember as well as the possible essays and its a lot to memorize but it can be done. She offers a lot of extra credit.",0
"Amazing professor. Make sure to do all the reading and take notes during the lectures. The individual portion of the main group project for the class I took (ARTH 2753) was very stressful and difficult, but if you seek the right guidance and work hard in the class its possible to get an A. Great lecturer and great course!",1
"Ryan Romero is as subjective as they come. If you have to have him and are not some creative guru, just do your best and try not to be upset when he grades you really harsh. He is a cool guy and pretty understanding, but I wouldn't recommend to take this particular course from him. Unless you are outrageously talented, don't expect to make an A.",0
"Prof Jones likes to be called Randy. I took his Fine Art class and WSU Tri-Cities. While attendance was mandatory, you can really just zone out during class. He's really passionate about art and has some cool lecture points, but the lecture isn't at all in the exams. For the exam all that you need is re-read your hw which he corrects to perfection",0
"Dr. Beckman's classes are not only interesting, but extremely useful in the real world. Highly recommend the program and miss being in his classes.",1
"just 2 papers per semester. easy to write but long, i wrote between 20 and 25 pages and got an A. takes attendance. don't buy the textbook!!! easy A if you write the 2 papers and show up to class",1
He is nice but very confusing and the quiz level doesn't match his teaching.,0
"If you are serious about getting ahead in the Illustration industry, you will be as disappointed with Dennis as I was. I was uninspired by him, got no portfolio pieces from his classes, and was wholly disappointed with the number of assignments we were given. He will push you into painting instead of letting you explore your own methods.",0
"I highly enjoyed his class. He is great and very knowledgeable in Anatomy. Book is not needed, he provides power points which all tests are based on. Also, study the old test questions, lots of them will be on test!",1
"Very inconsistent, he LACKS a lot of communication with his students, does not respond neither emails or calls. He will not mark you in you are even ten minutes late. Heavy accent, if your a good listener you will do fine he literally reads off the power point, and often rushes through everything. He's very knows his stuff but lack teaching skills",0
"This is by far the most incompetent professor I have ever had. I have had her for two classes now, and the second was worse than the first. Hey syllabus is nearly never correct, she is unorganized, and her teaching is a joke. She stays so topical, critical thinking and discussion would never be fostered in he classes. Her tests reflect it too.",0
"This instructor is the only reason this class was difficult. The rubric was barely followed, if at all sometimes. She will mark you down for random things without reason, and for things I've never had issues with before. She finished grading all my milestone papers within 15-30 minutes.  Nothing was ever clear, making this class terrible.",0
Who has two thumbs and makes chemistry more difficult than it needs to be?? Dr. Evans. He is soo tough he barely ever talks and uses hand gestures to get his point across. Usually he just grunts and picks up things because he is unusually strong. He kept getting stronger during classes and began to smash things. I think he was also turning green.,0
"He tries to make you think the class is hard but it isn't. His exams are easy and he's a fairly funny guy but the classes will bore you to death. If he's an option for you, take him. It's an easy A.",1
Insane class. This professor did nothing for us. When we asked questions we were shut down with rude responses that were smart ass like. It was just not a good course at all. We worked so hard to receive such petty grades. She obviously had favorites. I mean give me a break. We literally are having class over a screen. -GIB,0
"Thick accent and just moves to hard tricky problems to give for your test. Has a complicated grading system of extra credit and quizzes and tests.  Really beware of pop quizzes, it used to be open book, then it wasn't. Multiple choice tests-very hard and no partial credit for problems (150 pts)",0
Ok she is a tough teacher but unless you are one of her favorites and she does have favorites you will not get any positive feedback from her. She will knit pick you to the point that you can get a note out of you. She'll make you so mad that you'll want to punch her. She can be extremely disrepctful to you infront of everyone!Take someone else.,0
"Mook is one of the worse professors I ever had in UB. He had failed to provide bare minimum requirement of the contents for the course (ie competent notes, and lecture recording). Avoid this guy at any cost.",0
"A real nice guy. If you don't understand something, ask a question. He always answered mine nicely. He was also good at explaining things that were new to the class",1
"Dr. Montes is the kind of professor who can teach without the power point! He can answer pretty much any question you have.. really smart guy. I learned so much from him. The material isn't difficult, there is just a lot to absorb. If you actually want to learn I would take Montes.",1
"If you enjoy self-learning then this is the class for you. For the online version of his class, all he did was give you links for youtube videos and said figure it out. He also doesn't give enough time on the exams but when you ask him for extra credit he doesn't offer it. Go with caution when taking this class, many breakdowns happened.",0
"She's a genuinely a good person. If you go in after class to ask for help you can tell she really wants to help you . However, this means nothing since she is not a native speaker; you literally cannot understand her. She is also unforgivably strict on assignments, and will not accept anything from you if you are even five minutes late to class",0
"This AN101 class is treated like an upper level elective for juniors or seniors. Her lectures are long, she posts readings that are 50+ pages, and is beyond boring with no interactive. By far the worst class I have taken at QU and a waste of a free elective.",0
"Witelski is an amazing professor. The material isn't easy but he is super accessible and willing to answer questions both in and outside of class. His lectures are extremely clear. Good professor, clear expectations, and a great sense of humor.",1
"great professor, shes clear, and literrally tells you what will be on the tests. She hands out great practice worksheets! Work on them! It is  the exact same material on the test.",1
Best. Class. Ever.  Best. Prof. Ever. Seriously excellent teacher - he should teach everything and be President of U of T!,1
There is a lot of homework in this class. I don't like that we learn most of this stuff on the computer then he teaches it afterwords. The thing I don't like is the test heavy part of the course.,0
"Professor KmacK is very entertaining and clearly works because he loves his discipline; he isn't in it for the money or the job conditions. That being said, beware of his confused ways to teach and evaluate his class.",1
"Professor Auten, is probably the best instructor i ever had in ITEC major. he made labs interesting and relevant and worked to keep us interested in the course material. he is not like other professors who gives us the labs and expect us to do it by own, he actually guides us step by step, explain us and gives the demo how to do it. Cant beat that!",1
"Taking a class with Dr. De Vos is like being held hostage by a narcissist. He only likes to lecture on Freud, Buddhism and himself. Work on the study guide during the lecture and you should do ok.",0
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! He's a fantastic professor. Very helpful and understanding. Class is as hard as you make it. He is very forgiving and helps in any way he can. I took him for Pre-Cal and if it weren't for him, i'd have an F. ",1
"Just horrible. Confusing, goes off on rants, awkward. I wouldn't recommend this professor to anyone. I can't believe there's such a horrible professor at USI.",0
"Nice guy, as long as you show up you'll pass.",1
"I loved Ms. Epley! She's full of good energy and really shows that she cares about her students. She does everything in her power to try and help her students the best she can. She will however see if you're slacking and will call you out on it. As long as you don't slack and show good effort, you'll do fine.",1
"With out going to class you will fail. And study by going over the homework not reading the book. I really enjoy Dr. Steward, he is a good prof",0
If you have the option do not take this class online. Her directions are not very specific and she is terrible at replying to emails when students have questions. She will even copy and paste emails and send them to multiple students that asked for feedback on their paper. Not very helpful at all. ,0
"Mostly do-your own work, 3 hr class and most doesn't help with exams or homework, very nice and funny likewise.",0
"Very hard to understand. Seemingly doesnt know how to use technology, reads off of slides, and gives little to no instruction for assignments (even exams). Took the joy out of art history and most of my brain cells. Definitely would avoid this prof.",0
Great teacher if you study for all the exams you will do fine gives practice quizzes that are almost identical to the tests. Curves grades at the end by half a letter,1
"Funny guy, obviously loves his job but his class is hard because he talks so fast. He doesn't tell you what you need to know so it's just a lot of information. If your good at studying on your own and understand biology you'll do fine, ask him questions because hes better at explanations one on one.",1
"Had Dr. Kim for O-chem Lab and loved her. Wish I had taken her over knight for lecture because apparently she grades more easily. In the lab, she's very attentive to students questions and keeps a close watch over  everything to ensure that everyone is doing things correctly. Lab Exams are surprisingly tough. know the structures of lab compounds.",1
"This was one of the most difficult classes I have ever taken. His lectures are super engaging but he doesn't stop to review/clarify concepts that might have been forgotten. There are so many lecture quizzes and lab quizzes which can be both beneficial and harmful. His tests are super specific and vague, but it taught me where to focus my studying.",0
"Professor RIckerson is an expert in her field. She is very passionate about her subject and it shows in her lectures. Her lectures can be very long sometimes, but most of them are very intriguing. Since parts of the test are visual, it is important that you attend class. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone interested in her class.",1
"For this class, he did not follow or measure up to any of the stated expectations that he set for himself in the  syllabus. Got irritated anytime he was asked a question, replying ""i don't understand question, look in the book, I am not an expert.""  Overpaid seat warmer.  Take the online course and save yourself the hassle.",0
"She's a great professor and I learned so much in her class. Her tests are easy, there's a group project which is not difficult at all. She has lots of guest speakers and overall it's a very interesting class and I would recommend it.",1
"I don't why there is no option for choosing 185A as his class. I took 185A this quarter, which is complex analysis. He was a funny guy that alway talked about off topic material. He wrote down ever follow his previous notes during the class meetings, which is very useless unless you really understand it. Two midterms and 1 final paper. Aviod him.",0
"If you can take Ross I would highly recommend him. He responds to his emails very quickly and comes across in a way that is relatable. His lectures are relaxed, yet informative. He normally divides class into lectures and group problems. Pay attention to in-class examples and group problems because they often show up on tests.",1
all i can say is GPA booster :D,1
"He was probably the nicest professor I've ever had! Was extremely caring and understanding of any outside problems we were having. Taught the class extremely well and overall just amazing. If you can, I highly recommend signing up for his class!",1
Notes are very vague sometimes... Seems like half the stuff he goes over isn't on the quizzes or tests. Never worked so hard in my life to try and pass a class . Make sure to write EVERYTHING he says down because you will need it in some type of way. Moves very quickly so pay attention! Prepare to study hard. ,0
"Sara is AMAZING!!  Her Intro to Social Work Class is extremely interesting and she asks review out of the exam, itself!  Brought us breakfast a couple of times, too.  She is a sweetheart.  You have to TRY to fail the course or get a bad grade.  I got an A+.  Make sure you get your volunteer hours in, though.",1
he is a really good teacher but the only issue is he should be more specific about what he wants from his students in assignments.,1
"would literally open the slideshows and skip through almost all of the slides and go ""you probably know this"" like no we really dont plus i ended with a 79.5 and the dude basically told me if i had done better on a few quizzes i would have had the grade i wanted so he wouldnt bump me like yeah do you not understand how grades work? was concerning",0
"Honestly the worst math professor I ever had. Over complicated simple subjects, ridiculously difficult tests which were also long. Did curve but it didn't help much. The class is already a hard one and he made it even more difficult to manage. Don't take him.",0
"As I was in my first semester of graduate school, this was definitely a difficult class. Dr. Lorton took time to answer each question without making you feel as though you were an idiot for asking. Be sure to do your homework! Test questions are similar to notes and homework problems. Often, homework is harder than the test. Best of luck!",1
2 Homework sections a week. Discussions are hard to understand. Difficult class. I took it online.,1
"Believe all previous reviews. She posted a take-home test (a day late) with only 77 of 100 questions and didn't send an email after she updated. Several students showed up to class with only 77 questions answered. She randomly gives good papers Fs, but usually gives full credit. Final exam tip: most questions from chapter summaries in book.",0
"Extremely boring lectures. He would just read his slides, make some sound effects, and attempt to joke. He's a terrible grader, as even correct answers, with the same info from his slides, is marked wrong. Never replied to emails, hard to reach in general. Told us to study notes during the quarantine and then disappeared. Not worth paying $2k+ for.",0
"He's a bit snooty and pretentious. He has sometimes discredited film as ""art"". The philosophy book you have to read is super confusing. He is also a bit extra for an assignment where you have to write four sentences (ie it's not even an essay or anything), we had to print it out as apparently handwritten is not good enough for him.",0
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant man.  However, he's incredibly intolerant when it comes to others' opinions and monopolizes the class discussions.  I don't recommend him, but if you must take him, just try to keep your mouth shut and do what he says.",0
This class is very easy if you do the assignments; they aren't hard. The only hard part is the resume & interview because she likes everything to be exactly how she says. If you look like your not paying attention she locks the computers. If you participate in discussions shes pretty nice. If you miss class & don't  pay attention good luck.,1
I would avoid taking her class.,0
"She is my favorite professor here at Allegheny. I respect her a lot, and I think she grades fairly. Her class is my favorite of the semester, and one of the few that I've ever had that I actually really look forward to attending.",1
Smart and kind professor.,1
"Professor Hafey aka ""Chaz"" is an awesome math instructor and very easy going. He really cares about his students & will help you out until you understand the problem. I struggled in math until I took his class. The way the class is taught is helpful because you start slow then speed up the difficulty. By far the best math professor I've had!!!!",1
"1 Laura Ridenour a Quality of Teaching ai The worst teacher you will experience aii No quality in her teaching b Organization Skills i Nonexistent (she is supposed to be expert at organization?) c Communication Skills i. none, she is the worst",0
Awesome professor! Very nice and caring and wants to help you succeed! Highly recommend! 4 novels but nothing too long. He likes to talk but encourages you to as well. I would take his class for all English's if I could.,1
Really easy. Gives chapter outlines that are all you need to know. Textbook Used for a paper and as a good study material.,1
"The test are worth 70% of our grade and dont follow his lectures. He promised a large curve and didnt follow through, which was annoying since this class is lecture heavy and moved to be remote. A 1% curve is probably the stupidest thing ive ever seen especially when the average for each of the exam was below a C.",0
"Very nice lady, but for the most part she was unable to remain on schedule with going through materials for lectures. Dropped her class after the first test; 85% of the class failed because she did not grade in accordance to the book, slides or study guide she designed herself and told/made us use; was unwilling to discuss why she graded that way.",0
"boring you want to kill yourself. I had Chaucer in high school and couldn't wait to take a course in college. HS was better, we learned something about the middle ages. The one good thing is that  its an easy A.",0
"She is very clear when explaining questions in class, and cares if students are actually learning. She is helpful and when there is clearly a problem fixes it fairly for students. She also is refreshing and easy to pay attention to. Classes are important to attend :)",1
"I found Ms. Ridenour to be a little tough, but she was very fair. If you came to the lecture, paid attention, and worked hard on the homework assignments you did well in this class. This was a work intensive class, and the tests were challenging. The snowflakes that gave this professor a bad review, don't understand what college SHOULD be.",1
I absolutely love Professor Garland! I have taken her for every class that she has and they are all interesting. She makes it possible for you to care and pass. Her assignments are great. Just do the work and put in some thought and you should well.,1
So much homework for only 1 credit. I mean really. This class is a waste of time but unfortunately needed to go to a university. So yeah hated it.,0
Easy grader and assignments for each week take under an hour.,1
absolutely hated her. An obvious failed screen writer who is trying to hard to connect with the youth. Class is useless and not helpful all we do is watch the behind the scenes extra features on DVDs. Would definitely recommend her as a professor.,0
"Possibly one of the most unprepared, detached teachers i have had to date, yet, in all of my years of school. He never emails you back, nor, does he care about you as a student. He seems totally burdened to teach, and it reflects in his students learning.",0
"He is the toughest grader I've ever had and he doesn't give the best feedback. AVOID this professor as much as possible. I wrote in the disuccsions every day and he still gave me a C on that particular grade. I wrote two papers that he gave me poor grades for because I wasn't specific enough, but he doesn't make the guidelines clear. DON'T TAKE HIM",0
"I really enjoyed taking Interpersonal Communications online. She is super sweet and caring, and her online lectures are very professional and well put together. The class consisted of quizzes each module and either a discussion post or journal entry and a final. She provides great feedback on all of your assignments so take her if you can!",1
I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,0
"He is very kind and patient. His classes feel like forever though. Class can be very boring and slow but its an English class so I expected nothing less. He is very helpful and clear on what he wants on his assignments. I haven't gotten my grade for the class yet but im positive I got no lower than a B+ because I do the work. Overall, nice prof!",1
"If you are a weak math student, do not take this course with Ostry. His lectures are boring and not interactive. He does not provide assignments to keep you on track throughout the semester, and the text is hard to understand without supplemental material. As many people before have said, take it with Amsel.",0
"Very poor grader - She doesn't have a real rubric to go by. She takes off many points for miniscule things. There are four assignments in the whole class with one discussion each week. You have 3-4 days to post, not the typical full week. She takes weeks to a month to answer emails and grade assignments. She is very unhelpful.",0
Honestly the most unorganized class I've ever had. I feel I could confidently say that about 75% of the class didn't know what was expected of them. A whole bunch of stuff was shown in lecture that would never be brought up again so you didn't know how to filter out what was important at all. Plus there are the readings which are pointless.,0
"Taking Dr. Bardo for SOC 255 was a great decision. There are no exams, attendance is not mandatory, there are only 7 quizzes and he drops the lowest two, and the largest portion of your grade comes from an easy project at the end of the semester. I have learned a lot about medical sociology from him and HIGHLY recommend his class!",1
"If you havent had a math class for a while, dont take her. She teaches fast and doesnt explain clearly and gets confused by her own work. Gives 1 or 2 quizzes every week , but drops lowest 2. Homework due every week , drops lowest 1. Tests are about 15 questions. Math Tutors got me through this class.",1
She's Awesome ,1
"He is super unclear about what he wants, and the office hour doesn't help at all! The only thing you can learn from is the class note. The lecture is useless. Definitely hard grader. Deduct points with no reason! Ridiculous project at the end of semester that no one knows how to do",0
"it was an easy class. i didn't do well on 4 exams and i passed with a b ,and he is very helpful. the class was never boring because he gets the entire class talking in spanish",1
"worst prof ever, doesn't want to help students, makes everything so difficult for students, stay away",0
"Does not teach, you learn 100% from the Text Book. Unclear instructions.",0
"Dr. Lim is a disgrace to the CHE department.  He does not teach!!!  When going to office hours, he won't actually answer questions and just tells you to look in the notes.  Semester tests are easy, but the final was incredibly hard and lowered most peoples' grades by two letter grades.  The class did not prepare anyone for the insane final.",0
"He's a really funny guy and his lectures are pretty enjoyable. There is a lot of material and he does iclicker questions in class. The material is not that hard to grasp, but there is a lot of memorization and some of his questions can be a little bit tricky. That being said all his midterms were 100% multiple choice.",1
"Best Spanish teacher of my life... class was interesting and fun. I learned a lot, and things I was confused about from high school were all cleared up! Sign up for her class... asap!",1
"Very good guy but it's difficult since CMPE-160 is just by nature a tough class. He really cares about his students doing well, and clearly knows what he is talking about. Very tough grader though, seemingly minor things will noticeably cost you on quizzes and tests (i.e. not labeling the select pins on a multiplexer). Great professor overall.",1
"Was not a fan at all of the class and material. R is hard and confusing, as with the other programs. Not a good class or really a good teacher.",0
Loads of work in the 2nd half. Assignments are tough. Very strict on papers.,1
Dr. Ponce is an amazing woman!  She is a great counselor and cares about her students!  She will motivate and help you achieve your dreams.,1
"In laymans terms - lots of smoke & mirrors. The perception he gave in class was different from what was posted. Some good stories but there was a lot of ""did I say this in this class or last class"" while at the same time insisting he said something that he did not. We proved this in class and then had a surprise assignment. hmmm",0
"I don't often take online courses, but I definitely vouch for her. I work full-time and there were times where I would miss a deadline for an assignment or even miss a quiz or exam. For whatever the problem, she was able to respond the next day and give not just positive feedback, but she allowed more time, and even curved my grade.",1
"Goes over material pretty fast.. you can do well in the class if you read the book thoroughly and study a lot. The TA's were pretty horrible, and I'm pretty sure they made up the midterm/final...",0
"great teacher!  A lot of hard work, but if you attend class (like your supposed to) and do your homework, it's no problem!    And he's funny and knows how to relate math to commonplace things/situations, too bad he's retiring!",1
I love Professor Tompson! She was really funny which helped me stay awake at 8 am. Read the chapters in the book and study her lecture slides and you're set. Discussion was pointless unless you have questions about the information....,1
shouldn't be teaching intro,0
"The best teacher I've ever met! Very clear but very complex. You have to push yourself hard,  but not beyond your capacity. A lot of hard reading, but his lectures clarify everything (if you are attentive and present).  Grades not based on Attendence.",1
Hes a great professor and you learn a lot from. Be prepared if you have him twice a week then youll get quizzes mostly every class. Also on his midterms and exams he like to give extra credit questions on things off topic from the lecture like a video he showed. My only issue with him is he likes to give last minute assignments the week of finals,1
"I had him for Integrated English and he was okay. He is very nice but very unorganized and will call on you during class to ask you questions. He gives out at least seven different papers per class time which means, A LOT of homework. He will let you turn homework and major assignments in late and will give you take home tests with study guides.",0
"Pros: - Flexible on the due date of homework if a life event pops up.  Cons: - No feedback on the graded homework so you have no idea where you went wrong. - Says he gives partial credit on the exams, but he doesn't. - Really hard to follow his lectures, so I spent hours outside of class watching Prof. Leonard to teach myself the subject material.",0
He won't let you use a laptop to take notes. Waste of time.,0
"Good lecturer, knows his stuff. The class is just really kind of boring and nothing is really worth writing down in the lectures. It can be interesting at times but most of the time it's dry. Most of the student taking the class are Business majors who just want a Humanities credit so they don't really care about the concepts they're learning",1
1 Job search assignment easy and a job search presentation. 3 Test and the 4th one is the final . attendance is for extra credit. course evaluation is for extra credit. He also gives us a question sometimes and we would get extra credit. easy class as long as you take clear notes. everything he discusses in his lectures is important to get an A.,1
Awesome teacher! Very helpful and wants see her student succeed.,1
"Passionate about his subject, but lectures can be hard to follow. He tells stories with no relevance to the curriculum. What you read and what he lectures does not always equate to the same. To do well on his test, take notes on what he says in class and write that as your answer.",0
"OH DEAR GOD KILL ME NOW! I DREADED this class every wk.the tests are beyond hard,& he shows the first films EVER made in EVERY country.try to take cinema 2 to avoid this.NEVER out early.nice guy tho.i just thot his exams were way too hard.BUT I HATED THIS CLASS",0
very likable professor. Easy class. All that he requires  is attention and a degree of inferential perception,1
He really cares about his student and he guides you through he work and he always review before a quiz or test,1
"Dr. Kennedy is an ok prof.  He is often not clear with expectations on exams and gets angry if you leave class for your next one in ten minutes when he is not finished, even if class has technically ended 4 minutes ago. Sometimes can come off a bit sarcastic as well. Lab is good with him though.",0
"She is not helpful at all; Probably one of the hardest teachers Ive ever had. Studying, taking notes, and looking over h/w is not helping. I'm still enrolled in this class because I have no choice.  She does not give extra credit or curve your grade. Take another teacher if you can you will regret it unless you're good in math and word problems.",0
"Great class, great teacher, and interesting class. Take it! Be sure to stay caught up.",1
Great professor!!!! He was willing to accommodate during the pandemic and workload is super manageable. Material was easy to digest and exams were pretty easy. I highly recommend this class to non-STEM majors. The one negative thing I can say is that feedback was not given on assignments and I was often unclear as to why points were taken off.,1
"Professor Zein is a very tough grader. And most of these things said are true. Her desired answers are subjective and she is picky in her answers. However, she is very clear and precise in what she expects. If you listen carefully, and take notes you will do good. Pass this class and you can pass any F&M class.",1
"Professor Schap's lectures are fast-paced and pretty confusing. He assigns a lot of textbook reading and practice problems that are not graded. HOWEVER, this extra work is how I actually learned and did well in the class because the lectures were confusing. If you take this class, do the extra work because it will be to your benefit in the end.",0
"Had him for the OCHE abroad program. Very kind and caring! Did his best to help us, was very accommodating, and listened to his students. The class was hard and he makes you work, but its doable and he does his best to make the exams pretty straight forward! A wonderful person to talk to if you get the chance!",1
"Rare combination: understands advanced math concepts AND can explain things to people who aren't great at math!  Amazingly helpful during office hours.  Patient,  respectful, and non-judgmental to questions, responds well to feedback.  Genuinely wants students to succeed. Study guides for tests.  Tests reflect HW and class content.",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. The course was challenging but you can do well if you do all the readings, pay attention in class, and study for the exams. The material was extremely interesting, and Dr. Britton was engaging in her lecturing. The course expanded my mind so much, and I would highly recommend any of Dr. Britton's courses.",1
Definitely one of the best nursing instructors I've had here at hfcc!!  If you get the chance take Mrs. G,1
TONS of homework. I felt like I couldn't really approach her because she seems kind of tough. Never took any quizzes but the tests were super long. Very detailed syllabus and she expects nothing less than the best. I believe she helped me out in the end to pass the class but I would not take again. I struggled in this class,0
"Dr. Evans is a great professor-- he is witty, intelligent, passionate, and personable. He is understanding/encouraging, but also expects you to work hard and strive for excellence. Although I took it as a requirement, it was my favorite class of the semester. In PSC-211, he led a discussion based class with reading/lectures as homework.",1
"Not only is Professor Dattolo an excellent professor,but if you need extra help he is always willing to meet you outside of class and spend the time to help you. He is a very special professor and I highly recommend him.",1
"He is an extremely tough grader (looking for specific wording in exams). He also talks about being available for help anytime outside of class, but when you ask him questions or try to reach out he is either dismissive/passive aggressive or never replies (email). I am currently teaching myself with the textbook. Take this class with someone else!",0
"This woman was out of her mind.She called out students for not showing up, which is ridiculous considering the class time (T-F 810AM!) and size (well over 200 people).  She would constantly interject useless stories about her family, some prof with short-man syndrome, how Rutgers invented the pill, and how the female sex organs are so sophisticated",0
i love mis magdaleno she is the best teacher i have this semester =] i wont her for my color fundamentals class!!,1
No Comments,0
"I had Dr. Lim for both Thermo 1 & Thermo 2 and he is by far one of my favorite professors. He provides written notes for all of his lectures and they are EXTREMELY thorough, even including some example problems. His tests are not that difficult if you know how to do the homework problems and the example problems in the notes.",1
"Dreaded going to her class. Sheila was one to get side tracked a lot with arbitrary banter and stories, along with getting caught up with stories from students. A total waste of valuable class time.",0
Ive taken Baker also for PSYCH. Ive taken both classes online so its always more work. He added Connect to his assignments but it pays off. I currently have an A in this class and got an A in PSYCH. Replies fast to emails and always gives you reminders and tips. He wants you to pass the class and cares for your well being.,1
"Lai seems nice but he has his ""favorite"" students that he treats with a double standard.  He treats them very nice and treats other students average.",1
"Do Not! I repeat Do Not take this Professor under any circumstances! Please try to avoid him! His Syllabus is not clear, he does not give you extra credit, he has no compassion for his work or his students and he will give you lectures about how getting a degree dont matter when it clearly does! Because he wouldnt have one two Or three degrees!",0
"These good reviews are a little to good when I first picked his class. I thought it was going to be easy since everyone else is saying he is. Sadly that's not the case, he has 3 exams (sure there open book) but I cant find any answers in the book or his PowerPoints. I would not take him unless you don't have another better choice.",0
"Professor Sonntag is extremely funny, has compassion and just an overall great human being. Yeah, whats up with all the hate here, I am starting to think that some of these comments are coming from the same person. Her updates through canvas was really the only reason to log in aside from studying, eww.",1
"First test in this class was easy, but the second test was a nightmare. Go to class and work through the practice exams he posts online. He doesn't post keys but if you work through them and bring questions to his office hours then he is very helpful.",1
"He talks at you, his questions to the class are 99% rhetorical.Gives take home multiple choice tests with multiple right answers per question, but he decides what the ""most right"" answer is. The class is not interactive, it's just his monologues. End of the class multiple difficult essays are due, with no homework before then that would help you.",1
amazing teacher. He is super funny & helps you develop more into your essays! I recommend this teacher.,1
"teacher is not clear with material, very broad but quiz questions are very specific and built to trick you. They suggest to log into the VOH sessions but they are useless and do not provide any important information. The reading material is extremely heavy for a 200 level  elective course. I strongly do not recommend this class.",0
Opposed to all the other comments I LOVED Mrs. Kurtz! I am not a math person and always struggled with math in high school but Mrs. Kurtz taught me in a way I understood and I never had below a 98 in her class the whole semester. As long as you pay attention in class and DO YOUR HOMEWORK the class is not hard at all. I wish i could have her again.,1
Kathleen is an amazing teacher.  She will come around and critique your drawings to make you a better artist. Portfolios are very important so take them seriously. She has a lot of experience so take what she says to heart. Loved this class and her.,1
"Do not take this class until you have taken physics! That's all it is! The people who were lost were the ones who never took it. 3 exams with an optional final. Exams were HEAVILY curved. She wasn't too bad, but didn't seem sure of herself. Study old exams, read, and visit office hours and you'll be OK.",0
"Fun class if you are an engineering major.  Easy class, but sometimes boring.  You have to attend class and do the homework, but it is really easy. one paper with a presentation the last week of class.  If you like your grade before the final, you don't have to take it, your grade does not change!! Find another teacher that does that.",1
He doesn't follow the syllabus to teach. Hard to understand.,0
"I had a difficult time through her class. I study days for her tests and still only receives C. She requires hundreds of pages to be read for her tests. Thankfully, she gives you a good amount of writing assignments to help your grade.",1
"A bit spazzy but she was a good professor. 3 tests that consists of multiple choice & short answer questions on vocab terms. Study the vocab and the powerpoints she posts on Bb, and you will definitely ace the tests. She gives out few paper assignments and one newspaper article assignment that you present in class (very informal presentation).",1
"I had Angie for my clinical instructor at Metro, for the LPN nursing program. She was very down to earth, which made it easy for us to ask questions and she was very patient with her teaching. Shes very hands-on, she answered my emails quickly if I had any questions about paperwork. She set clear guidelines with expectations. Great instructor!",1
"Online class. Everything is laid out for you + there are no lectures. You read the textbook + do weekly assignments. This might seem nice, but I see no point in having the professor when the textbook does her job for her. Also, midterm/final have 100+ questions that ask you to memorize VERY specific info from the text - poor, lazy test design.",0
"He's very nice and will help you if you need it. He hands out notes for each class and gives out a review before each test, which are very helpful. If you put in the effort, you should be able to easily get an A. One of the best MCC professors.",1
"She is a great professor with a lot of knowledge, but GET READY TO WORK. Requires 2 discussion board posts a week and has weekly homework assignments and quizzes. I spent about 5 hours on each assignment. Her tests are HARD, make sure you know the material 100%. She takes a long time to grade and respond to emails. I would take her again though.",1

"Dr. Mahosky is one of the best professors I have ever had at NAU. She is passionate about disability studies which improves your motivation to learn. It would be hard to not get an A in her class, as her teaching is clear and the coursework is interesting. I definitely recommend all DIS courses. They are all exceptional with wonderful teachers!",1
"A very nice man, but, he really needs to keep political views out of class.I don't care if your views agree with mine or not. I'm paying 14 grand a year to learn, not to hear a bunch of political propaganda. Any person that starts a class with the number of deaths in the current war isn't right in the head. Oh,and reading the material for tests, an",0
"Poor explanations, assumes students are finance savvy in this basic level course. Handouts were old (2006) with dated content/examples years ago. Crazy curve 74 is an A-tells you about prof teaching style. Wandering lectures went from tangent to tangent. Verbally dismissive to students, poor use of expensive textbook-no glossary in version used",0
"This guy is very sweet and he means well, but his tests are ridiculous.  Nothing in the book or in his lecture notes show up on the tests.  I have no idea where he got his questions from.  He had to scale the grades majorly for my class.",0
He is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. All he does is wastes people's time with the stupid videos he plays which are unrelated to the topic.,0
She is by far one of my favorite teachers that  i have ever had. She is so worldly and intelligent and loves to share her knowledge. She is Russian and has a russian accent but that is all it is she speaks perfect english and i would assume english is her second language and she does a great job. I just love her class so much. Def recommend her.,1
"amazing fun teacher. really tries o lift up the class. knows what she is doing and wants you to succeed. gives a ton of extra credit(there's literally a ton of ways you can get extra credit and make a good grade) but you do have to work hard for the grade and read the powerpoints, notes and the book",1
"Honestly probably the best professor I've had at FandM. She comes off as tough at first, and she can be if you slack off, but she is also very understanding and caring when needed. Her lectures are amazing - she is incredibly knowledgable about her subject. You will learn a lot from this class if you put in the effort. 10/10 would recommend.",1
Brent is the most talented professor in the Interactive media department... seriously look up his reel. He's so humble and nice that you'd never guess theamazing things he's worked on. If you talk to him one on one he's got great insight about the industry. Best teacher ever!,1
This dude called out multiple of us this semester for plagairism which is the one thing I have never done during my college career. I took this class for fun and I'm going to end up failing. He's a very tough grader. There's only four grades and the final is a ten page paper.,0
"Professor N'Jai is a very good professor. He is extremely friendly and approachable. His class is easy for the most part. His assignments are scheduled and predictable, which is a plus. I don't think many people try hard in the discussions so if you actually put in a good effort you will make him happy. Just have an open mind and you'll be fine.",1
This class was online due to COVID and did not have any zoom meetings. Very few assignments besides unit quizzes and tests. I personally did not enjoy this class as it was all self-teaching and I did not receive much feedback. Had a 'B' the entire semester. Honestly felt lost and like I didn't learn anything the entire semester.,0
"Weil is a terrible professor and really is not a teacher. He's a bully and gives zero feedback on papers. Watch your word count, yes he counts words and doesn't read your content of your assignments if they don't have enough word count. He's pompous and ego driven (his ego) BEWARE of this professor and do NOT take him for a class!",0
"Definitely not worth the hype. The professor was hella dry and I did not find this class interesting at all. His lectures and extremely boring. I found his essay topics unclear, and some of the readings were just so tedious and inconvenient. The class is graded on very little things so your grade is very dependent on each test.",0
"Very unprofessional woman. Never stopped bragging. If u want 2 learn something productive in her class, just buy the book and teach yourself. Doesn't empathize with the difficulties of her students. And apparently doesn't put in practice the Ph.D. in ""psychology"" she has for she only acknowledges her life, her struggles, her Ph.D and finally, HER!",0
"This man knows absolutely nothing about Muslim Fundamentalism. However, that does not stop him from giving his ""expsert"" opinion every time he can ""grandstand"". Stay away!",0
"Wonderful, easily my favorite professor on campus. Cheerful and cares about her students. Very funny, and is honest about the material covered. Gathers a consensus about student's feelings towards a reading and proceeds through class by being aware of the room.",1
"Covered to much to fast, lacked substance",0
She is a great professor and easy to pass her class. Just stay on top of things. She also posts all the weekly assignments at once so you can do all the questions in advance if you would like. Very nice and helpful too,1
I don't even understand how she is actually employed...,0
"He was using an old exam for the first midterm, and he sometimes does this for the final midterm. I know students who studied only an old exams have passed the first midterm and the course with a decent grade. While some people tell you to study hard, I tell you to find as many old tests and practice them over and over.",0
"Awful teacher. He does not actually direct you, and the lectures are pretty pointless to the homework which you are left to figure out on your own. He is arrogant and rude, and expects far too much from students who have never worked in the field. Will mark your papers as ""So what"" and ""irellevant"" but give zero direction.",0
"His lectures are AMAZING! I had him only for half a semester for General Studies, but the class was so interesting and really grasps your attention. He is crazy smart and is understanding if you can't make it to class. Whatever you do, DO NOT walk into class with your phone in site; PUT IT AWAY. Anyways, Dr. Bartl is great and attractive as well ;)",1
"This class is awful.  Instructor is dumb.  She is so unorganized.  Notes that she post are horrible and you can't follow them during a lecture. I honestly can say that I have never had a worse instructor.  RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS CLASS.",0
"I'm sure she is good at what she does in-person, but as for her online class, it's a disaster. I have no idea how to navigate the blackboard page for her class and even the syllabus doesn't match what she actually wants us to do. Just a lot of miscommunication and disorganization.",0
"He's 'flamboyant'  so be prepared for that. His lectures are useless, the papers are vague and difficult and he grades very strangely. I've never had an issue with writing, and in fact enjoy it, but he seems to find an issue with everything I submit, and gives nonsensical reasons for the deductions. If you're an engineer, not a poet- stay away.",0
"Dr. Heth made an 8 a.m. every day in JTerm bearable.  I felt like I really learned something from him.  He definitely has his opinions, but he's also cool if you have different opinions.  Definitely take a class with him.",1
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
"Very passionate, easy class",1
"She grades harshly and takes off points for minor things. She will find any specific thing to mark you off some points. Impossible to get an A on anything. Psych 1 was supposed to be an intro to the subject and class, but no I was welcomed with mistreatment. If you are a Psych Major then sure have at it. But for those who aren't then good luck to u",0
Lecture is long monotone and straight from the power points. everyone falls asleep everyday. I dread this class. While a very kind and friendly woman I would not recommend her for any subject or class. Everyone failed her tests only one A and 3 B's out of 50+ students in my section. No one knows where her test questions come from,0
"Mr.Riley nice man,gives you handouts/WS for each section/CH;long as you read CH & answer each question to full detail/understanding & use those to study w/ diagramss n CH. (to understand n class read & take own notes from CH b4 class!)has powerpoint posted on blackboard no take notes n class just listen all work graded/extra credit  study hard 4 A!",1
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
"Mr. Jiao is a great professor, will work with you if you need help. Show up to class, pay attention to lectures and you will most likely pass. He does a good job explaining lectures on power point. Overall a great understanding teacher.",1
Do not take her! Avoid at all cost!,0
His tezching method uses the material from the text but he goes beyond and incorporates real world experience into his lectures.,1
"Most of class time is correcting him on the math because he doesnt know it well. He does not explain how or why an answer was right or wrong. The professor would tell us to check the online the textbook instead of teaching us in class. The professor does not curve grades, even when all of the class failed a test.",0
"She has no knowledge on intercultural comm. Grade is based on coming to class, one paper & two exams.I dont think she even read some exams and just gave them passing grades. extremely easy if you dont want to learn anything & sit in class for a few hrs a week.",1
"Do NOT take this class. He gives little to no feedback, and is not willing to help struggling students. He changed his curriculum, so now students are required to write 3 papers and take 3 exams (each exam has an essay). Hardest english class I have ever taken. Do not recommend Prof. Landrum. He grades extremely harshly. Not an enjoyable class.",0
"Do not take Spanish 101 (5 week course). I get its suppose to be a lot of work because its cramped but Id recommend if you have to take a language, save it for the reg semesters. teacher gives out an absolutely insane amount of work.. everything is in Spanish.. even expects you to write full convos in Spanish by the first week. No Beuno! Lol",0
"The level of difficulty should be 1 but this professor has impossible expectations. I received a 100 on every module, but debatable discussions etc. that are graded by her were given a 70. I followed the rubric step by step to ensure points were not deducted. Either she didn't agree/like my viewpoint or she just didn't actually read it.",0
" The class material was extremely boring.  I tried to follow and learn from the critiques she gave me but I did not see any improvement in my grade. Her critiques are vague, this was one of the most frustrating class I ever took. I do not like her teaching style and I do not recommend her to anyone. Boring , frustrating & prof not interactive.",0
I enjoyed her class. Before taking classes with her I'd heard how hard the classes were but she really is a great professor. She wants to see that you care about your grade. Great professor!!,1
"I took Calc in HS & got an A+, and got  a B- in this class. I'm in Calc 2 now and I learned more in the one week of review than I did my whole semester of Calc 1. He's a nice guy but his teaching is really all over the place. He doesn't explain anything in full and skips many steps assuming that we all are following his thought process.",0
"Professor Cowherd, while well published and highly regarded in the eyes of faculty and the institute itself, is fundamentally lacking in teaching ability. His single assignment type and grading are overwhelmingly subjective and his elitist and arrogant personality make for an underwhelming and frustrating classroom environment. WILL NOT TAKE AGAIN.",0
"He really cares about the point he's trying to make and he thinks everyone should care about it. I took him for African American history but he seemed like he knew what he was talking about and knew a little bit about the struggle. He talks a lot, but he gives you a chance to say your two cents. I like the music he chose and the pictures are good.",1
"Professor Benitt spends more time discussing UFO's and Big Foot, than he does teaching Astronomy.  He is obsessed with neatness and completely irrational.  His teaching style is haphazard and confusing.  He is all over the board, which makes it hard to copy down notes. My notebook looked like a treasure with all of the arrows I had to draw.",0
"it is a show up and get an A- type of class, her grading is so superficial. You can skip class and she won't notice. Don't buy the textbook! you will never use it once.",0
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
"Assigns online homework on this program mymathlab. It is horrible. I did really well on the my math lab assignments, however once he decided to give us assignments that were 4 sections of the textbook and 90 some problems a piece. absolutely ridiculous! also gives you weekly quizzes with like 8 mins to do them. Completely outrageous!",0
"This class was great. We met twice a week for an hour and 15 minutes or so. He give a lot of essays, which he covers in the syllabus. He goes over every essay in a slideshow with what and what not to do. He really cares about his students and will help them. He plays videos either to enforce his lesson or just for fun and to entertain. I recommend.",1
"Mrs. Ryburn was very helpful if you needed additional instruction. This class is a little different because everyone goes at their own pace based on online test scores. If you needed help with ANYTHING, she was always more than happy to see you during her office hours. She made the math problems very clear when they weren't on the software used.",1
"Mrs Sias is very organized and her class is easy. In her class youll have to listen to a lot of podcasts and read a book from which youll do the majority of your assignments from. She does take attendance every class, so youll need to show up.",1
"WORST TEACHER AT NASHVILLE STATE! Doesn't enter grades at all, claims he only gives a final grade and you are suppose to keep up with your own grades to know if your're passing. Takes the fun out of art! Does the same thing every single class!!! He talks with terrible language and bad body language and uses profanity, which is so unnecessary!",0
"He's such a great professor! He's incredibly knowledgeable and really makes you ponder about everything.  You start to question yourself and the life around you. The course was eye- opening and great. Classes were pretty boring and slow,and sometimes got a little repetitive. I really liked his teaching style and really emphasized individual growth.",1
"I took her class through teco, so we met 3 times for the speeches and the rest of the homework online. She's really sweet and will answer any questions. I like how she gets everyone involved (less anxiety). Overall i would recommend her, she's a sweet women.",1
"I do not recommend taking this course. He is very bias in what he teaches and the content he uses. Because no sociology book or criminology book was good enough to teach his bias opinion, he used articles as old as the 1910's and as recent as the 1980's in his boundaries book so he could teach his bias opinion about government and crime. ",0
This class should honestly be taken before any other biology classes because it provides useful information that helps you understand biology. Also no math in a statistics class!,1
"Worst Professor at NJIT.  I am looking to get him booted.  He never changes his slides, his accent is heavy, he is confused himself when he talks, his exams are confusing and do not correlate to what he teaches, he responds 2 days later too questions, the structure of his class sucks, bad textbook selection, overall he needs a major makeover.",0
Probably my favorite class i took one semester. Professor Candida really cares about her students and is passionate about disability. Many in class lectures however they were engaging and interesting. Attend and participate and you'll have a good time as well as an A.,1
"She grades hard but allows you to change your work after she comments, so it is kinda easy to get a good grade if you work at it. Lots of reading!!!!",1
Horrible I mean REAL BAD professor I do not know what I was thinking when I choose her over the others. She is not consistent with formats of quiz and does not even gives a heads up changes from 10 questions to 20 then back tracking for some quiz and then some allow. Never answers emails does not send send reminders like every other prof. STAY AWAY,0
"Dovidio is a good teacher and he knows his stuff. His video assignments are not complicated, just make sure everything is lit well and positioned correctly and he will be happy as long as you try. Try to show him work as often as you can. The only thing about him is he repeats himself ALOT but try to have patience! He has connections!",1
"The class was OK.  He was super easy and always seemed to be thinking of other things, super preoccupied. Overall I recommend his class if you want a super easy A.",0
"This guy sucks. Pop quizzes every few classes, sometimes 2 in one day so you never know the information to look over. Sometimes, the info isn't on the pop quizzes you learn in class. Not a good personality, if you can take another prof or class, take it. No connection with students, barely even knew our names. Overall, not a good time, hated it.",0
"He is amazing. Show up to class, pay attention to the notes. You need to work for your grade. Great prof.",1
"Although there were times that he had some comments that were uncalled for, I think he is a great professor. He was very nice and funny most of the time. Very easy grading and best of all, no midterms, quizzes, nor final!",1
"If you are a favorite then you will be allowed to make your own rules, if you are not, then you better get it right! If you are not experianced in art...DO NOT TAKE HIM! b/c you are teaching yourself and then getting in trouble for what you did wrong",0
"Washburn is passionate about child care and education, and she really knows what she's doing and talking about. Her lectures are always real life examples that connect to what we are learning in class. Her test are based off her notes. She gives a lot of group work, but it's not something to be scared of. I'm looking forward to seeing her again.",1
Very vague. Not a lot of feedback given,0
"This professor, doesnt teach anything about English. He goes and explains History. Nothing to do with English!",0
Shaikh Karim is lovely. he explains Arabic well. I like him. I hope to marry him and become Muzlim. Love you teacher KOKO!,1
Out of he twelve things we were supposed to cover in the class we only covered two. The whole class revolved in a philosophy he claimed would be famous one day (he made it up). We literally talked about the same thing everyday. The class was a major disappointment and he acted immature when students disagreed with his philosophy. Run while you can.,0
"She's a nice and kind woman, but she's very stubborn and not really willing to see other views. If you write exactly what she wants you to (meaning, agreeing with her opinion) you'll do pretty well, but if you try to challenge any of her views, expect to get hit hard. Very unclear grading criterion.",0
"He loves to talk about american politics, how great Trump is, and american involvement in other regions rather than the actual curriculum. He also loves to talk about the booming oil industry(its not, its actually beginning to decline)... he isnt very clear about whats on tests and quizzes but hands out a quiz ever class period.",0
"Hands down the worst professor at ISU. He makes you feel beyond stupid and isn't afraid to tell you how bad you are at writing. He thinks that he is better than his students just because he has been teaching for so long. He will tell you that he ""believe in you"" when in reality he could care less if you do well in the class or not. AVOID HIM!!!!",0
"This could be the worst professor on campus. She has no leniency so anything late is a 0. She makes you read out of a pointless textbook on a weekly basis, and then asks questions on quizzes that do not relate. This teacher is terrible and I highly recommend that you do no take this teacher, every other public speaking teacher is better than her",0
"Professor Flores is one of the best on campus. I would recommend going as often as possible because she talks about stuff that is not on the slides. The worst part about her class is that her Smartsite is SO UNORGANIZED! It's hard to figure out what lecture is what. Easy class, interesting material, a lot of small assignments. Overall, easy class!",1
"Brilliant theoretical math professor, but can't really teach lower level math. His accent makes following already shaky lectures very difficult. Asking questions is pointless, he doesn't understand you any better than you understand him. If you already know calculus or read the book, you can scratch by.",0
Ams is probably your best bet for organic.,1
Dr Borglin has extreme difficulty breaking down and building up on important concepts. She jumps from one thing to another without explaining the first one. Her inability to break concepts down and poor organization skills is a major reason why I struggled in this class. I got paid with an A but it was all through my own effort not hers. ,1
"she is giving us a test on thursday and a final on tuesday. pshh. what the crap is that. ha, i guyess it doesn't matter but i will cry anyways.",0
Miss Errico is amazing!! I'm taking her again next semester for Acct. 2. go to class pay attention and you should pass. a lot of extra credit  and help is given. she is extremely reachable too. ,1
"The worst professor I have encountered. His rudeness, disrespect, and attitude are so poor. The guy clearly has issues and needs some help. Do not take his class unless if you want to experience his poor grading skills.",0
Don't take this class if you have no business learning about marine biology. Tried to reach her many times regarding my grade and if there were things I could do to better it but she was never any help. She loves to talk about herself and is always making rude comments about perfectionists and ppl with OCD me. Not very nice and voice is annoyin,0
"Dennis Dennis Dennis...the 1st week or so of class you may want to kill him.  However by the end you will be signing up to take more classes with him.  He is extremely unorganized & he knows it.  But, if you ask lots of questions or need help with your work he will be of great assistance.  He is also funny once you get used to his humor.  I <3 him!",1
"Steps to making an A: Take online, DO ALL OF THE HOMEWORK, take the test (grade doesn't matter.) Do whatever you want on the project. I know this is going to sound odd, because it is, the test grades do not matter that much, most of your grade comes from homework. I forgot to do some of mine, drop my grade from an A to a C, had A's on all test. ",0
She's a sweet women,1
Great Prof!!  will take again  The one rater is right.  Dont just sit there.  Helps to speak up in class for sure.  But GREAT discussions.,1
"Took his Saturday 8am class, the lectures are long but if you browse the material during the week it isn't that bad. The tests are pretty clear cut, you do have to study though. He is caring and willing to work with you to make sure you learn the material. The labs are short but entertaining. If you don't get an A it's all on you.",1
"Don't take him!! It's difficult to verbalise just how tedious he is-like a recording of an unfunny Mr. Rogers narrating lectures in slow-motion. Very unclear about requirements, however he spends 20 mins at the beginning of each class repeating the date of every quiz and assignment. Treats you like a child-don't get caught doodling or looking away.",0
"Great professor. I learned a lot in her class, and am looking forward to having her in another tax class for my masters in taxation. If I could have her for all the tax classes for this program, I would.",1
Thanks for a great semester.,1
"He is super smart and this class is very difficult regardless of the professor, however Dr. Norris might have given the most fair exams I have ever experienced The study guides are KEY fill them out email them to him & you will pass this class with a good grade. Go to class. Go to office hours, ask him what it is he wants! Don't buy the book",1
"Fermin is a great prof in my opinion. Overall, lecture do get quite boring sometimes, but Fermin is very passionate and knowledgeable in his specialty. It was only boring to me because the course content itself did not interest me very much. Tutorials are mandatory attendance and quite useful. Reading is assigned from books instead of textbooks.",1
"Often explains concepts in ways that just confuse many students; I frequently spent time with classmates re-explaining the concept because Selgrad just rants. He just spouts his knowledge, which is never absorbed because he doesn't provide students with enough opportunities to program. It's a lot of wasted time, but still leagues above Chen.",0
"Elizondo is a tough professor, she won't hand anything to you, you have to earn it! If you want an easy class take someone else, if you want to learn, take her! It was a challenge, her anatomy class but I loved every class, always learning, she answers questions if you ask. Lecture tests & lab tests are challenging but study and you will be fine",1
"Dr. O'Quinn is incredibly intelligent and this shines through in lecture, but never in a way that seems cocky. He genuinely tries to make harder ideas more accessible - for instance, he will use simple ideas that build off of one another to lead you to a difficult concept. I would absolutely recommend him!!",1
"Jill is a wonderful professor who truly cares about her students. The class is extremely difficult and dense, but she makes it fun and is there for you. I had a very difficult time learning to ""think like a nurse"" in this first semester, but really started to get it by the end of the term! Would definitely take her again.",1
"She goes through around 12 pages of notes in one class. There tests are hard and there is a lot of ""all of the above"" and ""b and c only"". Unrealistic to memorize all her class notes ALONG with the massive textbook. Hard course especially for a first year. Would not recommend as an option.",0
His lectures offer you an insight into the world around you. He teaches real life knowledge.       ~~~very inspirational~~~,1
I got an A on the midterm paper and blackboard says that i have more than 100% on every quiz but I was still given a B in the class. I pretty sure she is out to get me. Not to metion she likesto push her politics on the class.,0
she is really nice and helpful. she makes class interesting snd fun.,1
I took this class because it was required but I ended up having the BEST TIME. My friend and I are in this class together and now we're obsessed with foreign policy. Brownlee is super knowledgable and his exams are very fair. 11/10 recommend,1
"SHE IS SO GOOD!!! She has some real industry experience that a lot of students could really benefit from, she lectures very well and honestly, is one of the best. You will have to work for your grade but it's so worth it!",1
"If rate my professor would allow me to give this woman a 0, I would. Horribly rude and disrespectful. She is one of the most unreasonable people I have ever dealt with in my entire life. The final was nothing we ever learned in class so good luck.",0
"Power point reading in a monotone voice in an early am class  zzz!! Expect to make use of the tutors in order to get your questions answered. She is very unclear, only uses simple problems as examples, does not really seem to know the material well herself. She acts as if questions should not be expected and are an inconvenience to her. ",0
"Majority of the class was failing the entire semester. More than half the class dropped. Not a bad person, but clearly needs to work on establishing clear criteria and realistic expectations given the course level and needs to effectively communicate what they want from the class.",0
Awesome prof! Professional but with a good sense of humor. Expects you to learn a lot but is helpful and understanding. Didn't require a textbook!,1
"This was such a great class. Ms. Khan always shows up early, is available if you need help, and makes sure you have clear guidelines for each assignment. She makes English 120 fun and as painless as possible! Only downside is there's a lot of homework, but she's not a tough grader.",1
do not recommend her to anybody,0
"Promises to be ""your statistician for life"" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can",0
"Solid professor, fair grader, and always willing to go through the complex proofs.",1
"Very nice professor. Exams cover what is discussed in class. Some group projects, graded somewhat leniently. Very experienced in the health field, I enjoyed her ethics class the most.",1
"Dr. Avila really cared about the students. She made sure everyone knew the content. AMAZING professor, I understood everything she was teaching clearly. As long as you turn everything in, youll for sure get a B and getting an A Is also easy. Shes also very funny and sarcastic, you can tell she loves what she does! Great prof!",1
"You go to class listen take really good notes because his powerpoints have only pictures. Study guide has 25-30 words and 3-4 essay questions to study. You must know date, definition, and how it relates to history. Really easy. A on both midterms so far and a B on essay 1. I go to his office and he answers every questions clearly.",1
"She doesn't mind helping students during her office hours, however she made a lot of mistakes when teaching in class which then will confuse you a lot.  If you want to do well, attend her office hours, she might give you a hint what will be on the mid term, which happened to my friend. Overall, not a great prof. Come on U of T!!!",0
"Very, very helpful. Always has time for questions.",1
"WOW. i literally met with her everyday after class, went to the writing center- and spent atleast 5 hours weekly studying for her class, Still got a C. She is ridiculous- and expects you to answer exactly the way she wants- or no points. Deflates grades- highest grade in the class was a b-. this is NOT ok",0
"Easy A.  Makes some crude jokes, but as long as you aren't easily offended, this class is better than a really hard professor.  Goes mainly off outlines for tests.  Go to class most of the time and your set.",1
"do not recommend for a non-english major or to take just as an elective, the class was so boring. she spent the first 30 min of the first three classes attempting to learn our names and 13 weeks later and she still doesn't know mine. she also has a strict bathroom policy. her lectures are boring and class seems to last forever.",1
Hard grader and the test are really confusing and even with the supposed answer you can still get it wrong.,0
"Professor Haney is a great teacher.  He challenges the students to think, uses cold calling effectively, and is crystal clear in his lectures.  His syllabus doesn't overwhelm you with reading.  Most importantly, he scheduled lunch with almost everyone in a 70-80 student class in small groups.  Very kind.",1
"Strange teaching style, but not impossible to pass his class.",1
Nice guy but too disorganized to run an online class. Spent hours trying to figure out which site each assignment was on (never used blackboard like most online profs). Paid $100 for book + $100 online course fee and got an A but couldn't even tell you what Human Geography is. Easy enough to fulfill requirements but you won't learn anything.,0
"Tim Scharks is the single best professor I have ever taken, you could not care at all about environmental economics and he could still be the best professor you've ever taken as well. He's absolutely hilarious yet incredibly intelligent. This isn't the easiest class you'll ever take, but it will surely be the most rewarding!",1
"Professor Elliot is really great to have in class. She sets very clear expectations. If you do the work, it's likely that you'll do well.",1
"She explained simple things in really confusing ways, genetics was easy, but she explained everything out of order with no good explanations of anything. She also gives two ten minute breaks in lecture then speeds through all the material to the point where you can barely write fast enough let alone understand the material.",0
"You will learn more about colonization from reading Bartolome de las Casas' ""Brief Account of the Devastation of the Indies,"" than you will from this entire class. He spends about 90% of the time justifying the European colonizers and how it wasn't that bad. Only refers to native/aboriginal/indigenous people as ""Indians."" Calls slaves ""workers.""",0
"Average exam scores for the whole class was like 45. She boosted grades a week or two before the last day to drop, then put them back to what they were. No idea why she gave false hope but yea. Honestly my fault for not dropping and staying. Dont take this class she sucks at teaching.",0
"Hardest teacher Ive ever had in my whole entire life. Ive always been an A student and got my first C in her class. Very tough grader, one little mistake and you will get a low grade. Does not explain anything and if you have a question she just tells you to read your book. Very strict teacher, and most of the time she does not make sense.",0
He were a great teacher hands down but a tough grader,1
"All you learn in this class is editing videos. You don't learn anything else about media. He is picky on how the videos need to be done. He does mot teach anything. You just film, edit, & present in class. He also has favorites. You make 6-8 vids throughout the semester. He thinks we will all become reporters ugh. If you cant use imovie, good luck.",0
"He is a nice guy, a great lecturer, gives great feedbacks during office hours. He is a tough grader, and I cannot stress how tough he grades on exams. He nitpicks solutions that are not identical to his, and he does not give partial credit. If you're looking to learn, he's the man. If you're looking to pass, try another professor.",0
"Hes very knowledgeable and teaches the material really well. Hes also friendly and nice. Theres a test for each chapter, but they are only 20 questions and are all from the worksheets you do in class. Theyre identical. He literally gives you the correct answers in class. The only way you could fail is if you just winged the tests each time.",1
I took MTH 242 this summer amid the pandemic. The coursework was quite heavy because it was a typical semester class that I took in 6 weeks. Dr. Chang is very upfront about the demands of this class. Her grading policy is very clear and fair. Statistics (MTH 242) is somewhat of a difficult class but Dr. Chang is willing to help you in any way.,1
"Dr. Workman seems tough when you first start, but he's actually a pretty easy professor and a lot of fun. He has a very dry and sarcastic sense of humor that is absolutely hilarious if you like that kind of humor. His tests are a bit challenging, but open book and collaborative. I recommend taking him.",1
On tests he chooses the most difficult problems and tries to make his tests as hard as possible when they shouldn't be. His tests are much much harder than the homework and quizzes. He makes his tests as hard as possible.,0
"if you get an option of a thursday or tuesday lab take thursday because the tuesday lab can tell you everything on the lab exams, don't take the quizzes lightly, they add up and are a huge factor. Don't rely on her as a teacher, she simply goes off the ch in her class time. She does her best to be there but in the end its just a job. good outlines",0
"She's insanely hard! I had to work extremely hard in her class to pull a C. When she lectures, she talks too fast and in a way that no one understands. I like her as a person she's very nice. Would I ever take a class with her again? Absolutely not.",0
"Took a Grad Assistant for pre calc and got a D, retook it with Mr. Justice and got an A-, took him for Calc I, got an A- again. I am going to keep taking him for every class I can. He teaches efficiently,  and is a very fair grader. He even gave us a take home exam. 10/10 recommend.",1
"Prof. Keeling is a good teacher, and I found his course material really interesting and engaging. I would have liked the course better if he were more respectful. He tends to be very passive aggressive to his students and even complained about several of them to me in office hours once. Recommended as a professor, but not as a human being",0
"Really qualified, charismatic guy. I took PS 361 and 201 from him in the same semester and he was great in both classes. Heard lots of the same stories though.     361: lots of required reading but I never read and got an A.      201: lecture style, kinda boring. 2 essays and the final are the only graded work- all pretty easy.",1
She grades like it is a 400 level course and she never answers her email so don't bother trying to ask her for help through an email. Avoid getting her at all costs,0
"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",0
Amazing person and lecturer! Makes 3T03 interesting even though some of the material is dry. Would recommend this course to anyone,1
"Prof's lectures tend to bore me since it is redundant and not straight to the point. Otherwise, when it comes to projects, it may be frustrating when attempting to get approval to start painting, but Prof B encourages you to go further and bring out the project's value with some tweaks. Good class if you're willing to go past artistic boundaries.",1
terrible because he focuses on side stories and not actual content,0
"Although attendance is not mandatory, it is very important to be at class as all her exams are based off of lecture material. Gives a ton of feedback on how to improve grade and is open to helping students bring their grades up.",1
Well learned in subject. Willing to compromise and work with you.,1
"This class is extremely easy, and it was super interesting. Allen is a great guy; he gives you a clear grading criteria that you are supposed to meet. Gives extra credit! It's easy so it lets you enjoy the class and have fun learning about plants. Expect several tests, like 2 pop quizzes, one group project with plant mapping, and one talk. ",1
"Dr. Hartman is the best professor I ever had. He is funny, intelligent, and will challenge your beliefs (in a good way). I cannot recommend him enough. If you ever have the chance, take a class with Dr. Hartman. He is an amazing teacher and and is always there to help. ",1
First day of class stated that she rarely gives an A grade. Doesn't feel that students can write on that level. Don't expect her to put grades into the computer until the last day of the semester. Quizzes for the first half of the semester on homework reading. I would attempt to avoid her class if possible. Formal writing for an informal world.,0
"Johns keepin it real in the classroom all the time, big mans got big tings for students around campus and from a far. i have lots of respect for mans and aspire to get a Phd. see ya next year pal",1
Professor Randall is a pretty awesome Professor and is always willing to help you inside and outside of the classroom. She always relates very well but can class can get slightly off topic easily.,1
"He is very nice and respects students. He is also very empathic, effective and teaches so that students would understand the concepts. Try to attend class and pay attention and you would pass. If possible record his lectures and make your notes from it. His exams are not difficult if you listen to him in class.",0
Talks too much and doesn't listen to what students have to say. He also tends to talk down to students and never gives a clear answer. His grading is straight forward. Expect multiple long emails per day.,0
"I took this class for a general education credit, and I'm not a biology major. His class was hard but definitely passable. You have to get the textbook and you have to go to class if you want to pass the tests. His lectures were fun and very informative and he did a lot of in class activities.",1
"He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.",0
Teacher is bad. Don't take his class. Took CGS1100 online and had to make up one of his tests. Had to email him 6 times before I could take it. He tells you to check blackboard for messages everyday but he doesn't even do that himself. Skip this prof. and pick a different one. Easy class but I knew 90% of the material prior to taking it.,0
"Gives So much work and isn't considerate of other work you have outside of class. Reads off all the slides, this professor made me reconsider my major and take any more News classes.",0
Everything is done through Pearson so know your deadlines and complete them you will get a good grade. The powerpoints are available through Pearson that helps with concepts and the math nature. He posts videos on D2L on how to do some of the math so if you save your excel sheets from the homeworks it makes taking the exams much easier.,1
This class was hard only 3 tests which count for 90% of your grade. My advice for any students interested in majoring in business stay away from buiness adminstration if you are not good in certain class,0
"If you want to fail a course, go ahead and take a class with this instructor. He's unorganized, and his teaching motto is ""I write on board and you figure out"", um okay? Then why have an instructor? English isn't his 1st language so there's a MAJOR language barrier, if he doesn't understand your question he completely ignores you.",0
This teacher is definitely the worst I have ever had going to this school. I took this class online and it was nearly impossible. The homework and test questions did not reflect her slides or the book. She was amazing at pulling questions out of thin air. She also would answer emails asking for help with snide remarks. AVOID HER IF POSSIBLE!,0
Procurement Law (PROC 5810) taken with this professor. This is a tough but useful class. Very informative. Professor has good understanding of subject and explains it well. Very good class overall. Would recommend.,1
"Maureen speaks VERY quietly so sit in the front row. Meet with her at the very beginning of the semester even if it's just to say hi. If you do so, she'll bend over backwards for you. Shes not always clear on what she wants you to do so ASK QUESTIONS. Participation is very important if you don't want a major assignment. Didn't really like the class",0
Most amazing prof I've ever had! Really has a passion for her work!,1
If u r taking this class read everything in the sylabis! You will need it! if she gives u notes b prepared to take a pop quiz next class. Her notes are all over the place bring a recorder. Her tests are hard. STUDY THE TIME LINES! and yes she has favorites.,0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. All her exam questions are trick questions; since her grammar is poor to begin with, this makes getting an A very hard. Put of a class of 60+, we averaged one or two A's per exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",0
Good teacher!,1
In all honesty Ted is a nice guy but a terrible teacher.  He struggles to explain the material and makes it very challenging for students.  To survive in this course you have to teach yourself the material in order to succeed.  ,0
"Very difficult class, not sure if this is SCC mandated but this class really needs to slow down on the homework and give students time to learn the material vs rushing through it. Mrs. Conrad really cares about the students and wants them to succeed; but when test averages are in the 65% range it is time to reevaluate how the material is taught.",1
"I cannot stress how horrible this professor is. He will leave you hopeless and confused. Even with the copious amounts of tutoring I attended nothing could have prepared me for those horrid exams. Save your money, save your time, and save your enthusiasm for an actual professor. Avoid at all costs, even delay your graduation. Its worth it.",0
"Keeps the class interesting.  Those that claims he doesnt teach, probably do not have the capacity to learn.",1
Quite boring..strong accent.semi-lenient with grading..unclear in lecture.he is nice though.,0
Professor Morgan is very much so an expert in the journalism field. His class is not too difficult. He can be a bit disorganized but it doesn't affect your grade. He is not a tough grader and is a nice and caring prof. I enjoyed his class.,1
"Unless you have a good previous understanding of chemistry, avoid her like the plague. Yeah, you might pass but if you learn anything its most likely because you taught yourself. Getting extra help is like pulling teeth and her lectures are absolutely brutal. Such a waste of money for this class and will probably have to retake at some point.",0
"Worst class i have ever taken! tests were something else than the course material, tutorial was like being back in grade 6, the essay was out to trick students. Take her tenure away!",0
"I took ENG 250 as a half semester course, so it was a lot of work in a little amount of time, but he made it easy as it was possible to be, I think. Make sure you do the assigned readings and participate.",1
This class is not terrible but his teaching style is so dry I have to drink a large coffee to stay awake most days. I recommend taking the online course but overall it is an easy A as long as you do well on the exams,0
"I loved having Patti as a prof. She was able to keep me fairly interested in what was going on, and when though I didn't read most of the material, I was still able to understand what the books were about! I would love to take a class with her again!",1
"Loved his class, very well prepared.  The arrogance was just the touch needed to wake you up in the morning, very entertaining.  I would love to take one of his classes again.",1
Hes courses are very easy. He cares about his work and students.,1
"One of the most awesome professors I've ever had.  Hard and utterly confusing, but so much fun.  The man is my hero.",1
"One of the best professors i have had in my 3 years. He actually takes the time to make sure we understand the material & readings. Even though i had no interest in the subject, he taught it in a way that allowed me to actually pay attention in class. Assignments are easy - mainly busy work, exams are fairly easy -MC/blanks/short answers.",1
He does not explain topics well. his lectures are no help at all I had to learn everything from the textbook even though i attended every lecture. The examples he goes through in class he uses solutions for the textbook which is not helpful at all.,0
"Professor Wood cares A LOT about her students. When ""life"" happens she will be there for you 100%. If you care she will also. She wants you to understand the meterial, and also pass her class. She is so smart and makes math easy for those who find it hard to understand. She is my absolute favorite professor. Keep up with the work and you will pass",1
Her feedback is terrible and her grading is the hardest I have ever experienced.  She is unreasonable in her grading practices and does not take responsibility for her own errors. I will never take another class instructed by her again.,0
"Asking questions in class can be difficult, as they are usually met with a condescending tone. While her style of teaching, using hand-written notes and examples, is helpful for students who learn better by doing, she often moves so fast that keeping up can be arduous.",0
She was helpful but she made the class too hard. Has been known to yell at students and make them feel stupid! Sweet outside of class! Just a hard language and a hard class. I dropped it and took sign language (recommened),0
"She is a wonderful professor. Policy is a lot of material to cover and she goes at the pace of the students so that everyone understands the material. She is really helpful and understanding that we have other classes also. Three tests that are heavily graded, lots of studying needs. A few papers, but overall easy class. Just read chapters.",1
"just dont waste your time, the good reviews are outdated, its time for him to retire, he does not know how to teach an online class. The class feels like a punishment . never answers emails and has always seems like he doesn't know what's going on",0
Easy A. Had online quizzes and speeches. Online quizzes have unlimited amount of chances and it takes the highest score. Speeches were easy just follow the grading rubric.,1
"I enjoyed having Professor fields because she was approachable, but she didnt get back to me on a few emails (or took 3 days). The class was kind of difficult, honestly. Reading the chapters was a breeze and the information wasnt hard to grasp, but the homework assignments and tests were pretty difficult. I barely got an A and had to work HARD.",1
The course in general is pretty bad. Berthiaume doesn't seem to care much and doesn't explain things particularly well. The exams were difficult.,0
One of the most interesting history classes I've taken and she really cares about the stuff shes teaching.  She is really enthusiastic and spends alot of time with you outside of class if you want it.,1
She grades really hard but the tests are probably the WORST part. She only gives you 30 min for 20 questions even though in the syllabus it says 40 min. Her reviews are almost useless because taking the test there is more info that you needed than provided. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
"Dr. Mark is very straight forward with what she expects from you. There is a quiz and journal entry due each week, along with group activities for points during class time. Participation is required. There are a few major grade assignments and tests throughout. Overall, she provides a lot of insight to working as a human resource professional.",1
"Greta is a personable professor. She makes you work for your grade, but she is there alongside helping you through every paper. She always has lots of feedback on papers.",1
Would not recommend unless you're a freshmen. The class was a dread to go to and kind of annoying because it was a waste of time but it was extremely easy.,0
Unreasonable strict on grammar. More strict than my English professor.  It doesn't like a planning class more like an art class. Lots of reports  and analysis. Too much details to lose your mark. I would drop his class if it wasn't mandatory.,0
"Traditional style lecture with ppt slides that she skips thru(states wont be tested on but sometimes are), very few examples considering its a science course. No hmwk to better understand material. Xcredit assignment after, 1st exam that helped comprehend material. Make sure you read all chapter & review all ppt slides before class.",0
"Awful prof, he doesnt teach, he only goes over whats in the book once and expects you to know it fluently. Expects you to be fluent in the oral exam(its a requirement to get 100%), give hours worth of homework a week. Exams all open ended, will give a zero On a problem for missing a letter in a word,no word Bank. Class runs over almost everyday.",0
"Instead of teaching in class she makes you watch videos at home (which is difficult when you work full time) and ""reviews"" in class. Does not give reviews for the test, online homework, quizlet is your best friend in this class.",1
"Incredible! In the process of taking her for a second time and wish to do so again in the future. Very engaging, invested in her students, and always willing to discuss course concepts with you. Entry level course requires work for a 100 level, but is very ""real-world"" information that is practical to use.",1
"She was very unorganized & scattered, usually arriving 5-7 mins late. Lectured about topics that were irrelevant to the films we watched, but really knows her stuff. Expected us to read 10 articles each week, but no one did. The class was an Easy A, but excruciatingly boring. Asked us to buy 2 books, but never referenced them. Easy grader on papers",1
"I have had her for 2 classes now and want to take as many as possible with her. She is a great professor, really knows her topics. She is very approachable and always willing to help students. Her classes are interesting, but you must put in a good amount of effort to get  an A",1
"Goes over nothing in lecture all the quizzes are based strictly on reading from the book.  Nice guy, he's pretty funny and didn't have a final exam but was a terrible teacher.  Class time was pointless the only reason I went was because he would give us journal questions we had to answer and the only way to get them was in class.",0
"I had Dr. Thomas her very first semester at Tech. When I tell you this was my favorite class so far in my college career, please believe me. You can tell that she loves teaching. She is also a vet herself, so it's very helpful to get this kind of knowledge from her. There are easy quizzes every week, so take advantage of them! The tests are easytoo",1
"He is a very nice person and had some fun lectures, but the tests are way different from the lectures. The first exam had an average of like 68% and that was because his quizzes, lectures, homework, and honestly even the book don't truly prepare you well enough for the exams. He scratches the surface and expects you to dive deeper. Seems flipped.",1
"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",0
People say all you have to do is read from the notes and you will do fine on the homework and tests. You do realize his notes are excessively long and tedious to read? He also assigns some huge project which takes forever to do.,0
He says it like it is. He provides interesting lectures. All you have to do is raise your hand at least once a class and you will get an A.,1
"I really liked Prasad but I gave her a 3 because she doesn't explain directions, the tests and reviews are nothing alike, and before tests, she has students teach the test materials. The problem with that is half of the students don't care about teaching the materials so you don't effectively learn them. She's pretty good, but maybe not the best",1
"Professor McKean challenges his students, and those those that embrace the challenges  quickly become stronger writers.",1
"Honestly just feels like he doesn't care about students and receives a lot more joy from getting to take points away from students than seeing them succeed. Terrible lecturer, decent slides, understood nothing from him talking, most things from the slides when he didn't use 500 slides to make a simple point.",0
Hes very nice. You will do well on test if you study. 1 reading and assignment with the reading per week but isnt hard to manage,1
"He is such an easy A! Easy class confusing lectures , but if you go to recitation you will definetly pass ! Shanleigh best recitation teacher ever . I never read and I got a A ",1
"Professor O'Hara is a good professor. There are 12 quizzes, a blog (which you must keep throughout the semester covering government issues in a local city), two in class stories, and a final exam of 50 questions. It's not a hard class if you read the chapters each week and complete the blog.",1
If you take this class make sure this is the only class you take that semester. That's how difficult this class is! If you are working a full time job and have several classes this is not a class to take. Her assignments disappear after mid night even though she saids the assignment is due next class. Gives so much work even on test days.,0
"Celia is very passionate about ASL. However, she does not provide much constructive criticism. There was weekly homework and tests worth tiny amounts overall. Has obvious favourites and is not super approachable. You may feel like your efforts are not recognized or you don't gain as much as you put in to the course. Be prepared for tough feedback.",1
"For those of you who are English and Non English Majors, I strongly recommend you take this class. English 111 is not as hard as might you think. You will write 4 essays and to listen to powerpoint each class. Yes you need textbook. Can be a little picky while grading essays. There are also no quizzes, no tests, and no finals.",1
"Dr. Hansen is a great teacher and is very passionate about soils; however, his class doesn't always effectively invite others to feel the same way. If you aren't naturally interested in soils, this class will be tough. The textbook is a very dull read, which doesn't help.",1
"I would recommend his American Govt class if you're only taking the class because it's required. I have no interest in history, but I know the basics. This class was fairly easy, and he gives you cheat sheets for all the homework. Tests are mainly over PPTs and what he lectures about in class. No quizzes.",1

"Dean was OK. Going to lecture is important, often boring but just go. No cum. final which is clutch. Boring and not super useful, but we made it folks.",0
"I wasnt a bio major and it was all coursework a biology graduate had difficulty helping me with. Lots of assignments and for an online class it took more time out of my day than an actual lecture would. Read all course work very carefully if you HAVE to take this class, otherwise dont take it.",0
"Le pire prof que jai jamais u. Des examens qui ont aucun rapport, difficile pour rien !! Un examen cest faire pour tester la compréhension las pour faire couler le cours aux étudients. Plus jamais ce prof.",0
"Excellent Teacher!  Very enthusiastic about teaching.  Exams are tough...mostly application questions. Understand the concepts you are reading in the book, don't just memorize.  The class moves at a very fast pace. Plan to spend at least 12 hours a week studying.",1
"Professor Martinez is really my kind of professor in that she's very passionate about the subject of Black History. I found the class to be very challenging in an intellectual but more surprisingly, an emotional way. She doesn't hold back on her lectures in presenting one of the most comprehensive classes you can take on ethnic studies.",1
He is not very nice very insulting and makes rude comments,0
I liked her class. She is really nice and is really passionate about child care. Only reason I got a B instead of an A in her class was because of the group projects (my group was lazy and never showed up to meetings) ALSO DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!,1
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
"Awesome teacher! Extremely helpful and available, but you have to go to class and do all the work. Tests are not hard and a major project easy and fun to do. I definitely recommend her!!",1
Mean. Gives contradictory feedback. Not helpful.,0
"Make sure you have reliable internet, a decent computer, and you are a fast test taker. She will not allow you a chance to make up time lost during any test if you have connection issues, she's not helpful. She is a pretty rough grader but involved in discussions. The assignments are not hard and she gives a few extra credits throughout if needed.",0
"Often gets off track with her lectures. Has course info in multiple different places that are not always aligned/updated. Moves WAY too fast on a minute-to-minute level, even for a review course - she'll sometimes wait two seconds (not an exaggeration) between an asking a question and asking if anyone has solved it. Take someone else's class.",0
"Benny cares about you and will adjust the grading scale according to how the class performs. He is lenient in grading exams and looks to see if you understood the concept rather than focusing on whether your answer is correct. Grading: 2 midterms (50%), final (30%), hw (20%). Hw is tough and long but I learnt the most in this class.",1
"He is very nice and easygoing, but has a heavy accent (Chinese?) and can be difficult to understand. Also, he is not helpful when you don't understand a concept and need to ask questions.. All things considered, I would not recommend him. I had to heavily rely on my book to learn in this class.",0
"Dr Sam is a good lecturer. He knows his stuff and he makes the class interesting and easy for everybody. He explains things if you do not understand and he does not go out of the syllables for his exams which are good to take. Although i don't have an A yet, bc we just took the practical exam, i am pretty confident of one.",1
"He hand writing stinks, but he's an interesting guy who knows his stuff. studied at berkeley. grades were based on 2, 4 page papers and 2 essay style tests. i liked the books used in this class. come to class and do the work you should get an A. lots of in class assignments. TAKE THIS ONE",1
Professor Daigle has got to be one of the most difficult professors I have ever had. He doesn't care whether you get a F or an A in the class. I'm sure there's better teachers at the mental institutions. there is only 3 grades the whole semester and its insanely hard test. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MR. PAUL DAIGLE! he's a trash can,0
"Will shows interest in his students and is overall a nice prof, but lecture content can be boring. There are fun field trips tough. The course has a lot of group projects, papers, and academic readings. Engage with your peers, improve your writing, and keep up with the weekly readings to succeed. Tests are all multiple choice.",1
"Nice, funny, super interesting lectures, but exams are a total guessing game.  However, everyone is pretty lost and he does his own sort of curve.  The project is extremely tedious and kind of disorganized. His disorganization is what makes it difficult, not the material.",0
PEX 160 is Latin Nightclub Dance and was very entertaining. I have no rhythm whatsoever but still managed to learn a thing or two and receive a good grade. You learn classic styles of dance like chacha and salsa. Show up to class everyday and put in effort and you'll get a good grade.,1
"She is one of the most important scholar / thinker alive today, it is an honor to learn from her. She is an amazing teacher and someone who can teach you endlessly about yourself and the world.",1
Homework is more of a suggestion since it isn't collected and is therefore worth 0% of your grade. Grade is determined by 2 midterms and a final exam. The exams pretty much cover what is in his lectures and lectures are very proof heavy. He often gets off topic talking about physics problems that are loosely related to lecture material.,0

"I am a 4th year UTM student, and this is one of the few courses I have taken at UTM where you will actually learn something. Lectures are old style pen and paper, which is why, in my opinion, you actually learn, the professor is very organized and clear. Test questions are a bit challenging, graders are tough, but I'll definitely take her again.",1
"Professor Freed is an awesome teacher. The novels she picked to cover have all been published fairly recently, and they're all great reads. There are three in-class essay exams, 10 ""optional"" experience points (they're mandatory; you just get to pick what you do), and the final. She is a VERY tough grader, though, so don't expect an easy A!",1
"When she said the class is an accelerating class, she obviously wasn't joking. Although her class is not easy, it's not hard either. As long as you follow her instruction, you'll easily pass the class. She's extremely helpful and nice.",1
"He is amazing, and I would recommend people to take him. Very understanding, and works great with his students. Lets you use notecards on tests.",1
Actually said maybe statistics just isnt your thing after i went to his office hours to question the amount of points he took off for small math errors.,0
"Very clear about what to expect. Is so passionate about innovation and adds so much value to the classroom. One of the best instructors at NAIT. Truly cares about her students. You will get so much out of her if you try. If you skip class or show up late, you will struggle in her class. She is great!",1
"4 3-5 page papers, 4 presentations, 10-page final and presentation, lots of reading. Too much work for lower div. but an easy grader with clear expectations and rubrics for all assignments. Only daily hw is reading, which can be 10-80 pages a night, depending. A quirky guy who loves tech and history. Shows cool videos and often grants extensions.",1
"Would often make you stay hours after class for a critique that wasn't very useful, or wouldn't have time to give one at all.  Provided lots of examples and books that were helpful to look at. Her instructions on assignments weren't clear half of the time, and she docks points if you don't participate in class discussions/critiques everyday.",0
"There is a lot of work to be completed for this class, but I believe that it has made me a MUCH better academic writer. Other than that, Tom is an incredibly caring and intelligent person. To be in his class was a blessing and a pleasure.",1
Worst teacher I've had yet. He judges you and belittles you in front of everyone. I hated this class and recommend that students find a different professor. He makes you feel stupid and isn't a good teacher. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS!,0
Telling Tales is the class I look forward to the most this semester. Much of the material Mclane assigns evokes deep thought and analysis which he lets everyone discuss during class. He is a tough one to acclimate to but once you accept that he expects your solid effort and input he actually becomes quite endearing.,1
Davidovitch is an absolutely useless incomprehensible teacher with no ability to help his students with anything.  THe way he teaches is impossible to learn from without memorizing every single thing he says. But the thing is you can't understand a single thing he says or writes because of his horrible spelling and accent. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!,0
Great professor! He is super funny and gets to the point with his lectures. He normally ends class early and gives everyone time during class to work on their group projects.,1
"Where do I begin, professor Monahan is the beginning, the end, the one who is many! Get used to that fact. His class was the highlight of my semester and if you do your part you will get what you deserve. He is more than fair with the amount of work he gives, and very understanding that we are all students who have hectic lives. 100% recommend!!",1
"there are a lot of assignments but if you do the work correctly, youll get 100%",1
I honestly don't know where these reviews are coming from. She is one of the worst teachers here at SUNY Geneseo and wouldn't be surprised if she got fired. Her lectures are VERY boring and she doesn't teach you a single thing. Be prepared for living hell...,0
"Dr. Vohs was a great professor.  He was very helpful when I needed him, and I thought he explained difficult concepts very well.",1
"Dr. Hart. Her review slides are longer than the lectures themselves.. babbles on about her personal life more than the protists she adores and fingi she thinks are cool. Save yourself and avoid her at all costs. Or just go off the textbook and skip class, lectures are not worth it.",0
"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",0
"Easy A, just make sure you buy the textbook that has answers for test.",1
"I'm not crazy about his teaching style, nor do I think his powerpoint/lectures are well put together. With that said, he is a very intelligent man w/ a sense of humor. As a working paralegal he is able to tell you about how things really show down in the field. You are going to work in his class, but you come out appreciating it. I recommend.",1
"Where do I begin. How about the fact that we finished the curriculum BEFORE SPRING BREAK. We hadn't had exam 1 and he was already teaching exam 3 material. I use the term ""teachcing"" VERY loosely. He does not work out problems contrary to what he says. He puts a piece of paper on a project and reads the numbers for 15 seconds. A V O I D. ",0
"EOSC 310 used to be an easy science requirement course, but not any more. Now you have to use a poorly written, unclear book with difficult, confusing weekly quizzes. Longridge was not helpful in answering questions or clarifying anything.",0
Not a fan. Hartman doesn't really seem to care too much about her students unless you're a part of the English department. I've gotten attitude one too many times from her and I would not recommend her if you're a student who needs help outside of the class.,0
"I meet with him after 1st week asking him how he saw this class. He said, come to class; be prepared when you come to class and ask for assistance. I did all three. He made himself available; I attended class and came prepared. My grade reflected my effort. What more can you ask for?",1
"I love Abdo! She explains grammar very well and helps you understand the material. Homework is for a completion grade, one partner projects, extra credit opportunity, and short/ easy quizzes. She's a real gem and is funny. Let's students teach the class at times and has class discussions instead of just lecturing. ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT UTSA",1
She is not an easy grader. Her test ask random questions about half in her powerpoints half from the book. The amount of Studying I needed to do to get an A was the most I have ever needed to study. Others will study for hours and only get a C on the exams. She is not the professor just be prepared for the class I guess.,0
"Very difficult. She grades according to how she views things and does not have any room for error. Grading is very harsh, somewhat unfair. I studied for a whole month ahead of the ECO 103 final and still got a C! If you are not ready to spend 2+ hours a night on Econ just to pass, I would not recommend taking her class.",0
"Teacher that does not like students despite what he himself thinks. Overall, the class was uncomfortable with an almost hostile feeling to it. He also does not understand modern approaches to software projects. Class also does not have a lot of resources. You will be punished for using internet for help (not code copying). Also no piazza.",0
"Difficult, unhelpful, unresponsive to questions, designed to make you struggle and fail.",0
I barely went to class... just for the review and tests. Going to class will just confuse you because all she does is drag on topics and uses big words for no reason. Her power points are literally just words without explanations. The only reason I got a B- was because I never went to class and just read out of the book.,0
"This professor made one semester for me at Northeastern a living Hell. Easy enough class, but my experience with him was one of the worst in my academic career. Do not take a class with this professor f you are a working student or require flexibility with your deadlines/workload . 0/10.",0
A very knowledgeable instructor at Thermodynamics he motivates you to push yourself beyond your imagination. You may not get the best grade however you'll learn a lot. In addition he loves turbines and talks a lot about GE,1
"This professor is extremely difficult. Genetics is a difficult class through and through but Dr. Jone's makes it ridiculously difficult. On our past test, no one made A or B and the average was a 58. She thinks we are doing well though. Do not plan on taking this class and coming out with a good grade even if you study at least a week in advance!!",0
she wants things done her way or youll get a low grade.,0
this prof's #1 goal is to make his students life a living nightmare. avoid at all cost,0
rude and unhelpful. tests are hard,0
"Nice Guy, bad jokes. Doesnt return HomeWork soon enough for students to know if they are doing their work correctly. Puts questions on quizzes from sections he hasn't gone over. He doesn't go through the process of solving problems, he just plugs it into Mathematica and students have to figure it out for themselves.",0
"The content he has to teach is very difficult, and he doesn't make it any easier by assigning tons of mandatory homework every week. He does not engage class, in fact he hates when he has to stop the class to answer questions. Very difficult to approach outside of class. Exams are very difficult, know what you're doing and study hard, don't slack.",0
"He is a good professor. He gives you study guides that if you do them, they are word for word like his exams. Any word he says is relevant to these study guides so you need to pay attention.  He does curves. Enough said with that.",1
Dr. Wang is a very particular grader and knows what she wants.  She responds immediately with email questions and is definitely there if you need help.  Lectures go very quickly and you can't miss one or you would fall behind.  Pick good group mates because that's your whole grade. I worked really hard but did learn a lot.,1
I was one of the people that didnt drop her class even after reading these reviews and it cost me. AVOID this evil lady at all costs!! She did not let me make up 1 lab of 1 week before in order for me to qualify for the NC grade. I attended all her classes and that was the first lab I missed. I have never come across someone so evil in my life,0
Do not take this class if you care about your GPA. He refuses to give out good grades and there are only 3 exams which are so difficult. Teachers like this should not have a job.,0

"I took this course on top of MBioS494 and got As in both. But, it was not easy. You earn it. Yes, lots to read. Yes, lots to write. Oh, but the learning. You will learn-A LOT, and A LOT is expected of you. If you haven't taken tough reading/writing courses, these are not for you. No excuses, including ESL. You've been here 4 y already! Thanks Prof.",1
"This class is completely awful. Three papers assigned for a history class is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even about history as much as it is him trying to teach us how to write in useless styles such as Chicago and Turabian, like why?? He always goes back and changes what he wants and there is no real structure. You'll regret taking this class",0
His class is useless. talk about things he enjoys talking about not what students need to know. One of the worse prof I had.,0
"Hunt is a very boring professor. She gives very organized power points but reads in such a monotone voice. As far as being a teacher she is okay, but as a person she doesn't seem to care about her students. She has a lot of pride and looks down on her students. Her exams are also more difficult than other professors.",0
Long and repetitive lectures. Also won't answer questions about final paper through writing and pushes phone conferences. Would not recommend.,0
"Excellent teacher, very helpful.",1
I took him for organic chemistry and I do not recommend! He goes by notes only and doesnt really teach you anything. One time during a lecture a classmate asked if he could go back a slide because she did not understand and he told her its on the slide show in moodle Also does not really reply to emails or sends short replies,0
"Not only a tough grader but an unfair grader. DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER.  Also she is not afraid to share her views with the class, which I found unprofessional. Definitely an interesting class but it is not enjoyable whatsoever. She does give extra credit options but even is picky with that. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Not a nice nor understanding prof.",0
"Mrs. Fox is tough, but diamonds are the hardest rock, and this one's a real gem. Stick it out and work your ass off and you'll learn so much.",1
He is a really nice guy. Expect to write 2 papers a week and don't expect more than an 18/20 often. His mid term and final are not bad. The material can get really boring. My writing really improved over the semester.,1
Super nice and understanding prof. His lectures are somewhat bland but they're definitely passable. Assignments were very straightforward and there were many marks taken throughout the semester so the final was only worth 30%. Definitely respects his students and their education. Recommmend!,1
Attendance points every class. She is very sassy and doesn't answer questions directly/ is not helpful. Half of the class consists of online labs using SPSS. The course reader helped a lot and she gives you a cheat sheet on the final.,0
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
"This class is hard, but it is extremely rewarding. Dr. K does everything to help you understand what you are confused on and he is ALWAYS around---seriously. A great professor to take a course from and a great person. Go to class.",1
"The tests DO NOT match the reviews. If you are taking this class as a requirement and know most of the material already, it's straightforward (tests/hw only). He doesn't ""teach"". He works out a problem of every kind in the chapter (whether you need it on the test or not-overload of info) . He does this quickly & with no patience for questions.",0
Lisa assigns assignments with little to no direction. She requests that you go to peers for help instead of her. She grades tough- you get a C for doing exactly as she asks; you must go above and beyond to get any higher.,0
"He come across a little too laid back at first and as a result is hard to take seriously until you start getting bad grades. He does however care and will offer you plenty of extra credit assignments if he can see that you are trying and a good student. Take him seriously, if you don't, don't be chocked when you get a 'D' or an 'F'.",1
"This was the worst and most unorganized instructor in spanish.He fails to use any visual aids, no handouts, no powerpoints, spreaks only in spanish with a satuated accent, fails to answer any emails, hardly use the blackboard, grades unfairly, and gets mad if he finds out you reported him, takes it out on the class, he is a terrible instructor!!!!!",0
"The class is based on one big project. Attendance in mandatory. Her guidelines for the assignments sometimes are the opposite (literally) of what she wants. For example, one assignment we did was a survey with open-ended questions, after turning it in she said she ""said in class"" she wanted closed-ended questions. Staff loves her, I'm not sure why.",0
"She's nice, understanding, and just wants you to participate and do your work.",1
"Extremely rude professor. Not very helpful to student responses, more often to just respond with a snark comment. Poor teaching skills, and course coordination skills. Doesn't listen to student feedback.",0
"Great professor. Homework was pretty average. If you read and do what you're supposed to, you should pass, no problem. She requires a discussion board per chapter, which I found to be annoying, especially for the assigned topic. I would, however, take a class from her again. Overall a solid professor choice.",1
"Professor Wigginton thrives on torturing students. She goes out of her way to make assignments and quizzes more difficult. She cancels her office hours almost every week, so when you have questions you have to email her. Then she never responds to emails!! Ever!! Rude and never available. Dont take a class with her if you can help it!",0
"This professor expects wayyy too much out of his students for a 244 class, I bought six different books for this one class. It's unclear and difficult how to achieve an A in the class as all the guidelines only detail how to achieve a B in the course. If you aren't a kiss up, it's going to be needlessly difficult.",0
"You may want to throw a test rock in before entering her office. Sometimes she's great, helpful, interesting; sometimes she's stark raving mad (I mean ""Yellow Wallpaper"" mad).",0
"Dr. LaBelle is definitely a solid choice for research methods. She can be a tough grader, but if you just sit and take time to do the assignments properly, you should be fine/pass. Her grading criteria is clear and she's accessible outside of class in her office hours to help. She's also pretty cool when you get to know her outside class.",1
"Greatest professor of all time! I don't like government but Prof. Tapia makes it really interesting. I learned a lot in his class. He's really funny, and good looking. The class had easy online quizzes, and a discussion assignment on the budget. This was my favorite class at MDC!",1
"The most caring professor!Kind hearted, intelligent, easy-going.Truly the best professor i have ever had!",1
"She promised practise questions for Imin, delayed them week after week and then never gave em. Inconsistent",0
"I agree with the clothes.  Not professional at all.  Sometimes very rude to students should you not share the same interests.  Group work is too much.  There isn't much of a lecture/she just reads from slide shows.  Only positive about her is she calls you when she cancels class.  Expects a lot of work to be done (this is college, not high school).",0
"Really great technically, not so good conceptually.  Wonderful person and really cares about the students/department.  She also has a lot of connections to the outside printmaking world.",1
"I normally wait until the end of the semester to write these but I just cant wait: this lady is way too picky. Ive gotten into it with her a few times bc of her unfair grading. She overcomplicates everything. Claims to not have gotten my emails, has yet to fix my attendance when I was in the hospital. She does too much. Condescending & boring.",0
This professor is challenging and most times confusing.  Most of the semester I spent teaching myself because she did not give good lectures.  She is confusing and unorganized.  She sometimes seems aloof and doesn't know how to answer questions. She is tough; nice person- but not a good teacher at all.,0
"Not very helpful when taking his online class- he only answers some questions that are asked, and even then he is kind of rude about it!",0
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Makes class fun, grades fairly, knows his stuff, gets the class involved, tells good stories, funny, etc.",1
"Good guy. Very helpful. Moved a bit slow, but made sure everyone understood everything about the material. This class is not as scary as everyone thinks.",1
Worst experience in NJIT! Avoiidddddddddd! A lot to read! Boring lectures! Do not take her at all!,0
"Homeworks is optional, but do it! Trust me! I didnt do my homework the first half of the semester and only passed this class by the Grace of God! VERY test heavy. Does not give extra credit. Usually only explains things one way even if you ask because you do not understand. She tries hard to be helpful and great; but in my opinion, she isnt.",0
"Dr. Meche is a great professor. All you have to do is show up to class, and youll pass. A day before essay due dates, hell ask everyone to show up to class, and let him read your essays. Hell tell you your mistakes, and correct them for you. Show up to his office hours, and hell answer any questions you have. I would recommend taking him.",1
"If you know statistics and can skip class till the tests your fine. Otherwise she will make you want to fall asleep. Most boring class ever. She gives weekly tests that she says is not for credit but shes a lie. She wants students to fail. She says one thing and then does other things. You can do better than this class, or teacher.",0
He is almost impossible to reach via email which is annoying considering the class is online. He will respond to one email which may take a few days to get a response. His class was so easy one homework a week and 3 tests for the entire semester. His only tests are easy and so is the homework. I recommend taking because of how simple the class was.,0
I'm currently talking his 100 level class and it is a wast of my money and effort. He give no slack and I'm trying my very hardest. They way he gives his test makes it very hard to pass. He teaches as if it is a 300 level class. I don't recommend him unless you are really into geology.,0
Michael is a great choice if you're looking to go into animation. He will give you honest feedback and an honest grade of your work; which may seem rough but it help will your improve your drawings/animations for your portfolio. Although his class is a lot of work it's all to prepare you for the work ethic of the program and the field.,1
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. She grades horribly and failed me on a paper because I chose a prompt that other students chose. She teaches the exact same things over and over but will count you off on papers and discussions if you bring them up in your own work. I do not recommend her at all. Yes, she's sweet, but she's a horrible professor.",0
very tough grader. She knows the material but doesn't know how to teach it to the students at all. Not very helpful when it comes to exams. Her exams are impossible to pass with a a decent grade.,0
"Professor Guetter understands in his Fundamental Concepts class that no one is there for a math major. The final was optional and he gave us two class periods to finish our very small homework assignments. He made mathematics interesting for once. Sometimes I wished I was getting more for my money, but I got the credit without hassle, so.",1
"One of the best professors I've ever had here, his class is easy, but you still learn allot. He focuses on educating, not testing, wish more teachers were like that here. He doesn't have any probs with late assignments either, within reason. Not bad looking for his age!",1
He's new at teaching and is still learning which means he's awful at the moment. His study guides have typos and his answers aren't even right. He takes away points if you want to check your online connect homework to see if its correct. His classes are slow and he often goes on tangents about Greek philosophy.,0
"She is a bad teacher, she wants everything with her words and fail Hispanic students, so in that way she can say that her class is hard",0
"Her tests are a little hard, but she does give a review before every test. She's hilarious and reminds me of my mawmaw. Great teacher for my first semester at McNeese.",1
"Very rude sense of humor, if you're sensitive don't take him. Not straight forward at all, assignments, if any that are given are confusing. Attend class or you will be completely lost! Tests are super hard but if you study and put your mind to it you will do well on them, its all memorizing. Must get the textbook, all reading and hw is from it!",0
"Interesting topics, awesome professor. Draper is definitely among the best of the sociology department faculty. Consistently fair grading and clear guidelines made this course one of my favorites. Exactly what a great college class should be.",1
You do not have to show up at all and you can still get an A. Do the online assignments (which he grades easily) and use his study guide for the midterm and final and you will be fine.,1
"Dr. Clementz is clearly very passionate about neuroscience, but because of that he spent a LOT of time going into excruciating detail on minor topics. He also went way over 50 minutes every single class. Never responded to emails either. If you thoroughly read the textbook it isn't very hard to do well, but these things were pretty annoying.",0
"He is very passionate about SOC, very lenient, and very caring. Strongly recommend. The midterm and final are online.",1
"Best prof I've ever had. He is amazing. So smart and funny. He's not really tough on attendence but there is a quiz almost everyday over the reading. Not hard if you read the bible. I've learned so much about the New Testiment because he knows so much. Great man of God, I wish I could a class with him every semester",1
made me feel stupid.. should be at a higher level and not community college,0
"Charmaine has gotten much better! I actually gave her a review here last time, but I had another lab section with her which was great. She explains the material really well, better than the other instructors. Although she still is a very tough marker. Nice lady!",1
Prof. Kopp really helps you come out of your shell. Public speaking can be difficult for some and Kopp made it a welcoming and less intimidating environment. Speeches are graded fairly easy as long as you're prepared and follow the criteria sheets. Quizzes every Sunday based off the online textbook chapters & are also super easy.,1
"Great professor. Speaks clearly, gives lots of examples, and relates almost all material to real life application. Be ready to take notes, lots and lots of notes. Quiz's at the end of every chapter and the final is cumulative. Never opened the book once.",1
"I had him for a visual concepts course and I swear that was a trial. He was so particular when grading but explained nothing when giving the assignment. It was so annoying. I almost wanted to quit the art program. I mean, I got a B. But no matter how much I pestered him I could never get a clear answer on how to get an A.",0
"Dr. Hale is a great professor! Very helpful especially if you take the time to go to office hours. Truly interested in getting to know his students and helping them succeed. Not an easy A, but will definitely take another class of his.",1
"Ana is such a great teacher. If you have taken Spanish in high school, this class will be a breeze. Not only is there rarely homework, the tests are so easy, some of it even comes straight from the book. She really cares about her students and gives great feedback when needed. I am definitely planning on taking her again for SPAN 102!",1
She was my middle school teacher and was great having again :) weird i got remember by Ms. Stewart lol Yeah suggestions just pay attention and you will pass her class !,1
"He makes you read novels that have nothing to do with sociology. Class was basically created so he could tell you about his life. Hated every minute of this class. I could write an bio about this man and probably get 99% of it right. Avoid taking Maril if you can. If can't avoid, expect a B or lower. He thinks an A+ or A is perfect so wont give out",0
"She is an amazing teacher that cares about her students. As long as you do the work, you will get a passing grade.",1
Just not good take somebody else lame boring. Thompson does a terrible job as a professor he just stands back and does nothing most of the time.,0
"She's a wonderful person. I actually picked her to be my academic advisor, so I work pretty closely with her, she's really helped me figure out my future. Class wise, the other reviews are accurate. You do have to read your text book beforehand. There are weekly quizzes. She does grade hard. There is no makeup work. Do NOT let this scare you away!",1
"avoid her if possible. she seems cool at first but as the semester drags on you'll regret taking her class. her lectures are very unorganized as she goes back and forth through time periods you lose track of which your supposed to be learning and what is just ""setting the scene"".",0
He is a good prof He double checks each point just to make sure everyone gets it,1
"Try to avoid him but, Dr No is inevitable.",0
The Best. Period. He makes a subject that to most people would be dreadful very fun! He lightens up the mood with jokes and goes over exactly what will be on the test. He provides study materials and hints. I definitely recommend Baumgartner. He will keep you interested throughout the entire 2 hours.,1
No Comments,1
"I have had Francis for three courses in my program of study, and I found him very knowledgeable and fair when it came to his teaching and marking. Everything we were tested on was well presented in class, and he doesn't surprise you on tests with questions he has not discussed.",1
"Best Prof, I feel the students that complaining that he is bad are the ones that think they can do what they want in class. The prof. do not allow disruptive behavior in his class and some people dont like that. I like that the prof follow the rules and try to show us how to be prepared for work",1
Very difficult. you will pass if you memorize the book. Quizes are online and can be taken open book. She talks very fast but if you record her lectures and listen to them it will help a lot. I got a B in her class because of my recordings and trying to memorize the book. her assignments are super duper easy except the research paper. Hard Course.,0
"I took this class online, and it is a big unorganized, the class schedule was out of whack. As I was preparing for a particular chapter the class schedule stated would be that week, it ended up being a completely different chapter. He took almost 2 weeks to grade discussion boards. And your grades are based on the test and the DB postings.",0
"This Professor is HORRIBLE! Please I am being honest, do not take her class. She talks and talks and talks about nothing. Gives a lot of pop quizzes on readings that are way too long, and is a harsh grader! She will never give you the benefit of the doubt. Save yourself and DO NOT TAKE HER!",0
"Mckean is a good teacher, he does try to help his students out. hes pretty crtical on assignments but he wants his students to succeed.",1
"By far, she is the most warm and welcoming professor I've had in college. She provides great feedback and excellent story telling when it comes to lectures. I couldn't imagine taking psychology classes with anyone else.",1
"Attendance is mandatory, don't skip, they'll take off grade points.  The projects are really time consuming, make sure you get them done on time. Otherwise the class was really helpful, if you like filmmaking, you'll learn a lot.",1
Please skip this class if possible. There is absolutely no communication or organization throughout the quarter. The poor TAs were always struggling to catch up with the professor and I never knew what was going on. The lectures and exams are extremely intense. He's very passionate but not the best professor for an intro class.,0
"Excellent, take prof serafy. Bio was fun.",1
"Sammons knows a lot about San Francisco. Crazy to see how much of his lectures are given on the spot, mainly ad-libbed, in monotone. No power-points or anything to go off of which makes it difficult to differentiate between what needs to be known for tests and what are just ""fun facts"". Pretty chill class overall but the tests take you by surprise.",1
Dr. Pringle taught the second semester of this course and she is a fantastic person and her lectures were well organized but her tests were absolutely ridiculous. She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,0
"We did easy science labs in this class. Now I know some simple experiments to do with my 3rd graders. This class is not that hard, you just have to keep on top of the material.",1
"Dr. Tim Cook is by far the best teacher. He makes a hard lesson to be something fun to learn for students. I could not thank him enough. If you have a chance to enroll in his class, you are going to have a great time learning Japanese!",1
"Just because her name rhymes with hell doesn't mean that her lab is. Far from it in fact. She will respond surprisingly fast to e-mails (worryingly even, I mean come on, play hard to get at least a bit), explain the information clearly, and is very knowledgeable. Go with Rishel, and it'll all be swell.",1
"Unfortunately, not a good teacher. I did not learn anything from him.",0
"Nice woman, but somewhat disorganized and never returns graded work. I still have no idea what grade I got on 2 of the 5 papers I submitted during the course. We didn't get our first assignment returned until 10 weeks into a 16 week course. Isn't an overly strict grader, however entire grade is based on papers, with no tests or quizzes.",0
He have the answer of every question,1
"Dr. Labelle is a good teacher, very kind, involved with the class and gives good feedback. This class, however, is challenging. The class is all about running the Rethink Campaign; that's all that you'll be doing. So the entire class is like one big group project all semester long. But, Dr. LaBelle was very helpful and responsive throughout.",1
easy a,1
Said she would correct the team project before the exam but didn't. We therefore had no clue how to write the solutions adequatly in the exam.,0
I agree with the few previous responses. There is absolutely no learning of Nutrition in this class. It's actually Advanced Biochemistry. A is possible with memorization word for word of his little book.,0
"I love Professor Carson so much. I took him for ENGL 1101 and 1102 because he is so sweet and cares so much about your success. Lots of reading and quizzes on what you read but he always goes over EXACTLY what is on the quiz. His classes are small so he will know YOU, do not skip class. His humor is underappreciated. Easy in-class essays! TAKE HIM!",1
Professor Chistensen is the best English Professor at Florida Memorial University. He is great. Upon leaving his class your writing skills will improve tremendously. Keeep doing what you are doing Professor Christensen,1
"Doctor Weiner is a very tough teacher to have for such a tough class. More than half of my class dropped the class before it even hit half the semester. I had a huge issue with him and that's why I dropped. He screamed at me in front of the whole class and didn't even let me explain what happened. After that, he constantly brought it up.",0
"Honestly learned absolutely nothing, and she was one of the worst teachers I've ever had. I am not very good at math, so I was hoping I could utilize her office hours, but whenever I went she would do nothing but complain about her life, and told me to ""work harder"". I would NOT recommend this class to anyone.",0
"Fun to listen to, he clearly loves what he does. Somewhat disorganized, but he doesn't mind being reminded of things he planned to do.",1
"knows her content but is not good at making sure students do. Prepare to teach yourself because she definitely won't be teaching you anything herself. extremely slow talker so unless you care about how words sound its hard to pay attention. In terms of content, unless you're going to be a linguist, you will never use irl",0
Professor Carter is one of the best professors at Columbia but you have to work hard.  She does not give to many quizzes . You will have to present a group case study and write a research paper. Overall she is the main reason I decided to stay at Columbia College. Great Instructor if you really care for the topics and life lessons.,1
"She's the type of professor your conservative parents warned you about. If she could hug every whale and destroy every coal mine she would. LIBERAL. Can be mean to girls. She locks the door after the start of the hour (excuse me, I'm paying to go here). She also is so far behind the times in terms of resumes and cover letters it's not even funny.",0
"I took her class because I had to, a friend warned me and I blew her off thinking she just didn't like math. I LOVE MATH, I passed 112 with a 97(for some background.) She gave us 152 problems,PLUS review to do for ONE chapter in TWO WEEKS, plus at home tests. She's cheery, but gives no guidance. I studied for a month straight, that's how i got a 78",0
"When they said the best, i almost laughed. She was, at first, the nicest person ever. I started off stong, and she made me believed that i was doing excellent even at the end. Then when i received a NP i was shocked nun the least. The books were interesting and easy to follow. As a person, she is awesome... as a teacher,Never Again!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Stay away if you want to pass,0
"Palmer was somewhat approachable after class, but was completely disorganized with unstructured format of his notes, tests, and his class as a whole left me appalled. I learned little from his class and would warn students to not take him if they have the option",0
Ana is great. She can be a little all over the place but her class is super easy. It's not a class where you sit down and take notes the whole time. She likes to give lots of interactive worksheets. Would reccommend if you're looking for a GPA booster.,1
"I LOVE HER! Hartman was a great prof to have. She was so understanding; clear on her expectations; gave amazing feedback; gave plenty of time for projects, and assigned fun projects. Dr. Hartman is not that challenging but she does have high expectations and expects participation. I would take her for every English/Comp class if I could. 10/10 lady",1
Worst class ever!!!,0
Shes very nice and very helpful and understanding.,1
"I really enjoyed the class I took with Professor Qualls. While I learned a lot, I struggled as well. He gives good feed back on papers, but it's not always clear and is mostly negative. If you don't feel like you're a great writer, I'd be hesitant about taking on of his classes. However, he's a great prof who you'll learn a lot from.",0
The most boring class and very essay filled. She goes essay crazy. And too much reading,0
"I took his PSY101 class online and it was it very frustrating. He was very unorganized and for it being an online class, it was pertinent to be well organized. He was consistently late getting his recorded lectures out to us and had to keep pushing back due dates that all piled up at the end of the quarter by his doing, not mine.",0
She is too strict.,0
"If your were good at calc 1,2 then you should be good for his calc 3 class. I barely even tried and i got a B. His lectures were boring and his exams were long. Webassign will teach you more than him.",1
He is an awesome professor that cares for his students. Homework is not mandatory but do it and it will help you pass the tests. Also do the extra practice he have online that will help alot.  If you pass his final you pass the class even if you did horribly on the other tests. If pass all his other test and fail the final he will average final ,1
"Professor Lorentz was so great. He made it clear how to pass and was willing to help in anyway possible. He responded to emails so fast it was insane. His knowledge on the subject made it enjoyable to attend class. The tests were right from the book and he was a fair grader. Overall, great course with a great teacher. Would take again. ",1
"Her style of teaching is kind of scattered, so she's hard to follow at times. and she's very lecture heavy. But she's very knowledgeable and very sweet and the class itself is very interesting. Make sure to read the syllabus and keep track of assignment due dates!!",0
"At first she seems like a hard teacher, but she is so knowledgeable about the topics.  I absolutely loved her class and she made me fall in love with a political science major! I definitely recommend her if you are willing to work and go to class.  her class is totally manageable and she really pushes you to your fullest potential!",1
Absolutely awesome professor. Very helpfull and has a very creative teaching style.,1
"Your average try-hard adjunct professor at first..  Teaches off of ppt's  and justifies it with essay test questions. But he is very spiteful. I received A's and B's throughout the whole semester, but when I had to make up ONE test for a family trip, he made sure that I received an 89.4 for the course despite my effort. Pass on this bitter old man.",0
A solid option for Bio lab. Explains everything clearly before starting lab and will guide you if you need help,1
"Mark Berkson is the best professor I have ever had. He is incredibly engaging, and funny. He has been very understanding with everything going on in my personal life and with the pandemic. He is not a very harsh grader, but there are not many assignments to grade, so just make sure you are on top of everything.",1
"This professor likes to show off how much she knows about everything. Be prepared to hear a lot of stories about herself. Be prepared to teach yourself, this woman is a joke.",0
Sanda has been one of my least favorite professors in the VCD program. Her talk on the first day of classes dismisses any chance of thinking you can get a good grade with her. Her critiques are demotivating and not very helpful. Her project guidelines are vague and usually she is displeased with what students bring in. Poor communicator.,0
"Overall she a good teacher, but she typical college professor. very boring and dull. she very nice, but the way she teach is confusing.",0
"Takes into consideration adversities students endure (i.e. stress, anxiety). She does not tolerate stupidity - check your emails, don't pretend you know what you're doing and come to her later in the semester about to fall apart. Utilize your resources (i.e. writing center & tutor).",1
Very uninspired. Reads straight from his handwritten notes. Seems like he is just going through the motions. Unfortunately many students have to take at least one of his classes. Gives pop-quizzes? Seriously are we in grade school?,0
"Singleminded, not helpful, poor presentation, has huge favorites/dislikes",0
"He is not the worst or best. You will have to work for you grade and spend hours on math homework so be prepared. There will be days you will multiple assignments due and some days you will have 0. Get in the mindset to put in the work and you will pass. Will it be an A or B? Most likely not, but you will pass if you do the work.",0
He is a great teacher and class was always fun. I was in his developmental psych class for the first time he taught it and yes he is Hot!,1
I had this prof for A&P and she is so great!  She will do whatever she can to go the extra mile to help you.  She really knows the material and lectures very clearly.  She is tough but is a wonderful professor!,1
Doing the homework is a must.,1
"Good professor, professional",1
"If you are looking to get out of your comfort zone and work for your grades, take her class. She sets high standards for her students and will call names out if nobody is participating. Follow her guidelines I would suggest going above and beyond to meet with her. She is never on time with anything, but her classes are genuinely interesting.",0
Worst professor I've ever had. Had him for Pentateuch and gospels in the same semester. His opinion is always right and if you disagree he will laugh at you. His assignments are ridiculous and he doesn't explain them. I am an A student and I got C's in both classes. He assigns a ridiculous amount of work and acts like his classes are the only ones,0
"Just posting so you all are warned. Take another prof. Dr. Wigginton is super judgmental and rude especially if you ask questions or dont understand her examples. She cancelled class 6 times all last minute, twice before the midterm, and expected us to teach ourselves based on the textbook only. No study guide and doesnt follow the syllabus.",0
I do not know where to began because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps and can't teach.,0
Great Professor. Wants students to learn and does not care too much about grades. Very interesting and Practical way of teaching. Open book exam. Fair grader. ,1
"Federal govt Pros: Free txbook, hw& exams (2attempts each) are easy, found on quizlet. Cons: Not enough time given on quizzes & exams even if u use quizlet, hw takes hours to complete. 4 writing assignments 500 word each, & graded harshly Going to class is pretty useless, login in daily. No extra cred or makeups. 3 pts from a B. Avoid her class.",0
"So Ibrahim is a great guy, but I will warn you of two things: First is there is a LOT of reading. If you're a history major, you are already used to this, if not, just be ready. Second, because the subjects are so passionate, sometimes students get into arguments and he just sits back and waits instead of managing the sides like he should.",1
Dr. O shared many real-word examples on the discussion board to make the class lively. Great feedback and will ask for a resubmission if you miss many of the CT assignments. She is a great professor and I will take her again if she teaches more classes at CSU-Global.,1
"Took his online class, a lot of work get ready to work and be committed to this class. A lot of reading, discussions and quizzes. He is a tough grader and I highly recommend you do not take him. The online class was very heavy and sometimes mis leading.",0
Save yourself time and money. Do not take Gerschick. Hes the worst professor ever. You will not pass this class. He will comment on your papers saying he believes in you then turn around and fail you. Take some advice dont do it. He is the devil. Beware. He loves to fail students.,0
He was good at the beginning. Then began losing control and getting mad whenever you asked questions.,0
"Fred Shira is a great guy and repeatedly encourages his students, however the class is far too easy for a college level class. All we do is write papers and more than half of them aren't graded. He is a very interesting guy and fun to talk to. He has a lot of stories to share with his classes from his life and he is happy to share his experiences.",1
"First of all, takes 2 months to put in grades. Second, does not highlight what he is grading on and makes you down 10-20 points. Third, if you disagree with his opinion you are marked down. Forth, final grades are currently due in less than 10 hours and I still have several blanks in grade book. He does not answer emails. AWFUL CLASS.",0
"Attendance is not mandatory, but he will use the fact that you are not in class against you. Along with this, he gives quizzes every week. He does not actually teach you how to do problems, just throws a bunch of equations at you and expects you to know how to use them to solve a problem when he has not shown you.",0
Very Hard to Understand. Had to teach myself everything. Tests weren't like the problems we learned to do. Do not take!,0
Amazing professor. Funny. Very useful if you pay attention,1
Great teacher. Wants the students to succeed. Like any class you have to put in the work to do well. I recommend this class and teacher,1
Hoffman is really hard for biochem. I know students here are saying good things about him which I agree with. He's not a bad guy just rushes through lecture and his exams are only thing that your grade will be based on. Whole class wants extra credit but Hoffman don't care.,0
"Hard lab professor. Tests are hard, material is not covered in class with much help. Couldn't continue because my lab grade was too low with little help from Prof. Stevenson.",0
I don't get it this teacher is a master at making people think she's something she's not.  What she has been is incredibly rude and just spiteful to me.  Doesn't anyone else see what's really going on?  Shes the reason my husband dropped out.,0
Strongly Recommend.. Awsome professor that teaches you alot.. class is enjoyable and easy to succeed in.. Great Person with positive energy!,1
"She grades more on English than the content of the class. You write a paper including all of the information needed but she doesn't like your delivery you get a D automatically. She doesn't care if you have other classes, she gave 2 papers in a week, one over a move the other over a book. Her discussion board posts requirements are also ridiculous.",0
"She is very hard to understand. She uses powerpoint, but I think she just photocopies the pages out of the book because it is exactly the same. She doesn't explain anything and acts like she doesn't understand what you are trying to ask if you have a question. Most of the people in my class were completely lost the entire semester.",0
Mrs. Martin is a very good english teacher. I like the fact she records her teachings and you can listen to them online. She is very impatient about cell phones ringing and is strict on absents. But if you communicate with her she is much nicer! :),1
"Terrible Teacher, doesn't teach, has trouble staying on track.",0
The professor is great. He is easy to understand and his explanations are easy to understand. H you don't need any textbooks because he gives a lot of handouts. Also his sylubus is super easy to understand and follow.,1
"I took him for AP I, Bio 425. He explains things clearly; knows his stuff; gives extra credit if you ask nicely. BEWARE, he doesn't like to review for tests, but again will do so if class asks. He's an acquired taste, he has no time for bs. He wants his students to do well, is available before class. I'd take him again.",1
"during my course the professor required quizzes on a weekly basis which is an accelerated rythm, it prevented me from fully assimilating the chapters and since i had classes twice a week, I couldn't accumulate good grade due to almost 8 quizzes one midterm and one exam . we all know the law of large numbers however we don't need extra pressure.",0
"Fantastic teacher.  Very supportive, very easy to understand, gives a lot of really good examples.  The only thing I didn't like was that I wished the class was more challenging.  :)",1
Recommend if you are a graduate student. She is not approachable. Loads of reading and tests r hard.,1
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0

"This class is not easy, but I learned a lot. You have to read the chapters and understand concepts to be able to do test 2 with 35 questions. I took the 8-week class HRPO2303. I found the book for free online after buying and make sure you convert the book to Adobe Acrobat to find the answers for the test quickly because there is a 2 hours limit.",1
Awful! If youre a visual learner this class will be extremely difficult. She uses launchpad & reef & theyre extremely expensive. If you dont buy them youll obviously wont pass! Her study guides are useless & she had no set office hours & its very hard to reach her. Do yourself a favor & dont take her,0
Dr. Vohs was an amazing professor who was always willing help students. He even gave out his cell phone number so that students could text him questions. Would definitely recommend.,1
"Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"One of the best, if not the best technique teacher at this school.  It's a shame he doesn't teach all of the technique classes.",1
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0

"My days are good until I walk into this class. Unnecessarily rude in emails, expects a lot out of students for it being a 101 class. Readings every night, pop quizzes usually the next class. A bit sarcastic, which I didn't appreciate. He knows the material, lectures are decent, but if I could go back in time I would take an easier core.",1
"Possibly the worst professor ever. So unprepared. She'd come to each class, and just ramble. She showed up for two of the tests without a test. Once, she had us write the tests ourselves in groups and then she READ them back to us, and gave us about a minute to answer each question. Her excuse? She was training us to be professors. Awful!",0
"I was excited coming into this class, but quickly realized it would be one of the worst classes I've taken at MSU. I don't feel the lectures accurately represent what he tests on. He is a touch grader and wants you to extrapolate your own answers from the little info he does give. Hard to get ahold of through email. All around a bit of a let down.",0
"Dr. King is laid back and  funny, or tries to be. I enjoyed his class and found it interesting. He tries to connect with the students and knows what he is talking about. If you learn the material you'll be fine.",1
"Had Ams for Ochem 1 & 2. Ochem 1 wasn't bad but not as good as it could've been. Ochem  2 was a disaster b/c he stopped caring about the students and teaching after he received his tenure. There was not additional help outside of the lecture that left you confused and unprepared for test. If you want to get a good grade/learn ochem, don't take Ams",0
This class was definitely not what I thought it would be. Heavily reading based. If you read the articles you'll be fine and he gives you opportunities to miss some of the reaction papers he assigns. The book essay is a big part of your grade: START IT EARLY! Overall he's an okay teacher but kind of boring and the class is not based on medications.,1
Horrible.. no passion to actually teach. Seems like she likes to assert her authority or dominance onto students. Constantly makes kids feel uncomfortable in the middle of a lecture. Very unprofessional presence in the classroom. Doesnt know what partial credit means. All She is good for is putting your test threw the scantron.,0
She is kind and prays for her students every day. It would be helpful if she actually taught the material. There is a pervasive feeling of frustration in the class and she ends the discussion if there are too many questions. I have an A but feel that I may need to retake the class from someone else so I actually learn the material.,0
