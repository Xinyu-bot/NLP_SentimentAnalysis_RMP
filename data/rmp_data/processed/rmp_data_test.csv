"Really funny, I thought Id hate chemistry, but with her teaching Ive gotten a lot better",1
"I took Terri's class online. It was a challenge because I hadn't done online classes before, but she is GREAT at helping you through. She wants you to succeed! Highly recommended!",1
"Professor Peterson is a very fair, nice professor. Her assignments were graded fairly and she did not have unrealistic expectations from students. I had her for Comms-116 and the class was great. I would recommend her for any communication class you can get into.",1
"Bring caffeine to class or you'll fall asleep pretty quick.  Dr. Self is ok, he'd probably be a cool guy out of this boring class.  You might spend every class wondering what is going on but it's do-able.",0
"His class was one of the most difficult I've taken. He's pretty strict about cellphone usage and even going to the bathroom. He will literally stop class to ask you where you're going if you get up to use the restroom. I really just was not into his class, but it might be easier if you enjoy political topics or history.",1
"Kristi cares about her students, and she is very passionate about what she teaches. She keeps class interesting. She creates a very safe and comfortable environment for students that have anxiety about public speaking. Loved her so much I took another class with her.",1
The class is completely online. I liked her teaching style and simple/organized structure of the course. The quizzes are 10 question each and you get two tries. The highest grade counts. She is accessible by email or phone should you need it. She also gives good feedback and is fair with the grading. She grades with a rubric. A great experience.,1
she is ok,1
"Chemistry minors beware: this is not an easy A! Furthermore, if acid/base chemistry is your weakness do not enroll in this class! Otherwise Dean's a nice but ineffective professor. 2 exams and final are easy, hard, and comprehensive, respectively. Several group work activities make you wish he would go over problems on the overhead instead.",0
"never on time, frequently misses classes, not helpful, very angry person, at times she is irrational",0
"LOVED this class! She has a respect for students that is unsurpassed by any other prof. Expects a lot from her students. Genuinely interested in students' thoughts and opinions- gets upset if no one wants to comment. Incredibly knowledgeable, and will expose you to diverse, unusual, and interesting ideas. I wish I could take this class again!!",1
"Grades given are very confusing. Would not recommend unless taken pass-fail. Otherwise, you can attend every class and work really hard and think you will get an A and then end up with something much worse.  In terms of class material, the dance class feels more like yoga. Would recommend looking at other classes like Ballet or Jazz dance.",0
"Looking back, i feel like the material for this class was way overcomplicated by Hines' teaching. He went way too fast and messed up more times than I could count while solving problems. I highly recommend going to Johnny Prints and picking up the slides used in class. Get ready to teach yourself this whole course.",0
"I genuinely felt sorry for him. Absolutely no one pays attention to him and he basically lectured to one person the entire semester. People sign attendance then leave. However he is soooooo sweet and so understanding. The tests are online with no lockdown browser. I would definitely suggest him, also suggest being nice to him.",1
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
taking his ornithology class and it's amazing.  he is a polymath in every sense of the word; a true naturalist. got me and my little 5 yr old boy hopelessly addicted to birds and nature. the man is a treasure and his students are among the luckiest on the planet!!!,1
He is sweet,1
I took this as a Distance Education  course in the Spring semester 2015. Profssor Chidinma Udezeh was very helpful.,1
"Such a good prof!! She is so helpful and really cares about how each student is doing. She is a pretty tough grader, so definitely pay close attention and take good notes from class. She offers a lot of out of help, so take advantage of her office hours. Never be afraid to ask for the extra help, she's super nice about it!",1
"I think a lot of people can agree with me when I say that his lecture videos do not make much sense. He's smart, but he does not do a good job explaining content and trails off into irrelevant topics. I understand that he has a lot of students, but he takes long to respond, sometimes he does not even respond at all, and if he does, he's rude.",0
"She is an excellent teacher!! I haven't taken math classes in years and I came in very insecure about my math skills. She completely restored my confidence in math and about life in general. If you want a do over in math and want to really understand and enjoy the material, Professor Bronie is the professor to take! I wish I could take her again.",1
David is one of the best professors I have had at Iowa. He truly cares about teaching his students how to be successful in the business world. He doesnt succumb to the political correct safe space speech many teachers unfortunately have adopted. Great guy that knows business. Take his class but be ready to engage or you will not enjoy it.,1
"He moves through class slowly, which can be boring. However it is beneficial, you do develop a strong understanding of the material. He does not give a lot of homework nor the answers to the textbook. Therefore it can be easy to get high 70s too low 80s, but it can be difficult to achieve a higher grade.",1
"Professor Oakley is one of my favorite profs yet. Class seemed to be a friend gathering to discuss Geology. Always answered questions and was so sweet. She handed out study guides for us to fill in that were SO helpful, and was very clear on assignments! She wanted you to succeed and learn about Geology. I learned so much!!!",1
"LA does an amazing job lecturing so paying attention is no problem. If you attend class regularly there is no way you can fail. She lays all the material out in a way that is easy to follow, she is very approchable and kind. If you have the chance to take her class do it.",1
This class was easier than any class I have taken ever. Super easy credits and Caitlyn is great. The tests are legit the practice jeopardy games.,1
"I really enjoyed this class! I had never had Dr. Capper before and was not very interested in religion beforehand, but he changed that! His tests are not hard, just study the material and read the textbook. He always encourages discussion and will happily answer questions. He's a great guy and a lot of fun to talk to.",1
Professor Wolf is probably one of the best professors Ive had at UC Davis. Shes very organized and the content she teaches is digestible and relevant. Very nice woman and very understanding!,1
"First time professor and extremely demanding. Mandatory activities include: learning how to play a pan flute, dancing during lecture, and having to write a 5-page ethnography paper. TAs were amazing but discussions were not helpful at all. 3 quizzes, multiple choice + essay final, doesnt post slides and no photos. Avoid as much as possible.",0
"Took it online. Was available, had everything ready on time and split it into digestible chunks. Took an online teaching course beforehand and it showed. Really tried hard to help us succeed in the pandemic. Hilarious dry humor.",1
"If you take down good notes during lectures and do his practice quizzes, midterms and finals multiple times until you understand every type of problem, there is no reason that you shouldn't get an A. No surprises on exams.",1
Do not take this class he is so hard to understand he has an accent. He is also old so he is sooooo boring I had him at 8am and I could not keep my eyes open.  He also does not teach so well . Many test,0
"Dr. Maher's exams are harder than I would have liked, but his quizzes help with grades, and give you a good idea about what the exams look like. They typically have quite a few short answers/essays, so be prepared to know what you're talking about. Overall, he makes class interesting with the studies he includes, along with cute videos.",1
"Wilson is a very sweet professor. She's very confusing explaining projects and assignments, but the cool thing is that she lets you do resubmissions after she grades everything. I didn't learn a lot (which is unfortunate) but at the same time I don't feel like it was a wasted class and I got an A. Just be wary of who you pick for your group!!!",1
"Stephanie is a terrific lady and tries her best to make lectures interactive and fun.  We had online open book/note quizzes usually every week, but they were difficult if you didn't read beforehand.  Only two tests, a midterm & final, and she gives you great study guides.  She also uses a lot of the quiz questions on the tests, which makes it nice.",1
She is a great professor! you wont have to take notes as she already made work sheets available for her students that you simply fill out. this allows you to cover more material at a time and easy to come back to. She also records her zoom meetings so you can come back and watch previous lectures. Lots of extra credit too.,1
"Great professor, he takes the time to make sure his section understands, and if you ask a question, he will come to the next class with a solid example to help you understand.",1
"Professor Trombley was an awesome teacher and very helpful if you need her assistance! She will make you work for your grade which makes perfect sense!! I would definitely suggest that whomever is reading this, you wont be sorry taking her!",1
"STUDY her ppts for exams, ex. done IN-CLASS & understand the material. Did fine w/o the book or practice problems she suggests (frm book). Exam math portion is easy if you know your stuff, but understanding the diff. kinds of tests & under what circumstance are they used is important, esp for multiple choice portion. this is a class you CANNOT BS!",1
"She is a great instructor for the course and opens the eyes of how many options are available in the Sport Management field. She has a lot of connections that she has speak to the class (which was awesome) and has a lot of knowledge is various areas. One paper, a midterm & exam and other smaller assignments that are easy enough. Good person to know",1
"Lectures are 3 hours long, yes he is a bit boring and some topics are hard to sit through depending on your interest but it is very easy to do well in his course. He provides study guides that are 6-9 pages but if you go over it the exam will be easy since he pulls questions from the study guide. He also gives xtra credit 6% added to final grade.",1
"The first couple of papers he assigns are confusing. Throughout the course it gets easier. Good note taking skills are important as he explains what he expects from students. Lectures are confusing sometimes but it you take notes and ask questions it will be helpful. Very little homework is assigned, go to his office hrs. Great professor!",1
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
"Dr. Nelson was delightful. His blistering criticism was always specific and helpful, and he is one of the few Davidson profs who actually gives you useful advice for after you graduate. He has a rep for being mean, but he was always kind and truthful with me. And he remembered my name afterwards!",1
"Dr. Beck is amazing, she is always willing to help and answer questions.  She will try everything to help her students achieve.",1
Difficult to say the least. Nice guy but not clear about what he wants. Super hard for a core class. I've had A's in theology previously and it was really really hard to get a B. He's definitely not easy and has ridiculously high expectations.,0
"Ms. O'Donnell is tough and does not let anyone skate through her class. I dreaded this class and heard horror stories. But if you pay attention, apply yourself and make a concerted effort you can pass with a very good grade.",1
Professor Huerta is the best professor to take for any history course! She always responds back to emails and is always willing to meet to help with assignments. I would definitely recommend her to anyone!,1
I thought we were suppose to be refining what's in our minds and not what's in her mind. He assignments felt like she was mining her students for info that would help her next book of criticism. She gives a lot of work and very little valid feedback. I'd look for a more generous teacher whose easier on your grades.,0
"Super fun professor. He always tells a ridiculous joke at the beginning of class. I never opened my book or did the homework, but he gives take home quizzes that let you know what to expect on the tests. Made potentially confusing material very clear. Aweomse professor!",1
"Prof. Wood's nice person & knows lots about math; BUT, she expects you to know as much about math as she does. She grades EXTREMELY HEAVILY on tests & quizzes. One skipped step in factoring & your grade will suffer. She'll mark your answer wrong if you use a different method to get the same answer. Good luck on trying to pass this class :/",0
"NEVER REPLIES TO YOUR EMAILS !! Beside that though, he's a really good professors because he makes you do applications that you would implement in real life for the labs and exams.",1
"I took ENG 250 as a half semester course, so it was a lot of work in a little amount of time, but he made it easy as it was possible to be, I think. Make sure you do the assigned readings and participate.",1
"i can see how this would be a great class in person but online wasn't great. It's read from the textbook then do the quiz, no notes, no lectures, no pre-recorded lectures. not impressed by this course delivery for online because of covid.",0
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. I cannot say it enough times. This man thrives on seeing his students fail. His tests are downright impossible. He is an incredibly tough grader as well. I took the online course and he made us come in to take an exam because he thought we were all cheating. I promise even if you did cheat you'd probably still fail. AVOIDDDDDD!,0
Very Very tough if you are not an english major.  Do not take this guy lightly.  He definitely helps you write for the reader.  If writing is not your strength DO NOT take his class.  Otherwise he will improve your writing dramatically. BE ORIGINAL and interesting!,1
"Bruh, dark souls but no bonfires. Doesn't try to change the direction of the class to help the students but rather just to get on and get paid. Try to avoid at all cost.",0
"I lost all respect for him towards the end of the semester when he kept showing us pictures of the effects of war. They were tasteless and vulgar and lowered his professionalism as a teacher. Also, he made a paper due a couple days after our final which is not ethical. I spoke to other professors & they all encouraged me to talk to the dean.",0
"Don't take her awful class.  It's easy, but not worth it at all. I would explain but moderators would rather me not,just,.keep looking for another prof. Rebecca Mugford, if she's still teaching is amazing. Had a friend take her course while I took this, so much more interesting of a lecturer and can actually say learned more from her than Adelle.",0
"only have to go to class like 5 times. everything online pretty much, easy class, great lady, lots of guest speakers",1
"Espo was a great professor. He is very intimidating at first, and you will feel like dropping out in the beginning. However, the hw and tests are very concise, and if you do the work and reading the class is great. He is very engaging and I really learned a lot. He gives A LOT of extra credit.",1
Follow the syllabus and you'll get an A no tests,1
"She's very sweet.. But a horrible instruction-giver. My research partner and I felt our way around in the dark the entire semester. Attending class is mandatory, but pointless. You will learn nothing. That being said, she's a relatively easy grader. Possible to make a good grade, but I don't recommend her.",0
Does not even try even a little bit too make her class engaging. Not to mention that the lecture and textbook readings are literally word for word. Her tests were tricky and with limited time it was really easy to mess up. Felt that she didn't want to teach or want her students to do well.,0
"Awesome teacher. The class is so much fun and you can tell he loves what he's doing. He's a very talented guy also so check out his concert, take this class!",1
"Prof Merdian is not funny or caring. He screams and mocks students in front of the whole class. Some students (yes, plural) dropped his class due to the anxiety he was giving them. He surely knows his stuff, but teaching is not his forte. Very disorganized and we never used the book or lab manual. Be ready to lean a lot on your own...",0
"This teacher is really nice! you have to buy her books for 80 dollars and you get two, its totally worth it because her tests are exactly from the study guides at the end of the chapter. the only reason you cant understand her is she has a really thick greek accent. other than that really easy class and pretty interesting.",1
If you want to truly learn anything take professor Rohan! He is an amazing teacher and anyone who takes his class will see why. TAKE HIS CLASSES!,1
"Took over the summer. Did not learn anything from lecture, learned every the material on my own, but attendance was required. Spends too much time on a problem when stuck, and shows that he did not review materials before lecturing. Lab was a mess, did not explain the procedure or setup, and left us 10mins to do the lab at the end.",0
"I took him for both Higher plants and Wetlands. True, his exams are hard, but he provides you with all the information that is covered. Sometimes hes a bit spacey, but if you ask him for help he jumps at the chance to teach you more. Wonderful man and great teacher. If you are willing to work and get messy (field trips) you will like his classes.",1
"Professor Mahallati provided practical material that most students are able to use in a variety of other courses/fields. Her course outline and curriculum was clear and user friendly, and she took time to explain the concepts. Enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it.",1
Class can be boring. People don't usually listen and are doing other things. All assignments are in the syllabus. He wants you to be in class but you can miss and still do well. Tests aren't bad if you read the material beforehand. Lots of interacting with classmates. Lots of assignments but are easy. Easy A. He's a nice guy and cares.,1
"Her class is not so hard ,but she gives a lot writing assignment and the films for the class are an hour .",1
"This class was good! I enjoyed it. The professor is very nice and understanding. Make sure to attend everyday, attendance matters! She lets you use the book during exams, & assignments are a piece of cake (just make sure youre doing them how she exactly describes she wants them!)",1
"Big nerd with a big nerdy ponytail, and an awesome professor. Genuinely loves what he's teaching and it rubs off; very helpful and understanding. One of the best at GCC",1
"Easy. Slow Paced. You can show up and do nothing, Take the review sheet for test and study it, and then get A/B's on tests and coast.",1
"Arevalo is a sweet person but shes not great at teaching. She runs through the slides and crams things in at the last second. Her thick accent makes it hard to understand her too. There arent many options for bio 104 , but if you can, avoid her. You can pass this class but you WILL have to teach yourself. Tests have little to do with taught info.",0
"I took CIS 298AB ""Special Project"" from Dr. Storeslee. He was a good teacher and the class was very self-paced. He was good and staying in communication and a fair grader. I sat in on the first few minutes of one of his classes, super fair, funny an open-minded.",1
Dr. Self was a great professor and he actually made this class pretty interesting. He tests more on concepts than memorization so make sure you understand the material. Going to class and taking good notes or recording the lectures will help you succeed in this class. I think he's one of the better professors in the M&M program.,1
"NOTE: I took this class online during COVID-19. You don't need to attend the live class sessions, though you may want to skim them. I wouldn't say that she is a tough grader, but you need to fully answer every question. The textbook is straight-forward, so I skimmed it. The final was okay. I'd recommend having complete answers to the 6 outcomes.",1
"Prof. Bush definitely knows math, and if you're already good at the subject then you'll be fine. However, he doesn't provide examples in class that can help on the homework. He only uses a ton of variables - no numbers. Go to office hours if you're struggling: he's much better in 1-on-1 meetings. The hw isn't mandatory, but still do it. It helps.",1
"Costanza is a truly nice and genuine guy. We used our textbook once a week to complete a study question in class with a buddy. I took the class with a friend and shared the book. I made a B+ but only because I missed notes prior to one of the 3 tests we had. Good teacher, good guy. Reminded me of Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, in a good way!",1
"Mrs. Jackson is one of the best GCC has to offer. She is incredibly real, makes class and lecture easy to relate to life. She makes you question a lot of things and most of all CARES about all you have to say and think. She usually replies quickly through canvas and always leaves feedback. If you show effort on your assignment youll always get 100%",1
"She doesn't throughly look at your homework, just do 70% of each assignment and she will give full credit. She does teach new material before a test, which sometimes can distract you. But doing the homework and understanding it does help so much when you take her tests.  Her tests are not that hard if you pay attention.",1
Dr. Parker was really flexible this summer. He provided extensions and was always willing to help us.,1
"She is a very kind person and makes sure everyone understands was it going on in the class. There is a decent amount of work, but it is by no means difficult. The exams are easy and she gives extra credit.",1
Very excellent teacher. Always friendly and very helpful.,1
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
Absolutely inspiration. Made me love philosophy. He's very engaging in class and in office hours.,1
"There are no tests or quizzes throughout the semester. The only exam was the final, and the final was only 4 essay questions; which was annoying. Burke was a little unclear when it came to his expectations for the class. There are a few debates but they weren't horrible. If I had to take this class again, I would choose Burke's class.",1
Everyone on here is saying she's hard and her exams are difficult but they weren't even difficult UNLESS you study. You have to memorize word for word and to read ahead before the lectures. People who don't do this will get a B+ or something and will complain. She's pretty helpful as she replies quickly to emails and gives reviews :-),1
Professor Nuneville is clearly educated when in comes to the criminal justice field. Her class consists of textbook info followed by memorable personal stories. She is overall an incredible professor and has even helped me in some of my other courses! 10/10 would take any more of the courses she teaches.,1
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
"Three papers, but he is unhelpful when you ask for advice. He will grade lower on papers written on subjects he doesn't like, so write about the assigned books if you want to get an A. He is unclear with his instructions and he mumbles a lot during class. His lectures are irrelevant and unhelpful in class. Hard class/grader, not recommended.",0
1 Job search assignment easy and a job search presentation. 3 Test and the 4th one is the final . attendance is for extra credit. course evaluation is for extra credit. He also gives us a question sometimes and we would get extra credit. easy class as long as you take clear notes. everything he discusses in his lectures is important to get an A.,1
"I had her in JAP 101-103 and LSFY 203 as well. She is possibly one of the easiest teachers I've ever had in college. She's extremely understanding when you turn your homework in late, and her classes are always fun! Last year was her 1st LSFY class and she's never taught something like it before, so She did an excellent job for her 1st time.",1
"One of the best classes I've taken at UMD so far. Professor Nusraty knows a lot about Afghanistan and is great about answering any questions you have. Plus, he brings in multiple experts in the field of diplomacy, which is super cool. Not too much work, more focused on understanding of the issues. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",1
She is actually really good when it comes to teaching the class because she did live in spain (and always talks about it) but she is always there to help you if you don't understand. She does go over everything on test and there is a self test in the textbook. She can be unclear sometimes I will admit but it is a very easy class. I recommend her.,1
Very chill teacher a lot of work once a week but its really not that difficult i took him twice because its a very chill class,1
"Terrifying and bizarre experience. ""Accidentally"" marked my answers wrong throughout the semester and then continuously denied it, repeatedly pretending like they had no idea what I was talking about. One of my exam grades went from a B to an A because of these erroneous deductions. Very, very scary.",0
"Honestly, if you procastinate I recommend you not take this class because he is a tough grader! He doesn't care for excuses he will give you the grade he thinks you deserve. If you show up everyday, pay attention, and take very good notes then you'll most likely pass but very few people pass",0
"Professor Esposito is PHENOMENAL!!! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and I adore his ""pathos"" during lectures. Everyone who gave him a low rating probably didn't put in the effort to do well in the class. He is the best and I would take him again 100 times if I could. Loved this class!",1
"He would rather insult your writing than offer constructive criticism, which takes all the joy right out of creative writing. He forces you to write inside the box unlike better writing classes. His syllabus is hypocritical.",0
She lectures off of notes everyday and they are so boring.  She is willing to help outside of class but it is so hard to learn during.  Take another biblit prof.  ,0
"This is by far my favorite professor, one of the hardest classes I have ever taken (due to the material) but she was extremely helpful, and she made physics fun. As long as you complete the work, pay attention, and don't miss any classes you will definitely pass!",1
"Prof. Collins is awesome. Very smart, very caring, very intentional.",1
"He seems to be a good guy and he is passionate about the topic but he jumps around so much in lectures and gets so off-topic that it's basically impossible to take good notes. His tests are really hard and encompass things he didn't really go over in class, so you have to read the textbook.",0
"billy's a necessary evil because he's the only organic chem prof, he's an idiot, you can find his companion notes for the textbook online and he just reads them word for word, you'd be better off just reading the book and only showing u for tests, if you remember anything about gen chem 1, you're smarter than he is",0
"Professor Guttmann is very knowledgeable, he will ask you to understand and explain all the materials to him. The lecture is amazing, you will learn a lot. Take him! The exam is a little bit hard and homework will ask you to write a lot (discussion board), but if you write more than he expects, you will get extra credit (will boost from B to A-).",1
"Doable amount of homework assigned everybody class, collected 1x a week. Some of the questions are hard and werent covered in class but the test reflects the easier part of hw. 2 tests and 1 final. Dont skip class and dont zone out or youll be left behind. Doesnt use canvas/moodle so youll only know your grade after. He does go over tests",1
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
"Absolute gem of a professor, an old master of the natural world. Take one of his courses (Higher Plants, Lower Plants, or Ornithology) and you'll walk out feeling like you know everything on the subject. Field trips to all sorts of great places. Just MAKE SURE to study the practice questions and DO NOT walk in late.",1
"The most understanding teacher at PSC. Although, there was no lectures for this class, he would help in anyway he could. I would recommend him to anyone.",1
"She teaches and keeps you busy all semester long. If you like to write and enjoy doing it, take her.",1
"She's young, but she's great. Awesome non ppt lectures. I was fortunate to have her for my class. Our average was very low (I don't know why), but I'm pretty sure it was my cohort's fault. She was always there for us and offered PLENTY of extra credit for us to earn.   If you are in trouble, GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. She'll help you succeed.",1
Professor Huerta is one of the nicest most caring professors that I have ever had. She is really passionate about what she teaches and really understand that being a student is hard. Sometimes her lectures can be a little slow but other than the class is pretty easy as long as you actually follow along.,1
I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in linguistics. There are no slides and lecture can be repetitive and dull. Attend class because your best bet is to repeat Sam verbatim on exams or you will probably be marked off.,0
"Professor Wood is an amazing lecturer, she works with, even if you are a dummy, she pushes you,",1
Lectures are pointless but you have to go because of pop quizzes. If you arent already experienced with computers or programming prepare to teach yourself. The class itself isnt that difficult but he assumes you have prior knowledge. Very bad lectures.,0
"She can be a difficult grader but overall, this class was pretty easy to pass and still learn a lot. There is a lot of weekly work even though it is an online class so get ready to read and write a LOT more than you do in other classes. You also have to do a research paper which is more like a short 4 page informal paper than anything else.",1
"Great professor! Especially for all the non-science majors like myself, class was really enjoyable although online course. I loved that professor provided feedback to every single assignment. Her grading criteria is pretty straight forward. I dont think there's any reason anyone wouldnt pass this class",1
"You are graded with 25% online homework (difficult) , 10% written homework, 40% midterms (only 2 midterms, each having 2-3 qestions, hardest versions of problems), and 25% the final exam (difficult). The class average at the end of the semester is failing however he is scaling so the class MEDIAN is a B- but a class average should not be failing!",0
"I took Professor Wade for Summer 2019 Fundamentals of Networking and it was a great and easy online class. The structure was laid out perfectly and there was opportunity for extra credit. The book didn't help much with Subnetting in my opinion, some things I am more of a visual learner, but other than that great class and easy to follow! Thanks!!",1
Jeri is an extremely fair grader and you dont need to be an artist in order to pass her class. She understands that everyone has different skill levels and as long as you try your hardest she will give you an A. Shes also extremely organized and accessible outside of class!,1
Horrible professor. Dont take him. Very disrespectful and rude to students for no reason. Grades too hard and assigns difficult work.,0
Most classes were a lecture presentation format. Weekly quizzes and discussions plus 3 out of class experiences were required. She is pretty flexible if you ask about deadlines and we played jeopardy a few times.,1
"SHE WAS great, the class was kind of hard but she really  helps you.",1
"Very to the point with his lectures. Class didn't make sense until right before the first midterm. After that, tests were exactly what he said they'd be on, which was also very similar to the hw/quizes.",1
"He's a funny guy and I don't have anything against him as a person, but as a professor he leaves something to be desired. He can and will ramble the whole class, and he's a very confusing grader; he rarely gives a reason for the grades he gives and although attendance is mandatory, he picks and chooses what days he actually takes it. He's just eh.",0
"Brian is a really great teacher.  He makes the projects interesting and relevant.  You can tell he really wants us to do well, and he has really interesting hair!!",1
he was a great teacher. film and short fiction is a really great class and he really loves what he's doing. he's very passionate about it and will def be up to helping you when you need it. and he lets you hand in your 1pg paper late which is nice :-) i would def recommend him!!! take his class!!!!,1
"Mrs. Elfring is an absolute Gem of a professor, who makes the subject fun and worth putting the time and effort into. Right from the start she created a comfortable work environment and this is actually one of the few classes I've been in where everyone talks and communicates with one another. Easily the best and or funnest class I've taken at ECC.",1
Li Liu is homework heavy and her class is incredibly boring. It does feel like a chore and attendance is mandatory for a good participation grade in the class. 10/10 would not recommend this class.,0
"Took his 8 week class last semester. Seems like a lot of work in the beginning but as assignments get completed class gets easy. There are 2 quizzes per chapter plus a ""think piece"". 2 analysis papers are required but he explains to us how to do it and helps out! Checks in every mid week to make sure the class is on board! Great teacher !",1
Sweetest prof. ever! Cares so much about her students. Take her if you can... she's the best.,1
Mr D is the best! lectures a lot but you dont even need to take notes because he goes over every question to the test a few days prior. homework is jusy busy work and he grades really fairly. get ready for a 10 page paper! you get to pick your topic so choose wisely. He is a lot of fun and i will be taking 2 more classes of his in the spring,1
"She's very helpful and caring but at the same time will go off tangent and spend a lot on proofs. Gives out a ton of homework that will take up a lot time. As with any class, if you put in the dedication and effort you will pass. There will be quizzes every week.",1
"Professor Israel did great at teaching online. Make sure you watch all of the lectures and take lots of notes on them. Homework is KEY in doing well in this class. If you try on the homework, you will get a good grade easily. First midterm was easy, and the second midterm/final was fine. Ask questions during/after lecture if you are confused.",1
"Took online sociology marriage and families. Avoid this professor for online classes, his syllabus is in broken English, he is not responsive to messages, and he does not have anywhere regarding the assignments throughout the semester, just sends weekly messages of what is due. Maybe a good professor in person, but awwful for online material.",0
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"I had Professor Bushey for CHEM131 and he was fine, however having him for 132 was hell. He is not good at explaining material, and often moves wayyy too fast. He got some of his own answers wrong and made the learning catalytics very stressful and due at the very beginning of class, but would get you the code minutes before. Not taking him again.",0
The man is out there!!! He is great and funny. In several ofmy classes with him we watched the Sopranos!! He is brilliant but out there.,1
"In short - extremely easy class, do the online homework, go to lecture, and do the EASY extra credit he gives you and you should have no problem getting an A.  Love this Professor and would definitely recommend!!",1
get ready to read a whole book but it is not too hard. easy essay grader always got B's on my papers. gives good feedback when you have a question. he is super chill. he likes when people participate in groups and when people talk in class.  i would def take his class again,1
"Lectures are a little boring, but the professor's a nice, understanding, guy. He knows his stuff and the class isn't that bad as long as he isn't teaching the course with Polentz-Bernard. If she's in the class too, get ready for a lot of work and crappy grades. She will suck the fun out of any course he teaches.",1
"Excellent Professor! He's incredibly laid back and down-to-earth with his students and never fails to make us laugh. We discuss compelling issues and debates in class which are always current and interesting. Class is probably one of the easiest English classes ever, I got an A on every essay I've written! Highly recommend him!",1
"I took Professor Richmond's class during COVID. Throughout the entire semester, she was very understanding and supportive to all of her students. Grades consisted of 3 exams and 1 paper, but they weren't very hard. Most of the answers can be found on her powerpoints and lectures.",1
"Took Prof. Osoba two semesters back-to-back and not only did he remember past students, but he would also genuinely take the time to ask how you've been, what you've been up to, and will reference past class information. He's quite old-fashioned and is a very paper and pencil type of guy, but he's a fair grader, and the syllabus is easy to follow.",1
Take this class to get credit for a plan letter knowing we signed up for a introduction class. Then he says if you have a brain youll get b or better and talks politics half the time. He grades and talks to us like this is a class in my major and I will be taking religion for the next 3 years. Hes got to understand were taking it for a letter.,0
Very cool professor- very liberal. Knows a LOT about the subject matter. Studies affirmative action. He just needs to speak louder in class- he has a lullaby type voice. But he is good. You will learn a lot in any of his classes. Definitely recommend him. Brings other perspectives into the class and holds time for valuable discussion.,1
This was his first semester teaching stats. Professor Maher is really knowledgeable about statistics and how to use R software. His tests are very inconsistent and is inconsistent with grading curves. He does not post his lecture slides on blackboard and he goes through the slides very fast. Great beard.,1
Class is interesting for the subject. Wolverton makes it very clear what is expected of the students therefore it is easy to succeed if material is studied. Doesn't handle questions in class very well but this is expected of a 50 min lecture of which she uses every min. I recommend this course to any one who is interested or for GE purposes.,1
"Best prof I've had so far at IU. She's really passionate and brings that to her teaching, but can be rude at times. You spend most of the classes watching special features and I found that a lot of fun. The hardest part is the final project. Do not procrastinate on that. I was up until 6 in the morning working on it.",1
"Be aware this professor does not appreciate student opinions. If you are not a mind reader, she will completely shut down your comments. This class is not hard but her condescending attitude makes students apprehensive to participate in class discussion. She did not give us a chance to evaluate her, but instead insisted we do it on her time.",1
This man is amazing makes you feel comfortable since day one ! If you ever have a question he will provide his phone number for you to contact him or his email. He makes history look fun as well ! Wish more teachers can be like him.,1
"Professor Baddar was so inspirational! I learned so much in regard to the writings of Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Franz Kafka, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. She will force you to think outside of the box when you try to interpret the literature assigned throughout the semester. You can learn a lot from her! Work hard and you'll earn an A.",1
"I would recomend taking professor Fujimoto over any other teacher. Shes easy to work with and has great feedback. If you attend class, listen and do her readings youll pass. She doesnt give tough assignments and is very flexible. I truly think shes an amazing teacher!",1
"Definitely not a professor that I would recommend. She is not very nice, and is extremely unorganized. Everything is online, even the book. She does not respond to emails often, and when she does she is very passive aggressive. She should not be a professor. I have not learned a thing from her class.",0
he is very monotone and has a dry sense of humor the quizes are easy since you can use the book..study and you should be just fine watch out for the curve,0
Wonderfully dedicated instructor with high level of understanding and awesome ability to connect with students!  Extremely patient and willing to repeat instruction when asked.  Had her for several semesters and never once saw her become impatient.  One of the best math instructors who is an excellent example for student teachers.,1
"Great teacher, highly recommend taking this class if you need the music credit. He's lecture heavy, but the lectures are clear, easy to follow, and not hard to listen to. Read the book, listen to the music selections, and you'll be fine in this class.",1
Dr. Bailey is one of the best professors in engineering. He truly cares about whether you understand the material. He gives his students every tool they may need to succeed. I wish he taught all of the engineering courses.,1
"Nicest professor ever! You learn a lot of useful relevant information in his Social Media class. He isn't a tough grader, if you put in effort you will get an A for sure. He really cares about students. He is willing to go out his way to help students understand the material. Responds fast. So nice and caring and too pure for this earth. TAKE HIM!",1
"Faith Lamprey is a nice lady. Her lectures are clear and easy to flow. Attend class, do the homework and you will pass. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask her. She does not have an office at Rhode Island College, but she is pretty good at responding to emails.",1
"Puh-lease. Prof Waller just doesn't like bull. I have had NO issues with her. Also, how many students do you think are in the program? Don't you think it might be hard to accommodate EVERYONE. If its never open why have there been special days just for 1st semester students before practicums. Stop with the pity party.",1
No Comments,1
Dr. K is a great insructor.I wish all of my other professors would utilize his teaching techniques. Dr. K got you to think about the class and responded to all classmates postings.,1
One of my favorite professors in my online college experience. He encouraged out of the box ways of thinking while providing plenty of information to grasp what he expected of you. A fair grader that I would recommend taking. If he offered more classes I needed I would be taking him again.,1
"If you take his course, don't stand out.  He will grade you based on your visual appearance, class, etc. He spends most of his time on personal business and cancels class a lot. He thoroughly answers questions, but with a patronizing attitude.  He'd be a great guy if he wasn't so insecure and full of himself. Talks about fellow staff negatively. :(",0
"Very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but lacks commitment to the class and appears unreliable. An A is  realistic, if you give a decent effort. His lackadasical attitude toward the class (several missed classes), poor communication) have the ability to make you lazy. You just have to remain focused throughout the semester.",1
"her organizational skills are terrible. She is quick to change the schedule whenever it suits her, without warning the class. The teacher even goes over lessons in class, which have nothing to do with the chapter we have read. She never responds to emails, and is quick to deduct points based off grammar. She's also Always late when grading homeowr.",0
A real gem of a professor. His class was my favorite Gen Ed/Hub Unit so far. A great class if you have decent Bible Knowledge and would like to supplement it.,1
One of the worst classes and professors on campus. His teaching is absolutely pathetic. I recommend noone to take him as a professor.,0
"I had several classes by Dr. Chris when I was at school. Easily, one of my favorite professors. His classes are challenging, don't come to them expecting easy ""A""s. You have to work hard for your grades, but you learn a lot of valuable information. He genuinely cares about the lives of his students. I would highly recommend him as a teacher.",1
Lectures were so monotone. It was very unclear what he is looking for on exams. Take this class with a different professor if you can.,0
Sara's classes are difficult because she pushes you to do your best. There wasn't a class where I didn't learn. She also teaches more than just the text book; she gives you an incite into life and her successes and failures. She is also hilarious.,1
"She is an amazing teacher , you will like her class . she makes it easy to everybody , she helps you to pass the class and get good grade ,just do the homework she gives and attend the class and you will be good. Any thing you need in the class or with your homework she will absolutely help you . I recommend every body to take the class with her .",1
"I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, and I learned more in 10 weeks with Marks than I did in the past 4 years.  The Wiley Plus (on-line assignments) is annoying at times, but I do not mind going to class.  He explains everything really well, and although he is a tough grader at times, you will still learn a lot and do good if you actually try.",1
Dr. Feige is an awesome prof! He's really good at teaching difficult material and is very nice and approachable. I learned a lot from him. I just wished I had Dr. Feige for boil 151.,1
Professor Trower is SO NICE! He is SUPER helpful and loves giving extra credit. He also likes to apply the concepts he goes over in class to real world issues. He has got to be one of the best professors I've ever had!,1
"Very brash and unapologetic dude. Office hours are practically non-existent because he's adjunct. Physics is hard, but he puts in a lot of work to try to help students really understand the concepts instead of just the underlying math.",1
amazing professor. his lectures don't put you to sleep and he makes the class fun.  just show up to class and do your 3-2-1s. you have to do an incredibly easy midterm and a short presentation at the end of the semester. easy A. also don't bother getting a textbook.  ,1
"Horrible teacher! The textbook basically taught you how to do math. He did one example of a lecture and the rest was up to you to figure it out. I love math, but he made me hate it.",0
"Lectures can be boring and the papers are a drag, but the final is optional. Easy to get an A or B",1
She clearly cares about her students but unfortunately does not meet the mark as a professor. She assigns readings and documentaries that are very long and complicated and blatantly boring. She puts thought into her lectures but unfortunately does not capture interest. She is also very set in her opinion and does not make room for other ones.,0
"Professor Knott is tough, but she genuinely cares about the success of her students. Take good notes and ask plenty of questions to clarify EXACTLY what she wants from you. She is more than willing to help students, but requires that students show great effort on their end as well. I developed a passion for writing by taking her class.",1
Great Professor. He understands that most of the students in this course aren't science majors and the course itself isn't that hard if you give a little effort. There is so much extra credit that lots of students end up with over 100%.,1
she is really nice and helpful. she makes class interesting snd fun.,1
"WORST class I have ever taken. The discussion class is misnamed, the tests are impossible to study completely for and the paper outlines are apparently written with the expressed purpose of tricking students. Needs to learn to control the volume of her voice- BADLY.",0
"A little boring, but she was nice.",1
"Dr. Macdonald is only good for reading off the slides. She wont discuss midterms or how many questions they contain, she wont look at chat, she literally will do nothing further than giving you the slide info. She also doesn't have basic computer competencies, failing to even start the lecture at times. Rip to anyone that takes her 325 course",0
He is funny and the best professor ever.,1
Shes cool,1
"Professor Chambers is a dedicated and caring professor.  She helped me on her own time and helped me pass the course.  She made an investment in me and believed in me, which inspired me to work hard.  If you are struggling, all you need to do is ask for help and she will make the same investment in you as she did in me.  If you care, she cares!!",1
I would totally take Hinton for every Biology course if I could! She was amazing! I loved her! She is so caring and hilarious! She goes off of topic a lot but make sure you show up to the reviews! Make sure you study the reviews because they are JUST like the tests (like word for word). Answer questions and she will give you bonus points :-),1
He is a great teacher. ,1
"Mrs. Waddel was a wonderful professor! I'm not ""mathy"" but managed to get an A and not have to take the final. There is a great deal of work in her class, because although the homework isn't mandatory, it is key to do to pass. Quizzes almost every day allow you to get a lot of points. If you are willing to put in the effort, a good choice!",1
his class was all over the place. We had a lot of different books and we would jump all over the material. He would go off on tangents a lot and it felt like what he was saying didn't align with what we were reading. His essay assignments were confusing and he took forever to grade. He's very stuck in his ways and i wouldn't take him again.,0
"The class has a few quizzes, a large project, two midterms and two long in class quizzes. The material is actually a lot more interesting that you would imagine. If you ever get confused, Dr. Hansen is always available to help. I learned a lot in this class and it was very manageable. He also might be the nicest man in the world.",1
"I have mixed feelings about this professor. He's a really nice guy and is very accessible, but sometimes he can be unclear when explaining his lectures. Luckily, the lectures are posted so you can go back and review it. My only problem with this class was how harshly the homework was graded. You'll do better on the exams than the HW.",1
Really good and insightfull teacher.  Very relevant application and helpful.,1
"Scanlon is a very funny, but sarcastic person. He might come off as stand-offish sometimes, but he is a very good professor. It just depends on your sense of humor. Overall he is very good at explaining things, but you are required to put forth a lot of effort too if you want to pass this class.",1
easy A just watch the lecture videos,0
"Prof Conroy has the potential to be an excellent teacher once he figures his stuff out. He seems kind & honest &  is always an email away. His tests are tough and long and are 3-5 chapters deep. He needs to double check handouts, space his tests out, & not assign a project less than a month before Finals while still preparing for our 3rd test.",1
"Healthcare Eco. good class, not that easy of a grade,but managable....",1
"Not very well prepared for class.  We spent most of the class time waiting on him to get his stuff ready and the rest of it talking about things that didn't apply to anything remotely related to the course material.  Tests somewhat difficult, but not too bad.",0
If you don't have your notebook you've basically failed the class.,0
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
Best profesor for A&P take him if you don't you will regret it. 4 exam including the final for the lecture. 2 exams for the lab midterm (combine MC & fill-in) and final (all fill-in.) Take note!  I mean it  write down EVERYTHING he says because the exams are from the notes best part (old school) no power point board only. Answers all questions,1
"she is a friendly woman.First English teacher since my junior year of highschool who ACTUAKLLY taught how to WRITE AN ESSAY. As far as grading goes, hand in you rough drafts everytime. you will save yourself a lot of stress when you get your grade. pay attention and participate and she will see the effort you are putting in. overall great teacher",1
The class is very irrelavent to English and Literature and the professor also uses biases in his teachings and towards students. The class is very boring.,0
"He is very helpful and makes chemistry understandable. If you are having any troubles with his class, he will help you as long as you ask!",1
"If you have the ability to take him, do it!! He made me love English when I hated it coming from high school. He has a grading contract where as long as you do the work required with effort, you will get an A. While this seems like an easy way out, it actually encourages people to take risks and deeply engage with the material in interesting ways.",1
"online literature set up clearly.  Assignments due every two weeks.  No tests except exam.  Had to post journals, lengthy unit discussions, 1 short research project. Good readings.  Must meet deadlines, but very fair professor if you read and do the work. Summer online lit. is only 8 weeks long,not 15, so only serious students should attempt.",1

"Honestly the most boring class i've ever taken, it may not necessarily have been all her fault as the materials are bland, however she doesn't make it interesting at all and it's very hard to pay attention to her.",0
"Très bon prof, cours agréable! Mais il y a quand même une pas pire charge de travail (c'est quand même du français) Ça se fait très bien !",1
"His lectures are very interesting. I easily get bored durint long periods of conversations, but not in his class. Especially since everything he says is important, and will likely be on his tests. Many students don't appreciate his hard lectures and exams, but I did because it made it that much more worth it in the end. I learned alot!",1
"god this lady is the devil, simon cowel of the speech word. everything you do is wrong, even if its right. NEVER take this lady.",0
"I have a 4:30-7:10 class, about 5:30 every wednesday she has a guest come in and talk. This is soooo boring for some, and for others interesting. Nuneville, will teach you the lecture for about 45minutes - 1 hour and after that her guest speakers come in and talk for the rest of class.",1
After taking Professor Perez for speech class i'm no longer scared to be in front of a class and present. She's a great teacher that gives great feedback that will strengthen your speeches. As long as you show up every day and get all of the work done you'll be fine. I highly recommend her!!,1
one of the best teacher I have ever met,1
"She's very patient and if she sees that the class doesn't understand what she's talking about, she goes over it in a different way. She's always willing to help in and out of class. She's also a perfectionist so she will point out where you could do better, but she understands that night classes = busy people.",1
"This is a useful course. Professor Mahallati explains the text, because the text and Content is dense. Worth the work though.",1
"Not many tests, just 3 big speeches and a couple of smaller ones. But when you do get exams they can be difficult and graded hard, don't go over studying for exam as much as like the speeches. Can be a tough grader during speeches. She does offer help for your speeches you just have to ask her and she'll tell you a clear answer of what she expects.",1
I took this class in 2020 and I don't know if it was just the circumstances but this class was lacking structure and presence. Lectures were hard to sit through sometimes but it was an easy pass. If you are looking for surface level insight into the field consider this class.,0
"Mr. McEntire is an exceptional teacher of drama. He gives TONS of extra credit by watching videos in class, seeing playsmusicals at TCC or outside of class. He lets you know when a quiz is coming. Several short quizzes, 2 tests, 1 analysis essay over a play of your choice. He makes things very interesting!  Very funny guy, Highly recommended.",1

"Definite GPA booster for me, can get 100% on online labs (MC Q's) if you compare answers with ppl. 3% survey bonus marks. Lots of recommended readings, but I barely did any of it (~5-6 pages altogether) and got 95%. Focus on online notes, learning obj, and video questions. Use textbook for reference, or when smthing is explicitly mentioned to know.",1
Professor Hart REALLY knows her stuff. A good professor & you WILL learn a lot. Expect a lot of homework every single week. The assignments can get quite repetitive but there is a reason why she chooses to do it this way. Tedious at times. You cannot pass this class without the textbook. Participation and attendance is very much mandatory.,1
"I liked her, solid prof, make sure you participate. She's respectable and respects the students.",1
"Good person, okay instructor could be better. Class participation heavy, lectures every class, thought experiments and the like.",1
Calculus II is a very hard class as it is and he makes it harder when he doesn't completely finishes examples and doesn't go over complicated examples which are seen in the very long hw. Quizes are very short which make it hard to get pts. He's smart but he needs to realize this is our first time taking the course and we need more thorough lectures,0
"This class reminds me of high school. It's so straight forward and required the minimum amount of work and effort. Professor Suggs is a cool guy and is really passionate about the topic, but I couldn't help but zone out anyway. 100% recommend taking for a gen-ed. Easy A.",1
"Very Helpful, Wants her students to pass .",1
AWESOME professor. Extremely helpful and caring. I'd highly recommend her =),1
"Beato is a nice guy but also never seems prepared for lectures. He is equally as surprised with what is on the next slide as you will be. Because of that, he gives off a chaotic vibe and often teaches out of order. That is not to say that he doesn't know the content, once he remembers what he wrote, he can normally explain it pretty well.",1
"Interesting class, she knows her stuff",1
"She is a very nice lady, but the class is spent going over problems. Tons of extra credit is available. Her tests always seem so much harder then what was gone over in class. And she loves fractions..",1
"I loved taking sociology with Mrs. Trent. She is funny, kind and a good professor. If you put in the work the class should be an easy A. Exams are the hardest part but there are plenty of other things that you can use to bring your grade up!",1
"While he can be very stern, he is fair. He gives students the opportunity to earn majority of the credit through showing work (even if incorrect answer). Earn his respect through your grades and/or effort and you'll be fine. Long tests but questions are just variations of previous quiz questions(that you can take home) so no reason not to pass.",1
"I found his lectures rushed, disjointed, and unclear. This is partially because his powerpoints are a mixture of the textbook publisher's ppts as well as a few other professors' lecture slides. It was easier and clearer to read the excellent textbook and skip all lectures. That aside, he's helpful out of class and his exams are fair.",0
"Ben is absolutely one of the best professors I've had! If you are a history buff like myself, this course is right up your alley. Everything he says has meaning-- so listen! He is able to convey exactly what information you must know for any quizzes or tests in a comprehensive manner. I look forward to Ben's lectures! He is also pretty hilarious!",1
"Looking back at the past 5 years of college, Thana was one of the best instructors I had. He made CS very accessible while also challenging me to progress. I also took him for CIS 36B and CIS 27 and I wish I could have taken him for more class still.",1
IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE AND VALUE YOUR TIME DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE NAME JOANNE HOUSTON.... THE SMALLEST MOST MICROSCOPIC THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION OF TAKIN A CLASS WILL DESTROY THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN SHE FAILED 28 OUT OF 30 PPL IN MY CLASS...SHE IS ILLOGICAL AND CONFUSED WITH HER OWN LIFE MUCH LESS TO HAV TIME TO CATER TO YOURS..DON'T DO IT!!!!!,0
Spends half the class talking about herself rather than focusing on important matters. She has a bad attitude. Reprimands students who request guidance through email which is often since she is only in her office for a few hours during the week. She does this because she is not computer literate. Very discouraging to eager students. Awful! Awful!,0
Edward J Tavss is perhaps the best chemistry professor in the country... The universe? Maybe... He is funny and he makes sure that his students understand every single concept before he can even think about going to the next slide. Is it worth going to Cook/Douglass three times a day for an hour? Not one bit... However Tavss uses a sign-in sheet.,1
"If you struggle with math or haven't taken math in a while, I recommend you take this teacher. She is amazing !!! The best math teacher I have ever had. I have seen some bad reviews on her but they don't make sense because she is very helpful and does care about her students passing her class. She does have some typos in lectures but she fixes it.",1
Brandeen is one of the best teacher at Humber. She teaches some of the hardest subjects on the course but she does an incredible job at explaining them. She has her expectations on students but is also very understanding of extraordinary situations. Don't think twice before taking her as a teacher.,1
Awesome Teacher. I would highly recommend him. We need more teachers like Mr. Edward,1
"Professor Bachmann was really good. She is really corny but hilarious. No tests or hard worksheets. There are 2 essays but fairly easy. Attendance is mandatory, but you'll pass if you miss 2-3 lectures. Just pay attention and take notes. Overall, an easy A.",1
"Professor Westover is very knowledgeable. I also think he is respectful, responds to questions right away, and definitely gives feedback about student performance in a timely manner. He is a great teacher, especially for those on the HR track.",1
Outstanding teacher. Math isn't the easiest for some of us but she is more then willing to help. She'll extend due dates for assignments if to many students in the class are struggling. Comes in once a week  an hour early for a pre class workshop for students who need a little extra help. Easy to talk to and super smart.,1
He made me love moral theology and I was always excited to go to his class! Only 2 tests and every class is a different lecture.,1
"Excellent chargé de cours, extrêment pertinent et connais très bien sa matière",1
Great teacher! defiantly take him. Had 3 twelve page papers worth 33% of your grade. Lets you out an hour early each class. Also hilarious and keeps the lectures interesting. Textbook is not needed.,1
There is quite a bit of homework to complete out of the books. Keep up on it and you will get a good grade. She is fair and nice. I did recommend her for a class.,1
Took her Honor's class online. Professor Hartgrove is extremely helpful and accessible through her office hours. The class work is fun and if you put in the work you will learn a lot about psychology. She gives good lectures and was very sympathetic to students during the pandemic.,1
"Miss class and you will not pass. She is a Pro Public Speaker and wants everything done EXACTLY how she says it. As long as you do the work, work hard for the grade you will pass the class. She is a tough grader, points deduct if you do not follow her outline. WILL NOT pass this class if you do not do your speeches. I got like 6 assignments a week.",1
"Prof always willing to help and doesn't want to move on unless we fully understand the topic. If you aren't that great at math, I 'd take him. He makes understanding the class quite simple. Homework also reflects most of the quizzes/exams.",1
"Great professor, really knows his stuff. All power points are posted but only figures, so go to class. On review day he straight up tells you the answers to the exam(only if you ask ), meaning he will tell you questions he is going to ask you. Dedicates an entire lecture just to be asked questions about the exams. I would take this class again!",1
"MARK LIST IS AWESOME!!! For a subject I've always found to be completely dull, he made it the best possible. He runs a very interactive class. There's a lot of group work, and he's always nearby to help. There aren't very many homework assignments or projects, but you definitely want to be in class for the classwork and to prep for exams.",1
"He goes very fast and it is hard to follow along. The practice problems will help you keep up, so do them. He ends up curving the entire class at the end, so if you are not happy with your grade don't worry because it will go up.",0
i highly recommend this professor. she is such a generous teacher in grading. she always motivate to join you the debate team. i love her!,1
This class was not what I expected. this teacher is all about journalism and he should stick with that only. MCOM 63 was about new media and all we did were videos. very disappointing class. He's helpful when one on one but very rude if its in front of the class. take a different teacher for MCOM 63,0
"He's a very strict grader and deducts any points as possible from the test and homework. He talks very low so make sure to sit in the front, if you have any questions he's willing to help. Besides that the class isn't as hard if you know what you learn in MATH 125.",1
"FUNNIEST BLACK TEACHER EVER! She comes off as strong at first but just respect her, WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN shes extremly clear, and REALLY helps students to understand! I recieved a C in this class due to her grace upon me. Im so thankful i took her. WORK YOUR HARDEST, and she'll work hard for you(ie. extra credit/retests/notes4quizzes) No MyMathLab",1
"One of the best teachers at Bates, would definately recommend to all....",1
"Amazing professor! She really pushes you to your full potential. Although she doesn't always use her powerpoint during lecture, she keeps the lecture entertaining and makes the material easier to understand. As a clinical professor, she is fast paced and keeps you on your toes. She may keep you past lunch so make sure you bring a quick snack.",1
"she knows what she is doing, one of the best. she is too good to teach there.",1
Amazing professor and very professional. She cares a lot about her students. She helped me so much.,1
"WORST CLASS EVER. You will study all semester long and still struggle. Awful tests, easy quizzes, busy work assignments. You do not even learn the most important part of the course until the last week of class. ",0
"Dr Sam is a good professor. I have him only on Lab. Besides his heavy accent, he always try to explain everything clearly.",1
"The class used historical role-playing games, so not as much lecturing. Helped to develop writing and speaking skills, but reading and preparation is necessary to do well. No tests, so papers and participation make up the grade.",1
"Worst teacher ever!!! Tough greater, doesnt even teach but expects you to know everything and she will report you if you forget to cite anything. Shes absolutely terrible this lady should be fired, not a teacher at all!",0
"Do Not Take!! Professor is VERY work heavy. I had more work for her class than for both my major courses taken in the same semester combined!! She is not very friendly towards make up work or absences and is very critical with the grading system. Unless you plan on only taking her course alone, you'll need maximum effort to pass.",0
"You definitely need the textbook in this class and also come to class because he talks about everything you read in the book. He's an easy grader. This class is an easy A, as long as you do the online homework which is read a chapter of a textbook and makeup and answer 3 questions. He's very nice but he just very strict on all electronic devices.",1
"Gave the final exam. Was challenging, but then I have learnt more in this course than any other at University of Winnipeg!!",1
-Grammar checks contradicted each other throughout the drafts of an essay. -Directions are mostly unclear and vague. -Talks more about her other jobs than finishing a chapter lecture. -Exams are not based on power-point lectures but unnecessary information from the textbook.,0
"I wish he taught other classes.  The professor is smart, funny and an excellent lecturer.  He also is a sharp dresser and cute!!",1
"He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting.",0
i was scared to approach her in the class ... the course work was very heavy shes a nice professor but that class was not for me,0
"The best experience you can have learning a foreign language. If you're seriously interested in learning the language, his class will be the favorite part of your day. Highly recommend - no question!",1
"Lectures mainly consist of powerpoints with the occasional group project. She is very nice and always willing to answer any questions you have. She tries her best to always find a book that is also free online. She has four tests a semester, reading is important but you can get by with skimming as long as you pay attention to the lecture and study.",1
"Very good prof.  Not an easy class, nor should it be; must think very critically and express it in your writing.  I worked hard and it paid off.  I'd recommend her.",1
"Dr. Moore is alright, ya see, she's just like you and me. She's a bit passive aggressive and bloody-well-boring, but what's important is that she loves you and me.",1
"Claudine was a wonderful instructor! She gives clear expectations, is easy to communicate with, and genuinely cares about her students. She loves mental health and it's easy to see. You'd be lucky to have her!",1
Utilizes a lot of examples from business. Does a good job of explaining the material.,1
Great teacher!!! I love her she's very helpful!,1
"Her lectures are very dry and she gets off track easily. It takes her forever to start the lecture since she always has some random thing to say at the beginning of class. Her tests are by far the laziest I've seen which leads to the wording to be either convoluted, ambiguous, or unclear. Even the typography and appearance of her tests look bad.",0
"She's a really chill prof, and she leads interesting discussions. The works she picks to read are well-rounded and interesting. Work really hard on the two take-home essays and use her office hours. She really prepares you for the in-class essays, so don't miss class leading up to test days. Readings are due in every class as well as journals.",1
"I had to take her online because of COVID-19. I thoroughly enjoy writing but her class made want to despise the entire subject. She seriously takes forever to grade assignments and marks points down for small mistakes. I feel like the experience would be different in a face-to-face class, but overall do not recommend.",0
"This is the easiest class that I have ever taken. Anyone who says that this is a hard class is an Ag major that has had it really easy during their community college days, or they are a lazy liberal arts major. Would recommend for an easy science credit. I have no ag experience whatsoever, and I got a 100 in the class. Buy the course packet.",1
"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected. Ridiculous time limits on exams/quizzes, NO feedback, and turn around time for grades (semester is over and I still haven't received grades for 2 papers- be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks). DON'T. DO. IT.",0
"Gets off topic too much, rarely discusses the book, no test review. Hard to pass when we do zero book discussion and watch videos. Cool person but not a quality teacher",0
"The class content is not difficult.  The professor makes it difficult by setting her own criteria for grading that is not part of the assignment.  Elizabeth does not follow the rubric, does not answer questions, and makes up erroneous grading criteria.  She doesn't even understand the course she is teaching. Worst excuse for an instructor.",0
Best ENC professor at BC!,1
I think Mrs. Bowlin is a great teacher. I really enjoyed her class this year. She had us work in groups and I made some new friends on top of learning about Sociology. Thank you Mrs. Bowlin!,1
I really enjoyed this class. It was a very informative class and Dr. Westover did a great job at explaining things. I would highly recommend him to anyone. There was a lot of work but it was all helpful to the learning.,1
A great teacher that I would take for every class if I could,1
She is really great at teaching. If you miss a few classes you need to get notes from someone in your class or you will be lost. She's very understanding and she will try to make sure you understand her lecture before moving foward with the lecture.,1
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Rude and unprofessional. If you don't already basically have a masters degree in physics he is going to make you feel stupid. Doesn't care about his students or their comprehension of the material.,0
"Dr. Bricker is the worse professor I've ever encountered. She has no respect for students, makes them feel dumb, and actually called our class of 120+ students ""stupid"" multiple times. She was the only teacher for this course, but if you can, DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE",0
"Dr. Zavarin is very knowledgeable but more importantly is an effective teacher.  He is relaxed, funny and approachable, and will make himself available for questions.  He seems to want you to succeed and provides thorough practice exams and solutions and some extra credit.  Lectures are thorough and not at all boring.  Definitely take his class!",1
Mr. Emshwiller is a caring and respected vocal instructor.  I will continue to take lessons with him.,1
"I took the computer deal of his class, where you do the course online but you're in a class with him. I liked the program and his teaching style is nice, you raise your hand, ask your question and you get a PERFECT answer, and I SUCK at math, I mean with a capital S. He's very mellow, chill, and funny at times.",1
"I am thoroughly impressed with how Dr. Kelley laid out course materials in Blackboard. Everything is easily accessible, organized to limit confusion for students. I WISH that every professor would lay out their classes this way.",1
"The bulk of information for exams comes from a print out that he hands out before he even covers the material, so it's hard not to know what to study. He wants you to participate, so make sure you do the homework and readings before class, it WILL bump your average up significantly. Honestly, I thought he was great. I got an easy A",1
Takes forever to get graded work back to students but is flexible with deadlines and assignment criteria. Very understanding but also is very picky and likes things her own way.,1
"I had a bad TA which really killed the class considering there were two discussions a week, but the one lecture we would have was excellent. She infuses humor and intellect brilliantly. A terrific professor.",1
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
"Dr. Parker was enormously patient with us when we moved online. He accommodated our various schedules, supported us when writing, and made sure our final submission was a success through feedback.",1
"A great professor, a professional software developer and a man of noble disposition. It was an honor to be his student.",1
You get what you put into it. She gives great feedback and responds to emails in a timely matter. Voice your opinions during discussions. Homework and online discussions are super easy if you read the material. She super clear on what she expects and will dock points if you stray.,1
"He is the easiest professor i have dealt with. He will tell you in 1st day of that you are  guaranteed an A or B at the worst if you come to class. All the exams are 12 take home and the reviews are same as the exams, he only changes the numbers. Easy A for everyone, even if you are horrible in math like i was. He is the man. Best professor ever.",1
"this woman is out of her mind, during lecture she'll go on for an hour about her granddaughter and teach us NOTHING, come exam time, she pulls questions out of her ass about stuff she never ever taught, THANK GOD SHES RETIRING no one deserves such torture",0
She is a great teacher and proides study guides. All you have to is show up because you get a lot of in class assignments and just need 2 do your projects/papers.,1
"This was a very easy class, and I enjoyed it a lot. Sara allowed us to get to know her as well as the other students in the class. Our projects were fun, and the workload was fairly light. She is a very good teacher to have as an intro to theatre.",1
Oh Steve.. Steve is that dude. He is one of the boys and was a great professor. Tests is based on 4 tests and he gives very good reviews. Also we has quizzes but were told about them in advance. Much love Steve.,1
"Lacking of  example, the assignment is nothing about the notes. He talked a lot about the definition. the definition is useless. He thought he is a good teacher, you know....",0
"Very helpful, she wrote the book, literally.",1
"I was completely lost.  Tests did not accurately reflect the homework.  You had to really understand the concepts (and I did not).  Tests were open notes/book, but it really didn't do much good.  I got a B because I randomly did well on one test, but I didn't learn anything.  My grade was pure luck.  Most of the dept. sucks so I guess he's alright.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR CARIBBEAN BIODIVERSITY!!!!! Class grade only dependent on 3 exam grades out of 4 (1 is a cumulative final). The average grade for the last exam was a low D without the curve. He asks questions that are very specific about something he said during a lecture that he barely mentioned. Very unorganized way of teaching.,0
This is an awesome class. Pam knows everything about teaching language arts and is especially well read in children's literature. She is extremely supporting and nice. Would recommend!,1
"This class was SOO boring, but it's easy. You don't need the textbook and your don't even have to go to class. I don't think I listened to any of his lectures, but I got an A in his class. He talks so quietly. The whole class is based on presentations and 2 online exams.",0
"This class was easy and I recommend taking her. I made a 98 in the class. She extends deadlines and is flexible if you have any problems in your field experience. There are 3 bigger assignments and a few weekly reading summaries. Lectures can be long, but she likes people to participate and show at least some understanding of the content.",1
I started off with an F but i immediately went for help during her office hours. she can explain complex ideas extremely simple and it was a joy to have her as my professor. Before each exams she prepares the class with a practice exam so make sure you complete that before the test. Great professor if you want to learn the beauty of algebra!!,1
lool tbt to that one time in class when she said she disliked rap. I was shook. But I needed the course so whateves. She plays songs about whatever drug she's lecturing on before class starts. Her exams aren't easy and she marks hard but the course material itself isn't difficult. Class isn't a total bore even though it's history.,1
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
"great prof, great classes.  Take his classes if you can.  bank it",1
"This class wasn't originally supposed to be taught by him but he adjusted and did the best he could to accommodate. He is flexible on the old professors grading scale and will go back to fix it if necessary. He wants his students to pass but this class is time consuming so if you don't put in the time, don't expect a good grade.",1
boring class ..cant keep students attention ..knows his material but has a hard time putting it into simple terms,0
"I took a two semester course with Stephanie. While the course was difficult, she did her best to make sure everyone understood. If you are confused, raise your hand! The tests are lengthy, requiring the entire class length. STUDY HARD!! I received an A both semesters, so it is possible. Overall I like her.",1
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
"great teacher, highly advise to take this course with him. makes the class very interesting.",1
"Of all the classes I took online, sociology was my favorite! I am a pre-med major and this course gives you an insight into the different problems we face as a society, but this professor made the weekly discussions meaningful instead of having you repeat the information from the textbook. Highly recommend she is a very nice lady!",1
"I have had her for RPE 31 and Disabilities II in the Winter.  She makes the class a nice friendly environment. The class is well structured, interesting projects and easy vocabulary quizzes. Just study and not screw around and you will be fine. ",1
"My second class with AR. Ok, let's put the looks aside because she IS a looker and focus on her teaching style. As a teacher myself I found it too research oriented but in this case that's exactly what I needed. A researcher of her caliber would be perfect for grad students. Less sure about undergrads. Overall high marks.",1
"Professors dont matter that much with organic chem II. Good or bad the class is still gonna be one of the hardest youve ever taken. Accept that. But MS is one of the best professors if not. Always has a hilarious story, makes lecture fun. Material is hard, exams are fair and professor is amazing. Take MS above all other orgo professors.",1
"Sullivan is a great professor to learn from. He has had first hand experience in the field, and can provide great insight on his lectures. ",1
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so passionate about her work that you can't help but enjoy learning it. She uses her own textbook so it's really easy to understand. When you are reading it you can basically hear her voice in your head. You do still need to work hard to get a good grade though but she is always there if you need help! Love her!!,1
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
"Dr. Hinton is funny and kind and always keeps the class hyped but she messed up my grades and I kept checking them but she didnt put them in until after grades were due and I was supposed to end up with a 89 B but somehow I ended up with a C on my transcript. If youre going to take her class, CHECK YOUR GRADES WITH HER TO SEE IF THEY ARE CORRECT",1
"Noris is a nice guy, knowledgeable, and makes Human Physiology very interesting. He is addictive, I actually looked forward to every class. The class covers a wide array of topics in physiology. Quizzes every Tuesday and he tells you whats on the quiz, so a voice recorded is highly recommended. It is an easy class. There is one research paper.",1
"This class wasn't the best, but definitely an easy A if you show up to class and listen to the lecture. There is a quiz once a week, but she tells you exactly what is going to be on it the class before at the end of the lecture, so make sure you come to class. A summary for homework every week on a chapter and a few follow-up activities.",1
"The worst professor I've ever had in my life. There was probably close to 4 full books of reading for only a few questions on each test. He was really rude and immature during some times and was really unreasonable. Worst professor ever, do NOT take him",0
Mr. Boyle is a really hot guy although i wish he would lighten up. Sucks that hes already married.,1
"I really enjoyed her class, I got the feeling some people were missing her sense of humor, but if you like a little subtle wit with your learning, she's your Prof. Gave great examples, was easy to talk to and ask questions, and helping find answers. Projects are well defined before you start, she gives you a checklist of things to include.",1
"Yo, don't even listen to the negative comments. Mr. Pilar is a really good teacher. His lectures are easy to understand and engaging. If you missed class, you could just go to his office hours and he will help you one on one. If you get the material, then online homework and tests are very easy. U r wasting a gr8t opportunity if u don't take him!",1
"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",0
He never tells you what he wants bc he doesnt want to stifle your creativity then takes off points for stuff that wouldve been clear if he gave rubrics. feedback sucks and gets annoyed when you try to talk to him/clarify things. His lectures are cool and so is he but he rambles and is unhelpful. he doesnt realize that hes condescending ALL THE TIME,0
"He is a wonderful Professor. I am not saying this because I passed but because he really takes the time to help you understand math. He shows different techniques to solving a problem in case you don't understand. He's awesome! Offers extra credit. Do the work, study and you'll pass. You can't expect to pass if you don't do the work.",1
Showing up to Matt's labs is very important but he is there with you the entire way. Matt really cares about each and every one of his students and is a very organized and smart individual. I highly recommend taking one of his classes. You are guaranteed to pass.,1
"I don't know why the first few ratings are negative - She is clear and understandable, flexible with assignments if she sees the class is stressed, gives open-book quizzes/tests, provides all powerpoint slides on moodle, and doesn't give a lot of work. I would definitely take a class with her again.",1
Super Nice! Tells hilarious stories! Take notes in class there's barely any homework then do the test. Pretty Easy,1
"I'm in his Math 70 class. If you're patient and not a jerk about his accent he's really a helpful guy. He has an awesome blue shirt I want to steal. I usually get out of class 1 hour early every day. Finish your worksheet and you're done. If you're not able to study by yourself dont take this class. You have to do some ""self educating""",1
"She is a very nice indivudual but I felt she did not connect with all the students in the class. At times she looked at me like ""Are you in my class"" and she did have her favourites. Both Exam were HARD. Her marking not so easy either. I always felt what she was teaching made sense in her own head but most of us had no clue what she was saying.",1
"he's a good professor that explains his information really well. He gave out study guides to complete that helped so much with test. You do have to get the book but honestly you dont even need to read it. I passed without reading it, just come to class and take notes on the powerpoints and youll do great.",1
"Most of us were intimidated on the first day until we got to know her. This instructor was amazing, you had to work for your grade but you learned a lot. Feedback was very helpful.",1
The worst structure ever! she can't even speak in English fluently... she can't teach and she is awful for master level! Unfortunately she is teaching the most important course in Econ!!!!,0
"Great professor. Loves his subject, and very animated during lectures. Pop quizzes, but he reviews a lot, and the tests are from the quizzes. One paper, but he basically coaches you on how to write it and is very helpful. Loves to joke, but pay attention in class or you will be called out (and possibly miss vital info). Would definitely take again.",1
I love this professor! Programming was very tough but he made it better. I made a 75 on his midterm but improved on the final exam with a 90 because I studied better. I made an A in the class but that was with a lot of hard work. He was very good at returning e-mails and answering any questions that students didn't understand. Please take him.,1
"She is a tough grader, during lectures she does give out good ideas that you wouldnt normally think about. There are about 1 inside the class essay. I believe overall she is narcissistic and no matter how hard you try; it still isnt good enough for his standards.",0
"I found her very unhelpful and unapproachable. The few times I interacted with her she was very unpleasant to deal with, and never fully answered my questions. She is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, but lacking the teaching skills. Would not recommend taking this class.",0
"A lot of fun. Exciting debates. Like everyone else said, get down pat all of his methods for how to approach each type of fact pattern on the exam.  And record his 1 hour review on the last class and review it over and over and over again.",1
"This is the worst teacher anyone can take, she does not teach the class. Her exams are super difficult and if the work you solved are not her way she marks it wrong. Do not take this class with this professor she is rhe worst. She is very rude and disrespectful. Will make you feel like you dont know anything. Rudest professor I met.",0
"May is a great guy, but as a teacher, very boring. Do not take as an 8 am class. You will be fighting to stay awake. He is willing to help at all times, but be sure to stay on schedule with tests and projects.",1
Great at making lectures interesting. Genuinely cares about her students. Put forth a little effort and you will succeed. Great for both science and arts majors.,1
I just finished calc 2 in the first half of summer so i thought i would relax a bit and take intro to russia online for the second half. I'm spending double the hours per week on this class. It's insane. she is crazy if she thinks this is an appropriate amount of work for a intro class like this. I'm doing like 8 hours/day minimum. DO NOT TAKE HER!,0
Gave us thoughtful and interesting pieces to read with great insight.,1
Good teacher. Very fair and helpful. Don't miss any classes and be on time or it will count against you. She has and likes good manners so behave yourself.,1
"For 170A he was fine. But I really enjoyed 145 (Robotics) with him. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is fairly comfortable with using MATLAB. One of my favorite engineering classes taken and the material was easy to understand but very interesting. Grading was fair, lectures were interesting and straightforward. Labs took hours and hours",1
"Listen. She's a good professor, ok? If you go to class, she offers a lot of extra credit. Also, I don't think her class is hard. Everything is literally from the notes. Sometimes  she'll really reeach for a real life example/metaphor (?)  and it doesn't work lol, especially in the beginning. She'll round you up a grade. You'll be ok! Good luck!",1
"I'm a good student & receive good grades. Even though I was interested in the material and ready to learn he made this class unbearable. He is very strict, unforgiving, rude, and gives a horrendous amount of busy work. He's a Christian (you can see his cross necklace through his chest hair) and is bias against the other religions in his lectures. ",0
"I took her class in Winter 2013. Grades fairly, reviews well for all quizzes and tests. Japanese food day is awesome! My Japanese is now up to speed thanks to Professor Garrisi.",1
"I FREAKIN LOVED FRAU ADAM. Very organised, prompt on returning assignments, clear handouts, quick on answering emails - an amazing, caring person as a whole. Her personality was sassy and outgoing and it was the only reason I never skipped our 8 AM class. She's also from Austria so it was really interesting to get her cultural aspect as well!",1
She is amazingly nice but don't let the word 'yoga' fool you! it is an actual class! there are tests and a legit research paper! Its an easy A if you try. but dont expect it to fall in your lap.  there is a lot of reading and several writing assignments.  but it was a really fun class and I am glad I took it.,1
"Really doesn't care about teaching the course whatsoever. Told our class that half of us may become good engineers and the others would be outright bad ones. Doesn't really read emails for questions, instead responds with rude comments on how we should know certain things that he either hasn't explained yet or explained poorly in class.",0
"Class started out with 35 students, 5 remained and only 3 of them passed. I recommend taking Newman, he is more thorough with his teaching. It is a hard class, I get that, it's college, but Kula's teaching habits weren't for me. I dropped his class and took with a different professor and it was 10x's easier to comprehend.",0
"very sweet but very easy. if you like easy A's then take her, but if you want more of a challenge the I suggest you dont.",1
"Her class is a bit boring for the 2 hour and 45 minute TOSS class, but she really does care and she yearns for her students to be interested in what she has to say. The course load is pretty minimal compared to other TOSS classes, and the textbook readings are short and sweet. All that she goes over is relevant and useful.",1
Best BU Psych 101 professor,1
Shes great overall. There is a lot of reading by yourself. Youll be assigned chapters and there will be open discussion about what you read in class the next day. She trys to be flexible with turn in dates. Shell ask if things are too much and if we need help to call her or email her. She cares about students and want us to have #WakeTechSwag,1
"FABULOUS instructor! My favorite one yet, take notes and you'll do fine on the test, they're straight from the notes. Extremely friendly and a great professor. His class helped me make up my mind about my major(I'd been going back and forth)and I changed it to Music Education. Best Professor at ODU!",1
"I love this woman!  Not afraid to say it how it is and how she want's to.  If you don't take an interest in the material, the class may not be enjoyable, but Mary has a wealth of knowledge and thinks at 1000 miles a minute.  Too many estudiantes tontas take her class, otherwise it would be one of the best classes I've had at this school.",1
"the worst ever. she makes the course so so so hard. also, she challenges the students. She feels satisfies if the student can't answer her quizzes or exams.",0
"The worst Professor on Earth, not only is he a tough grader hes also highly inconsiderate. If you have him just consider dropping out.",0
"He is an incredibly sweet professor, his class seemed difficult at first, but he allows you to send in your drafts and will give you amazing feedback. With his essays, they were long but not really hard to complete.",1
Tough but thorugh.  I liked her... its not as bad as some people said. Quizzes were tough but open book.,1
"Great Professor overall, would recommend him to anyone. Very inclined to help students outside of class.",1
one of the finer professors,1
"If you take intro or her gender and sex class, then you will have a blast. But if you take any higher level courses with her be prepared. She never actually teaches the material, it is up to you to learn it. Basically I learn more from the books she assigns than her in my other classes.",0
"Bill is one of my favorite professors I have ever had. Math is daunting to many people, and he really has a way of simplifying and demystifying algebra. His homework is short and easy, and he is a kind grader. Just be prepared to talk in class, as he is a fan of class participation on the regular. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
"PROFESSOR PERUYERA IS GREAT, HE WILL READ OF THE POWER POINTS BUT HE REALLY KNOWS THE MATERIAL, YOU NEED TO STUDY FROM THE BOOK POWER POINTS ALONE ARE NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. TAKE HIM, HE IS A GREAT PERSON. HE LETS  YOU TAKES YOUR NOTES AND POWER POINT TO TAKE THE TEST.",1
"This professor is very condescending. Random pop quizzes, so beware! He speeds through lectures and doesn't really teach, so prepare to learn the material on your own. I do not recommend his lecture or his lab.",0
Lectures were confusing and long winded. He is a nice person and tries hard to convey the information however he loses the students in the process. I have been to every class and still do not know what we have been doing. I literally put in random numbers on the homework assignments and do that until I get the correct answer. There is no hope. ,1
He is a great professor he has a great knowledge of biology. He also has a great sense of humor. Sometimes he does have to rush through the materials to meet his deadlines but I would not say he is disorganized. All of his exams are 50 multiple choice and he  drops one of the lowest grade. You do not need the text or lab book. He is the best,1
"Attendance is important, tests are based on lectures and notes. Book was not required. Very little homework which means you have to do well on the tests to get a overall good grade. He is funny but his lectures can get boring if your not a soil enthusiast. I find the tests hard and the study guides are not very helpful.",1
For those who dont know John Street is actually the ex Mayor of Philadelphia so you will get more of a background of what it is like working in local government because of him. This was only a GenEd course but I thought he was very funny and extremely helpful. However the simulations got old real quick ��,1
Professor Cambic is extremely helpful with assignmetns.  She explains everything well.,1
Shes one of the nicest professors Ive ever had. Shes very understanding if you just talk to her about any issues. There are a lot of group projects but she grades individually and if anyone isnt pulling their weight just talk to her.,1
"Sara is a very nice person at heart, but as a teacher I think it is hard to have her. Her grading system is very confusing and doesn't allow for students to keep track, and she makes the class very lecture heavy, which often leads to boredom from students. There is definitely a way to make the class more interesting. Wonderful person, not teacher.",0
"Ive had trouble with math all my life. I'm 50, Mr. Narin is the FIRST teacher I have ever had that made math easy for me to understand. He will work with you, just talk with him. If you dont say anything you can't blame him for not helping you.",1
"Dr. Polster is an extremely skilled teacher, and her method of teaching a foreign language is probably the best I've ever seen.  If you're interested in German or just need a foreign language, take Dr. Polster's class and you'll learn something along the way.",1
He is the worst teacher.,0
"Professor Shartin was great! It is really important that you go to all of the classes otherwise you will be so far behind you cannot catch up. The topic itself was really challenging but professor Shartin made sure that everyone was comfortable before moving on. Just show up to class, pay attention and ask a lot of questions! Good QR requirement!",1
Don't take her trust me you will regret it,0
"Group projects, discussion posts, and a couple of individual assignments. There's a lot of writing for this class. PPts and answering objectives is the best way to study for quizzes & exams. Otherwise it's an effort-based class more than anything else.",1
Roxi is a tough cookie to crack but a really good writing teacher. Definitely made for an interesting quarter not knowing if she liked me or not. She really cares about class participation so come to class with one thing to say about the reading and she'll love you. Also write with passion and she'll dig it no matter what it is.,1
"This guy is really genuine, helpful and easy to talk to. Any question you have, you email him and he literally gets back to you within half an hour with clear, helpful and usefull answers. Would really recommend taking him either for interest in Social Media, an elective or just for credit! A lot of material, but its all very short.",1
"she requires many books that you have to order online because some are not available in book stores. Although i highly recommend to not buy all books she does not even use them, also her syllabus was not clear on her grading, i got a 74 and she gave me a D which dropped my GPA by a lot unfortunately. I thought as all professors a D was 69 or 70",0
Totally awesome. In 2 weeks I was honestly speaking in Japanese.  Prof Garrisi starts speaking in Japanese the first day of class. Awesome Awesome! She takes attendance for every class. You want to be there. Daily homework from the workbook. Quizzes and test super easy as long as you attend review classes and study. TAKE HER YOU WONT REGRET IT.,1
"He is a delight. You can tell that he enjoys what he does as well the the topic. Tells great stories , very approachable and engaging.",1
"He is extremely passionate about what he is teaching, which makes you more excited to be there. Sometimes hard to follow, due to amount of material covered in each class. Assigns LOTS of readings each night, but do the readings! Things will make more sense in class and he gives pop quizzes.",1
He doesn't make it mandatory attendance for regular days only for presentation days. his class is an easy day. i never used the book,1
Show up to Intro to Civil and get an A as long as you take the weekly surveys after each class. Voss doesn't really even stay for the lecture as it is given by a guest professor each week.,1
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
There were a lot of test which is good but they were a lot of questions and people were often rushed. His grading policy is really harsh and the quizzes are due at weird times. Hes really funny but gets upset when people ask questions. Not very helpful if you dont understand the information,1
Such a great teacher. I've learned more in his classes than I have in anyone else's just from his real world experiences alone. You don't need the textbook and he gives you a study guide with exactly what will be on the exams. He is also willing to help you with interviewing and resumes any time you need. Would definitely take his class again.,1
I highly recommend taking Calculus 1 with Professor Kuhlman. He's a great guy that really makes the class enjoyable and his lectures are easy to follow along with. He's made the transition to online learning seamlessly compared to other professors. He's also very flexible in terms of assignment due dates and gives various resources to help you.,1
"This class contains  lots of participation and group projects.  Attendance really matters in her class, if you miss a lecture it is hard for you to pass this class.  The textbooks were used everyday for this class.  DR. Mark went out of her way to help anyone with any questions they may have.",1
"Professor Weis makes coming to class worth it. She knows how to keep your interest during a lecture with jokes and personally stories. Professor Weis makes her class very comfortable. She rather you participate a lot in class so that you won't have work to do out of class. She assigned a few journal entries, two papers, and one group project.",1
He was a good teacher who had very clear lectures. And students were encouraged to ask questions,1
"If you attend and pay attention on his lecture, you'll find no trouble of getting through the course. All of his lectures are 95% base on real life experience and text book use is very minor except for some necessary table requires to do home works. Otherwise, study all his notes and pass the class just a piece of cake.",1
"Very helpful and intelligent!!!  He makes you work hard, but he only does it because he wants you to succeed.  I hope to have him as a professor again!!",1
"I made a huge mistake taking Prf. Smith. She is nasty, sarcastic, doesn't give good feedback on papers, and is very unorganized. I should've stuck with my professor from last semester. Prf. Smith runs her class in an ""my way or no way"" kind of fashion. Do not take her, ever.",0
"Monika's a nice and caring prof. Every day in class is a bit meh, tho. We'd come in then she'd tell us to take out our travaux pratique then she'd literally call on us one by one to answer each response and it was a bit of a pain and boring. But she is nice and gives decent explanations. She is super willing to explain things outside of class!",1
"Dr. Carter is an amazing professor. He cares about his students and whether they understand the material. He is truly inspirational, and you will leave class motivated. His class will make you think about questions you don't want to face, but you need to. Overall, I strongly recommend him for any and all classes.",1
"I took plane trig and algebra with Rosin online. If you aren't very good at math I wouldn't recommend taking the classes online. I'm decent at math and was scrambling on some of the quiz reviews. That being said, he gives out reviews that are pretty similar to the actual quizzes. One or two were nowhere near the same for some reason. Decent choice.",1
I've taken Krutz in the past and always enjoyed his classes so nothing against him. Learned essentially nothing in this class though.,1
"Falcon was an amazing professor, he is very intense but will change the way you think about the world. And he really genuinely cares about all of his students, he will spend time outside of class to discuss class topics you may be unclear on. Falcon is open about who he is and makes real connections to students. Just do the homework, and reading.",1
"She's nice, understanding, and just wants you to participate and do your work.",1
"Had him for 153 and 181. Really good guy and professor. Hes very clear when lecturing and always asks if hes alright to move on. Gives lots of study tools and exam study guides. Hes always accessible and replies to messages promptly, and is always willing to meet via Zoom if you need help. Would HIGHLY recommend.",1
"Professor Guetter understands in his Fundamental Concepts class that no one is there for a math major. The final was optional and he gave us two class periods to finish our very small homework assignments. He made mathematics interesting for once. Sometimes I wished I was getting more for my money, but I got the credit without hassle, so.",1
"The experiments are quite interesting and I enjoyed working on them.  However, if you encounter some sort of issue, Prof Ho will be of ZERO help to you.  I dont think he spoke more than three times the entire semester.  Youll have fun working on his required 50 page lab reports - any less and he wont even consider giving you a grade above 80.",0
"Dr. Storslee is absolutely the best teacher I've had at PVCC. I love his teaching style, he's incredibly helpful, and he genuinely wants his students to succeed. He's always available to help, he's easy to talk to, and I love how he's so proud of his students. He's just an awesome teacher.",1
Teacher was really leniant and helpful in certain situations.,1
Mrs. V is one of the best teachers ive had at wake tech. She explains the concepts that will be on the test and the labs we completed were fun. Recommend her to all of my friends. Put forth a little bit of effort in this class and you can pull out a B if not an A.,1
"He teaches in Avery unique way, make sure to be attentive. Classes are fun and entertaining rather than being boring and dull lectures.  Easy course. Very conceptual, no memorization. Useful.",1
"He is one of those teachers that makes you go home and watch videos on the topics and learn yourself. Then after you do that he reviews it during class. I personally would rather have my teacher teach the criteria and then I will review it with the homework they give us. He is kind and can help with some homework, but wasnt the teacher for me.",0
Heather is an awesome professor. She is very clear tells you exactly what is on the exam. Doesn't test over the book only the notes. She compares to real life examples and makes it easier to understand material. Would definitely take her again if i got the option. Sometimes gives extra credit for attending lectures,1
She was the best Biology teacher I have ever had. She had a way of really making things clear and interesting.,1
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
"Do your homework, study guides, and read. He is passionate with the subject because he has worked in the field before teaching.",1
"Best professor I've had by a long shot. He's very clear and makes sure you understand the material before he moves on. He's always willing to give you extra help outside of class when he's there. If you pay attention and do the homework, the exams are a piece of cake.",1
very nice person!,1
"Test have no multiple choice and consist of an essay and all writing. There are 2 exams, and one essay. A VERY hard grader, but note taking is a life saver; don't take notes, don't pass. Before each class, you had a reading of about 20-30 pages followed by a quiz with very specific questions. Super fun, but hard class! Very caring person too!",1
LOVED him. He is awesome he just wants his students to succeed. I love him and have taken all my classes through him. Way to be the BEST trower!,1
She is very knowledgeable but her class is hard if you don't pay attention. Dr. Yamazaki seems like a kind professor. She goes by very fast when lecturing and her tests are very hard even if you study. Take this professor if you are willing to put in the work and like Biology. If you're just trying to fulfill the requirement try another professor.,1
"Definitely not a hard class/teacher. You just have to show up, do your homework, study and ask questions. Nothing super crazy though, easy A in my opinion.",1
"Sweetest prof out there! He makes stats really accessible to students who have no math/stats background and always provides example questions and past quizzes/exams so you know what to expect when you're tested. He's ALWAYS available for questions, and even had office hours on weekends because he genuinely wants his students to succeed.",1

"Take him over winter or summer and you will get to use cheat sheets. On those cheat sheets put all of your hw mngr problems and step by step how to do them. Learn to use your calculator. Tests are 1/2 homework type problems MC answer and 1/2 theory MC. Its not easy, but I like finance, I got an A, most people got C's. He doesnt explain that well.",1
"He's interesting to listen to, but gives uber-hard tests.",0
"Professor Calkins was one of my favorite English teachers I've ever had. Her homework is really easy and tolerable. Once it gets into writing the research paper, she assigns more writing assignments which is where time management is key. She wants to see her students succeed and will always be there to help. Gives great extra credit opportunities!",1
My adviser would not let me drop the class. All he did was rant about conspiracies and the government. He briefly went over material before announcing that we had a test on it the next class. I love music and he made me hate the class. I was extremely disappointed that he gets paid to not teach.,0
"This is the worst teacher ever.  He not only puts the program to shame, he also puts the fire service to shame. Makes many mistakes. Has multiple incorrect answers on tests. Doesn't give feedback and so on. If you are looking to become a firefighter, please do not take him.",0
AWESOME Teacher!!!! EXTREMELY helpful and always willing to help!! UNDERSTANDING too!!! I RECOMMEND ANY OF HIS CLASSES!!,1
"I had her for students with special needs and, although she is really nice and helpful, there was a lot of work for the class.  Everyone was confused and stressed out throughout the whole process.  She's a great teacher and really accommodating, but be prepared for tons of work, and be on top of it!",1
Boyles is an amazing teacher! There is a lot of group assignment work but he also makes sure all the books he assigns are pretty cheap! He wants to help people succeed!! He has a couple of important papers & a final that is easy if you have a big imagination. Take this class & really engage with this guy if you want to learn anything & keep an A.,1
"I've taken Intro to Psych., Stress Management Psych., and now Abnormal Psych. with Professor Trombley. She is particular about what she expects from students but it's nothing unreasonable, you simply have to read instructions carefully. I love that she quizzes weekly because I am able to retain more info this way. Take her class, its great.",1
This class was alot of fun. He makes the lectures fun to listen to and easy join. Tell lots of stories that relate to the topic at hand. He's there to teach not too grade so showing up and participating are a sure way to pass yhe class with an A or B.,1
Hands down best professor I've ever had. Pretty hard material but Professor Northrup was amazing at responding and helping you through at any time- even 2am. Hard tests but if you show you care about his class he helps you. I'm normally a B student but because of the amount of extra time he spent helping me learn material out of class got me an A.,1
No Comments,1
SHE IS VERY GOOD AND UNDERSTANDING.,1
"worst prof ever, doesn't want to help students, makes everything so difficult for students, stay away",0
VERY knowledgeable economist. If you dont understand something speak up because hell clarify. Exams are difficult but only because theres a lot of content covered for only a midterm and a final. You will definitely learn a lot. Also his discussion board entries can definitely boost your grade but dont procrastinate them.,1
I have very few good things to say to her besides the fact that she is nice. Her teaching is reading off a PowerPoint and her tests ask the most obscure and irrelevant questions that are not important Big picture questions. When half the class was struggling through with the pandemic she just said suck it up and would not offer much help.,0
all im gonna say is that the mean exam scores were in the low 40's for the ENTIRE CLASS. Highest was in the 50's.,0
"Ive been doing great throughout the semester, but then he has had us study our two last assignments and study the answer key. The 50% midterm was based almost entirely on those two assignments. Frustrating that if i didn't understand something after doing well consistently i will suffer heavily for it.",0
"Serpell is a kind and thoughtful mentor. She welcomes student input to her classes, and she's really responsive and helpful in office hours. I really loved taking classes with her because I feel like she really values our ideas. Would recommend; it's a not an easy A, but totally achievable if you are willing to do the work, and you learn a lot!",1
"Dr. Yamazaki is a very knowledgeable teacher and knows the information she is teaching. Occasionally she has a hard time putting the information into understandable terminology instead of bio/physio jargon. She will help her students as much as she can, but you need to put in the work and asks questions if you have them",1
She is literally the sweetest! She really cares about her student's success and during quarantine she would so many times extend the due date for assignments! She gives good feed back and her lecture videos are very informational and clear. She gives a lot of chances for extra credit which is nice. I wish she taught SPAN 1103 as well:/,1
Love his extra credit questions this mans hilarious. Always on time and knows answers that you ask him.,1
"I love Quinlan! He's so awesome and fun and his stories really help you understand what he is teaching! He is very funny and he gives out a lot of extra credit points on tests if you speak up in class. You are rewarded for being a well rounded student in his class. Talk to him about sports, he'll love you.",1
"Isabelle was wonderful! She was my lab instructor for this class. The lab assignments are tedious and the 4% is hardly worth the 12 hours you need to invest into assignments, but Isabelle was great. I reached out to her a few times throughout the term and she was always willing to help. She wanted to see us succeed!",1
always helped me when i asked...easygoing,1
"Amazing teacher, truly loves his job",1
Such a sweet lady. really patient with her students and takes her time with whatever you may need help with. Easier than all of the other A&P lab teachers meaning no hidden tricks or surprises on the tests!! everything is straight forward from what she gives you and its all the easy basic material. Easier class to pass!!,1
It's a so so class. I would not take it again though. Too much writing,0
"Best teacher I have ever had. You will have no problem as long as you read the material, do the work, and show up for class. I highly recommend his course !",1
"Professor Ikegwuonu is a very nice woman. Often times, she goes off on irrelevant spiels and forgets what she's lecturing about. The book is trivial as long as you take good lecture notes. I gave her a 4 for difficulty because the tests sometimes do not follow the lectures making them hard. There''s one 10-page research paper, worth 35%.",1
Never again.,0
"Easy class and he managed to make something boring, fun. Our class got a ""Christmas Present"" which was not having to do the final exam. As long as you do the listenings and read the textbook (maybe 30 minutes of homework after each class at most) it's an easy A.",1
"Sometimes kind of dry, but actually found some lecture pretty interesting. He is a stickler for attendance. Also, only one online final at the end. Would take him again",1
I just loved this woman i had to take her class twice. Actually i failed the first time but it was so great i was able to take it over with her.,1
"Jerome is a great teacher, everything is online and gives you 2 chances on everything. If you do the homework you will get an easy A. The best Calc teacher Ive ever had. He teaches business Calculus and knows his stuff! Very integrated teacher and respects everyone. If you struggle with math you need to take Mr. Caldwells class!",1
"I never wanted to ditch class because she was so amazing! She's so sweet and nice in office hours! Gives super clear, and easy to follow lectures on very difficult subject matter. Always insightful, fun, chose some amazing books, and always incorporated other critic's thoughts aside from her own. She is one of the best professors I've ever had.",1
"One of the best teachers I've had regardless of level. He makes class a joy to go to. Flexible on when the midterms are and he really encourages class discussions. He's also funny as hell, not a class goes by that's not entertaining. Very quotable too.",1
"Ostermeyer has the class set up so that you can only fail if you don't read attentively and consistently work. While there are quite a bit of readings, essays, and quizzes, though they are short. Many lectures recap readings, which will be useful. I'd recommend doing the readings first, then watch and note lectures.",1
"This man is painfully awful. He is super sarcastic and when asked a questions he will revert it and at as if it is a comedy club. Even though no one will laugh he still sticks to his act. Not very good at teaching at all, flies through content and the whole class gets low scores on quizzes. Awful professor, would not recommend.",0
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, by one of the best professors I've ever had. frustrated with the workload for just one credit, but ended up being worth it for the valuable information. Tough grader, not flexible with lateness. But she did care very much about her students success. Don't take if you aren't prepared to work hard.",1
This is a great class. As long as you call in for the weekly conference calls he pretty much gives you the answers. Very flexible & will work with you if you need an extension on an assignment. Very responsive to emails and questions. I would take more classes from him. I didn't like law before I took this class but now I am making law my focus.,1
"One of the best professors in the psychology department! He is so inspirational, and knows what he's talking about. I really enjoyed taking behavioral psych with him. Take him!",1
"He thinks he knows everything, he kept interrupting me when I was doing my presentation. I felt embarrassed as he kept interrupting and he I ask him a question, he wont' answer it right.",0
I really enjoyed her class and we always had very interesting class discussions.,1
Chandra was my professor for several classes during my undergrad. He was always very helpful and willing to go the extra mile to assist students. His intermediate and advanced physics labs were all very interesting and gave me experience relevant to my career after University.,1
"Super kind, extremely helpful, and really cares about his student's success. Dr. Knapp teaches multiple music classes, and is very knowledgeable about the material. He is excellent at accommodating his students to give them the best possible chance to succeed, and is always available for extra help if you need it. Definitely take his classes!",1
"Nothing. Not only did she give me attitude on the first day of the semester, but also falsely accused me and a classmate who is also my best friend of cheating on an exam, by asking us what's up about our scantrons in front of the entire class. I have never felt so humiliated and disrespected by anybody like this ever.",0
"You leave class everyday confused and learn absolutely nothing. You're expected to know what he left off after class. Relies HEAVILY on MyMathLab Homework assingments, which only boosts up your grade by one point. (Don't miss a day on them, it will drop your grade badly!!) Try not to fail any of the four tests, will bomb your grade.",0
"This Professor is super nice and transparent with what she requires. Put your best foot forward and you should be fine grade wise :) Do all the work in a timely manner (8 week classes are hasty & tedious, but well worth the time saved) and again, with your best effort, and you should get an A no problem :) She is very kind and easy to work with.",1
"Dr. Besing is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's always willing to help you outside of class, and while his classes are a lot of work, you'll get a lot out of them if you're willing to do it. His lectures are very high value, and really worth attending. His sense of humor is unique, but he can be funny. Occasionally.",1
"Gail is an absolutely wonderful teacher. She's straightforward, authentic, and very knowledgeable. She doesn't let you slide but she will do everything she can to help you succeed and understand the purpose behind assignments. She personally checks in on all of her students in a way that lets you know she's invested personally and professionally.",1
"He is absolutely awesome! He's very understanding and down to earth. The class was very opininated and sometimes it got very tense, but he always knew how to calm things down and put us back on track. I loved his class!",1
"Dr. Ferriera was a great English Teacher, especially for a student just returning to college after a four year break. I loved her class, and I would definitely take it again. She is very helpful, if you have a question, ask it! She is very enthused about her subject as well. If you study and do your homework, this class goes by very smoothly! ",1
Lab with Prof Stevenson is the best! She is VERY clear about what she expects you to know for the test. She goes around and quizzes you during each unit which was super helpful. She always makes sure there is extra time the week before a test to review anything you want from the lesson. Use your time wisely in her class and you will be fine.,1
"Steven Stovall is hands down my favorite college professor I've ever had. Not only are his classes not mandatory, but as long as you read your textbook occasionally and participate in your group projects you will do just fine. I would 10/10 recommend Stovall.",1
"Professor Wiley is a great teacher! Follow his syllabus and you will do well. He goes out of his way to explain things and will help you with your assignments before you turn them in. If you have him as an option, definitely take him!",1
"He is a nice professor, very helpful,his exams are hard but his purpose is to make students think and feel challenged so they could learn. he gives H.w and pop quizzes and they r easy since they r after the homework due date. Dont worry about the grade , just study hard and u will get a good grade A+ prof",1
Avoid taking him. He failed me. I took Calculus 1. He expect the students should know everything. He just write notes on board and expects students to know everything.,0
"Dr. Gilyard is an awesome, albeit intimidating scholar. He is knowledgeable about his content and doesn't mind sharing his wisdom gleaned throughout the years. He is a hardworking professor who can, at times, appear hard/harsh, but I assure you his classes will not disappoint. He's a great school/teacher, someone I truly look up to.",1
He is the best.  He rocks.  I could honestly listen to him talk for hours.  I wish all profs were like him.,1
"I had her for math 108 online, it could be very stressful at times, but she was always a phone call or email away. She helped me a lot, I felt like I actually understood the material & she wanted to see me do well. All the endless nights of homework/quizzes/tests paid off!",1
Great professor. Lets you wear hats in class and use laptops.,1
"Great teacher! Very knowledgeable, you will learn a lot if you are interested. BIG group project for the second half of the semester. Overall his class is fairly easy, but pay attention because it's useful information for any business/management major.",1
"Kathleen is a gem. So kind and truly care about her students. The class is very simple and you actually USE THE THINGS YOU LEARN!! My resume and cover letter greatly improved and I have used the cover letter i wrote for class multiple times, just changing it a bit for each job. If you are struggling just show her you care and she will be help you!",1
"Murtuza cares for his students and tries his best, but will leave you a little confused at times. But if you ask him a question he will happily clear things up. He gives you packets every class and yes you will have to teach yourself, but its manageable. His reviews for the midterm and final are key to doing well STUDY THEM! 2 easy projects too.",1
"Great Guy- Cares about his athletes. Relates to his students and makes 2 hour lectures based on ""Micro-Economics"" actually interesting and bearable to sit through.",1
"Chris was a great professor who I would take class with again. He is truly passionate about teaching, his class is very interactive from day 1. Three major group projects that are easy yet fun. easy midterm and no final if you compete every assignment and show up every day.",1
The lectures are boring but that was expected considering it was a Gen Ed bio class.  I always felt aware of what material would be on the tests. There are a few hwk assignments.  He seems like a really nice guy and i would recommend him for the bio 101 class. If you study for the tests you should have no problem passing the class.,1
"This class is extremely easy. All the homework is online and you can do it as many times as you would like. The actual class time is a lot of youtube and reading the vocabulary words in the specific chapter, so not very helpful. You really have to teach yourself. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy.",0

"Ms. Gordon will work with you and she explain the work.  IF you do not show up for class she will drop you,(makes room for the ones that want to learn). Very easy going and I have her for all my math.",1
He is an old school prof - his lectures are all talk with minimal overhead slides. He talks at a reasonable pace and tends to say the same thing a few different ways so you have time to write down the important stuff. There isn't a topic in econ that this guy doesn't know about. One of the smartest people I've met at U of G.,1
"Mr. Trower was very pleasant,  he went through presentations slowly, which for a person who is not good at math is awesome.  He was extremely helpful and met with me on occasions to help me understand and he did so in a nice manner! If I could take him again I would! Such a sweet man! ",1
"She is the best chemistry professor. She replaces your lowest exam scores with your final. Her lectures are really good. She gives you lots of opportunity for practice. Take her, and do some practice problems you can pass her class with 100%",1
"Very good professor. The material in the course is very abstract and the recommended 10 hours a week is accurate if you really want to understand what it is you're doing. He gives you a really clear idea what is going to be on the tests and what is expected for assignments. The class is HARD, but it has nothing to do with the way he teaches it.",1
"Dr. Nguyen was my favorite professor I've ever had! He's really the only professor in philosophy who made me read the texts, which is pretty rare in the philosophy department. He will make you work hard, but in the end, you'll know so much more than when you first walked into his class. If you truly want to learn philosophy, he's the one for you.",1
Good class overall,1
"I must be honest. After the first week,  I thought I made a grave mistake on taking her class. However, college is supposed to be easy. Dr. Northam's weekly discussions makes you tap into your critical thinking skills. She provides  great feedback that is straightforward and the truth. If you really want to learn about business, take this class.",1
Prof. Guzzone was the man....he was very knew a ton of good stuff about an interesting subject....always had sweet music playing when you walked through the door.,1
"covers a lot of material and requires a lot of reading but she's a really good teacher. at first i was worried about her tests that are in essay form, but they're not bad and i got an A- in the class. i'd definitely take her again.",1
"I would recommend, anyone taking accounting to take his class. I had never done accounting before and this was my first class related to accounting. He gives a  lot of homework for each chapter he does. If you wanna succeed in his class attend all his classes and do the homework and you are set. Great teacher. Explains material really well. Helpful",1
"David was interesting. I mean he was a good teacher for sure! But if you disagree with his liberal views, you may as well just drop the class. He makes you read a lot, there have only been 2 essays, no tests, no quizzes. I would take him again, heres my advice for an A in his class, fake it till you make it.",1
If you're taking this class for a gen ed then don't take it because it is a lot of work and projects for a gen ed. It's an interesting class and I would recommend it because it's enjoyable but it's a lot more work than I expected.,1
He is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors you'll ever meet. His grading is very fair. The exams aren't bad considering you can use a notes sheet. There's lots of Iclickers so you have to show up to class. There's no book used. Take this class its fun and interesting!,1
I took Alisa for math 108 and from the very beginning found her very hard to stay interested.  She was very monitone.  She also rarely worked problems on the board unless asked.  I went from 2 prior classes with an A to having to withdraw from her class.  I would NEVER recommend her to anyone.  She is super nice though but that's all I can say.,0
"Great professor! He knows his material well. His tests can be a bit lenghty, but they are doable. The jokes are one of the best parts of the class.",1
"If you've taken an AP calculus class before, go ahead and take him as a professor. If this your first time ever seeing calc before, stay away.",0
3 things: Physio- study a day before test. anatomy study- 2/3 days before. Physio-use powerpoints/ and chp. summaries. make sure to understand everything on study guide. Easy class idk y ppl dont do well.,1
Tam is really chill. No midterms No final. Just some class quizzes. I hear she used to be really hard but she has calmed down a lot and I loved the class. It was fun.,1
"Professor Heilman is a super passionate and very knowledgeable professor. I learned a lot from her class because her lectures were interesting and attention-grabbing. For a 100 level class, this course had a lot more homework than I expected. That said, all the homework was graded very fairly and it is easy to do well if you watch lectures",1
Prof Infante is both an adorable person and a fabulous professor.  He listens to his students and makes time to meet at least once during the semester with each student in the class. He make required material interesting and understandable. I furthered my Spanish significantly in the 2 semesters in his classes. SPAN 307 & 334.,1
"Though her class is lecture heavy, she is very good at teaching. She draws out a bunch of diagrams to help you understand. The only reason why people don't pass this course is they don't memorize/study/put in the effort. I took this in the summer for 5 weeks. ASK HER FOR HELP!!! She's really nice. Thank you Dr. Yamazaki!! I learned so much!!",1
"has a grading contract that guarantees an A as long as you do the assignments and show up to class. it's a really fun class and you talk about real-life, modern issues and then write about it. 2 papers and lots of discussion board posts and a final project. you can get an A+ if you go to 3 asu events as well.",1
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
Claudine is the best instructor I could have asked for in a mental health rotation where I didn't know what to expect. She is so supportive and not the least bit intimidating! If you show her you genuinely care about your patients she will love you. She truly just wants you to succeed and makes you so comfortable. Wish I could have her again!,1
"Took her in the summer and she was great! The enviorment and vibe is awesome in her class.  You do lots of class interaction and she makes it fun!  Do your work and ask quesitons, she's very smart and helpful.  She's also very understanding but at the end of the day you're in charge ofyourself. strongly reccomend! ",1
do not recommend her,0
It's a shame this man is a professor for the prerequisite classes. He seems so unhappy teaching 2D and 3D which transfers into our class environment. If you are not conceptual or performative do not expect him to like your work. I see him discouraging many future artists which is very disappointing. Do not take him if you have the option.,0
I took two sessions of her class and they were both two of the most exciting classes I have ever taken in my life!!  Linda Besemer is a Genius and extremely generous with her time and patience.,1
There is a lot of reading to do however the topics are generally pretty interesting. His lectures are very long though (3 hours) and so they are pretty hard to sit through because he goes on a lot of tangents and makes simple points very convoluted. You're better off just reading and not listening to lectures.,1
"All the stories about him are true as this was my most traumatic academic experience. I literally had to study every day, especially when he might spring a pop quiz on us. Lectures were hard to follow, since he went too fast when using powerpoint slides. His english is incomprehensible at times (achume?). Shockingly helpful during his office hours.",0
"she is a good professor, really specific and caring about her students. If you want to learn how to play piano and you have not taken any lesson before she will be really helpful. For those people that already play she will give a lot of work, not just playing but looking to achieve perception in your pieces. Highly Recommended!!!!!",1
"Very time restricted exams online, has habit of not unlocking assignments on time",0
"I truly enjoyed Dr. Ortegas class. Not only did I learn a lot, but I was also inspired by his passion for what he teaches. If you want to learn and enjoy a biology course, then take Dr. Ortega! Make sure you go to class as well!! Tests come straight from lectures and powerpoints.",1
"Portfleet is such a nice professor and is hilarious! She goes on and on when she tells stories and always let my class out sooo early. She is so passionate about what she teaches, but I do not think I learned one thing in her class.",1
"Super nice guy, he is always available to help and is nice about it. Not too much work and the assignments are explained well. Lectures can be boring but he tries to bring his instruments for entertainment so it is not all lecture.",1
Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Very inefficient and unclear lectures. Don't think he actually knows the material very well himself. Test questions seem easy but it's impossible to predict what he will demand in terms of answers.,0
"Professor was great. Do the extra credit. Test are base on power points, class info, and the book. You have to purchase the book. Test can be tricky, but most answers are found on the power point. Great class to take if you have kids or you deal with kids on a daily basis. Everyone should be required to take this class.  You can get an A or B.",1
He doesnt have a good online class system.,1
"She is very nice and grades fairly. There are a lot of papers, but nothing too difficult.",1
"Not a hard class when it came to subject matter, but the semester-long group project she assigned was ridiculous. Impossible to coordinate, instructions for the group assignments were very unclear, and she didn't care about our life outside her classroom, making us complete endless hours of outside work. Have a job or taking other classes? AVOID.",1
"The course could have been structured better since 5 percent of your grade for each module was riding on a 20 question quiz. However, I feel like this difficulty is made up since she offered quite a lot of bonus marks (3.5%). The lecture notes were great but if you want a high grade (A or above) you will need to work for it.",1
"He will give pop quizzes if no one shows up to class, so attend every class. Make sure to do well on the first few tests because they do get more difficult towards the end! The homework for this course takes a lot of time to complete but turn in all assignments and you will be fine. Hes really nice and easy to talk to if you ever have questions.",1
"Super hard for a CORE class, cool guy but VERY high expectations.",1
she just hands out A's,0
Attended 3 weeks of lecture and then resorted to the homework website to learn everything. Reads out of the book and is very hard to follow. I took this class online and his hand writing was unreadable.,0
Excellent professor!,1
"I would never want to take this professor again. I took a 100 level class and it required so much work! I wrote at least 12 papers and had to do a 15 minute presentation with a group. Very boring lectures, assigns a lot of homework, tough grader, and assignments weren't explained very well at all. I do NOT recommend this professor at all!!",0
loved her! Gives everything you need to pass her course. definitely go to the supplemental instruction courses! I earned a B in the course but because I went to multiple SI sessions she bumped it to a B+,1
"Really fun guy! As long as you study the textbook and do all of your assignments, you'll get a good grade. Very understanding and makes long classes interesting with his examples. Offers really nice extra credit opportunities too!",1
Pretty whack professor. Class is basically unrelated to the homework which is from the book and the book is easily as whack as the professor himself. Very unclear about everything and the exams are brutal.,0
One of the best professor in University at Albany,1
Dr. Adell es un gran profesora! You should definitely take her class whether you are a beginner or intermediate. She is always extremely helpful and wants her students to learn and succeed. She is very enthusiastic and fun to watch too!,1
"ECON 227 was a train wreck on the administration side (lost exams, grades never coming back, etc.), but KMack cares a lot about his students. If you go to class and put in enough practice before his exams, you're very likely to get an A (plus you get to hear his awesome bagpipe playing at the end of each semester :D ).",1
"He completely killed any passion I had for Math. I went into this class excited to progress my Math learning, and he shriveled up my dreams like a raisin in the sun. I cant tell you enough DO NOT TAKE HIM, you WILL fail. This is not a challenge, please save yourself  He's got an alright sense of humor though BUT do not take him.",0
"He is super funny and I enjoy going to this class. He only assigns a midterm and a final, which are in forms of take home essays.  He makes class interesting, I recommend taking.",1
Falk makes his class unnecessarily difficult. He gives homework on topics that haven't even been mentioned in class until after the homework is due and these topics are not in the textbook he recommended. He runs the class like a graduate class and will spend all your time on his class. He is very understanding about life circumstances though.,0
He really knows his stuff. He doesn't just teach the material but he helps you understand things about the economy that you will carry into your adult life. Just make sure you READ THE BOOK before class or you will be completely lost. He gives a week to complete each homework assignment which is more than enough. Tests aren't too bad if you study.,1
"It's true that she is sweet, but what's best about her is her ability to teach. I learned the core aspects of essay writing in her class. She goes over everything she expects and has great exercises for the class. I owe the A I received on my midterm for English 1A to Professor Fujimoto whom I took for English 111.",1
"A great teacher to learn economics from. Good lectures with a few good jokes thrown in to help you remember the topic. Simple coursework that, while weekly, never is too hard, and you always have Flannery to talk to if you need help. He will walk you through it and make sure you can understand even some of the crazier topics.",1
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
"Very straightforward and relaxed lecture style. He is also very responsive to emails. Tests are fair and usually based on notes/homework/labs. The labs can be challenging, so be sure you get a good group! Would highly recommend this professor; he has been one of my favorites.",1
"Take this guy's classes.  i took 2 of them, tough but a blast.  I actually learned something.....I think",1
"Prof. Peterson is such a sweet & soft-spoken lady. She wants everybody to do well & learn alot. The lectures, weekly quizzes & 2 papers all stem from the textbook! It's fun because you get to choose your research topic, but they are time-consuming papers! So START EARLY! (She does walk you through the entire process tho, so don't stress!) :)",1
Absolutely love her! I have never enjoyed an English class until now. Be ready to participate in lecture but Dr. Bland is the best prof I have EVER had. 10/10 a queen I am genuinely sad that I wont have her anymore. If you ever get the opportunity to take her class DO IT!,1
Erickson might be the best bio professor I've had. His lectures make a lot of sense and I actually feel like I understand the core concepts of molecular biology now. The material is hard but the final is easy and you should easily do well if you study. Make sure you take advantage of his lectures and actually learn the stuff. Great professor!,1
"I cannot stress how horrible this professor is. He will leave you hopeless and confused. Even with the copious amounts of tutoring I attended nothing could have prepared me for those horrid exams. Save your money, save your time, and save your enthusiasm for an actual professor. Avoid at all costs, even delay your graduation. Its worth it.",0
"She doesnt respond to any emails, takes forever to grade, and doesnt consider that were in a PANDEMIC. Her grading was tough and she wasnt lenient at all. Take it at another school dont put yourself through the stress and mental deterioration. Disappointed because I had heard so many good things about her when classes were in person.",0
"Professor Benjamin really does mean well. This class is very lecture heavy and I didn't really understand them. However, the material can be learned if you put the work in. I strongly recommend going to the Math Lab to get additional help. Make sure to do the extra practice problems as they are very similar to the test. He really cares :)",1
"Terrible professor. Only professor that offers the management specific courses, and they're all online. I wanted to take in person. I know what you're thinking, online is easier right? Absolutely not. He makes them so hard in that he grades everything so tough. TONS OF WORK. Then he gives exams that are so hard and cover 4 chapters at once.",0
Excellent Professor! Gives very good feedback and amazing lectures. Dr Gueye is always willing to help students. Would definitely recommend him. ,1
"Mrs. Myers is committed to seeing her students succeed! She is happy to answer anyone's questions in class & gives plenty of reminders about MyMathLab HW and Quizzes. She is energetic about math, often nerding out over the cool higher-math stuff we ""don't get to learn"". Willing to chat after class, & VERY responsive to email. Generous EC on tests.",1
Alisa is an amazing teacher. She explains things very clearly and works through problems step-by-step. She is willing to work with students both inside and outside of class and puts a lot of time into her lessons. I would recommnd Alisa's class to everyone!,1
"Professor Judge teaches at Trinity College now, but I felt that it needed to be said, how great of a professor he is. His lectures were super clear and if anyone had questions, he would go back and explain in detail (sometimes, he even emailed a summary of the question in confusion). I would definitely take another class with him; it was enjoyable.",1
"Dr. Pringle taught the second half of the course, focusing on fungi, diversity of life, and plant life cycles and biomes. It was her first semester teaching any class. She can be quite out of touch with the students sometimes. The things she presents as interesting and hyped up just are not. She asks belittling questions that nobody responds to.",1
"Ayland is an amazing teacher. He cares about the students, and is clear on grading criteria. He wants students to learn the material, and really puts lots of energy into the course. Highly recommend.",1
"He is a respectable professor, and his lectures are very meticulous. If you have any questions, he will answer them patiently. In short, he is a great professor.",1
"Pawkett is a guitar GOD.  If you're willing to learn, he will teach, and teach you well.  Prepare to laugh, cry, and play guitar like you never have before.  Take any of his classes, and I promise you, they will be your favorites of your college career.",1
"Dr. Andertons class is super easy if you know computer basics. Homework is heavy but predictable, as its all based in the simulation software. Monday due dates were nice, and assignments could be completed in an hour or two. She offers weekly virtual class meetings (non-mandatory) to cover the material, but prepare to use the online book.",1
"Amazing Prof overall, If I could take all of my math classes with him at Delta I would because he was way better than the other calculus professors there. Optional homework and exam prep guides that match almost directly with the exam he gives, make his class pretty easy. If you just study for the exams guaranteed B. Very approachable and involved.",1
"Leikind is a really nice guy, just a boring class. The final is worth 30% and it's difficult. Also, he keeps you in class very late. Wouldn't recommend registering for a class immediately after his.",1
"Such a sweet lady! Kind woman, definitely recommend. Not too difficult of a grader, but very reasonable and helpful.",1
really good teacher,1
Thought this class would be sooo easy but then there was a professor change up. Richard really cares about what he's talking about but this class was not easy by any means. The material was confusing for non physical scientists but you don't have to go to class though. I had to P/NP but didn't have to do much work.,1
"Smart and genuine.  Some of the material was a bit dry, but she helped make it interesting.  I would take any class from her.",1
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"The course itself was easy and interesting, but the prof made it difficult as some of the material discussed would be completely different from the quizzes.  I enjoyed the class but not the prof who taught it.",0
"Brooke has a reputation on campus for the best Trig teacher out there. She is the best! If you struggle with the math she will help one on one. You must attend all lectures to stay on track. She always wants to help every student succeed. Yes I only got a high B but if you work hard, she admires you and helps you. She inspires you to keep going.",1
"I love Professor McIver!  She is awesome!  She tries to make it as easy as possible to learn a second language, and she's super helpful.  She does use the book & the website a lot, and there's a fair bit of homework, but the tests are usually pretty easy & she drops the lowest grade.  She's a really good teacher, take if you actually want to learn.",1
Doesn't know how to teach or do the examples he shows. Jumps all over the place. Constantly says umm and uhh.,0
"Thad is a fantastic person.  Unfortunately he has a very time consuming day job, therefore it takes forever to get your tests/quizzes/labs graded and back to you.   If you don't mind this he is really funny and makes the class fun and labs are really interesting.  He is also lenient on turning in things late and always making up tests late.",1
"Regret missing one class because I was totally behind after. She is so organized, stays on schedule, syllabus helps, SO ORGANIZED, I cannot stress this enough. Nice, smart, challenges argumentative thinking. Like 2 homework mostly worked on 3 main debates/speeches. If you enjoy Coms you'll love it.",1
"ART course 121, 122, 221, and signed up for 222. Doug Domine is an excellent teacher; willing to work with people, great with critique when you ask, will push your skills, and generally has fairly fun and amusing class atmospheres. He's definitely a teacher you don't have to worry about approaching for any questions or concerns. Highly recommended.",1
"Dr. Polster is brilliant.  She is very helpful through the process and beyond. The material is no cakewalk and she is well aware of that fact.  Her raw intelligence can be intimidating at times, but her personality is warm and her demeanor is kind.  She even shows restraint in dealing with stubborn ignorance.  If the opportunity arises, do it.",1
Mehmeti was magnificent. I took this class as an elective and because I figured it would be an easy A. I took a lot out of the class and actually learned about Music History. I enjoyed taking it in the summer because there are many free concerts the city offers and attending 3 concerts is mandatory for this class. Take him!,1
"Ezell is awesome! He allows 6 unexcused absences per semester which is definitely doable, but he does give pop quizzes to ensure attendance stays up. The quizzes are straight from class work and the tests are straight from the quizzes! Super easy to get an A in if you keep up with your quizzes and review them before each test!!",1
"Very fair in regards to grading and course load. Has average expectations of his students. Not overwhelmingly difficult, but there is work. You can't just show up and pass.",1
"A perfectly decent professor, but the same can't be said of her as a human being. Spent an introduction to Criminal Procedure berating an entire class for their uniformly poor performance on the Criminal Law exam rather than placing the blame on herself as the testmaker and arbitrary grader.",1
"Dr Mensah is the Professor Ojelade of the Poli Sci Department, but actually nice and respected. His classes are GOD easy, as you only have to do the test and he reuses the same test that he's created since he first made the class. However, as said, he is very kind and funny and that alone made me want to come to class as he doesn't check attendance",1
She makes learning a foreign language fun & interesting. I learned so much from her class through her teaching & study abroad experiences. I took an extra semester of Spanish just because she was the professor. She is AWESOME!!!!!!!,1
He's is a really nice guy but his class is way too hard. The quizzes are doable but his tests are impossible if you are not a naturally born history person. I was a 4.0 student in high school and ended up with a C in the class (my only C). Avoid his class if possible but if you must take his class DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES.,0
I am white and not a bit ashamed of it.  Dr. Fontenot's class was the only class I got an A in all year.  I got A's on all my papers.,1
He is definitely quirky and I found him to be quite funny. As long as you study his lectures and the definitions from the book you should have no problem. I think he's a good professor. ,1
"to the prev. rater: i suggest you pay attention in lecture as well as read the text. 1/3 questions from each...the other 1/3 are random, educated guesses needed..not too hard to pull at least a B. curve is insane",0
"um ummmm ummm um um um.... this is all I would hear in lectures. He can sound intelligent but at the same time also sounds like he is just reading the pp. again he says um so much the class started to keep count, up into the 700s....",0
"He is an amazing professor. Very knowledgeable. I took Engl250 short semester with him and it wasn't pretty. Have to admit despite him being nice, his also a tough grader. Very strict when it comes to homework submission. He also has a sense of caring. I would only recommend to take his class if you are looking for a challenge. If not don't.",1
Dana is awesome! She is extremely helpful and understanding.,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER FOR HONORS DISCUSSION. As funny and sophisticated and intelligent as she is, I got absolutely nothing out of this class.  She asks too many questions during discussion, and no one knows how to answer them.  When a student tries to ask a question, it never gets answered.  She is a pretty fair paper grader, but this class was awful.",0
"Dowding is funny and knowledgeable, but he is an extremely tough grader. He cold calls throughout the class and can be condescending at times. It doesn't matter how much time or effort you put it, he will still grade harshly.",0
"DON'T BELIEVE THESE COMMENTS! I had Prof. Podewell last semester in a 3 hour segment. He really keeps the class laid back. He takes his classes outside on occasion, releases you early, and gives you enough supplementary notes in class to make the tests doable. Having said this, READ THE BOOK. If you don't, you'll fail every test. Great prof, guy.",1
"Favorite Teacher by far, super easy to learn from and will help you with anything.  Highly recommend taking her class",1
"Never take this professor. He lets you have a page for exams to write down anything you want, but it doesnt help because tests are designed to confuse you, my class avg for the 1st test was a 28% and the extra credit offered due to this was hrs worth of hw for a max of 2%. No point going to class because you usually will spend the time watching TV.",0
"Best English professor I've ever dealt with! She is such a sweetheart, and she is very understanding. Her work is at a timely manner, she doesn't assign too much like others, and she is very communicative! If you have an issue she will gladly talk with you about it and help you resolve it. I would take her over again if needed to.",1
Does not fully answer questions and has a very thick accent that is super hard to understand at times. Asked questions multiple times that received no answer because he didn't know how to answer and often diverted away from the question. I would definitely NOT recommend please take someone else if you can. ,0
The content of this course is very interesting but unfortunately the prof for this course makes it hard to find interesting. Plus she makes the midterms worth 45% of your grade with nothing in between to fix your grade if your screw up. Plus there are many slides and not enough time for notes on each bring a camera and lots of memory or dont takeit,0
"Dr. Ghosh is truly a great prof. She is caring, kind, & helpful. She is accessible by phone, email, Skype, & FaceTime. Her online course is very organized with clear instructions. You will have 1 on-campus exam, 12 quizzes, 4 reflections, 1 project, & extra credit. The book is required. Honestly, this class is an easy A.",1
"This class made me actually regain a liking for math. Great professor - clear teaching, really breaks down problems, reviews for exams, answers questions after class. It's not an easy subject - homework takes about 4 hours to complete, but once you get into it, it's formulaic. You should make an A as long as you study the formulas & attend lectures",1
"Amazing professor. Everyday she brought food for the class. But besides this, she took the time to read my essay and fix them. She offered to come to school on a non class day just to sit with anyone who wanted help with their final essays. This is a professor that will help you succeed if you want to succeed.",1
"He is a very nice person and had some fun lectures, but the tests are way different from the lectures. The first exam had an average of like 68% and that was because his quizzes, lectures, homework, and honestly even the book don't truly prepare you well enough for the exams. He scratches the surface and expects you to dive deeper. Seems flipped.",1
"Patti is one of my favorite teachers here. She's kind, helpful and very understanding. It's so easy to talk to her and I have had no problem asking for extensions on assignments. I would definitely take one of her classes again and recommend you take her class.",1
"Assignments due every Sunday. The ppts were posted from the beginning to take notes and the textbook had so many resources to help practice. He was quick to respond to emails, sent many reminders, and helped me out a lot esp during covid-19. He's amazing & wants the best for every student and as long as you study you will get the grade you deserve.",1
"Professor Schlorrt was a great teacher. He is a bit of a tough grader, but it helps you in the long run. His classes are very interesting, don't be afraid to ask questions. He is more than willing to help you before or after class, you just have to put the time and effort in. Keep up with the reading, and take good notes to pass the class!",1
"This textbook was written by him, so he always makes reference to it in class. Quizzes every week based entirely on the textbook chapter with 5 written questions you're given beforehand (which you answer 3 of in the quiz) and 14-15 multiple choice. Super easy if you do the work. 1 midterm, 1 reflection assignment. Superb prof.",1
"Content of the class was incredible fascinating. He is not the most engaging lecturer, but the content alone had me interested. Not a very hard grader, and the class did not require that much work. Would definitely recommend if the content seems at all interesting.",1
"Osoba is a really nice teacher, but I would personally never take this class again. I would only recommend taking this class if you are an economics major or you have a love for it. The test are really hard and you have to memorize everything. You won't understand any of the study guides unless you go to him for help. Take it online if you can!",1
"Just because her name rhymes with hell doesn't mean that her lab is. Far from it in fact. She will respond surprisingly fast to e-mails (worryingly even, I mean come on, play hard to get at least a bit), explain the information clearly, and is very knowledgeable. Go with Rishel, and it'll all be swell.",1
"Phenomenal teacher. A great individual who truly cares about the success of his students, and the importance of communication (cinnabon, savvy)",1
This instructor was the best instructor I have had at NWACC hands down! She was very prompt about grading our discussion posts and gave great feedback! She was very engaged with us as students and with the material. Too bad you can't clone her.,1
"I'm not crazy about his teaching style, nor do I think his powerpoint/lectures are well put together. With that said, he is a very intelligent man w/ a sense of humor. As a working paralegal he is able to tell you about how things really show down in the field. You are going to work in his class, but you come out appreciating it. I recommend.",1
Dr. Ranft is awesome! Just go to class and look at the exam questions before the exam before the exam date and you'll get a good grade. ,1
"at first the class was okay and she was nice. the first part of the quarter consisted of mainly reading the 2nd half of the quarter, the course consisted of more writing and less reading. i got a B+ in the class but i did put in a lot of time and effort in the class. and she was very picky in writing styles she is enthusiastic but the class was ok",1
"She is nice, but most of the times she would talk about the Cubs game. She tries to make the class fun, and time is not efficiently spent. At times she was not helpful, and would not recommend to everyone. ",0
Brittney rocks!,1
"Prof. Magallon is one of the most insightful teachers Ive ever had. I loved going to her class and learned a great deal. She gave me confidence in my writing and as a student. Do the work expected, with effort, get an A. Homework, outside reading, pop quizzes. Prepare to work hard outside of class but it's worth it. I'd take her again, forsure.",1
"What a joke. it's like we are back in elementary school. She moves seats, makes you work with partners, and has every single person in the class repeat the same thing over and over again. Terrible teacher. Boring. She's so annoying. Tons of HW (Writing words 5x each) You never get out early even after taking a test. She's terrible. Worst teacher",0
"The best teacher I've ever had, super easy!  You just have to study your study guide that she goes through with the class and gives us the correct answers the class before the test.  Only thing is there's only 4 tests throughout the semester and a final exam so you better do good on the tests!  TESTS ARE SUPER EASY JUST STUDY THE STUDY GUIDE",1
Professor Blackburn is fantastic! He really helped me stay motivated and worked with me to extend assignment deadlines after I lost my job. He really cares about his students.,1
"You must attend your lectures in order to get a good grade in this course. She tests on pictures and maps, however she does not post pics/maps on her slides, so BEWARE OF THAT. She posts lots of slides and you have to know all of them to write the exams. It is a difficult course but if you have a great memorizing skill then you will do good.",1
This class is pretty much all self-teaching and memorization. She reads over the entire powerpoint in class which is not very helpful. The written portion of her exams are hard but she gives partial points and curves all the exams. She also gives lots of extra credit. Getting an A is possible but you have to put in a lot of effort.,1
"Overall, not impressed by his teaching style (online). Be prepared to teach yourself everything, because he provides no lessons and little help even if you ask for it!",0
Heather hug is the most helpful teacher I've ever had. She really helps you learn and understand the material.,1
"I did this one online, the content was nothing I hadn't studied in high school. Just a brush up course really. No homework online and you can do the exams anytime you like. I finished early so I could focus on other subjects. He was always quick back with emails but you're probably better off getting help in the LRC.",1
Great teacher takes the time needed to make sure you get the material,1
"really tough grader, extra credit is only worth one point. She is not helpful when you have concerns about your grade and has a very smart way to respond, always. since her english isn't so good, her lectures are not understandable. Do not recommend her.",0
"Miranda is so incredible. I've had her for COMM 553/503, and she brings a really unique perspective and style to her classes. Her assignments can range in difficulty, but they're meant to challenge you, and she's very willing to help. She does lag a little with giving grades, but her feedback is excellent. I absolutely recommend her!",1
Professor Liu gave concrete and specific guidance on research methods. You will learn how to differentiate good from bad research.,1
"Don't take him!! It's difficult to verbalise just how tedious he is-like a recording of an unfunny Mr. Rogers narrating lectures in slow-motion. Very unclear about requirements, however he spends 20 mins at the beginning of each class repeating the date of every quiz and assignment. Treats you like a child-don't get caught doodling or looking away.",0
Clesr grading criteria. Do the readings and weekly quizzes (which are open book and at home) and youll be fine. Midterm and final-- super clear.,1
"She cares and she knows her stuff that's all that matters if you care she cares Cliche, but you get what you give  I recommend her to anyone taking mkt research",1
Bliss is the absolute best. Really enhanced my college experience. I supplemented class with jon from skoolers but still class itself was very worth it. I just wanted to get the notecard for exams lol. I look forward to taking Bliss for financial management of the firm!,1
"She is someone I  have so much respect for, someone I learned so much from, and someone I  look up to. I had Jayne Lobert for 141, theory, clinical, and 153 theory. . She is not easy, but she is definately an awesome instructor,and a teacher I will always keep in contact with. Be prepared to work hard cuz she doesn't put up with stupidity.",1
"His English is very difficult to understand Lab and Lecture are totally not relevant Youtube video, link on lectures are useless Regret going to KPU because of his class",0
"You can tell that she really wants to help you, but she is not smart enough to do it. She has been teaching this course for at least 3 years. But still she doesn't know how to help students with their english. Highly recommend you NOT to choose her class.",1
"Professor Layoun is one of those people you either hate or love. There really is no in between. I agree with the other student who called her lectures ""thought provoking"". Interestin indeed.",1
"Loved Mr. Martin's class! He is such an approachable professor, and he tries to make class interesting. He makes sure to learn your name and help you get to know your other classmates. He's adorable. I think of him as my ISU grandpa. :)",1
"Val in one word is amazing. The class is quite easy as long as you volunteer for the exercises and make an effort. Show that you care and you'll do great. She gives great criticism in a positive way. Best THR class i've taken so far. I would highly recommend this class for a DEC D. Class requires 2 shows, 1 essay & memorization of a short script.",1
"Barely listened in his class, was pretty boring, everything is on slides, final and midterm are just papers, APA FORMAT, cool guy, just really really really really really really really boring lectures... so yeah have fun with that",1
"Whole class based on readings! You will discuss what you thought about the readings assigned and how certain ideas are applied in teaching so you get a reading response every week, 150 words max but 2 are graded. They're easy, just use quotes to make connections. Interesting lectures and there is one fun group project that you will work a lot on.",1
"Great class, pretty fun.  This is not a difficult class, but there is a lot of work.  The work is not hard, it's just the amount of it.  There are 2-3 semester long projects, not including a group project towards the end of the semester that is a 20 minute presentation.  There are canvas discussion posts every night needing 1-2 paragraphs as well.",1
"gives quite a few lectures and gives a lot of handouts but is clear and concise- lectures are easy to follow. Tests based on lectures. Extremely helpful and understanding. Best professor I've ever had. I have taken him twice so far. NEVER any homework and usually lets you out of class early. Got an A- last semester in PSY112, hoping for an A again.",1
"Assignments are not specific. Whenever I ask her a question, her response is ""refer to the assignment."" Poor grammar that makes the assignments confusing. Posts assignments in modules that are not due that week. Would not recommend this teacher to anyone. I've taught myself more about communications than she's taught me. Teacher's Rate: 0",0
Dr. Hazell was truly great! I wish that all of my professors were as inspiring as him. This was the first history class I actually enjoyed learning in. Would recommend taking his class x100,1
He's awesome. 4 tests and a final. About one written homework assignment per week. Most of this class is common sense which will really help your gpa. Take this class for your gen eds!!,1
"His lectures are pretty much useless. To actually lear, you have to read the textbook. His labs were doable, I recommend staying on top of them. He can be rude, but he is much nicer if you approach him during office hours (if he is there). During labs, don't expect any help from him, he will leave as soon as lab time starts. TA's are very helpful.",1
"boring course,too many things need to remember. don't waste your time.my GPA is 3.5 and got a c in his course.worse grade i ever got. don't expect he will curve Hundreds of slides notes. if you want to suicide, take his ee333.",0
"I withdrew  from the class, as well as many others! We started with maybe 15 or more, by the time I dropped there were 6.  She did not teach the subject where the student could understand and retain the information! If you ask for help during class, her response is always ""Well..., I don't understand why you don't understand"".",0
"All STAT 201 classes take the same tests & are supposed to follow the same powerpoint notes. Dr. Pannell didnt like the powerpoints so he skips a lot. Which is really frustrating bc you have to go back & learn it yourself. My roommate is in a different STAT class and she got a review for the test, but we didnt get one.. but its the same test?",1
Steve is a very understanding professor. Although he didn't always help you understand the concepts very well. But he did allow note cards for most tests and even gave a take home test. There are online quizzes for each section and book work that isn't graded but is required. Very easy to get an A in this class if you are good at math.,1
"She is SO unaccessible. She teaches at like 3 different places, doesn't always reply to emails, and has a grad student do ALL of her grading. If you want to feel like you're taking a pointless and difficult class with no teacher, take Oakley. She isn't helpful but still grades harshly. Complete waste of time, do not recommend.",0
Good first time professor.,1
"Professor Bahr is awesome. He does lecture based classes and loves discussions. His exams are optional (can choose to do smaller easy projects instead.) He likes you to buy the book but honestly, you don't need it since he teaches from it and then never has you use it other wise. He's young and understanding of working students.",1
super sweet.,1
Hes so hot its a pleasure being in his class for that only. Butt;) he is also the only teacher in the HRM course. The other are a waste of time and a shame to the profession. This guy is a true teacher. Thanks!!!,1
This class is really easy but she does not give out any grades higher than a 95. Usually you will get between an 85 and 90 on an essay no matter how much work you put into it. She is super flexibly and very nice. DO NOT GET THE TEXTBOOK OR ACCESS CODE it is not worth it. We used it once and it was not helpful and you can just say you forgot it.,1
"I enjoyed having Professor fields because she was approachable, but she didnt get back to me on a few emails (or took 3 days). The class was kind of difficult, honestly. Reading the chapters was a breeze and the information wasnt hard to grasp, but the homework assignments and tests were pretty difficult. I barely got an A and had to work HARD.",1
"So respectful, so friendly, and he is the best teacher I have ever seen in my life",1
"Amazing professor! He made critical theory fun! So easy to understand it after he explains it in class, and the papers/exams were so easy. He really cares about his students, and he admitted at the beginning of the semester that you shouldn't contact him through email. Very enjoyable class! Just write 2 discussion questions and show up.",1
"What a guy! Cool head! Smart phys. ed. professor, been around the block a time or 2 or 3 or 4.knows his s#*! When it comes pitchin! Only 1 thing... he's a Cubby fan!! oooooo Jus kiddin Great Coach!!! Keep on Truckin! Newport! Rock On !!!",1
"You have to write, take, and then grade your own tests, FOR A GRADE(This will take you hours). Not to mention the numerous progress reports you have to send her just to tell her you completed another assignment. Do not take this class if it is given online. It will be the most stressful thing, especially when you have to write your own final",0
Discrete Probability,1
Insightful,1
He is a terrible teacher. Please don't take him. I had to drop. I don't feel like he gave me the chance to really appreciate the subject and topic. His exams have only 3 questions and are nothing like the 40 questions homework he gives you. He CANT TEACH! He will mess up your GPA.,0
Excellent teacher! Does a great job of keeping everyone interested through positive individual inclusion during the class.  Lots of work though.  If you're in 1505 you need to come to class regularly.,1
"Harvey is the best professor for chemistry within the LACCD system. She clearly tells you what you need to study for her exams, gives you countless examples of every type of problem that you will encounter on the exams and makes the lab time very constructive and focused. You literally just have to listen to what she says and you can get an A",1
"Dr. Sam is a great professor! He prepare his class well for the lecture and lab exams. Pay attention, read, and study hard and you will make it out of his class. Study guide and practice quizzes will come back on the exams, no games or tricky questions. His exams are pretty straight forward.",1
"This class was probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken so far. If you arent really good at Calculus, take this professor! He will triple check if everyone understands the material and will always encourage you to reach out to him for any questions. He never collected homework and there was a small quiz each class, nothing too difficult.",1
"Wonderful teacher!!! She explained the problems and made them easy to understand. We used the online course Aleks, the textbook was never even opened. Homework every night. she offered extra credit if you went to the math lab. I passed with an A!",1
"He's a great professor that keeps the class engaged, does not give too much homework and is a fair grader.",1
Professor Murphy was a great instructor. This class inspired me to add a GLBT minor. I would definitely take another class with him.,1
She is not good about getting back to her students if you email her.  She doesn't use the PAL grade book so you have to ask her for your grades.  She is a very strict grader.,0
Corporate Finance,1
"BEST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. Math has never come easy to me, until this class. He is SO patient and caring .. he really cares and makes sure you understand! i will be taking him again for my next math!",1
"Very few examples are given in class. You need to read the textbook prior to the lecture to make the most out of the lecture. Dr. Wang is very informed and will answer any question you have,  so come prepared! Homeworks are assigned every week and it's not something you want to do the day before, unless you want to spend 8-10 hours working on it.",1
"He did provide a lot of reading material, some so valuable that I will keep for lifetime reference. Though he doesn't say it directly, I found we were not expected to thoroughly know every single article. Rather, skim to find snippets or entire articles that resonate with you and focus there. Assignments open in advance, good for busy ppl.",1
Amazing teacher. I was so worried cuz I've heard bad things but he really was excellent!,1
"I love Ms. Magallon! She is an excellent teacher and a great person. I did not think her essays were difficult at all, but others may disagree. Receiving feedback from her will help raise your essay grades, so get as much as possible! She is willing to help to her students to make sure they pass.",1
"A great class and a great professor. Class was recorded and as long as you watched all the lectures and paid attention, assignments and tests were very easy. The mini quizzes were very easy. Lectures were very well done and interesting. Definitely an easy A if you attend/watch lectures. Highly recommend this class!",1
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
"Her class was very interesting but, she is a hard grader, she gave me B after really hard work. I will never take with her any future classes. By the way, no one in my class took a full mark.",1
Really hard to understand him and expect you to learn everything on your own. Do not recommend this professor.,0
"to be honest, although I re-watch his recordings, I still don't understand his English at all for both lectures and questions on exams, so I don't learn anything useful from this class. The good thing is he is an easy marker and his exams aren't hard (due to open book). Unfortunately, he is the only person who teaches 4115, 3225, 3235, KPU IT sucks",0
Nice guy but horrible class. His grading system is ridiculous! Lectures are a bore. Would not recommend..,0
easiest class i have taken so far at wake tech. yea she goes through powerpoint slides really fast but that doesnt even matter. her study guides are the EXACT same questions & answers that are on her test. first test i got a 98 & my lowest test grade was a 96 all semester. memorize the study guide & u got an easy A. i LOVED her!!,1
Dr. Bland is a great teacher. I took her class last  semester and she helped me a lot. She is  one of the best teachers that I ever had. If you are planning to take English 102 or ENG 203 I suggest you take her class. Her class is not hard. Ask questions about anything that you don't understand about her lectures or MWA's and she will help you.,1
"Total Recommend anyone take this class with the Professor. She is understanding and helpful to those who do not understand the material. To those who are retaking the class like myself, this is definitely the professor to take it with.",1
"Long, less than exciting lectures, but gets the job done. Very willing to help with homework and labs. Makes some of the toughest material pretty easy to comprehend. Reasonable and straight forward with expectations.",1
"Constantly rambles off on tangents during lectures. Many of her diagrams made things more confusing. Changed the entire format of the midterm the week of, and instead assigned it for over spring break. Totally inaccessible out of class, never responded to emails, often waited until lecture to answer very time sensitive questions. Easy class tho",0
So sweet!,1
"Linda is such a sweet professor and she is definitely passionate about everything she teaches. Sometimes her classes are very lecture-heavy and hard to sit through, but she does a good job assessing where the class is in understanding and adapts to their feedback. I would recommend her for straightforward classes that are still pretty interesting!",1
"Very wishy washy. He will decide one thing one minute, and change his mind the next. Makes you participate in a Global Business Game, impossible..then tests you on it. Even harder. Try to avoid taking him. Pretty nice guy, just not the greatest teacher.",0
She is one of my favorite professors that I have ever had the joy of taking a class from.,1
"Really boring and too talkative about himself. Bored me to death, pretty easy grader, just uninspiring. Learnt way too much about his personal life.",1
"She's one of those people who thinks being ridiculously hard and assigning tons of work makes you a good teacher. The day a 7 page research paper was due, she told us we had a take home essay as part of final due in 3 days. Are you kidding me? Also, tons of reading each day. And she definitely plays favorites.",1
"Daniel Proga's class is super easy. He only gives out 3 test and one final. He'll tell you straight up that you can find his Quiz Review answers on quizlet. Study quizzes and you'll pass. Trick to his class is that he takes 5 random attendance days, and it will effect your grade if you don't do well on test.",1
"Sara is one of the most amazing women that I've ever met! She is so passionate about what she is teaching and you can tell that she really cares about her students! If you have a little bit of background, you don't have to attend class to get a good grade but I found myself excited to go to class because her lectures so interesting.",1
She gave good lecture and was easy to ask questions. This class is one of the hardest at Pierce. This semester was tough online and knowing that she still wouldnt round anyones grade who had a 79 or 89. The mental stress from this class is exhausting and having so many assignments doesnt help you study. She only gave us 4 days to study for final,0
"Mark Hooper is one of the Best Lecturers I've ever studied under. He is really on top of his stuff and is widely read. Mention a field and Dr H has an answer. A very free-spirited man with a very tough approach to grading. Your first lectures with him could be frightening but once you get to know he expects  what he calls LEVEL V, you are safe.",1
"I just took her online Nutrition class this past summer. I liked having everything available and ready from the first day of the course. She has some videos with instructions available to everyone which I thought was very useful. I suppose someone who has not taken an online class ever before can become overwhelmed, the course is meant for all.",1
great,1
"The class is pretty easy, the quizzes are based off of the readings and the answers aren't found online. She also uses top hat.. Try to find a friend in the class so if you need to miss they can get your participation points for you",1
Very clear and easy to follow. Classes were easy but if you need more help Dr. Jon doesn't mind answering questions after class.,1
"He isn't the worst professor but his methods of teaching were sort of confusing. I am really good at math but I didn't take the class seriously because it was online. That being said, he made several extensions for assignments and he also did what he had to for us to learn. He could have been more organized, but again it's an online class.",1
"Professor Wood has been one of my absolute favorite teachers. If you show up, participate, do the homework and study; you will pass. She is an amazing teacher who is caring and respectful. I loved the open forum style in the class and that so much of the class was really helpful in regular day to day life. This class was so much more than expected.",1
"Excellent professor for both robotics and 170A. His exams are very theoretical, meaning memorizing homework questions will not yield a good grade (I think this is the reason for the negative reviews). Both corresponding lab sessions require many hours of work but were very interesting.",1
"take this class , he is very super good teacher, i like him what he is ways his teaches ",1
"If you are serious about getting ahead in the Illustration industry, you will be as disappointed with Dennis as I was. I was uninspired by him, got no portfolio pieces from his classes, and was wholly disappointed with the number of assignments we were given. He will push you into painting instead of letting you explore your own methods.",0
"Dr. Yang gives a lot of work and can be a tough grader, but she really is there to help you. She always responds to emails quickly and is happy to help with homework during her office hours. A lot of her class is centered around group work- she has group projects that are 20% of the grade. Also be prepared to do the entire class in RStudio.",1
Awesome teacher. Very thorough! The test is from the material in class and the study guides. She gives a lot of opportunities for points other than the tests which is helpful. She also drops the lowest test grade. Would recommend Ms. Smith to anyone!,1
"Best teacher I've ever had, and I've had quite a few! He knew I was having problems that year, and he spent extra time helping me and some other students after lab to make sure we understood what was going on in class.",1
"I have always loved History Theory but Rob ruined the class for me and many others. He puts down students publicly, wastes our time when we have group assignments that need to be finished within 2 hours, and grades unfairly. He gives the same grades to students in group assignments that do nothing or do everything. He needs to fix this class.",0
"She is the best teacher ever.  She explains everything very well, and make the class so fun.",1
"Very poor instructor. Classes consisted of confusing slides and even more confusing explanations. She seemed very disinterested in the material covered. If you read the books and decipher the slides, you'll pass.",0
No Comments,1
"Extremely nice, easygoing, and helpful.  He can babble and be scattered with his material at times, but he always reviews it so it is clear afterwards.  He truly cares about his students and always attempts to interact personally with them.  He will offer help in aspects that do not even involve his class.  Few assignments, and you can rewrite.",1
"Course went smoothly. Try to pay attention to participation during the weeks - that will help on exams questions that involve using decryption methods.  Grading based on participation - easy, two short papers (5pg) - easy, PGP project - easy, Midterm & final exams - hard. But I woule take him again. Ask questions - he will help!",1
"He moves too fast in lecture. When he ""works out"" problems in class he just puts a previously worked out problem on the projector and has a contest with himself to see how fast he can go through it. ",0
"excellent,responsive,invested, study for your exams from text. If you work hard you will get a good grade. She uses some audio and highly communicative. excellent teacher!",1
"Shes a very nice person, However as a full timer living at my moms with no job, Its alot for me! I have other courses and it seems all I have is math. Way to much homework. 3 assignments will be due in such short time, test are graded heavily I don't understand why some points come off. She made me cry with a failing grade I tried hard!",1
Dr. Ross takes time to go through several example problems for each concept on the projector. Homework is usually weekly and is entirely online. Expect to spend about 2 hours a week on homework. Easy exams with each having just 4 problems and no conceptual questions. Make a good equation sheet (you get one page for the exam) and you'll do well.,1
"man goes way too fast, mumbles, has horrible handwriting, and just all around sucks",0
"Huge GPA booster if you stay remotely up-to-date. Got 100% on all quizzes. No textbook needed, use her notes. Crammed for the final in 1 day, got 85% and 77% in the course. Would NOT recommend though if you have absolutely no interest in the course; I lost marks because I didn't care enough to even attempt the assignments. Yes, I'm garbage.",0
She knows her stuff but she is too hard.  I have lost my interest in anthropology because of this class.  But she is very informative and a great resource for those who really like anthropology.,1
A hard class.,1
"JUDITH IS AMAZING. She is first off: BRILLIANT, and totally helpful!! She makes you feel like you can do anything and brings all of her experience to her teaching!Take a class with Judith! Any class! It doesnt even matter what it is, if she's teaching it; take it!",1
"He is rather loud and intense during class, often making you feel uncomfortable during the lecture. His class is extremely boring but isn't hard to get through.",0
would only recommend this class if you really enjoy journalism and I mean really enjoy it. The professor is very demanding of how he wants things done and there is a ton of writing for this class,0
"At first I thought she was mean and honestly kind of scary, but after awhile you warm up to her. She is a hard teacher, but one of the better ones I have had. She really lets you experiment with your writing, which made the class really fun for me. Overall I had a really good time in the class!",1
"I had him twice and I have to say he's one of the best teachers I ever had:)He communicates well with his  students, very helpful and will do whatever he can to help you become a better artist. He makes class fun with his sense of humor and explains his lectures very clearly. I highly recommend him!",1
"Awesome lady, very nice, very helpful, very easy grader. Her class could be very interesting but because no one ever participates in discussions and she lets them get away with it, it's very dull.",1
"Even though his attendence is not mandatory I recommend going.  If you go, you will do better in the class.  He's a great teacher and grammar is hard.  He explains well.",1
"Good teacher - really feel as if she is trying to help you succeed. I made a C, but I deserved it.",1
"She use's the socratic method to get students who are struggling with concepts to realize the answer. However, most people interpret this as her trying to make you look stupid. She is very generous with personal time to help students and is even willing to schedule personal office hours outside of the ones on her syllabus. Excellent. ",1
"She is an okay professor but, she regurgitates information from slides that are from the textbook and doesn't even bother slowing down . Also she relies too much on Sapling Learning for homework which is the worst program to learn from in my opinion. Also she scolds you for not knowing the material so read up,do your best, and pray that you pass.",1
"Read the book and discuss, that's half of the class. (I used an older edition and one chapter was different, so be careful) Participation is the most important thing to pass, so don't forget to reply! I really enjoyed the assignments throughout the class because they were all unique and different. Learned a lot about communication. Grades are fair.",1
"Sias is a wonderful professor. She's obsessed with podcasts, particularly Serial and This American Life, and will make you listen to them in class a few times. I didn't mind listening to the podcasts as they were interesting and a nice break from normal lecture or work. There's a video interview project, so get on the ball with it, and a paper.",1
Professor Stevenson was an amazing lab professor. She answers any questions during lab and is available at her office hours with help studying for practicals. She is very sweet and funny and I'd recommend her for lab or lecture.,1
"Sam is really a nice and friendly professor!!! P.S. One important thing to keep in mind is: don't be absent minded during lectures otherwise you will find yourself completely lost, as there is nothing called ""slides"" in Sam's lecture. But even without slides Sam is a great professor! (as long as you are a good student and go to lectures, lol) :)",1
"I tooked the 115 and 125 class with Mrs,Wells. Very good teacher be prepare to do lots of homework. you want an ""A"" she will make you work for it. Her lectures are very clear she is very passionate about her job and helping her students.I would take her for all my math classes if I could.",1
"Probably one of the easiest classes I've taken, ever. As long as you're able to complete all of your assignments on MyMathLab, and partake in the discussion boards, ON TIME, you will pass this class. She has a strict-late work policy.  Also, if you're passing the class with an 85% or higher, you're exempt from taking the final exam ",1
"This class was great, the texts that we read were interesting enough to keep our attention but also broadened our concept of literary analysis. Iliana is super great and personable, easy to talk to and just overall a great professor. This class requires a lot of conversation in group and talking about what your thoughts are on the different texts.",1
"Quizzes/test straight from the powerpoints. Didn't need them, though. However... case studies suck, are different from text problems, and don't expect her nor the TA to help, either. She never helped in discussions or private email. I guess she expects the online students to automatically understand the studies, which are 18 points of final grade.",0
"Physics 140 is a weed out, so take it with dr, mike. He does care about his students and he is super funny. The class can boring and he knows that, he tries his best. He has alot office hours, esp. the week before an exam. It's really to reach him by email, he won't respond. There's no mwrite or flipit physics . for his section.",1
"Not very helpful. He doesn't respond to any students e-mails for help. Also he hands homework back extremely late, so you are not sure if you are doing all of the problems correctly. He seems like a nice guy, but I wish he would explain things in class and show some initiative towards his students.",0
"O.k. classes, has her own favorites though.",1
"Tough subject with good professor. Moves fast but provides slides,Practice exams VERY similar to exams and lets you make one index card. This class is nothing but a bunch a formulas and knowing how to use them n some excel, He knows his stuff REALLY well, You are getting real knowledge not textbook stuff. Take him but get ready to study n work hard",1
Great professor. Very helpful in class and during office hours. He was also willing to take our opinions into consideration if there's something overly difficult about the course.,1
"Overall good teacher, one 30 question test on like the 7th(?) week. One personal presentation on topic of choice but have to get your topic first because no duplicates. No textbook, mostly go on the news and talk about topics like an open discussion. No FINAL.!!!",1
"His in-class assignments were a tad ridiculous, and the group project took a crazy amount of time to complete. He expects everyone to participate in the class, and would call upon people to talk if no one volunteered. His exams were really straightforward and fair. Textbook helped if you missed a class or were unclear on some of the concepts.",1
"Professor Andrews is the best! He's insightful, and he's a professor that doesn't let his students just listen. Participation is key to great discussions in this class, so don't be afraid to speak up. One of the best English professors at Fullerton College, you would be a fool not to take him.",1
Probably the most undeserving B+ I've ever received. He's aware that he's a difficult grader and blames the students for how boring the class is when the material he provides is extremely uninteresting. He has a monotone voice and a very awkward and quirky sense of humor. Could appeal to some but not worth it.,1
this is the best math teacher. He is very helpful. He makes it fun and more easier to learn. His class is very enjoyable. He makes you want you come to class he makes learning fun,1
Good information learned from the class. Make sure you show up to class.,1
"Professor Kiesewetter is very good at explaining chemistry. She definitely knows what she is talking about and is very dedicated to the success of her students. CHM101 was mostly review for me because I took chemistry in high school, but she made me understand the new concepts. There are 4 exams and then the final. They are all fair not too long.",1
"This class was a bit of a hassle since we had homework but it didn't count as a grade, so no one ever did it. There are wayyy to many assignments besides the 3 essays (4 vocab assignments, a journal,2 tests...) Just give it an honest effort and you could probably make an A. Although I hear the other prof. who teaches this class assigns less work...",1
"Listen, I'm not one to dislike many professors, but I honestly really dislike her. If you can avoid Yana Sandlers, please do at any and every cost. Not only did her lectures not make sense, if you asked her a question, she just reworded your question into an ""answer"". She does not know what she's doing.",0
"Never a boring class, you do get a lot of work but everything you do is helpful and essential to getting a good grade on the essays. Readings can get a little overwhelming for some, but it wasn't a problem for me. Her class does require a lot of time outside class, but if you fulfill all the requirements and ask for help you will pass",1
"The class design makes grades heavily reliant on timed exams, which unfortunately are on applications of the assignments which no student would understand unless a student has taken the course or some equivalent before.  This places students who don't have the proper background at a disadvantage.  I learned a lot, but I'm worried about my grade.",0
"He is awesome.  Very enthusiastic about the subject and gets the class interested, too.  He is very funny and tells good stories.  Not uptight at all.  Very laid back.  I don't like Math classes but he made Calculus (normally a very painful subject) enjoyable.  Take him!",1
"He's kind of all over the place, we pretty much focused on the same topic all semester so I didn't feel like I learned all that much. He has a very specific way of thinking so on assignments and tests you have to keep that in mind. Overall I really wish I hadn't taken this class.",0
SO sweet and caring. The nicest guy ever. Lectures can be boring but study guides are posted before the mid-term and test-just memorize it and you'll get an A. Often plays his cello and other instruments in class. Lots of listening and videos. As long as it looks like you tried on assignments you'll get full credit. FAVORITE CLASS I'VE TAKEN,1
"Just Had my first class. I didn't listen anything she was saying cause she is insanely pretty. She also has a cute accent. Or maybe, I found her accent cute b/c she is pretty.",1
"This professor does not give you a clear understanding of the assignments and she does not take the time to answer students questions, she is just worried about getting though the slides. You will end up figuring out each assignment on your own.",0
"He's a great teacher.  Very laid back and easy going.  He gives pop quizzes every now and then, but they aren't really a surprise because if he gives you a reading the class before you can count on maybe taking a pop quiz. Even then there's a 50% chance you want have to take it because he makes you roll a die to see.",1
I took Franciscan Spirituality with Br. Daniel Maria and this class was one of my favorite courses out of the 50+ credits of theology I have taken. He is passionate about the subject and his class is engaging. His course gave me a deeper love and understanding of an authentic Franciscan spirituality and challenged me to live this out.,1
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
"In the beginning of class, she'll say how it'd be nice to see more people on camera- annoying especially to those not comfortable with that or who have bad internet. Other than that, the class is generally fine. Nothing special but at least it's something actually useful for the future: emails, resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, reports.",1
"Horrible professor, so rude and reads straight from power points, doesn't actually teach. Tests are confusing. Read the anatomy textbook because it's your only chance of passing.",0
"Maureen is a very hard marker! This course is a lot of work and participation counts! I suggest not skipping a single class and keeping up with the large amount of readings. If you want to do well, make sure you talk about feminism.. she will talk forever about that topic! Expect over three quarters of the class to drop this course by the end.",0
My favorite professor that I've had at App so far. I was eager to come to every one of his classes just because you could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching. Everything we learned was eye-opening and important and useful in order to go out into the world and to be a good person. Definitely take him even if you're not an anthro major.,1
There are 2 midterms which are easy if you truly study the study guide. 3 quizzes based off of the 3 books you read outside of class (read them or you won't pass the quizzes). Participation is 5% and all you have to do is be present on the day of exams. As far as class goes it is mostly power point with a few videos. Boring but manageable.,1
"Her participation grading - stupid. Claims the way she grades you for coming is rewarding but you buy an app and get legitimately graded. You could show up and try but get a 50 on the questions. Her quizzes - easy. Use google and powerpoints. Her ""business problems"" are rough. Isn't challenging. you wont get an A. Time consuming... Learned nothing.",0
"Professor Sullivan is a great teacher, but lectures can be confusing and boring. You have to read the books to understand the discussions. He gives mini quizzes on the readings which aren't too bad and often open for interpretation. Read the material and pay attention during lecturesdiscussions and you should be fine! ",1
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"Sonia is very intelligent . She often speaks in monologues but if you pay attention you can really learn from them. If you want to get anything out of her lectures you need to do the reading. On another note, she is approachable and understanding that we're all humans, which I appreciate in a professor,",1
"Sometimes difficult to understand.  He also talks very fast during lectures.  However, he is helpful and very knowledgeable.",1
"Although attendance is required, don't pay any attention to her lectures. Study straight from the book.She wants very detailed answers and is a little nitpicky when it comes to grading. She does curve, and if she doesn't get to a topic, she will delay tests. Everything is straight memorization from the book. If you're good at that, you'll get an A",0
"He's very flamboyant, but his 12 step process is severely underrated. I pretty much finished my paper while other 221 professors' classes were just getting started with the rough draft (it was due right around finals week), which was great because one less class to worry about. I thought his grading was a bit arbitrary though.",1
"Extremely poor class planning. Will make up useless activities just to fill remaining class time. Doesn't discuss texts adequately. Tests are fairly easy, papers graded easily. Most boring class ever.",0
"Where do I even start? Perez is AWESOME! He made writing my tech paper so easy by utilizing ""Perez's 12 Step Process"". Classes are really fun & you do most of the work in class. He will work with you extensively if you need the extra help. I really enjoyed writing my paper, learned a ton of skills & highly RECCOMEND him to everyone! ",1
"Fantastic! Cares about people, the problems, working. Wonderful",1
Good Teacher,1
"I had her for Microeconomics (ECON 211) and she was great. She was very straightforward with her grading. If you put in the effort with the discussion posts and follow rubrics, you'll be fine.",1
Great course that empowers women to keep moving forward and offers all the resources and support PCC has to offer. Really recommend this free class sponsored by PCC,1
"Gives very thoroughly lectures, lots of visuals, helpful websites and videos. A lot of partner or group work with almost all assignments. Really good and detailed feedback on assignments and projects. Really cares and asks for reflection to make the course better. I loved this professor and class.",1
I loved her class.I took it as a Deck course my freshman 1st semester nd by far my faorite class...the acting techniques and exericses we do are fun and interesting...it helped me come out of my shyness..fav class at Stony,1
"Very entertaining lectures. Light journal work throughout the semester, few tests, and only one presentation. Would highly recommend.",1
Easy class covering a topic you have probably taken,1
Do not take his course please. It is terrible! Tough grader,0
"Her lectures tend to be boring, doesn't speak loud enough and has a monotone voice. I didn't learn too much from her, mostly from the SI for the class. She's straightforward about what she wants you to know but sometimes leaves out important info. I wouldn't take her class if you don't like teaching yourself most of the material.",1
"Very boring and long lectures, gives homework that is not interesting at all and makes you not want to draw. doesnt ever give As on homework",0
"I absolutely loved this class, Steve really worked to make the material interesting and relevant to social issues, when it easily could have been just a ""monster story"" class. Really nice and funny which made it easy to talk to him and discuss essay ideas. With more confidence he will be an outstanding professor.",1
Awesome professor. His test cover alot of material which can be difficult to remember at times.,1
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
"Dr. Day is pretty friendly, easy to talk to, and willing to help. The majority of the points for the class are in the labs which can be difficult but Dr. Day usually has very good input if you're stuck. The tests are open note, but some of the material on them is only mentioned in class. Lectures aren't particularly helpful aside from that though.",1
"LMG is the best. She sends a kind reminder after each class to let you know what went on during class if you missed. Homeworks are easy points. Hardest thing in the class is the test, but study some and you should be alright. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
"He only provides instructions - step 1, 2 , and 3, but not walking you through the example which make it harder for students to understand the concept.  The test have only 20 questiuons, and each one is 5%. AND He does not curve!",1
"I highly recommend Dr. Sharma's pov and soc welfare course. Reading isn't required due to her power points being based on the book. All assignments are easy and the videos she has us watch were interesting. Lectures can be repetitive but if the whole class participates, it can make it more interesting. Also, she wants her students to participate.",1
goog,1
no comment,1
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
"Brown is fine. He keeps his voice low and is very reliant on slide presentations that have a LOT of material, and if you miss a day you miss a lot of information not included in the actual pres., but WILL be included on the test. I found him interesting enough, but the class was very boring with him. Tests have a lot of material on them.",0
Amazing amazing teacher. Must take to experience the best experience in school,1
I just wanna make sure everyone knows to never take this class. Like fr... These positive comments are actually cap. Like please save yourself and do not take this class. If you want to get anything more than a D good luck! YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT IN THE CLASS. LIKE NOT EVEN CAPPING EVERYTHING. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,0
She never replies to emails,0
"I love psychology with a passion but this has been by far the worst class I have ever taken. She is a sweet women but my goodness! I never even knew what my grades were because nothing was graded till the end of the semester, by that point I couldn't fix my errors on the next assignments. This was also a very unorganized.",0
"This was the third course I chose to take with Dr. Masud. He is the best teacher I have come across at postsecondary level. He does not only teach Ethics but practices it as well,",1
"I was expecting a lot more from this class. Serpell was a brilliant prof. but her lectures were usually too broad thematically while at the same time incorp. theory & a TON of new terms that we're responsible for on the final. Way too much work (2 papers, 2 rather pointless ass., a final, + graded attendance & weekly quizzes) for the little back.",1
"LOVED Mr. Allen. He gets a bad rap from people that don't do their work, but if you do your work and go to class then you will easily make an A. The test are straightforward and reflect what we do in class. Really like that he gives us worksheets to do outside of class, and will occasionally give extra credit to those that completed. Take him!!",1
"I had him in high school, possibly one of the best teachers I'd had back then. Now I got him again, I purposefully took this class just to have him teach me again. Without a doubt I can say out of all my current profs he is probably the coolest one I've had so far. He is sarcastic, friendly, and he goes above and beyond. You cannot ask for better.",1
"Professor Easterling is a great professor! She wants you to do well in her class. She is helpful if needed and you should get an A if you complete all of your reading assignments, questions and case study.",1
"She is a cool professor, her lectures are very interesting and she definitely knows what she is talking about. Hardly gives homework and when she does is very easy. Do recommend taking her",1
"Six hours of class without a break. The scores of my assignments were almost same as my classmates, but I got C they got B or A-. He doesn't reply email or messages until the day of the class next week. I chose his class because he is the only professor in the summer.",0
"Professor Morrow is a wonderful teacher who enjoys teaching.  He is caring and will do everything he can to help you pass with the exception of taking your test for you!  Do your homework, take notes, and ask questions.  He is reasonable if you have to miss class just let him know ahead of time.  Best!",1
"Dr. Jimmerson is a fantastic teacher.  She generates interest in English.  She grades hard, though.  Her tests can be pretty difficult as well. She provides Bonus opportunities to make up for any bad grades.  I recommend her, but expect to work for your grade.",1
"She takes a little while to grade exams but that's because she wants to give you the most amount of points she can. She doesn't like multiple choice questions, but with that said, it's not all short answer questions, there are fill in the blanks, t/f, and matching questions too. Overall, really liked her!",1
He is very willing to help and trys very hard to make the material easy to understand but sometimes he ends up making things more confusing. ,1
"She has a very thick Russian accent, can be very difficult to understand at times. If you plan on missing class much, she isn't the professor for you.",1
"I really enjoyed taking Interpersonal Communications online. She is super sweet and caring, and her online lectures are very professional and well put together. The class consisted of quizzes each module and either a discussion post or journal entry and a final. She provides great feedback on all of your assignments so take her if you can!",1
"Amazing lectures, easy to understand, very helpful if u don't understand",1
GREAT!!!,1
"As someone who struggles with math, Dr.Brown was the best choice as a teacher. He is always willing to help his students. He'll stop during class and explain something over if you need him to. There are opportunities for retakes on tests. There isn't homework or quizzes. If you put in the effort, you will pass. TAKE HIS CLASS !! (:",1
"Great teacher, really nice guy, would take him again.",1
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
"Mrs. Elfring is a  great professor! She's very friendly, helpful, and cares about her students. All of her assignments are geared towards the 8-10 page research paper which made writing the paper a lot easier. I would take her again if i could! ",1
"This professor is absolutely terrible. She is always late to class and never has a lesson plan. She just starts talking and expects the class to keep the conversation going, even though no one knows what she's talking about. The work for this class is excessive. If you have any other options for professors, I urge you, don't take professor Hart!",0
"Come to class prepared. I took it in the summer so it was 5 weeks. We read through 4 THICK books before the 5 weeks ended. You MUST come to class prepared (have read) otherwise you will fall behind very quickly. This class is not for you if you think you can breeze through undetected. Good professor, is willing to help you if you help yourself.",1
He's great in helping and directing student to achieve great goals to every student. Great sense of HUMOUR.... Great Guy,1
"I've always really struggled with math, but this class was especially difficult. I was intimidated when going to his office hours, as he is slightly rude and pretty patronizing. He went through problems too fast, and it was difficult to comprehend what he was trying to explain. When students asked questions, he belittled them. Please don't take him",0
"Great professor. Loves the subject. He is very helpful and you can tell he wants everyone to be able to pass. If you don't study for the tests you will not pass this class. It's not one you sleep through for an A. He takes attendance twice. Overall, great class. I would take him again.",1
"takes attendance daily, you have two papers to write each week from the book but very easy, lots of extra credit opportunity. basically show up to class, do a few papers, easy A",1
"Sara is the best teacher I've ever had at BGSU. I've had her for multiple THFM classes, and I learned so much in each. People think she's ""tough"" but she just has high expectations for her students and doesn't expect less than their best efforts. If I hadn't just graduated, I wouldndefinitely take more classes with her in the future. ",1
He is a tough grader but is clear of what is expected. He tends to go off topic a lot and talks really fast so it makes it hard to understand. If you are not able to reach him during his office hours then he will find time to meet and discuss assignments.,1
"She is a strict grader, though she does compensate by raising the grades on the exams so that the student with highest original score ends up with a 95 or 97. There is a lot of homework. She is very willing to help students if they are in trouble or don't understand something. Is a big fan of rubrics in grading to try to be unbiased.",1
"Prof. Anthony is approachable, kind and cares about your success. Though it is challenging to score an A on written assignments and tests, she gives enough opportunities to make up for it. She responds to emails promptly and is always patient in office hour meetings. Would DEFINITELY recommend. :)",1
"He told me that ""since I was not a chemistry major, I don't need to pass his class"" and was not very helpful during lecture or office hours. You can tell he knows what he's talking abt but has a hard time relaying it, MAYBE would have been good if I had a strong chem background. But not very ""user friendly"" for an INTRO TO CHEM prof :(",0
"If u luv lectures you'll luv Prof D. He is vry smart and knows his stuff! We had 4 major assignments (Quiz, Midterm, Resrch Paper, nd Final) He incorporates attendance in ur grade so it ""behooves"" you to go to class! Don't expect to leave early, EVER. U will B embarrased if ur phone goes off. He is best for mature students that are eager to learn.",1
"Thomas was our Physi lab Prof. Loved him! This guy truly has a beautiful soul. He is super laid-back, nice, funny & an all around great professor. Very knowledgable, made class fun, responds to emails, is chill on due dates, answers questions, always offered help & takes the time to explain the materials well Also did Zoom after shifting online",1
"Prof. Humphrey makes learning the concepts easy and entertaining which can be difficult to do in a almost 3 hour night class. Pay attention to lectures and when he says its important TAKE NOTE! He provides study guides for each quiz. Use them, you will do well. Hes very interactive and quite funny.",1
"He assumes you have had experience with coding even though this is an intro class. Tells you to look at Arduino reference pages, which are helpful but you need to learn how to code essentially on your own.",1
test R open book but u do need to study they R not really that easy! but hw counts 150pts so that helps----- & he is supper hot & has great HAIR! but he is married got married spring break 2005 so that sucks,1
"Professor Zein is a very tough grader. And most of these things said are true. Her desired answers are subjective and she is picky in her answers. However, she is very clear and precise in what she expects. If you listen carefully, and take notes you will do good. Pass this class and you can pass any F&M class.",1
"Nice guy, witty and clever. Likes class participation. 3 exams and attendance make up your grade. Study for the exam and you'll be fine.",1
"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",0
"He tries his best to teach complex topics. He is not good at breaking down difficult topics, but he is good at working with you through tough problems. It's a difficult class and you need to put work in, and he is very willing to help.",1
"If you just take notes during his lectures, and follow the objectives in the syllabus, you are pretty much guaranteed an A in the course.",1
"Going into microeconomics, I did not have  clue on how interesting the subject at hand is.  She made the class very fun and used plenty of props to illustrate the concepts being taught.  Their are plenty of oppurtunities for extra credit as a result of a small 5-10 min. presentation on a case study we read about within the chapter reading. Pro A",1
"This class is an easy A but I really cant stand Frazier sometimes. Hes rude and arrogant and he gets butthurt quick He doesnt like to take responsibility of his mistakes,when he does its snarky and shady. Discussions always go left because he interprets things weirdly. Quizzes have trick T/F questions but pretty easy. Exams are online though����",0
"I took this class online and it turned out to be one  of the best classes I had this semester.  The grading is made up of weekly essays, weekly discussions that are done online, and a final project.  I really enjoyed this class and learned so much from it.  There are no tests.  I feel like this class has taught me useful things for my career.",1
"Dr. DuBois is an excellent professor who goes to great lengths for her students to understand. She is patient and understanding when it comes to questions or doubts. However, her exams are difficult as they cover most of what she explained in her lectures as well as additional meticulous details that the book clarifies.Pay attention and take notes!",1
"Janice is so excited and knowledgeable about the coursework, I was engaged from day one. Her lectures are fun, clear, and the tests are fair. She succeeds at engaging the class and answering all questions. Homework is optional, but heavily recommended. She uses her own textbook, which is very informative and a nice change from the $200 alternative.",1
Fliping awsome,1
"He is the worst professor I have ever had.  He is not helpful, I learn absolutely nothing in that class, and I just highly suggest not taking his class.",0
"She can be hypocritical at times, will expect coding to be done in a short period of time. But the content isn't too terrible for an entry level class and she usually provides good help",1
"never take this class, we learned things in class, and BAM they were not on the exam. very one sided and did not care to hear her opinions.",0
"He is very good professor, and he helps the students, it was a DL class he replies the emails and answers the questions, the exams are not easy buy not very hard",1
Professor Camaj is remarkable. He teaches with enthusiasm. Engages with his students individually & collectively. Gifted in helping students harness their talents. Clarifying difficult lessons in the simplest ways. He is humorous and makes the class entertaining. It describes his high level of motivation to educate his students to his best ability.,1
She is absolutely amazing. she grade fairly and will help those who want it more then those who dont. You will learn in her class it also helps that the classes are small,1
"Professor Nia C. Mahallati, J.D.-PROC 5840-Legal Acquisitions Graduate Law course at Webster. Recommend attending all class sessions as tests based on class materials. Very informative class, exceptional professor. Provides extensive coverage of Uniform Commercial Code (Sale of Goods). Highly recommend this graduate law course and professor.",1
"Pros- She gives great feedback.  If you've hit a roadblock, she's there for help. The final is extra credit worth 50 points. Cons- Get ready to basically live in the writing center if you aren't a strong writer, and if you're looking to get a good grade in her class. Can be a little confusing at times. Very strict grader.   ",0
"Would walk into class and say turn in papers, but other than mentioning things generally he never make clear what was due when. Turned in weekly journal entries but none were graded till the end and gave zeros for half of the entries because he said they ""were not MLA format"" but they were the same format as entries he scored as 100.",0
Prof. Kim is strict on his class discipline. He will ask you to stop talking with your friends  if he thinks you distracts him. He is a tough grader on  your papers but TAs will often give a higher score to balance it out. He is very serious on the material and actually care for the students. He is very strict but caring for students as well.,1
He is not very helpful and quizzes and exams rarely relate fully to what was learned. The homework he assigns is barely worth doing since he never goes over it and it isn't the same problems as the quiz. ,0
By far the worse professor that I have ever had! His classes are extremely boring. Attendance a must! Gives way too much material to read & expects you to have it all memorized. Gives weekly pop quizzes! He raises his voice & talks down to the class. He's unclear on his assignments & grades very tough. Gives last a ton of last minute assignments!,0
"He was the best professor I have had.. He is very clear on what he wants, so he doesn't leave you wondering. This is not a hard class to pass, like any class you just have to pay attention. He has amazing lectures, the only real class work (no homework) is in the lab after lecture. Attendance matters, he takes roll.",1
"Absolutely fantastic at explaning things.  His lectures are incredibly well organized and easy to follow.  Assignments are tough, but well explained.",1
"Dr. Baddar is amazing! You will read stories that deal with different types of people and then discuss them in class, and write papers on the human condition elements that were the most meaningful to you. If you read the few short stories, do the hw, and pay attention in class you'll pass easily. Best professor ever!",1
"The class itself if so easy.  All you have to do is read some ancient story and then he'll discuss it in the next class period. There are mini quizzes everyday which are simple. All you do is watch movies. He cracks down on all cell phone usage, even though his goes off all the time. Wont let you leave until he dismisses you.",0
"An insightful class which changes your view of the world. Reading expected before class, amazing lectures with heavy note taking. Study guides for each exam, but get ready to study, exams have a lot of material that require lots of explaining. If you follow his guidelines to success in his class then you'll have no problem succeeding.",1
"Professor Ladon has a lot of knowledge about what she teaches but she teaches the 121 class as if it is a 131 or higher level course. She is belittling when students ask questions and expects students to do numerous hours of studying, whether it be from the textbook or practice problems. She drops the lowest quiz and homework grade.",0
Melody put in the effort for our online class. There are weekly quizzes with either a journal or a forum post. She grades everything within a week and also adds feedback. She is positive and makes the class enjoyable. I have never taken an online course I've liked but she changed that.,1
"I would totally take another class with Scott.  He's excellent, and I really like how he gives you free reign to do the assignments.  Make sure you at least skim the books for the quizzes; he gives at least one a week.",1
"The bad first: Harsh, not very approachable. Waited till the night before a quiz to post slides though hes been saying he's post them for weeks before. Takes forever to grade (didn't get most of the lecture submissions/quizzes back before the final). The good: Hilarious, engages us in class, tests easy, hand writes notes, emphasis on understanding",1
"Super cool guy! His class is super easy, if he likes you, you hardly need to show for class. As long as you do some effort you will pass with an A. He likes people who take his classes for enjoyment! super chill",1
He doesn't give you a review for any test or the final. If you ask questions he makes you feel silly for asking them. He uses the old book and not the one the you are told to buy. Even if you take good notes from the book you could be studying something not on the quizzes/test. and still fail them. He is a nice guy and can be funny at times.,1
"15% curve on exams, lotsa extra credit, extra credit exam, 2 attempt optional exam that drops lowest grade, answers any and all questions with much depth post class and  well during class. Lectures are def way worse than  Sarathy but Sarathy def isnt better since both have same book and tell you to study the whole chapter but Sarathy doesn't curve.",1
PROBABLY THE EASIEST PROFESSOR AT UCBA!,1
"She is very stern and means business, but she is willing to help you in anyway possible.  She really wants you to do well and if you put in the effort you will.  I would love to take another class by her again!!!!",1
"Mr. Eisenberg is really helpful! Like he doesn't try to trick you. If you show up to class take notes and do the homework and study like a normal class you will do great. If you need extra help he is available, zoom, in-person, over email, office hours, and that is something I really liked. Tests are fill in the blank, but not too hard.",1
"I took Professor Chris for the Winter semester. He was fun, enthusiastic, and his lectures were awesome. He gave cool study guides before the exams which were multiple choice and true/false. Prepare yourself to do outlines for your speeches which are timed, which was the toughest part of the class for me. Overall it was an excellent class!!!",1
Thad makes Phys super easy. He gives you practice tests that are very similar to the real test. He lets you know when to pay extra attention. He's funny and makes the subject interesting. Easiest class to pass when taking it from him. Never had a better teacher at Butte.,1
"People seem to either like her or hate her. I really liked her. Her quizzes do contain grammar mistakes which can make answering them a little confusing once in a while, beware of that. Otherwise, she is very nice, very understanding. Asides from the grammar, she is very clear and very willing to help. There's no surprises with her.",1
"Professor Ortega is truly caring, understanding, and fair. He puts multiple blocks of office hours for students and is very passionate about the topic. I really enjoyed this class and learning about the Caribbean!",1
She is the best Biology teacher I ever had.  You study and you will pass.  I learned so much in her class.  Ms. Smith is always available for questions.    I wish she taught Bio 252-254!!!,1
"I love Richard! I took him for Advanced Swim and Water Polo. He's a really great guy. He can swim really well. If you love swimming and are halfway decent at it, take his classes. A few online modules, but it's not hard at all.",1
"I am astounded by these comments. Patti is LU's finest English professor. She is consistently intelligent in lectures, and helpful in her feedback. She actively engages with students' writing on even the most mundane papers. And the comments that imply she is unduly harsh to male students are simply untrue.",1
Professor Broome is quite funny.,1
"adult student class. come to participate and you will learn. sit on your hands you will complain, its that simple with this guy. I hope they give him another class, I'd take it.",1
No Comments,1
"Quinlan is fantastic. He makes long lectures go by very fast with the passion he has for the subject and the fun stories and activities he includes. Usually lets class out early, so don't fret about the four hour class time. Great professor. Tests are VERY difficult, so take notes and study, but he curves extremely generously. No need for textbook.",1
"Very good teacher! Took his land forms class in the spring and liked him so much I took the weather and climate part in the fall. Very helpful and friendly and easy to talk to and get along with. Super funny and nice, even though some of his jokes are kind of corny.",1
Fantastic lecturer! A crucial course if you have any intention of conducting your own research and Dr. McDonald makes the material easy to understand and adds humor into the mix to keep the class engaged.,1
"this class was my least favorite class. the teacher is hot but that doesnt make up for the total lack of personality, he is so boring i wanted to shoot myself in the face every class. plus it is some dumb experimental math class where they give you a bunch of stupid word problems. would never do this class over again",0
"Ms. Polster is one of the best professors, pound for pound, that I have had at Memphis, and she is so precious and is always happy and smiling!  One warning: read the syllabus carefully (not kidding about it), and don't let your cellphone go off in her class.",1
My absolute favourite prof at McMaster! Her lectures are great and she speaks about concepts so clearly that helps everyone understand. Love love love this prof.,1
She talks very fast and when told to slow down she doesnt. She doesnt make a study guide and doesnt go straight off the book so its very hard to study for tests.,0
One of the best professors! He is caring to his students and is always willing to answer questions. The tests are fairly easy as long as you show up to class. You will need the book that is suggested to pass. I would take him again!,1
"hes really calm and collected, does a great job at explaining the material and cares about his students. great professor overall. you will not regret taking his class",1
"very unorganized, and i hate group projects, and in this class everything is a group project",0
"Professor Swift was decent. He had good lectures, so make sure you go to them. His tests were pretty hard. He will answer and go over any questions people have during class, so he was very helpful in that way. When we transitioned to online learning, the quality of learning decreased, but I think he might have just been adjusting to the new style.",1
I actually retook this class because I had missed a lot of online homework so I was confused when the teacher was a different person. But I'm really happy I retook it because I got to learn so much more and from a neurologist's perspective instead!! If I had questions she'd give me great answers and she was really passionate about her subject.,1
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors. Take him only if you are able to work hard. I learned so much from him and this class and I recommend it to any non science major. Really interesting stuff. He cares about what he teaches, just be prepared to put work in. also, he's always up to smoke a cigarette after class.",1
"Mr. Schlorrt, while a tough grader, helped me learn and appreciate the nuances of history more than any other proffessor I have had.",1
"Possibly the worst professor ever. So unprepared. She'd come to each class, and just ramble. She showed up for two of the tests without a test. Once, she had us write the tests ourselves in groups and then she READ them back to us, and gave us about a minute to answer each question. Her excuse? She was training us to be professors. Awful!",0
"Mary is the best teacher! math also isnt my strongest subject, but she made it so easy and enjoyable. i would definitely take another class with her again!",1
"Not the most caring professor, but very straightforward. Tests are straight memorization, but not difficult. Study and you will do well.",1
"This is one of the sweetest professors you will ever meet. He is so kind and understands that this is a gen ed and that we have very busy lives. He also does not give as much work compared to the other Mus200 professors. As long as you attempt to do the homework assignments, he will give you full credit.",1
Great professor! I would definitely recommend him to anybody for learning frameworks.,1
Mr. Humphrey is a really good instructor. I highly recommend taking this course. You will learn a lot from him.,1
"Professor C. Fitzpatrick is an amazing teacher, she cares about all her students. She helps every student in her class become a great writer and makes her students think critically.  Be prepared to write a lot in her class. One word of advice take this class serious because it will definitely  help improve your writing skills.",1
lectures are for videos. the content you teach yourself with the textbook so may as well take it online. weekly quiz based on textbook questions so absolutely need the textbook. overall was very boring but easy class,0
He really knew the material and was passionate about it. He also required a lot which helped push me and helped me really learn the material.,1
In the beginning of this class I was super overwhelmed and almost dropped it. I'm very glad I didn't because it turned out to be my favorite class and a pretty easy A. The readings may seem overwhelming but you only have to skim them as long as you watch the lectures. Professor is very kind and understanding. Would love to take again.,1
"Goes fast through new material/review, but stops and explains if a question is asked. Quiz almost every class period, tests cumulative. Available outside of class for help, but not directly advertised.",1
"You get partial credit for written Qs on exams. Took this course over the summer and was suprisingly not as intense as I expected. I'm bad in math so I struggled with chem math, but still got a B. Turn in homework and labs and it helps ur grade A LOT. No lab practicals and TAKE HOME lab final. I HIGHLY recommend Prof. Z. Really cool guy",1
"delightful, helpful, and a great teacher",1
Shimko is probably the best lecturer I've had. Lectures are well prepared and interesting. The class is graded on three non-comprehensive tests. If you show up and listen you should be able to pass the class.,1
"A real caring professor. Offers students to come to him for help, will read your work and offer advice on changes to be made before he grades your work. Wants everyone to do well. Solid in his teaching, experienced teacher. A",1
"Good overall teacher. He's helpful and is easy to contact outside of class, and the best part is he does a lot of hands-on activities to make sure people understand the content. He uses a lot of real-world examples in lectures, but can get boring over time.",1
"Good teacher.  Read his notes online and thenotes you take it class and you will do good :) Dont bother on buying a book, you won't open it once...",1
"I've learned more in his class than I have in any other at this point. Incredibly knowledgeable, and easy to pass. If you fail his class, you're an idiot.",1
"Excellent Professor! This professor can take you to the next level in your writing, so take advantage of his feedback, enjoy the class, pay attention and you will excel.",1
If u are willing to waste an entire semester without learning a single thing about English u should go ahead and take it.. It seems more like history class rather than English his talks too too much about nonsense and leaves way to much papers and gives no help what so ever with the papers and grades really harsh! Be smart and do N0T take his class,0
"Mr. Perez was by far one of the best professors I have had at riddle. No matter the size of the problem I had he always responded to his emails fast with an answer that actually solved my problem. At the end of my online class, we had a group project where I worked alone. Mr. Perez worked with me to help with the lack of team effort.",1
"Mrs. Fox is a very good professor. Very detailed syllabus, with all information you need to succeed in class. All online, including the book. Schedule to print that includes all assignments and due dates. Fox gives feedback on all outlines of writing assignments to help you improve. She offers extra credit. Fox can always be reached by e-mail.",1
"He's a HILARIOUS German guy, makes a lot of jokes about his kids which makes the class tolerable. Always do the online Aplia homeworks, they really do help. The class is not that bad if you have taken economics before and just because it's ""agricultural"" eco doesn't mean a thing... barely any writing assignments but A LOT of quizzes",1
"The class consists of heavy reading work, weekly reflections, and an overarching group project that is based on the idea of creating a well rounded lesson plan. Note that this is a foundations course, so it was my first ever lesson plan. We were verbally torn apart in front of our class for 10 minutes. Still got an A but it was not a pleasant time.",0
This professor is by far my favorite I've had here at BGSU. Super sweet and fun!,1
"Her class is tough, but she is very sweet, not to mention very funny! I thing there isn't enough time to completely retain the material but I don't think that's her fault, but how the class is set up as in time. Definitely need the book, and will probably have homework on a daily basis most of the time",1
best class at UNO,1
"Incredible! She has so many experiences with advocacy & law. Her ''quizzes'' are more like tests, and are very detailed... but she prepares you well. The readings are lengthy, but she goes over them in detail in class, and is approachable in regards to confusion. Easy A if you participate, do the assignments, & multiple extra credit opportunities!",1
The other recent review is 100% correct. He doesn't acknowledge technical issues and is not clear about what material is on which quiz. The material is VERY disorganized and instructor isn't helpful at all. Either ignores emails/discussions or just responds that he thinks everything is self-explanatory. Many students post questions that are ignored,0
"Very easy class. Most of the material is from Mechanics of Solids. Very little new material. Overall, exams are not bad. In class he just does examples from the book, but it's still worth it to go.",1
"There's a lot of group projects and participation will take you a long way in this class. She's a very caring, understanding teacher. She's funny and definitely one of the nicest professors you'll ever meet.",1
"She is definitely a hard grader and expects a lot from the students. However, she has a lot of useful comments to give and her anecdotes are really interesting. Whenever I have approached her she's always been very compassionate and understanding.",1
"In my opinion, she took a ridiculous amounts of points for items graded and was clearly unfair in her grading.  Her grading comments were very unclear. An example, post 2 responses for discussion boards to meet the minimum requirements. The she takes a point because you only posted two.  How can you take points for meeting requirements?",0
"Lectures are very detailed and, therefore, helpful (if the material is new for you) or boring (if you know the stuff). If you did not understand anything during a lesson, he will explain it several times and not to go futher until you are satisfied with the answer.  Sometimes gives examples from real life to make you understand better.",1
"The assignments given were very confusing, and not much information is given to complete the assignments. I would not take this class if you are looking for a GPA booster as you put in a lot more work than expected for a first-year course. Would not recommend.",0
"Just finised her class, althought the class was a bit of a rush it was still easy. Just have to put in a little bit of commitment and you're good to go. Just do all of her response papers, and don't wait until the lass mins >_<. Again THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHER EVER!!!! Register early",1
Decent lady but she can come off as rude at times. Get ready to sit in the most redundant class. As she drags out discussion and you will listen to people practically say the same thing over and over. I did an assignment early by following the syllabus and she added requirements not specified. Then got an attitude when I brought it up.,0
"Professor Egan is the man. For Eating Ethics, he's a great professor. The lectures are interesting, and he basically gives you an A for attending class. You have to try harder to not get the A in this class. Plus its 4 credits, requires some writing work in recitation, but other than that the class is soooooo easy. Def. a GPA booster, take it!!!!!!",1
"He explains concepts well, but his tests are far more difficult than in class. Should probably go to class if you want to get a decent grade. Don't know a soul who did well and didn't go to class.",1
Not Hot!!,1
Interesting class but alot of work. You have a TP and a quiz every week. Content was interesting but there is a lot to do.,1
Amazing teacher I would take her over and over again,1
"A really great professor! I took him for statistics. Everything on the homework is on the exams (if I remember correctly, there was 4 of them). I took this class online and the lectures were really easy to follow. As long as you watch all the lectures, take good notes, double check your home work, and ask questions, you will definitely pass!",1
"She grades hard but allows you to change your work after she comments, so it is kinda easy to get a good grade if you work at it. Lots of reading!!!!",1
"Routers was a tricky class for me especially once we got into GNS3, but he definitely helps you get through the labs. Lectures one day lab the next day. First half of class you use Cisco Routers and Switches to get used to the CLI and how to set them up. Next part of class goes to GNS3. He gives you all the information on GNS3 you just have to look",1
Professor List was amazing. I wish he could teach all of my classes. He is very patient and super funny.,1
"Dr. Smirnov gives challenging Wednesday worksheets, but he is always almost accessible outside of class for help. Holds reviews several nights before an exam; these review sessions are extremely helpful and I recommend that you go. Quizzes every lecture; exams are usually half multiple choice, half comprehensive. You reap what you sow. Cool proff.",1
"Mr. Trower is the BEST math teacher ever. I had previously taken statistics and failed. Mr. Trower truly cares about his students and wants them to all succeed. He is very lenient on due dates, and is very helpful if you ask him for assistance. I would highly recommend him to anyone! ",1
"He knows his material and he's a personable & friendly teacher. He's a lil oldschool. Do your readings, stay on top of even the small assignments. Grading system is really weird & weighed oddly, so don't come in expecting the normal kind of grading scale or that you know your grade w/o asking him.",1
"Loved this class because he kept me engaged with his stories and the topics discussed. He also brought guest speakers, who are his journalism partners from all over South Florida media, talking about their experiences of journalism ethics. Granted, there were quizzes every week based on book readings but as he said, ""Nobody really fails at FAU"" ;)",1
Love Dr. Starner. Knowledgeable and excellent with students and was my advisor during my college career.  Love ya Dr. Starner!!!!,1
"Dr. Clark was wonderful, even considering having class fully online because of COVID. I still feel like Ive learned the content. He is a nice guy and he likes to utilize group work during class. I would definitely recommend!",1
This class only had one test and one major project. She was super caring and made students feel like their opinions mattered. This class is worth taking.,1
"Professor MacKenzie is a gem- the nicest prof you'll find at McGill. Always makes time for students to see him after class/during office hours. Exams are straightforward with no surprises. An A is v achievable if you keep up. Sometimes he needs organizational assistance, but keep in mind he has to handle 3 sections of the same intro course.",1
I HIGHLY recommend Professor Wood for your communications course! Shes such a great teacher and makes notes on your outline and most of the time lets you revise it. Shes also very understanding with the online transition and how WiFi is unpredictable. You just have to communicate and do the assignments and youll pass!,1
"Pete Wildman is very light hearted, funny and quirky! He truly enjoys what he does and wants everyone to engage and pass the class. I was so scared to take this class but once I met him, I knew I was in for a great class. He is warm and welcoming. He never makes you feel like you're bothering him. In fact, he encourages coming to him for help!",1
"Sam is a great guy who really knows what he's talking about. If you have questions, he will definitely answer them. He really seems to understand students. His lectures are interesting, but my only complaint is that they lack structure and are quite repetitive. Overall, if you come to lecture and take decent notes, you will probably get an A.",1
"This is one instructor that will make you laugh, smile, and cry all in the same day. His story is so amazing, everything he has been through has made him a better teacher and I have to say it was a pleasure knowing him while I had his class. When possible take one of his classes because you will not be sorry you did.",1
I DO NOT recommend this professor.,0
Excellent teacher.  Knows everything and can explain everything to you in like... 5 minutes.,1
"Professor Krutz is a good lecturer and throws some spice into lectures. The lectures aren't too important for SWEN101, but you will be working with a group to complete assignments. Due to the content and its introductory nature, a bad group is not the death of your grade as you are able to carry your team if absolutely necessary.",1
This teacher was not helpful at all to me. In my opinion she is not clear at anything she wants and has a hard time pronouncing words which made it very hard to understand her during lectures. I would avoid taking her classes unless you have to.,0
She is amazing! As long as you go to class and pay attention you will make a good grade. She does a Kahoot before each exam that basically give you the answers to the test. She attended ECU and is easy to relate to. She doesn't tolerate disrespect but she's very fun! Enjoyed going to her class.,1
He talks very low and monotone which makes it hard to concentrate on what he is saying. He does try to explain but his explanations are hard to understand at times. All homework is online which could be annoying.,0
"Prof Platz is young and she relates to her students in a way where she realizes that you do not want to have a lot of work. She is really understanding and helpful if you talk to her one on one. The course material and homework is easy, just annoying. She also is not the easiest grader in the world but if you put in effort then you will get an A",1
I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,0
"Great professor. Very friendly and open minded, which is very important  attributes for any sort science professor. In other words, he has no bias point of view. Plus, he's very logical, and at times he shares his personal information as examples to educated the class. One of the best CCP professor's I ever had.",1
"Good: Extra credit offered, inspirational, great feedback, great learning opportunity about the stock market and presentations, kind, helpful Bad: writing intensive, must read to score high on hw or it may be the dif between an A & B. Don't miss any assignments.",1
No Comments,0
"Of course you need to put the work in to get the grade, but he works with you and is very kind/informative. He gives you material sources so that you can further educate yourself.",1
"I love McMillen he is a fantastic choice for Marketng. You will not regret it! He knows what he's talking about, and makes class fun and engaging.",1
Barcley is by far one of my favorite professors from WMU. He still gave me an BA-A in the course even though I would pull practical jokes on him. Like sending his snap chat name to his former students and telling them to send him photos of puppies. On the serious note Barcley has helped me to develop as a entrepreneur and a great mentor. -AW,1
"Professor Thomas-Reid is by far one of my favorite professors. He makes sure to make a safe space for everyone. He is one of the most caring and genuine professors I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and is very understanding and approachable. His class is based a lot on lectures, and discussions but you will never get bored. 10/10",1
"Hollis is really hilarious. He keeps his lectures interesting, and he knows what he's talking about. His sense of humor is on point. He is very helpful and he's one of those professors who is adorably excited by his subject. His class isn't easy, but he's awesome!  ",1
"This class is hands down one of the best classes I have taken. I her class and COMM 1101 (the general public speaking class) and Dr. Swenson's class is SO much better, more hands-on and I feel like I learned so much more from her class. She is a very kind, fun and engaging professor and I would recommend taking any/all of her classes!",1
"Prof Perez is one of the best professors I have taken in my college career. There are a total of One manual, One Tech Report, One Lab Report and a Group Project. He gives clear instructions on what he wants and if you dont understand he will explain it to you. If you ever get to take him for a class do it, you wont regret it.",1
"Took him last year for 1910 and now just finished taking 1920 with him. I want to stress that Buck is a really nice guy; however, he is not someone you should take if you are majoring in math. His class is pretty easy to get an A in because his study guides are extremely similar but he lacks a good touch in making info understandable. Easy A though",1
"Charlotte is great! Understands the difficulty of learning a new language, explains everything clearly, flexible with work, will meet with you if needed, and conducts a fun class. Knows english and french equally well so professor-student communication is clear.",1
Great class to think critically about basic beliefs.,1
"My feedback will be towards non music majors, I believe that his class is super cool and interesting. As long as you put effort into studying, you'll be fine. He's a kind professor so don't be afraid to ask questions. Tough in the beginning but you will transition through.",1
"She is a very nice woman and caring woman. Her class wasn't difficult, just show up and do the readings, take notes, participate. The only complaint I have is she doesn't input grades very fast, but she is busy with being a student and a mom. It's an easy going and interesting class. She is passionate about soc. Would take again.",1
"I took Prof. Smith's FE429 (Futures and Options). That was tough. His lectures were very unclear, explanations were confusing (at best). Well educated, but arrogant and ignorant of his class. This class was an elective.",0
"If you don't like Mrs. McGee, then there is something wrong with YOU, not her. She is seriously the most amazing instructor ever. She is a sweetheart. If you disrespect her, we're coming after you. ",1
"The worst professor I have ever had. He does not care about the online class at all, does not answer emails or messages. Do whatever you have to do to avoid taking him.",0
"Jeri's a sweetheart, easily my favorite prof in the design department. She's very helpful with assignments and is pretty flexible and will adjust the class schedule as needed if multiple people are behind schedule. A really fun, positive learning experience... can't wait to have more classes with her.",1
"Professor Hartgrove was an amazing lecturer, I enjoyed the way she explained ideas and provided examples. Taking her in person is much more enjoyable. She is known for being unorganized and it took her the entire semester to grade essays, however if you follow the guidelines you'll be fine. Textbook is required and can be used on quizzes and exams.",1
Unnecessarily strict with grading. Gives poor feedback with little to no reasons as to why a low grade was given.,0
"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",0
Great teacher!! He makes the subject interesting and easy to understand.,1
I would recommend Jana. She cares about her students and is very helpful. Always has a smile on her face and an attitude that matches.,1
"Class was unruly and prof was not good at managing it. Class was regularly disruptive and off task. I don't think we finished one lecture in its entirety before I decided to drop this class. The subject matter is dope and prof seems to know it well, but it did not translate well into her teaching methodologies.",0
Jana is a great professor! She makes the complicated concepts make sense and is always great at answering questions.  She is a very supportive professor and really cares about her students.,1
No Comments,1
"Wasn't a fan of the class, she did not seem to care for many people had her select favorites, not a good class for a Caucasian male(history of urban america) class was very anti white",0
"the material for this class was very dry! there is no homework  and you do not need a text book either. There is a quiz EVERY week on the material but he does tell you what it will cover. take advantage of making notes on an index card and using it on the weekly quizzes.  Overall, good eye candy.",0
"I thought Ning was a very good teacher.  There was a language barrier, but he was always willing to explain Physics concepts to willing students who wanted to do well.  He is very enthusiastic and breaks things down to basic easy to understand concepts. He seems very committed to his job and Physics as a field. I thought he was good!",1
"Great teacher that runs a no BS class. Grades are calculated entirely off of tests/quizzes, which he will prepare you well for. Homework is optional, allowing you the freedom to let yourself fail if you don't take the class seriously and practice, but also allows for more flexibility in your studies. Your grade will be a reflection of your effort",1
She's a sweet women,1
"My favorite professor at BU. Really does want you to learn and improve, and can be a bit harsh at times, but he's a really funny guy. Allows you to have rewrites! Knows that 3 hours is a long class but he makes it bearable.",1
"Her class was teh best one I took at NYU.  She's brilliant and interesting, not at all just rote versions of theory.  She's original and interesting and helpful.  Take her class!!",1
"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before.",0
"Sñr. Newall is nice and takes time to go over grammar in class. He's really straightforward about what to expect on exams. His class was my first Spanish class in college- I feel like I got more out of a high school class than I did this past semester, but he's new to USC and he did what he could with the SPAN 210 curriculum. I'd take him again.",1
"She's a proud woman and doesn't deal with people who cause trouble, so knowing a little bit about Spain (where she's from) couldn't hurt... Anyway, I liked her. She isn't a hard grader but there's a lot of work involved (book work, online assignments, etc.), none of which is too hard. Overall, she's a good teacher and explains lessons very well.",1
"If you need a science class take him, easiest class ever; it's almost impossible not to get an A. Only gives three exams, and he gives out study guides, and literally puts the same thing on the exam. I did not pay attention in class and I just made sure I studied the guides and I got a 100%. He's also really nice and super chill.",1
Brutal,0
"All AC 470 classes do the same tests, projects, and homework, but the professor makes the difference. She is AMAZING, and will make you fall in love with audit as well as herself. She tells inspirational stories about her life and Deloitte (she worked there!). Even if you hate accounting, she will make you want to go to class and be the best! ",1
Mr. Ball made coming to class enjoyable. Ive never been good at math but he explains it so smoothly its almost hard to not understand it. His personality is so caring and hilarious. I took him for 0308 and 0310 and best idea yet. Wish he could teach college alg.,1
"Professor Wood cares A LOT about her students. When ""life"" happens she will be there for you 100%. If you care she will also. She wants you to understand the meterial, and also pass her class. She is so smart and makes math easy for those who find it hard to understand. She is my absolute favorite professor. Keep up with the work and you will pass",1
"Only 1 final paper about 8-10 pages. 10 small assignment to lead you to your final paper. Those assignment were really helpful. She gives good feedback, and you will actually learn how to write a great paper.",1
She is really sweet and really helps when it comes to giving feedback on drafts. She gives a clear criteria on what she wants in her papers. Really tries to make sure you do your best in her class. She listens to what you have to say during discussions. The only downside is that she gives a lot of hw but I would definitely take again.,1
"Dr. McDonald gives you everything you need to do well. He will meet you halfway. Put the work in and youll be fine. Be prepared to get called on though. Very scary in the beginning of the semester, but youll get used to it. Dont be embarrassed if you dont know the answer, he will guide you to the right answer or just skip to the next person",1
"Dr. S-C has a very developed understanding of policy & government. I appreciated her candid, honest attitude about our political system. However, the structure of the class could use some work. I did not feel prepared for the exams, regardless of how I studied. Also, the work should've been spaced out more, & instructions could have been clearer.",1
"Class is informative and interesting.  She expects you to work, but you learn a lot.",1
"He kept the class very interesting with his personal accounts of trips he has taken, relevant music and cultural discussions, and was very funny and knowledgable all around.  He even brought in Pre-Columbian chocolate for us to try.  Go to class, participate, do your work, and you will probably get an A. He really is a great professor.",1
"Shaw is an awful teacher. She might know about dogs, but she is a ridiculous and unfair grader, with unclear expectations. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. I love dogs and she made learning about them unbearable.",0
He thinks of himself as the go to source for work advice when in reality he has no work experience or knowledge. He brings politics into class. He also takes off points when grading papers with no explanations.,0
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
"She's the best professor at Allegheny.  You most likely won't get an A from her, but you will learn and grow as a student more than any letter grade could ever reflect.  Students complaining about her grading simply are not willing to listen to her or put in enough effort. Take one of her classes, even if it is only WOMST 100; you won't regret it.",1
"Wolverton provides the proper materials to succeed, but only vocally, so attendance is a must, as well as quick note-taking skills. She was condescending when approached during office hours and the tests are very specific. Reading the textbook is necessary, but the Buddha book's a waste. Success is viable, but only if you're willing to work for it.",1
"Professor royce is amazing , he teaches everything which i upto trend that will definitely be useful for a professional career.",1
"Well lets put it this way. I got an A in the class. I didnt buy the book. I listened to her lectures and took some notes and thats about it. Just do the projects and put some effort into it. I never studied for tests but dont be fooled by that, just take notes during her lectures and you should be fine. Easy B/A :) Good teacher. Chill class, I advi",1
"He's a really nice guy and likes to have fun with the class, but he is a very strict grader and asks you to remember a ridiculous amount of detail",1
"Buhler is a basic professor who is out to prove a point. If you really want to learn the concepts, take an online Algorithms course, or just read CLRS by yourself.  You'll learn more and get your money's worth. 541T is not worth the tuition cost or time. If you do take it, be sure to cheat on HW. Everyone else does.",0
"Very helpful, and gives out CANDY!",1
"Dr. Ortega is extremely passionate about teaching and making sure his students find a genuine interest in his lectures. Class was enjoyable and I recommend taking notes and showing up, especially for iClicker!! Study your notes and his powerpoints and the exam shouldnt be a problem. Highly recommend taking the course, and Dr. Ortega!!",1
"His lectures will put you to sleep within five minutes. Coursework is easy but time-consuming because he's so nit picky. Disorganized and looks for ways to cut points. Penalizes heavily for insignificant mistakes, and claims that's how the real world works. Seems to think students are stupid. Overly critical and just downright awkward. AVOID.",0
Dr. Katner is an okay professor. She doesn't exactly know how to teach to kids in order for them to understand the material. She is very friendly and gives lots of extra credit and curves quizzes and exams. That is what helped my grade significantly.,1
"Show and you still will not receive full points for attendance, not explanation for random grading, either on papers or attendance.",1
"I have taken multiple courses with Nancy and did well in all of them. Fair warning though, Nancy does not care about her students and has no interest in helping you succeed, even when you make an effort and/or are a good student. The classes are worthwhile, if you put in the work you will learn, but expect to do it without her support. ",0
"Professor Woods is very detailed but over all its for a good cause. I would take her class again, just be prepared to put the work in if you want a good grade.",1
"Wilson gets a bad rep for being vague and very confusing, which is definitely true. Her class was definitely interesting and in my opinion valuable. To be successful in this class just participate in class, do all of the assigned work, go to her office hours (she's really nice), and work well with your group. Tests are super easy.",0
He will give you everything you need to know. Just regurgitate it in a different form and you will be fine. Be specific in your answers.,1
Senora Logue is an amazing teacher. You can tell she is very passionate about teaching spanish. She makes class time fun and interactive. I would take her again in a heartbeat!,1
"Lab is a easy A, just show up for the 3 hour lab. The classes you dont need to attend lecture but you do need to go on fridays classes becasue theres a quiz every friday on an article. You have 10 mins to complete it. You'll get 7/10, 10/10, 8/10 on most of them. 3 midterms (one counts as the final). answer the questions from lecture slides!",1
very easy and helpful. she gives extra credit papers. Easy A. language is a lil hard but if you are good with memory take her.,1
Took his online class and he was incredibly invasive with Lockdown browser for all test and exams. Lots of tests and two final exams. VERY heavy on lecture and horrible youtube version to watch his lecture. I would never take his class ever again. And during Zoom reviews he cuts off individuals when they try to talk as well as speaks over any input,0
"Covers a lot of information in class, but if you cannot get it all down in your notes, you can review it on Tegrity.  Lots of reading for each class and discussion on the readings.",1
"He's easy to follow during lecture and he grades everything fairly. If you deserve an A in his class, you'll get it. If you deserve to fail, you'll fail. Great professor overall.",1
bad teacher,0
"I decided to take David's class because of the fact it was an evening class that worked with my schedule. That was a huge mistake, he seems incredibly unorganized, doesn't care to make things clear, teaches as if you learned this 4 times already, and just doesn't care. A student in my class had a concussion and David deemed it not excusable.",0
"If you're a disorganized student, this professor is not for you. She is very clear about her expectations, she is very understanding and have great concerns for her students. She do not tolerate lackadaisical behavior, she motivated me. This professor  wanted us to know the work,  gain an education, not a just a grade. I love her teaching style. ",1
The best CBE teacher I've ever had. Do HW and practice exams that he posts and you should be fine.,1
"This course is a hybrid course, meaning that its a class you go to to simply do work online. MyMathLab helps a lot in refreshing your memory on past techniques and the professor is always there to help. However, he makes it clear that he doesnt teach the material.",1
Ms Gray  is a wonderful teacher.  She makes class interesting and fun.  I looked forward to each class I attended and was very depressed when it came to an end.    As a returning student  my experience was so positive I plan to continue taking courses at U.S. I.  I hope that I am fortunate enough to get another teacher with her knowledge & caliber.,1
"I love this class. Prof Stone is such a nice guy who is always willin to give you another shot at something. His tests are pretty ""off the wall"" as said before but i disagree, if you study the studyguide youll do ok, he really wants opinion.  Def take him for this class!",1
"Compared to other math professors, Graham is pretty good. His lectures are pretty easy to follow, and he explains things better than most. He does not grade on a curve however, and will be pretty tough on grading. He does 4 exams, a final and 10 quizzes for credit. Quizzes can be done as a group. He also assigns homework, but it's optional.",1
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN. materials he teaches doesn't make sense.,0
"Fantasic prof, available any time for extra help or clarification. VERY knowledgeable.",1
"I found Ms. Ridenour to be a little tough, but she was very fair. If you came to the lecture, paid attention, and worked hard on the homework assignments you did well in this class. This was a work intensive class, and the tests were challenging. The snowflakes that gave this professor a bad review, don't understand what college SHOULD be.",1
"friendly and tries hard to entertain the class with pictures, but his notes are very disorganized and doesn't tell you which parts of his version arent in the 'student' version so unless you print them, try to sit with someone who does; relatively easy, nice to have all multiple choice with bonus questions and not cumulative",1
"Professor Liao was very helpful this semester, especially with the craziness of COVID going on. He was very clear, thorough, and would go back if needed. He will answer any questions you have, and would definitely recommend taking him.",1
"She is great at giving feedback and actually helping you do well in the class. There's not too many assignments, just some larger discussions and goals for finishing parts of the research term paper. The class was interesting, but the book was pretty boring. Overall it was a good class.",1
Professor Hargett wants her students to succeed. She provides so much feedback to our discussions and assignments. I will definitely search for her in the future to guarantee a spot in her class. She goes beyond in my mind what is normal for a professor to engage with students,1
"I've been taking college coursework since 2004, both online and in person at numerous Ohio universities, and have yet to get detailed feedback like I did on my assignments. Very refreshing.",1
If you study you will learn a lot in this course. Professor drops the exam with the lowest grade. Many exam questions come from multiple choice class quizzes. Eight extra points added to each exam. Professor cares and is enthusiastic. Easy A if you come to class and study.,1
Professor Russell is amazing! She is so super nice and is so willing to help. The only thing graded are papers. The papers are typically super easy and the instructions are clear. She gives everyone the opportunity to do well as she does paper draft checks and helps steer our paper the right way!,1
Love Dr. Chalk!! Great class that is always interesting and sparks class discussions. Can't wait to take another class with her!,1
"Jimmerson goes by the teaching philosophy that all students are empty cups, and she is an overflowing teapot of knowledge. In other words, she is condescending. She is small-minded; if you don't fit into her definition of what makes a person intellectual, she will treat you as if you're inferior to her. If you're not good enough for her, good luck!",0
"He is a great guy, but study guides are useless. You have to really understand his material. Lots of homework and you have to really work to even make a B.",1
Terri is a very nice lady however this semester I did was not a fan of flipping the classroom teaching method. I had to drop after talking to my counselors. in Will try taking Into to Psych in the spring.,0
"Great teacher, fun and entertaining she covers the material on the test very well",1
"Best math professor I've ever taken in elac, he's helpful,learn a lot,homework and quizzes are online, love this class",1
Excellent professor! Take her class. You will be very happy.,1
"Dr. Kosnik is terrific! The class was fun and interesting. 2 tests, a final exam, and 2 concert reviews that everyone got A's on. I never cracked the textbook, and I got A's on all the tests. The lectures covered everything we would have read. Also, Dr. Kosnik is an amazing pianist, and he does demonstrations on the piano during class. Great class!",1
Attendance is mandatory. She used to be the director of ESL 1450. Its ironic for an English Second Language instructor to be a racist.,0
"Expects brilliance. Pushes you to max if you don't let comments/grades discourage you. Picky. Cocky. Rarely gives compliments, but when you get one, you really earned it. Provides tips on writing you'll keep for lifetime. Writing papers (65%) is whole class. No readings! Still lots of analytical thinking. Ask for help even when he it's not offered.",1
"I read the book 3 times, yet the test had no questions from the book. The second test was word for word from quizlet, but the 3rd test had none from quizlet. I have no idea where she gets her questions or what exactly she wants us to know. Difficult is not even the word for her confusing expectations.",0
Best math professor at elac. She makes all the lectures interesting and fun. Take her if you're not a math person.,1
No Comments,1
"I really enjoyed her class. As long as you go and really try on the papers, it's an easy A. Theres 3 papers with pre assignments before them and lots of help from her to get information for your papers. No final, just a portfolio of previous work. She's a fun and laid back professor. I would take classes with her in the future.",1
"He's a really easy-going prof. Doesn't lecture much. Pretty easy grader. Some of the reading can be boring or hard to get through but he gives you enough time to get it done. 2 group projects, 1 final paper, weekly writing journal graded on word count",1
"Love my professor, very passionate, funny and educated!!",1
"She is one of the best instructor, very helpful.",1
One of the best professors I've had. Quite understanding when it comes to assignment . Have to experience this professor for yourself. Don't listen to other students that spread false rumors about him. Once you enter the classroom you'll realize that those individuals were the problem. He provides additional teaching aids to students.,1
Dr. Hansen is one of the best professors I've ever had. He does all of his exams in class because he is anti-testing center. His tests are straightforward as long as you do the study guide. You can tell he LOVES the environment and he makes boring things seem so interesting. His assignments are made to specifically get to know his students!,1
"Grading criteria was not clear. Gives extra credit, but she won't post it online. So, it is hard to tell if she's really applying them to your grade.  Not very helpful. When explaining something, it was confusing.",0
She is the most amazing prof. I've had while I've been at North Greenville!!!,1
"He was not clear on what he wanted done, therefore the majority of the class including myself kept getting bad grades. Then when you would try to get a hold of him he would not respond in a timely manner nor answer our phone calls. Do not take this class with this professor unless you want to fail.",0
"She knows a lot about this topic. I advise everyone to take this class due to the algorithms taught are real life stuff. Start coding early and ask her for explanations. She cannot write code well. It reminds me of a CS102 student. Besides that, cool class.",1
Dr Lopez teaches her class like youre one of her micro colleagues. She forgets that youre in the learning stages. Shes not approachable. She says that shes there to help but not really. Who says to their students right before an exam that I expect everyone to get below 60%. Not very encouraging. Pick another teacher. I dont recommend her,0
"I was nervous going into Behavior Stats or PSYC 258 at Miramar College. Never had a solid foundation in mathematic, however Professor Lawson does his best to give everyone a shot at moving forward from PSYC 258. You will have to do your reading on the Chps. however he gives you in depth info on what to expect on the test and reviews every chapter!",1
"Pretty good teacher, helps you out when needed. 3 projects arent to painful and the tests arent all too bad either. Subject is pretty boring but he does crack very dry jokes so its makes the class a little better. I would take him again",1
"Thad is a really nice guy. Phys is hard, but he does his best to teach it. Lab is really easy and so are the tests. Recording the lectures helps,  but the tests are harder. He takes a long time to get grades back. Best phys teacher there is at Butte.",1
"One of the best professors at CRC. He only teaches at night and his lectures get a bit boring but show up & you'll get an A! Quizzes are online for Geo300 and geo301 labs and hw are due the next class but he is lenient on late work. Tests don't have anything you've never seen. Rent his E-books on chegg, way cheaper",1
"Probably the worst professor  I have had so far at Schulich (MBA). Clearly isn't well suited to teach the MBA curriculum, as all he knows are theories, but has difficulty relating back to relevant work scenarios. AVOID - take with Friendman.",0
HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! This man cannot teach. He hardly gives notes/examples which is very essential in accounting. Very boring and cannot answer your questions cuz he doesn't know himself. If you take him you will fail. He's late most of the time and reads from powerpoint print outs. You're guarenteed to fall sleep or stare out the window.,0
Not a fan. Hartman doesn't really seem to care too much about her students unless you're a part of the English department. I've gotten attitude one too many times from her and I would not recommend her if you're a student who needs help outside of the class.,0
"McMillen is a great guy. You can tell he likes to relate to students and cares about teaching. His lectures can be long and boring sometimes but he sometimes adds in a funny story, whether it's about the material or not. Tests were not hard but I also took it online because of the China virus so that made it easier.",1
Well respected and honest to his job. Tests you on stuff covered only. No tricks. Nicest guy and will care for you if you are sincere to yourself.,1
The best Psych teacher on campus hands down. I learned so much with out even knowing it!,1
"Dr. Dotts is a great professor! He really cares about the subject he is teaching and acknowledges his own privilege in teaching it. His lectures can get a little boring at times, but it is not difficult content at all. The one word of advice I would give is to not slack on the 20 required hours of field experience. Do the work and you'll be fine",1
"I genuinely loved this professor. She really wants her students to do their best. One thing though I must say, keep up with the readings and take notes during the movies because they will show up in both the midterm and final. Also, keep the phones away, she does have a problem with phones, but come on guys, we spend hefty money for school!",1
"No midterms, only short writing assignments, and one final paper. Drops two journal entries. It is not required to have your camera on. The professor would listen to the students if they wanted something due at a certain time. Easy to reach outside of class.",1
"took her for bio lab, she is the nicest TA youll ever meet. shes lenient, nice, and actually gets back to your emails fast. would definitely take her again and would definitely recommend",1
No Comments,1
"Easy weekly short assignments (1-2 pages each)...and one final paper (5-7 pages), and he gives you a list of topics from which to choose. 75% attendance = A for attendance. It's a doable A. And it counts for a second writing requirement for SAS. Take it!",1
"I took her walking/jogging course. You will be required to track your workout 5 days a week (never 2 days off in a row).  This was difficult for my bad knees, so if you have an old injury, be forthright about it at the beginning of class.  At the end of the semester, we were required to participate in a 5K.",1
"Her class is very straightforward.  She reads you her notes, you copy them down, then take a test.  Not too hard, not too easy.  It is nice to get a Christian perspective of history, I would recomend her.",1
"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors! He teaches it as if you need physics to succed in the world, every class there's a quiz and you have to read the textbook to do well on them but even then the textbook is hard to understand. Goes on tangents a lot and he will always keeps you until class has ended.",0
"Tests are a few long answer questions, but VERY broad. She expects you to be an absolute expert in the subject matter, even though her notes are useless. The question may seem straightforward but it's not. In lecture she normally just rants about her experiences with plants and how amazing plants are to her. Go to the review sessions! Good luck lol",0
I would not recommend taking this class online. It is a HUGE time commitment. It will not be the kind of class that you can just blow through.,0
"She is a great teacher for lab. She starts the class with a short lecture to introduce the topics of the lab, then we break off into different stations to do different activities at each. She gives a study guide for the test and gives recordings for the models which are very helpful.",1
Hes a great teacher and the study groups are super helpful but hes strict about texting in class and about being there for tests... if you arent there for a test day you dont get to make it up,1
Took the class about 3 years ago and had to take it 3x.  It was very difficult but Mr Crittenden was extremely helpful and I still appreciate it and hold him in very high regards.  He is by far one of the best teachers GCC has to offer.  Anyone would be lucky to have him as a teacher.,1
Buck is the best!! He helps students during every session with problems and his test only have one or two surprises-such as new problems. I would enroll in his class again. I am ready for Calc III thanks to his rigorous problem solving and help during his office hours.,1
The instructor was great. The only thing I can say is that she hides extra credit in the lectures so pay attention. If you don't do the study guides you will fail the class. One thing I didn't like was the questions on the study guide weren't worded the same as they were on the quiz. I found myself hunting for the answers a lot.,1
"She assigns way too much work. Her discussion boards and current events are fine, but her worksheets are awful. Even with the textbook it's hard to find the right answers because she changes the wording and makes the questions confusing. I will be getting an A in this class, but it was not easy. I wouldn't recommend this prof if you want an easy A.",0
"Mr. Stacey is a wonderful professor. Keeps lectures interesting with jokes and stories of his vast life experiences. Tests are difficult if you don't study for it, heavily information based but is straight forward and exactly what you're going to learn from the book or lectures. If you're a good class, extra credit or points are possible!",1
Mr. Ed is the reason why iam doing so good in school. the best teacher I ever had.,1
"She often delivers lectures but unfortunately, most of the class isn't listening. She is a decent teacher but I feel like I am back in high school, passed out on a desk, when I am in her class. She is a very nice person and perhaps, if you really care about the course work, she might be very helpful.",1
"Bias information presented without any acknowledgement of different socioeconomic views. Very limited experience as an 1 of the 2 black   .  In class. Poor representation of the black family, overall discouraging and unhelpful. Grading structure is vague and unpredictable. Consider a different course.",0
"I had him fall of 2014 , I have anatomy 102 this semester. my lecture teacher I have now is beyond atrocious, many complaints about him ( Reinken) , I have had questions and my 101 teacher Mr Baumgartner has even helped me here in 102 ,not in his class, a level up class even , and he has been willing to help me as well as others ! He cares a lot !",1
"He is the best teacher ever. If you want to learn, you should take this class. ",1
"I only hope that I can be like Dudrick someday.  This man is always cheerful, incredibly smart, and makes class truly enjoyable.  He puzzles through stuff with us, and never ignores a raised hand.  Dudrick is the man.",1
she needs to stay on top of her grades she dosent seem to be able to get them in elearning.,1
"Professor Baez is extremely nice and helpful. Despite lectures being a bit boring and long, he likes to explain the most as he can to get the point across. Homework is once a week on Saplinglearning, and there are 3 exams. There is also a group project where you are graded individually due wk10. Overall a great class and great prof!",1
"She is a good teacher, but it takes a lot of effort to get an A in her classes. She grades pretty hard, but she also does a good job of explaining and leading you to the right answer",1
Professor Goldman is a good professor with a pretty easy grading scale. Her tests can be difficult with the lectures hard to follow through. Make sure you ask questions!,1
"I struggled with Anatomy 1, but Heather Hug made anatomy 2 crystal clear. Yea, I only got a B, but for me, that was like an A. Anatomy really isn't my thing. She is the best teacher I have had in the Health Sciences Department!",1
Very nice as a non major it was a relief to not feel like the art I was putting out had to be as good as the rest of the class because she understood it isn't the same,1
Dr. Ghosh is a really terrific teacher. She makes it easy to follow the course material online and has a easy to follow timeline for everything in the semester. She answers emails back quickly and usually with a good deal of explanation. She is very fair.,1
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
"omg, this class is a lot of work. We had to do Pearson activities (Short Quizzes, Chapter Quiz, etc.) and then either write a 2-page single-spaced journal or a discussion post. We also have a final exam and a 5 page single-spaced paper. I know it's a writing-intensive course, but it was just too much. She gives good feedback, though.",1
"She's great for students that have some underdstanding of the material beforehand, but she's horribly confusing to those who don't.",0
"I took professor Jassen for Cell Bio as well as A&P 1 and 2. Let me start off by saying that she is very nice and always open to talk if and when you need to. As for her teaching style, I found her extremely hard to follow. I put in a lot of effort but unfortunately it did not show with my grades.",1
"She is very helpful with questions. If you complete all assignments and do decent on tests, you can easily pass.",1
"Hillarious guy, just a lot of on-line homework",1
"I took the online Statistics course this Fall 2019 semester. There is no interaction between yourself and other students, but he responds in a timely manner. A decent amount of homework, media assignments are helpful. The tech was easy to understand, and provides a lot of opportunity and resources for success!",1
Easy class. Don't miss class. Attendance can make your A to a B if you miss.,1
"Prof Allen is an amazing lecturer, EPSC20 is perfect for people who aren't very good at science, he was very understanding and accommodated coursework multiple times during the pandemic. Work is very easy, just stay on top of it and you'll be fine. I didn't do the readings and still passed. Just make sure you understand concepts and history.",1
Horrible professor. Might as well just be a full online class! i just found the class unorganized  and felt lost throughout the class. thankfully i passed.,0
"An amazing person, I dont know of any professor who cares about their students as much as Walker. With that being said, if you are looking to be prepared for a major in Business, I would not take her. It was an extremely easy A but I cant tell you I learned that much about business.",1
"Dr. Arevalo is such a kind soul. Her lectures were intensive, but they were very helpful and I learned a lot. Her exams were tough, but she helped her students to prepare. She was always very helpful during office hours and really cares about her students. <3",1
"an easy course, if you don't listen to the professor.  I just took all of my notes from the book and answered any questions she had in class, and I ended up getting a really easy A",1
He is a good professor! His online class is quite easy if you read the assigned chapters.  His book Social Welfare Policy And Social Programs is a very interesting book to read.,1
"Dr. Braun is a tough grader, and she gives a lot of assignments. However, she is a very nice and helpful professor. While the workload was wayy more than I expected, I still earned an A. I do not reccomend her if you are looking for an easier class, however, she is very nice and helpful if you put in the work.",1
"AWSOME PROFESSOR!!! If you do not like Math classes, you should take professor Rohan because he can motivate you 100%. He is excellent! Very caring, professional, and fair with students that do well in classes.",1
"Took this class on friday class was 4 hours long and honestly didn't even feel like 4 hours. He gives good discussion topics and most of them are to prep you for out of class essays as well as in class ones. He is a fair grader. Tip: take advantage of rough draft days, have him read it. Amazing. Take his class!!! Replies to emails quick too.",1
Awesome. Completely hilarious. Down to earth.,1
You will not receive  specific or constructive feedback on assignments. She will not provide feedback in the rough draft or the final draft.  She is one of the worst online teachers  I have ever had.,1
"Professor Felber set the standard for what feedback should be in an online course.  I've only taken 10 online courses so far, but Felber was by far the most helpful professor that I've had.  Her work isn't the easiest, but she is very fair and consistent with her grading.",1
"Steve is the man! He is passionate about his area of study and is easy to reach out to. A good amount of Extra Credit is offered. Easy to talk to, we spent half an hour in his office going over the contents of Gatorade and my pre-workout!! Take this class!!",1
"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",0
Extrememly easy! Cancels class ALOT! Do all the homework assignments! Guaranteed an A!,1
Professor Huerta was super kind and caring and I loved her. Her class does require a lot of time and effort because of the labs and module projects but they are not too difficult. There are a lot of readings but show up to class and they are all discussed. Would def take her again she gives many extra credit opportunities and wants you to pass.,1
"One of the only times Ive enjoyed a gen ed class and it was all because of Kosnik. He doesnt read off slides like some people. He knows what hes talking about and knows how to teach it. He gets to and through the point quickly, so class is usually short but still effective.",1
Jill is an excellent professor! She is very helpful and explains difficult materials in a very understandable way.  It was her first year teaching at Concordia but she honestly seems to have years of teaching experience. Absolutely loved her class!!!,1
This was by far one of the most difficult online class I have ever taken. Professor Knapp was very available and asked for me to reach out to him. But bottom line I take online classes because I don't have time for any extra meetings. I think the class would have been better had it been in person. I also don't think the book was helpful at all.,1
"I have fun in Ms. Lewis's class. I am so sad that the semester is almost over. She is funny, but at the same time, she actually teaches you things that you really need to know for a college algebra class and future math courses. She responds to emails if you follow the correct format she gives you in the subject line.",1
"FYI, John Street is the former mayor of Philadelphia. It's not quite as easy as in past years, possibly because he has a new TA. It's an easy A, but still a lot of work. That said, the Mayor is an awesome professor and equally awesome person and I learned more in his class this semester than in any previous one. I can't recommend his class enough.",1
"Just don't go to the lectures. You won't know what he is talking about. Read the powerpoints and maybe textbook by yourself. You could get a nice grade if you know when to use those formulas (don't need to know WHY the formulas could solve the problems). Anyway, don't go to the lectures to waster your time.",0
"there are about 7 short assignments (1-2 pages) you don't need the textbook, you don't need to pay attention in class, just clicker points, a 5-7 page paper at the end. EASIEST WRITING CLASS EVER",1
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
"She has very strong opinions and pretends to play devil's advocate. She challenges you to fight her opinion, and trust me-you won't win. She brought up current politics and made her opinions into facts. Would never take again and do not think she should be teaching history, or really anything at all.",0
"Mr.K is a great teacher and really fun to be a part of his class. When he tells you to write something down, it will be on the test.",1
"He is an amazing professor who has your interest in mind. His tests are easy and straight from your notes. Listen and recognize the music. There are descriptions for each song that help a lot. Extra credit is easy. You can sing, play an instrument, or hit pots. Easy A. Attend class in-person/online and you'll get the grade you want.",1
"Dr. Zeng's class was a very difficult subject but she helped us understand the materials with homework, team class exercises, and quizzes. The students knew exactly what to study or exams. She is passionate about economics and is very accessible outside class. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her.",1
Riley was nice. He gave a few extra credit for students who missed a test but anyone could turn in the extra credit. He always gave the questions for short answers weeks before the test. If you ask questions he's always willing to answer. I would take him for every bio class if i could !,1
"Although this professor provided detailed feedback (only if you asked for it), it was still hard to achieve what he was asking for. His syllabus, grading rubrics, and feedback is helpful but he is a tough grader and it seemed rare that your work was up to his writing standards. Also, late work is not accepted and will be a 0 so do not rely on it!",1
"funny professor, tests are easy if attend lecture! however, the powerpoints and recordings are posted online! his grading scale makes it difficult to get A's, but he does offer make up essay for missed questions on exams. very interesting class!",1
"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",0
Not very intresting. Reads off powerpoint. Often gets things wrong. Exams are difficult.,0
"Rick is a funny guy, which will help his lectures stick. But he can come off a bit rude at times and embarrass you in front of class. He is a lawyer though, and with lawyers, the ""attitude"" comes with it. He really teaches you the practical parts of real estate law and you definitely learn from him. I would take his class again.",1
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
"Dr. Marshall is amazing. Her case studies are always interesting and current. She is extremely nice and very open to any topic. The midterm and final were both open book. You do not need the text book at all. However, it is helpful for the tests. It was easier to pull the answers from the book than to google them. Half of the final was a  paper.",1
"This may be putting the cart ahead of the horse but I wanted to forewarn anyone signing up for this class soon. IT. IS. TOUGH. Professor Bliss is very kind but doesn't go easy on you. Get the Skoolers reviews, study your face off and, if you're so inclined, pray.",1
Professor Gray loves what she does but in my opinion she is not the best professor even though a lot of people love her.  She just lectures and has power points that have endless slides.  She often rambles and gets off topic and her tests are extremely hard.  The tests never have anything she taught in class.  Try to avoid her for this class.,0
"She is not clear with her instructions at all. She looks at you like you are stupid when you are answering a question.  She does not listen to your answer even if you shout it, like i have multiple times.",0
"Compared to all the other physics professors that I have heard about, Oks sounds like a saint. He really was a good professor. he gave decent lectures and would answer any questions students had. Would do some demos to make lecture more interesting. Tests were multiple choice and open book, so a little challenging there. You get what you work for!",1
"He give a lot of homework, but it is so easy. His class saved my gpa. He  is such a great teacher.",1
"Very respectful and easy professor. His lectures are very long, but the way he went about them I for sure take a class of his again.",1
I am so glad I had this professor. There were not really any proofs and he taught what would be on the test and explains well. Most of the grade was based on 2 midterms and a final but both allowed notes and were the easier of the questions. If you understand the quest hw then you'll be fine. Office hrs are super helpful. The textbook is optional,1
"Schaal takes tricky concepts and makes them a lot easier to understand. He does an amazing job of finding ways to explain complicated concepts with real life examples.   Tests are hard and theres a lot of homework, but a lot of that is because there's a lot to cover in the class. ",1
She tries to be caring and upfront but her teaching style is not the best. I've learned more from google and youtube videos than from her own lecture videos/discussions. She may make students feel as if they are not trying hard enough even when they may be putting all their time and effort into her class. Quizzes/exams for lab are never returned.,0
"She's patient and is straightforward with the class. If you need help you can find her. ME classes are never easy so of course it's not an easy A. And of course she's VERY!!! attractive, not that effects learning, but hey it makes classy way easier to get through on tough days",1
Iam taking 280right now. Solid reading experience. The book is not horrible to read though. Discussion due Thursday and grades are returned usually the next day. Quizzes on werkends. Fits my schedule. I am not sure about the rrsearch project or long paper assignment mentioned in other reviews. Not in this class. Oh and I like the movie!,1
"There are many negative comments about Professor Graham's class. However, after taking his class I disagree. He won't give you an easy A and makes you work for your grade but he has a really good handle on the material, explains clearly and thoroughly, and is more than willing to meet after class. I wish I could take him again for Calc 4.",1
"This professor knows the material, and is average at teaching it. If you are not in class, than you won't do too well. I had to miss a few days because I broke my wrist, which made the class way more difficult, and she still graded me tough. Lots of papers on subjects  I personally didn't enjoy. ",1
"Professor Burke is AMAZING! You have to read a lot of information but he teaches in a way that makes history interesting. He includes moderen examples, videos, musics that intergrates with the topic and makes it easier to understand. I always looked forward to his class because of his great attitude and his fun teaching methods. GREAT Teacher",1
The class was extremely difficult. Extra credit was given sometimes in class randomly. There were a couple group projects with your lab benches. I studied so much for her tests and read the textbook but still got around 60-70s on her test. There's a lot of grades though so it doesn't hurt your average extremely bad. You need to put in work.,0
"I've never met a prof who specifies using a (TERRIBLE) template for submitting assignments and refuses to let students add/remove space after questions. There's not enough space and all she can say is ""you can format it to fit"". These are equations we're talking about, NOT a resume. Assignments are also not on the actual content ""taught"". Horrible.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I took this class for a breadth and regret doing so. It's is incredibly boring. All she does is drone on and on and no one listens. Awful teaching. There are 5 pop quizzes that the class average is always a 60-70%. If you're going to take this class, take it with a different professor.",0
"Online class, she did a horrible job at teaching the material and when asked for guidance she tells students try not to overthink it or read the book again instead of helping you understand. DO NOT TAKE HER. She also made us write a 10-12 page paper and it ended up being only a completion grade.",0
Joanna is my favorite professor so far! She teaches language in a way that gets you very comfortable with speaking as the classes are mainly conversational while all the very technical stuff is covered in the textbook so we can just focus on specific questions and utilization of things in class. Joanna is also incredibly caring and reasonable.,1
This professor is amazing! His lectures are funny and engaging. His workload is not heavy only a few assignments. He provides a study guide for the two exams in his class and has a couple of quizzes due throughout the semester that are super easy. I highly recommend taking this course to get an easy upper division done.,1
"Prof. Prussing knows her stuff. Yes lecture is boring, but she hands out 50% of your notes in class.Readings are interesting and incorporate well.Just want to say that her TA's DONT deserve to be in grad school, (this means you MANDY DICKERSON). They like to screw people like me that KNOW what they're talking about out of good grades.",1
"I took her Social Justice and Welfare in the U.S. class and I've never enjoyed a class more. She genuinely cares about the well-being of her students. As long as you go to lectures, you'll be fine. She likes to bring in guest speakers that offer different opinions on a variety of issues. Just be careful because there aren't any fluff assignments.",1
"I loved this class, so interesting and really if you put effort into this class you should do well. The biggest thing I can say to remember is to make sure to do everything as there are not that many grades and you will get hurt if you miss more than 3 things. Wonderful teacher and great class, wish I could take it again.",1
"Prof. Longpre brings life experience to his class. He is very respectful and expects the same. His lectures are of great learning value and have a fun part added. He tends to genuinely understand and care for his students and adds in an easy 10% professionalism grade for his classes. .Just attend, participate an do the work for an A",1
Very easy class he explains everything in depth so its very easy to understand. going to class helps understand material tests are easy mainly common sense and the reviews provide answers. i would highly recommend,1
"This class was awesome. Very interesting. He did a take home final which was super easy and interesting. There were online quizzes where you could use lecture notes so read carefully. He gave a lot of in class assignments and extra credit. He's funny and all around an understanding, awesome guy. Make sure you go on the cruise though!",1
"Nearly absent from course most of semester. Finals week and still no grades/feedback from Oct assignments. Multiple weeks between answered questions by students, some after assignments questions regarded were due. Often unclear expectations of assignments, tough to know what to do. Very little engagement from Kristi this semester. Disappointing...",0
"Prof. Jesilow was probably one of the best teachers I've ever had - and I'm a teacher myself, so I'm a tough judge.  Differing from the majority of his CLS colleagues, Jesilow was tenacious, unfailingly dedicated, extremely open and helpful, and genuinely kind and funny.  His grasp of the subject is, of course, expert.  Just a great guy all around.",1
"Dr. Draper's Environmental Policy, Law, and Society class is great. She is well versed in her profession; she delivers clear and concise lectures, and she uses real-world examples. Even with all her credentials (Ph.D., J.D.) she is very much in touch with her students. She genuinely wants her students to succeed in and out of the classroom.",1
"Fun guy. One of the only Austrian-tinged econ profs on campus. He will stare you down if you try to ask a question, but there's not much to ask about. Also, don't just repeat what he says back to him in exams or essays, it seems to make him angry. Not that seeing him angry is a bad experience. If you lookup his journal articles, they're pretty fun.",1
I took Profesor Prasad PBL class for the spring of 2018 and I have to say I've never learned so much in a class. She made chemistry fun and easy to learn. It's chemistry and it's obviously not an easy class and with any science course it' one in which you have to work for your grade. If you don't plan on putting effort into the class do not take it,1
He is a fast teacher and can be difficult to follow in class. He can make simple concepts more complicated than they seem. I had a tutor I met with three times a week and still got consistent Cs and Ds on tests. The quizzes are helpful but his class does not prepare you for his difficult exams.,0
Hardest class I have ever taken.,0
wow honestly I thought this professor was the most passionate professor who enjoys what he does! He is SO GOOD with explaining! He loves answering questions! I was so terrified of  this class but he made it so easy. There was not a single time that I was bored in this class. I RECCOMEND!,1
"The teacher gives NO feedback. Do not expect clear instructions or responses. Poor communication for a communications teacher. Other than that, the class is an easy class as long as you participate. Also, when you try to find out information about your grade, you will receive an extremely rude response.",0
very helpful describe in detail. give a good feedback of your all questions,1
"This course was made up of group projects, class discussions, and student participation. I'm glad I took this during winter intersession. It was a fun class and we discussed very interesting topics. Professor is reasonable, very friendly and knowledgeable. Grading criteria is also very clear. You will learn a ton about gene manipulation.",1
"Professor is so sweet. She went out of her way to offer me honors designation in the class and met with me every week. If you take notes on the textbook chapter before class, you'll be fine! You're able to send your papers to her ahead of time and she gives great feedback.",1
"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Riffe. Seriously so down to earth and one of the most caring professors I've ever had. She makes class fun by making most of her lecture discussion based and is determined to learn your name even in a class of 200 students. One of the best professors at UNCC. if you have the chance to take her, DO IT!",1
"I took him for online classes and I loved it! And when I was supposed to submit my final I couldn't get it to go thru, and he saved the day and helped me get it in on time!",1
"Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself. You won't understand a lot what he is saying. I don't know how MCTC hired him.",0
"I have him for statistics and I must say, I never knew statistics could be fun! Yay for Kevin!",1
"Mr. Goodman knows his voice is monotone, but if you can look past that he is a great professor. All of his notes were on D2L and he would tell you what was important. He also stresses what other students have missed and wants student feedback to help more students learn. Very helpful and caring professor too.",1
"Dr. Richards is scary at first but once you get to know her, you will love her. She is super high energy and knows everything there is to know about books. She has a good sense of humor and is always willing to help you if you ask her. She is strict about things like grammar but overall a great professor.",1
Awesome professor! Very nice and caring and wants to help you succeed! Highly recommend! 4 novels but nothing too long. He likes to talk but encourages you to as well. I would take his class for all English's if I could.,1
Cant teach. Doesnt curve. Dont bother going to his office hour to fight for your grade. Wont give you a point back and will ask is this why u come to my office hour? Caring professor. Sarcastic. Doesnt care about your grade tho.,1
Awesome teacher! Project at the end seemed like the scariest part but we got 100% just for doing it. She's super funny and cares about the individual person you are,1
"I don't recommend this teacher to anyone,  and most of the readings and assignments didn't pertain to English.  She grades harshly on essays and doesn't except late work.",0
Literally the worst professor I have ever had!!! She is not clear at all of what you are suppose to be doing. There is a research project that is the span of the class and she doesn't let you know what to do until the day before it is due and then gets mad that you didn't start it months earlier. ,0
I wouldn't recommend takin Professor Ni. She lectures a lot from her head which is okay but sometimes she forgets and there is no energy in the way she teaches so it's very easy for students to not be interactive with her.,0
Class was very boring; all we did was go over the grammar concepts we already learned for homework the night before. Everything I learned was from reading the textbook. Lots of homework but it helps your grade. It was his first year here I'm sure he will get better! He is very clear about what to expect for the tests and the class is pretty easy.,1
"This guy has traveled the world and knows his stuff. He brings the topics to life with clear explanations, photos, and personal experiences. Like any other class, if you do the work, you will do well.",1
"Literally the best professor in MDC. No doubt about it. I've taken both german one and german two with Herr Morales. It is with him that I have realized that loving an afternoon class is possible. If you really, really want to learn either german or any other language that he offers teaching for, be sure to take him! Herr Morales is simply THE BEST",1
Professor Scoville is a great man with a big heart. I would have enjoyed the class more if we didn't get stuck on the small things and focused more on the larger topics.,0
"She is absolutely amazing! She makes math so easy to understand and if it's not working for you, she will try to find a different way to help you better understand.",1
"He is a very nice guy who is extremely passionate about statistics/teaching. He can get carried away in lectures and cover material that is beyond the scope of the class/difficult to follow.  He makes those that show up to class feel bad about those that don't which is annoying and calls people out for it sometimes. Tests are difficult, use TZ",1
"This professor does make jokes but he teaches more then anything, If a student is really listening they will hear that he is teaching unless they are sleeping in the back of the room, took him for this class and I learned what no other teacher at Molly could teach me: to work hard and value me as a person. He helps the students and guides them too.",1
"Chemistry is by no means an easy subject, but Dr. K made this class manageable. If you have to take chemistry, TAKE IT WITH DR. K!! She is brilliant and her lectures are clear and to the point. Also, willing to help you out outside of class if need be. A very fast paced course, however I learned a lot from her. Would absolutely take her again!",1
I love dennnis. he absolutely cracks me up.  hes a little eccentric but most artists are. i've learned so much from him concerning art and design. i highly reccomend him.,1
"Difficult to please. Makes his students work hard. However those who pass his tests, will appreciate his style of teaching after finishing the class. For those who are new to his class - do your best, and you'll have no problems writing ANY essay or paper in the future. If something is not clear ask lots of questions!!",1
Amazing teacher. Make sure you go to class or you will fail. She will definitely bring the actor out of you. Will defintely help you cope with stage fright. Very easy DEC class for D. MUST TAKE!!!,1
"If I could, I would definitely take Dr. Prasad again! This is my second time taking Human Anatomy at Benedictine and I am understanding it a lot better and have over 100% in the class! She does give extra credit opportunities and the lecture exams are off of her powerpoints and her lectures so pay attention! Put a lot of effort in this class!",1
Has you submit things throughout the semester that go into your final marketing plan and gives lots of feedback so you can improve. Really cares about her students and is understanding when things come up. I wish I could take more of her classes!,1
"He won't make it easy, but you'll lean a lot. He really teaches you to read fine details in every sentence that will make your writing and grammar so much better. He's much more effective at it than any other teacher or professor in the past. I definitely would have benefited greatly from taking this class before my first internship.",1
really a very enthusiastic prof. Made class really interesting,1
"Her accent is a little tough. Grading is clear. Compared to other professors, her class is better to take.",1
"Lots of folks don't like her, I can't understand why (perhaps they just don't like math or they don't try. I really enjoyed Dr. Menzel's demeanor and she was very willing to help.",1
"Very nice, enthusiastic in her teaching, builds good relationship with her students, always concerned for student progress, and very helpful.",1
"Professor Freeman is one of the best professors I have had at UW. He is clearly passionate about data science, he cares about the students and their learning, and the assignments/projects have all been relevant and interesting so far. We are using the textbook that he wrote, and it is very easy to get help from due to his knowledge in the subject.",1
"If you had Pasqualetti for ME18 during F2014, you have the right to complain. It was on of the most confusing and nerve wrecking classes I've ever taken.  For ME145 it is one of my favorite classes in all of undergraduate. It's really interesting and builds off of ME120/121. VERY HEAVY MATLAB for labs.",1
"The professor is very kind and always pauses class to ask for questions. Unless you are interested in the subject, the class is very boring. You spend most of the class/semester looking at weather maps on pressure and temperature. Try and make friends at the beginning of the semester because at the end of the semester you have a giant group project",1
"I don't see why anyone could complain about him.  He knows his stuff, he is enthusiastic, and best of all, he makes class FUN.  Imagine that.  Anyone that wants a good grade in MGMT, take him.",1
"If you want to learn more about Engineering, don't take him. If you want to get an easy A, don't take him either.",0
"An amazing teacher, material taught is immediately useable in your field",1
"Great teacher, Got everyone involved. Graded easy. Made a scary class fun. I definitely recommend her for speech!!!",1
I really enjoyed this professor. His lectures were lengthy and can get boring if youre not super into soil science but he is hilarious and keeps things interesting. His tests are not easy and a lot of questions are from lecture. Attendance was not mandatory but not sure how you could pass without attending most classes.,1
Jim is a great professor. He knows what he is talking about. Would highly recommend taking his class. I gained a lot of information from this course. One of my favorite professors last semester. He doesn't miss class hardly ever and if he does he will find a sub. Very reliable professor!!,1
No other professor has devoted so much time to drafting and helping us with our work in progress.,1
"I really enjoyed this class! Ms. Logue is very sweet and loves to get to know her students and help them achieve success in her class. It's low cost, she supplies everything you need for the course. The work load is very manageable and her lessons are easy to follow!",1
Great teacher for Chem 167. Lectures where clear and went over all the material that was covered on exams. Take Recitation assignments seriously sense that is the material that will show up again on exams.,1
"Smith makes clear from the beginning his classes are designed to resemble the style of law schools: Grades and materials reflect as much. Though you will have to pay for a pack back (mock Canvas) program, it helps aid the discussion and topics of the class. Exams are hard if you don't read but the material covered is foundational to 104 series",1
"Kim is a good lecturer, although things can get boring sometimes. He is very open-minded and kind. After taking this course, I plan to take more ASA courses.",1
"Barger is a great prof and keeps you entertained during an 8:30 am lecture, he is easy going and enjoys class discussions, he marks quite hard but if you put the effort in you will do great! Favourite prof!",1
He knows how to set up a class perfectly and gives homework at a very appropriate time. His lectures are very direct and he does not waste time. He communicates the subject extremely well,1
"First two weeks was terrible but after the first Exam it got easier and easier. Prof. Simona gives a lot of Extra Credit. She is heavy with lectures. It was hard to listen to her long lectures at first, then I got used to it and was able to get a solid A.",1
Literally the worst class I've taken at WCSU. Her grading system is a bust. She is a hard grader & makes you redo your work over & over again. Even meeting with her over Webex is a bust as she just tells you if you don't understand the work then settle for a lower grade. Would never recommend her. This class will end up giving you endless stress.,0
"Kind of strange, but a really cool dude once you get used to his Canadianism. Only complaint would be that his notes on the board end up being pretty disorganized which makes it a little difficult to study. Oh also the fact that it was an 8am class sucked. A lot of people didn't show up or do the readings but all of that is important. Dorky cute.",1
She's clearly passionate and very knowledgeable about her subject. You do have to go to class to pass- you'll fall behind (and/or fail if you miss 20% of the class) if not. You'll learn so much about how to be a good teacher- from personal stories that she tells and from the very useful textbooks and supplementary readings. I highly recommend her!,1
"Prof. Dudley's class is hard, but it isn't really her fault. Marine bio just isn't as fun as it sounds. Attendance to class and labs is mandatory. The labs are gross. The class is easier if you do the reading. She's very intelligent and the tests reflect the lecture material. Outside field trips were boring. This class is loaded with females.",1
He is a great guy. He is class is super easy but this is not enough! If you want to learn something from his class you need to read the book by yourself.,1
"Kristi Wilkum is an actual real, down to earth person and makes her classes fun and relaxing. She engages students and somehow does it in a way that makes everyone WANT to talk and be involved. She has also managed to make a public speaking class fun and enjoyable, and relatively low-stress. Yes, I said public speaking and fun in the same sentence.",1
Very nice teacher and always answered any questions you had.,1
"He is a good professor. He gives you study guides that if you do them, they are word for word like his exams. Any word he says is relevant to these study guides so you need to pay attention.  He does curves. Enough said with that.",1
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"I don't think it matters how hard you study- in taking her tests I used information from her slides, the textbook, and information from other class textbooks and still received below a B on all exams. She doesn't tell you what you did wrong, just takes marks off. She can't use technology and trails off in the middle of her sentences.",0
Probably my favorite professor I have had at UT. Really passionate about the material and makes it interesting. Relates things from the lecture to the real world and other things we might encounter in our fields. No homework; I would say the textbook is recommended but not necessary. The tests are fair and similar to practice problems. Best ever!,1
Professor gives great feedback. Very detailed lecturer and if you go to every class and try he notices.,1
"Prof. Calkins was an awesome teacher! I held an A all year because of the feedback that she gave on all my papers. There is a lot of reading and online discussion posts, but they all help with the major assignments. I would definitely take her again!",1
"Tami was a great teacher that really cares about her students understanding the content. Very patient and willing to help. Exam review guides were great, no curve-balls during exams. She is very clear on what she expects on homework and exams.",1
Tom is the reason I started to love math ;),1
"She is the best clinical intructor i've had. I had her for med surg 1. She's a tough instructor, but if you put in the effort, you will learn a lot.",1
"Over the top intense in lectures but I really do think this is a teaching strategy. Very engaging, hilarious, sometimes goes off on a bit of a tangent on material not relevant to the class wasting time. Did a good job considering this is his first time teaching this course. I found the lab way more challenging than the theory from lecture",1
it's a lesson in life,1
"Very sweet and funny lady. The first test I failed heavily on it, but the rest of the exams was a breeze. Quizlet will become your best friend in this class. There is millions of quizlets for this class. The reviews she gives are exactly going to be on the exam word for word. She always goes off topic but she really cares for her students.",1
"I wasn't sure about taking an online class, I never have before.  And I was also pretty nervous about taking a philosophy class, it seemed pretty hard to me.  But Matt made it SO interesting!  I looked forward to his lectures every week and have expanded my mind so much.  And as long as you keep up with the work, easy A. Best teacher at Oakton.",1
"This professor was great. He was my beginner guitar teacher, after taking the class with him teaching I now have a better understanding of the guitar and I am making great progress learning new things. Practice everyday for at lest an hour, you'll he a guitar player in no time. Learning guitar also inspired me to learn other instruments as well :-)",1
"Words cannot describe how terrible this class was, take Mrs. Pickham if you want to have a chance at passing speech.  And if you do for some reason take this class, be ready to hate your life, dont come in 1 minute late, dont fidget while giving your speech and make sure to let her know i hate her guts, thanks.",0
"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class",0
"Really funny and witty.  Used cuss words every now and then which made us laugh.  Is really down to earth and easy to talk to.  I didn't use the book, just my notes, which there are a lot of, but everyone on the test comes from them.  Show up to class on time, he hates late people, he looses his train of thought.  Awesome professor!",1
One of my favorite professors,1
Loved this class! Intro to computers and not too difficult!,1
Dr. B is a very effective professor and will take time to make sure you understand a topic. He shows great interest in the work and has many years of experience to help. A field activity is required in 101 and it is a great help.,1
"Professor Endlich is great, she is really nice and always there to help. She does give assignments during the semester, but gives you enough time to do them. You do not have any tests or quizzes at all. As long as you do all the assignments you will easily get an A.",1
TERRIBLE AVOID AT ALL COST!!!,0
I took her class online. There are a few assignments but are all pretty easy and it's obvious what she's looking for. She's a fair grader who responds to e-mails promptly. I thought the class was easy to get through and decently set up so I did learn a few things. I would recommend her for anyone needing an online class.,1
Dr. Birkett uses quizzes to help her students gain success. This course is a blended learning course and is easy to follow along. Show up to class and put an effort into the work and you will be fine.,1
"She is a fair grader and tells you what you need to know for the exams. She can be a little rough around the edges but overall is a good professor and teaches the material in a manner where everyone can understand. As long as you study and practice for the exams, the class is not that bad.",1
"3-5 pop quizzes throughout the quarter to illicit greater attendance. The ""lectures"" were interesting and the class had a structure where student input was not only encouraged, but valued as well. She assigns a few papers (one being 2000 words); however, she grades very fairly. Just start on it early and you'll be good. The novels are an easy read.",1
This class is not an easy 'A'. The work load is excessive. I believe she is posting her own reviews on this site.,0
No Comments,1
"What a terrible professor. He rushes through his lectures. We have class Mon and Thurs 8:30-9:45, and this fool always ends it right at 9:30 and relaxes the rest of the day. Tough grader and expects answers in a certain way. Definitely the worst professor I've ever had. Worst part is? You have very few grades. Only 6 hw assignments and 4 exams.",0
"Gail is amazing. After the experiences I had with her in lab, if I were sick and scared in the hospital, I would want her as my nurse. She is very candid, caring, and committed to her student's success. I was intimidated by her at first, but I truly cannot say enough good things about her. She is very accessible and helpful outside of class.",1
"Only covers the surface level of topics while lecturing so youre going to be doing a lot of learning on your own. Also grades the study guide as a test, but doesnt grade it until after the test which defeats the purpose of the study guide.",0
"If you strive for good grades, make sure to do homework and write your papers carefully. The instructions he gives for each paper are directional, in which you have to dig in a little bit to work on, which he demands a lot in class. Be prepared to read a lot.",1
"Loved Darwin. Great teacher. Very helpful. Three tests, four group projects, one paper/presentation. Easy and straight forward. Go to class and you will do well.",1
"Barcley isn't your average professor, and I say that in the most positive way I can. Traditional classroom is traded for a chance at a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship. If you have a great idea for a startup, Barcley has the means, the drive and the connections to take you far.",1
"Class was garbage just like the quarter before, just as unforgiving and overall didn't teach anything well. He graded the homework at the same percentage as the tests and the final was only 20% of your grade. Absolute joke, stay clear of this man.",0
Lulejian comments on discussion posts were constructive and lead you in the right direction. Tests are essay question heavy so make sure you know the material. The online homework through McGraw Hill has great practice tests to help you succeed. Lulejian was also an easy grader who made himself available if extra help was needed.,1
"Dr. Bona was one of the best chemistry professors I've ever had. During my semester we were able to use a periodic table with notes written on it for all of our exams, including the final. Our final exam grade could replace our worst score (if it was higher than exams). She explains topics well, and makes chemistry somewhat fun. 10/10 recommend.",1
"Ill be honest, yeah he is not the best at teaching BUT outside of class he really wants you to do well and acc would help you, so talk to him, he is so kind and understanding and mans acc funny! I didn't expect to do well, but he helped me get the grade I needed!",1
"He's very thorough, and has crystal clear lectures. He makes difficult concepts seem like a piece of cake.",1
"I loved her! at the first part of the class she is very tough, but she is trying to show you that you need to be serious as well, as the class goes on she opens up, and made learning fun. The class itself is common sense, however study for the test because they are very tough!!!!! Overall i enjoyed her class and would take more of them in the futur",1
"if you do all the work and practice, it will be a breeze.",1
This class is an easy A if you follow her grading rubric. She goes over the assignments in detail and if you have a question she makes sure you understand it. There is also lots of extra credit opportunities.,1
WORST PROFESSOR and very arrogant... No student should have to deal with a professor like this! ,0
Fun & interesting. ,1
"Hard, but amazing.",1
"She is one of the most wonderful professors or human being I have ever met. She is hilarious+ a great lecturer and teaches you not only what's in the textbook but also teaches you what's outside the textbook, a real-life lesson. She really cares about students. If you reach out to her for help she would make herself available for you.",1
"Dr. Hoffman is a positive, quirky, kind individual and genuinely cares about his students and their career path. I recommend recording lectures on your phone, and listening to it when going over slides. Exams are similar to practice questions, BCH369 consist of 5 exams, BCH370 consist of 3 exams and 4 homework assignments. I wish I had him again!",1
Honestly every review you read is correct. She was amazing both in person and online. She will give you good feedback and she tries to help as much as she can. Plus shes hilarious and sweet.,1
He is the best teacher I have EVER had! He really loves what he teaches and you can see his passion for the subject. If you don't understand something he is ALwAYS there to help...you just need to ask. The study sessions before the tests are amazing and so helpful. The tests are easy if you study everything on the study guide and I mean everything.,1
"Passionate about his subject, but lectures can be hard to follow. He tells stories with no relevance to the curriculum. What you read and what he lectures does not always equate to the same. To do well on his test, take notes on what he says in class and write that as your answer.",0
"she is stern but really wants you to do well.  if you care about your work then she will go out of her way to help you.  she is always available to help and is really nice when you go see her.  i loved her and wish i could take her again for all my english classes!!! Take her but don't expect to just ease through and get an A, you will have to work",1
"Professor Bardo is great! He is very caring and truly wants the best for all his students. He always asks students for feedback. For participation points just writing him a note and telling him what you thought about the class counted. Your grade is made up of participation, an essay, midterm, and final (both exams are online).",1
"Took Human Impacts on the Environment with Beck. She's a good professor and good person. Do well on the papers. They are worth as much as the tests. Put in effort and you should get nothing worse than a B. Some of the test questions were worded in a way that made easy concepts confusing. Overall, good professor.",1
"Great Teacher! He is very understandable, Comprehendable, and is always there to listen to any questions you may have or help with any probles. he makes class fun and interesting and clear in his lectures. Not dont think you can go to his class and pass without studing because this is not the case. He is very challanging.Top pick for finance classe",1
Dr. Capper is a phenomenal professor! He takes an enormous amount of material and condenses it into a single semester. The keys to success in this class are 1. Come to Class 2. Do your reading and 3. take the time to know your study guide. Nothing will ever be on the test that isn't on the study guide. Easy A if you are willing to try.,1
He is one of the worst professors you can imagine. Talks more about politics than physics. Stay away from this professor if you are actually looking to learn.,0
afd,1
"She has been by far my favorite professor since I've been in college. She made learning enjoyable and fun. Her exams were straight forward and came right from the notes. You have to attend class to be able to fill in the notes, however, she does not take attendance. Overall she's a wonderful professor!!",1
This is the easiest class i have ever taken at KSU. I literally made a 100 in the class. Class is mandatory and the lecture is very long but this is an easy A. Dr. G always extended dates and helped everyone. There are very few asssignments so make sure you do them all. I didnt learn a lot it was basically like a review of math 2008 & 3316. No HW.,1
"You will work in this class, but she is always clear and helpful. I felt like I became a stronger writer.",1
"For exams, be familiar with all problems covered in class, and know how to manipulate equations and logarithms to solve for any variable. To do well, practice problems are absolutely necessary -- the more, the better. The final was hard, so be careful about relying on final forgiveness. I found her intimidating, but she's a fast and fair grader.",1
"You have to be ready to participate in Dr. Duque's class. He will call on you at random. He gives everyone the same grades for compositions, but he steadily increases your grade throughout the semester. You have quizzes after every class and a weekly discussion board. Both exams were take-home and you have a 10 minute presentation with a partner.",1
Nice professor and kind. Lots of extra credits to make up your quizzes. Interesting screening.,1
IF YOU ATTEND ALL LAB CLASSES YOU WILL GET AN A.  HE DOES NOT LET YOU LEAVE IF YOUR LAB IS LESS THAN A B.  SOME STUFF IS CONFUSING BUT HE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP ALL HIS STUDENTS.  HE CARES AND LOVES WHAT HE DOES.,1
"Of the four teachers I had this past semester when all my classes went online, she was easily the best at using zoom and canvas to put class stuff online so students could still access it and her. Def not an easy A but not unreasonable either. She was super flexible about deadlines and stuff because of the coronavirus outbreak which helped.",1
If you can learn on your own I'd recommend her otherwise if you need a walk through of the information in order to learn find another professor.,0
"Professor Dowding clearly outlined the expectations of the course with his syllabus. There were no surprises, but the course was definitely difficult. If you want your writing to improve, take a writing class from him. He is there to prepare his students for writing in the real world. Be prepared for hilarious sarcasm, and to learn a lot.",1
"Great teacher. 4 unit tests 15-20 questions-review is the class before it, he does the review in class and it's exactly like the test just different numbers+if you complete it you get bonus points. 1 final of 30 quest no bonus points. No mid-term. Mymathlab HW due on the day of each test - easy!!! I suck at math but he makes it easy for you.",1
"Ning is a horrible teacher. I dont know why he is there. I ended up dropping his class, if you dont understand math very well, do not take him. Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself.",0
"Take him is you have to. He is a kind person, but very very very boring. It is very lecture heavy and he goes off on tangents that do not pertain to the subject you are learning about. He quizzes you every class and the quizzes do not correlate to the chapters that you read outside of class. He is nice though.",0
"What everyone else said.  Very hard, 5 hrs of homework a night.  A really good teacher willing to help you.",1
Great instructor.  Wonderful understanding man.  Class was a thrill to attend and he made everything easy to understand and use.  Taking his 122 course. He is very passionate about math.,1
"Awesome guy! Helpful, and knows his stuff. His class is based on the midterm, the final & attendance. Hs test are really easy and he seems to enjoy what he is talking about. I would really reccomend him. :)",1
Heyborne rocks!!! One of my favorite teachers. He is always there to help with anything. Take anything you can from him! you won't regret it,1
"It's hard to keep up sometimes, but she is nice and clear about what she wants in the essays. Grades mediocre sometimes, and if you need help, go to office hours because she will help you if you ask.",1
Professor Lee has been a great teacher and is very cooperative but the only problem I faced was that he was not very much frequent with his replies to the emails. But otherwise he is a great teacher.,1
"In my opinion, she is a very caring teacher and is very good at teaching the material. She would have live weekly sessions where she would go over the chapter and would explain the material that we should know from the test. I did feel her tests were challenging and to get an A on the tests seemed hard. Her labs seemed pretty simple.",1
"Mr. Riley a good guy, but a not so good teacher. He flies through his powerpoints, virtually reading off the slide, and speaks without enthusiasm. He does give out semi-helpful worksheets, but over all I learned more reading the textbook than anything he actually taught up front.",0
"You can tell Dr. Beck really loves what she teaches, however her lecture are still very dry and hard to get through sometimes. If you reach out to her for help she will gladly help. If you show up and put in some effort there's no way you should fail this class.",1
She is awesome. She makes you smile when you are feeling gloomy. I would recommend her. Really nice person. Does not confuse you with many information only gives you the important information.,1
"Professor who talks to students with respect. Dr. Brown is laid back and has a great attitude. Isn't afraid to crack jokes, but doesn't deviate from the material. I would recommend this Professor to anyone. It made me happy to come to class and engage. Doesn't go out of his way to make the material difficult, but makes it informing.",1
Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.,0
Amazing teacher. One of the best teachers I've ever had. He is very approachable for questions. Very charismatic and keeps your attention. He is very  entertaining and is full of knowledge. You can really tell he cares for his work and students.,1
"Her accent's thick, but understandable. There're many extra credit opportunities and she grades homework on completion. Her lectures aren't very engaging and it seems like her slides are just too text-heavy. I did better when I just listened instead of reading them. She'll say certain things will be on the tests that aren't. She's very kind though!",1
"JingJing is a cool lady outside the class, but inside the class, she is a whole other person. Lab reports are super hard, tests are even harder and no multiple choice. You can turn in a test and think you got a solid 80, sike... probably a 50. She grades super tough. Oh and the homework takes forever to do and she'll give you like a 35 on it.",1
Great professor! Super understanding and cares more about you understanding the material than grading you. If you show up and participate in the conversations you will pass. Very inspirational professor.,1
"Dr. Hartman has to be my favorite professor so far at Kutztown. She is super understanding of family situations and also spends a great ordeal trying to get to know you, which I appreciate. She gives really helpful feedback. I'd say the easiest way to get an A is to put a lot of personality in the writing assignments and do them on time",1
Words cannot describe how horrible this class is.She is completly unprofessional and dedicated in a cultish way to a belief system that shapes the entire class. readings were absurd and yoga useless. ruined the entire discipline for me. i am ashamed that a university like Duke supports this kind of shoddy teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
I overall enjoyed this class because the assignments were straightforward and interesting. I just didn't enjoy the video project because I felt like no one in my group cared enough to help.,1
"Professor Bush creates his own version of Torts so you cannot look to any outside material. You do not have to read. All you need is a bush bible for the final. However, this is not enough to do well because he is a picky grader and it is hard to know what exactly he wants. It is kind of a toss up in the end. Overall I did like him as a person.",1
"At first he may seem a little rough around the edges, but if you participate or at least pay attention, you'll do fine. He like when kids talk to him one-on-one and will help you if you need it. He hates late work, so always be on time. I did pretty well in this class because I listened to his instructions, as to what he wanted in a paper. ",1
"I had so much fun in 237(and an A). Go to his lecture, listen to what he says. That'll get you an A. Although exams are usually essay, no worries. Just write what he focused during class",1
"took him for eating rights, easiest class at rutgers. there are weekly short assignments that are 1-2 pages double spaced, a easy poster assignment, and a final 5-7 page paper double spaced. everything is graded very easy. the ta's basically give 90s and 100s on everything. only downside is you have to go to class for clicker points",1
"This guy is outstanding! He really cares about his students, he's very helpful, and he makes the class fun and easy. I highly recommend him to everyone.",1
"Melvin Hall makes you read TONS of redundant material;  over 200 boring pages a week!  His tests have obscure questions that are hard to  answer.  The reading makes you fall asleep while slogging through it.  Avoid this teacher and EPS 550, Marisa Crowley (she uses his tons of reading  material ).  This class is NOT about learning.",0
Dr. Kennedy is a chemistry nerd more so than a teacher. He sometimes expects you to understand things as easily as he does or thinks you should. He is a really nice guy and fair grader.,1
He's a great teacher after taking this class at sac and failing this class was a breeze and he is a very nice person. seriously do not get the book save your money. Participation is key in this class.,1
Prof was cool but he reads off the powerpoint that he provides.,1
"Professor Burman is nice, but she is not for everyone. She will give you a zero for painfully minor mistakes but allows you to resubmit until you get full credit. She takes an extremely long time to grade. She lectures 2-4 days per week, reading from a word document projected on the board for the entire class. You cant be even one minute late.",1
"Thrasher isn't the worse teacher. Toward the beginning of the semester while discussing prehistory, when a class member asked her what date the Neolithic Age began, she said she didn't know because she doesn't want to learn something that she didn't believe in. I thought that was the most incredibly stupid thing I had ever heard from a professor! ",1
"Awesome prof! Helpful and funny, class was never boring. Actually carried on conversations with students before class instead of ignoring them. Always welcomed class discussions and never completely rejected someones opinion.",1
You work for it and youll get an A. This is not a class where you can kick back but also shouldnt be your most tough class either .Honestly its fairly average. Everyone who hates here just didnt want to do the work. Do it and youll be fine. I promise,1
Literally a fitness god!!!!!! KEEP UP,1
The work that she expects you to do is reflective of a 400 level course. The depth of questions and speed at which she expects you to finish exams is not something that someone who is just trying to get their associates degree should be worried about. Just take someone else.,0
"Michelle is so friendly and helpful! Her test are challenging, but I learned so much and felt comfortable asking for help when I needed it!",1
A great capstone class with a good level of engagement by the Professor. Clear expectations. No textbook. Cases and readings assigned. Biweekly message board postings required. Write 2 short papers covering cases. Semester long Capsim simulation that you perform solo. CompXM sim (solo) at end of class. Quick grader and would take prof again.,1
"haha, I completely disagree! Prof. Layoun is the best professor I've met at this university!  Yes, her anti-racism lessons may make you think in ways that make some uncomfortable, but God knows Madison could use it! She's shockingly brilliant and the texts she selects are excellent.  Workload is light. Just read & listen well, no need to take notes",1
"Essay prompts are pretty ridiculous but not impossible to get done. In-class presentations do not help in any way, but she seems to think they do. Journal Entries aren't entirely difficult, just a waste of time and unnecessary. Not bad, but I would NEVER take her class again. Terrible teacher.",0
"Dr. Schmurr made taking statistics class more interesting than any other math class Ive taken. He is very knowledgeable, and is very accessible, in class and over office hours. His lectures are engaging and understandable, and he has a good sense of humor. Would definitely take another class from him!",1
"Prof Swift teaches a lot of class in both Cal-Poly Pomona and Claremont 5Cs. As a student in the 5Cs, it is disappointing that the math departments here don't assign him a TA, so we usually don't get feedback on our assignments. But generally, he is good. I like his lectures.",1
"Thrasher was always late. ALWAYS late. When my grandfather died, she was very understanding and allowed me to retake a test, but other than that, when I had questions I received no help at all. Also, her tests are ridiculously long.",1
"Fuentes is very funny and nice, but he moves through material very quickly. The labs are fairly boring most of the time and nearly pointless-- just study the packets for practicals. Lab practicals are VERY tough. He gives you a blank sheet of paper and shows you a powerpoint where you either know the answers or you dont.",1
"She is so awesome, took her online, she gives great feedback! Plus if you don't understand or mess up on something be open and honest with her and she will give you the opportunity to fix it!",1
Lovely prof he is very caring and willing to help. Gives good study guides for exams and the final. Lectures are not super boring like many math lectures. I highly recommend Professor Kuhlman!,1
Real easy on the eyes.  Hubba hubba.,1
Interesting class. A rational approach to religion. Not all are committed to reason. Be prepared to read and discuss the material.,1
"Professor Veliz was my introduction to Computer Science, and it was a great one! He really helped me develop my skills and encaouraged me to be involved in more activities. He is really good at explaining, and accesible outside of class. His grading is also very clear and he is alwasy willing to help. If you can, take him! You will learn a lot :D",1
WORST TEACHER EVER! she took points off assignments because of stupid things like forgetting to put the feet sign. and not just one point when i did this but 3.,0
She teaches this online class as if it were a classroom class which is great. you have to log in at least 2 times a week--which keeps you focused. great experience,1
"This class is completely awful. Three papers assigned for a history class is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even about history as much as it is him trying to teach us how to write in useless styles such as Chicago and Turabian, like why?? He always goes back and changes what he wants and there is no real structure. You'll regret taking this class",0
"There are three assignments that are due throughout the semester, but he lets you fix them until the end of the semester. You don't do anything else in the class.",1
"you have to put in the effort to do well in your class, but as long as she sees you are taking risks with your acting and trying, you can do well.  if you are the type who doesn't like uncertainty in grades you shouldn't take the class, because you won't find out your grades on the acting assnmts (only the written ones).  fun class.",1
"David, overall is a pretty nice professor. However, his teaching style is VERY outdated. You take tons of notes everyday and expects you to know the information based on the textbook&homework. Homework isn't graded but DO THEM, EVERYTHING YOU WILL LEARN WILL BE BASED OFF THE TEXTBOOK. He makes mistakes so please POINT IT OUT to him. Also DONT SKIP.",1
"Dr. Braun is the best professor that I had in my time at UA. Her class is work, don't get me wrong, but it is so enjoyable that you won't care. She is passionate about everything that she teaches, and it compels you to feel the same. She cares about her students. I took 3 classes with her in 3 consecutive semesters. I just wish I could take more.",1
"Boy oh boy, I have zero clue hoe this man has been a professor for so long. This man intentionally fails his students. I spent 3 hours doing a homework assignment for his class to only receive a 2 out of 10!! I've never met a professor who does this. I'm happy he's retiring, he definitely won't be missed. Definitely appealing to get my money back",0
Mrs.Schultz is very hard core about making sure you do what she assigned you. Hard to understand at times. But overall good teacher.,0
"Teaches one of the toughest subject of Information Systems major. If you really want to learn Agile, this class is for you.",1
"Even if you need to take him for accounting 101 DO NOT. Very nice guy, joking and funny but not a single class I payed attention in and makes a difficult class even more difficult to try and learn. Strictly shows youtube videos that we could look up ourselves",0
Hands down my favourite English teacher Ive had! She gives you a lot of readings but the books are actually interesting! She has 2 essays and a bunch of in class stuff so show up and do your readings and youll get an 80 for sure! Super easy marker and gives great feedback she really wants you to pass!,1
She is a great Groups At Risk professor.  Her material is online/power point.  Not a lot of test and quizzes just midterm and final.  Easy A!,1
"A jolly nerdy fellow. He's a little strange, but does a great job teaching the topic. Assignments, labs and lectures are very organized. Very pleased with the course.",1
He is a good professor but it is impossible to do all homework if you have a full time job and is a full time student. It is too much reading and home every single week. I would not take him again because I am a full time student and also work full time. Plus my major is in business and I dont need all this work for my future.,1
"Professor Smith is a fantastic lecturer and a very funny guy. You have to do the reading and there is plenty of it, but his tests are very straightforward. He is the best professor teaching the 104 series.",1
"Dr. Goldenbaum is excellent. She is a fountain of knowledge. Her strong German accent may make her difficult to understand at times, but she is a genius, a fair grader, and an excellent instructor in general. I wholeheartedly recommend Ursula",1
"I loved having DR. Sheridan for my HIST class! He is a super easy grader, I submitted a lot of papers I wasn't 100% proud of and never got anything lower than a 90 on anything. His online summer course is fast-paced, but easy to complete. You have to watch films and read three novels but he gives you the textbook so it's not more than $40 total!",1
