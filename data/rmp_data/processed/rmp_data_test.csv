"She's great! I got an A! Good class to take if you're a film major. I learned alot about how music influences, shapes, enhances a film.  There were 3 quizzes (lowest 1 dropped), 3 papers, a project with a partner, and the final.  A lot of extra credit is offered.  Easy, interesting, fun class!",1
"He's a great professor. Not afraid to contradict you in class, so you'd better have tough skin!",1
"ethics of education is sooo boring. she is very monotone and unclear. the tests are ridiculous (and i went to class and studied). the readings are ambigious and very boring. the only fun part of the class is going to teach at the school. and that's mostly bc dr. wike isn't talking. she's very smart, just boring.avoid if possible",0
Terrible and deleted my last rating.,0
She is making students right now (during a pandemic) get a camera for the computer due to academic integrity issues. Some people have autoimmune diseases some have financial situations where they can't spend money on items like that. I think its fine enough to use lockdown browser but really a camera? I hope she realizes what she is doing is wrong.,0
"I really disliked the class I took. I feel that the broad topic of CIS can been hard to grasp, and I felt that most of the time her lectures were useless. The group project/assignments didn't have clear requirements and felt rushed. She's nice -and knowledgeable in CIS- just not a very good teacher IMO. I struggled for the B. Thank goodness for EC.",0
This is the second class I've taken from Dr. Hansen. I really enjoy his classes and teaching philosophy. Attendance isn't mandatory and he doesn't ask any trick questions. He covers what you need to know and nothing excessive. A very balanced class that didn't stress me out.,1
"WONDERFUL Prof. Really cares about us, gives so much extra time even outside of class itself! even online! real sweet lady. with that said - not an easy A, the test are sometimes quite difficult if you dont put yourself into it. Still, worth it. You actually learn.",1
"Changed an open book exam to closed book less than 48 hours before, is hard to follow during class, can be very unclear during lectures. Moves at an unreasonable pace and does not post lecture notes until after the case/unit is over, which is unhelpful for trying to study or if you have to miss class.",0
"if you have this teacher, don't even try to pay attention, just read the book.  That is all he does in classto teach anyways.",0
"If he gives extra credit? It wont do anything for your grade. The grading criteria is all over the place, hes all over the place with what classes hes talking to, where were at in lecture and reading. And lastly, dont except to pass this class with an A+ if you arent totally in love with ethics.",0
The best teacher I've evee had! Take Danny you will be enlightened! There is something so appealing about him too ;),1
"Dr. Sweet-Cushman the lecturer and mentor is amazing. Dr. Sweet-Cushman the grader is unforgiving. In order to get above a B- you have to perfectly meet all requirements outlined on the rubric and then ""provide further analysis."" Your writing style becomes conditioned to quantity over quality. She likes when you relate topics to recent events.",1
By far the most rudest person I have ever met. She really needs an attitude adjustment.,0
Avoid at all costs. Asks for work far beyond what is listed in the syllabus.  Very vague in directions and then grades you on things you could not have known. Requires 2-3 copies of all lab reports.,0
Insanely demanding. Miss Pillai is really strict and she will call you out if you're not doing the activities or look distracted. She has very helpful Powerpoint and her knowledge of French culture is impressive but she could be friendlier to make class less stressful.,1
This could've easily been a very dry course but Dave made it awesome.  I looked forward to going to lectures because it was like going to a comedy show. And the best part was at the end of the semester I probably learned more in this class than any other.,1
"She was the worse prof. I already didn't like Chem. is high school and good thing I learn most of it there because she made things so much more confusing. You have to memorize everything, she doesn't let have have forumals for the test, make sure you remeber them or your test grade will be really bad!",0
She gives plenty of examples and help in order to get you to write good papers and pass,1
"GET THE COURSE READER! She's a little sassy, but she helps if you ask. This fall (of 2015), we were not allowed to use cheat sheets on every quiz BUT for our final we were allowed a double sided cheat sheet. It was an easy course for the most part, not a lot of ""math math"". I recommend this class instead of STAT 119",1
"Professor Schuster seems to have a passion for history which makes him interesting to listen to, his lectures are interesting and informative.  There are 2 papers and 2 essay exams for the class, they are set up fairly but he grades very hard.",1
"Lois is a trainwreck. For an instructor of a class with the stated aim of ""open-mindedness"" and ""objective analysis"" of political systems, she does nothing but  opine. This leads to a poor educational environment. I don't know how anyone could or would recommend Lois' classes to anyone",0
My favorite french teacher by far.  Honestly I'm not sure how her rate my professor score is so low.  I had her for 102 and she was extremely helpful and generous with grading.  Not only myself but a group of students agreed to take here again specifically due to her kindness.  I wish she was teaching 202 so I could have her again.  ,1
Not a good teacher at all.,0
Excellent professor! Very insightful comments of current events. Interesting materials related to what is going on in Wall Street.,1
"Took this class online over the summer at community college for an easy gen ed.  Figured this would be a cool class to take and easy.  No.  Doug takes this class so seriously - like it is the most important thing in the world.  It is a summer class, at community college, and photography.  Complete waste of time and way more work than it should be.",0
"Professor Miller is a fantastic professor. Although his class is hard, you must keep up and READ THE MATERIAL. But all in all, you will learn and appreciate him so much. If you have a problem and you ask about it, he'll give you one on one assistance. Signed up to take A&P 2 with him, fantastic teacher, really.",1
"She gives off the vibe that she'd rather be doing anything but teaching her class.  Grading is SEVERELY biased.  If you get on her bad side or she just doesn't like you for any reason, you will not pass her class.  Gives out unrealistically difficult projects with no time to do them and no assistance.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
She is extremely helpful and wonderful. I highly recommend taking her for any bio course!,1
"This is the second time I've had this professor.  He is awesome.  Class work in COM400 was more difficult than his COM 323 class, yet his professionalism is amazing.  I've learned a great deal from him.  Highly recommended!",1
"She is energetic about her subject and very helpful & accommodating. Besides this, I did have a few things that bothered me a bit. Going into this class I think it is nice to know before-hand (I didn't), she is not a native Spanish speaker and has a STRONG English accent. I prefer to learn from a native. Also a negative- class is very reading heavy",1
Sandra is a tough but fair marker. You need to do the work to get the grade. She is clearly passionate about the material and does her best to make it engaging even if it's not your thing. Class time can be an issue if students go on off-topic tangents because she doesn't stop them to bring the conversation back which can waste time.,1
"This dude is an embarressment to higher education. Does not answer emails, everything is last kinute. Completely useless to grad students. Just go do something else, what a joke.",0
"Dr. Epstein is a very kind man.  That is the only positive thing I have to say about him.  He is tough, very tough.  I am a physics major,and his lectures and tests destroy me.  He puts everyone through their paces.  if you take him, you will learn to fear him.  YOU WILL FEAR PHYSICS!!! take him only if you have to.  I would avoid him at all costs.",1
"He's new to RIT so he's still adjusting to the environment. At the time of this rating, it was only his first semester here. He tries hard to be helpful, though he doesn't have much experience yet so he isn't always able to answer certain questions.",1
"He explains problems while writing on board, then u don't have time to figure out how he gets answer. Not good with patients for others, you may somewhat understand, then he totally throws u off before u leave class. U leave with confusion and head spinning! And tutoring lab teaches differently. He knows math but not one to teach it!",0
"Mr. Hunt makes Law fun. He is constantly making jokes about lawyers and explains every single term, definition, case, etc. in great detail. He breaks everything down to make it very easy to understand. He included two curves on exams in my class and allowed extra credit as well. I would take any of his classes in a heart beat! one of the best!",1
Dr. Hermann was very helpful. His class was straight forward and I would take it again.,1
I am a criminology major so this course was very important for me. Our first test was supposed to be over 3 chapters and was only over 1 because she got so off topic while lecturing. She is not very organized and poor at communicating with students (especially during finals week). I have never been this unhappy with a teacher.,0
"Dr. Baddar is fantastic at getting you to think around the literature you'll be reading, she's extremely insightful, and she's definitely someone I look up to, but she's one of the harshest graders I've ever encountered. It wouldn't have been so bad if she gave me feedback, ever. Save yourself, don't take a writing class from her.",0
I am at the start of this course and I already want to drop. After watching his first videos of this course that he uploaded I can already tell hes going to make my life miserable and I am going to want to drop out. He legit did not say one positive thing and he makes it known as if your going to have a rough semester with him. dont take him.,0
"Genetics lab is  one of the toughest labs I have ever taken. However, I do not think that this is the TAs fault. She does her best to help out but you have to restrain from falling behind and outside sources along with office hours are necessary as the lab manual is very vague and the lab itself is on a very short and tight schedule.",1
"Robbi works to make her students' lives miserable.  She is a terrible role model, and is destroying the nursing interest.  Her tests are on how well you can take a test, not on any of her lecture material.  Lots of work, stress and headaches.",0
He has a huge ego which causes him to degrade students sometimes. His grading and attendance policies are strict. He will like you if you understand philosophy.,0
"Andy is a nice guy, but not very helpful. His comments are usually helpful, but he takes a very passive approach to teaching, only offering help when you specifically ask for it.  My problem is, if you don't realize you have a problem, how do you know to ask?  Laid back teachers are nice, but only if they balance that with pro-active teaching.",0
Amazing class and professor. She posts her lectures online but it's best to attend her classes since there are many things she omits in her notes. Her classes are definitely worth taking.,1
"This was seriously my favorite class. Every lecture was fantastic and I felt like all the information covered was important. We didn't have any filler assignments throughout the semester, only the exams and the weekly four question quizzes which were super easy if you go to class. Jorgen is an awesome teacher and I hope to take his classes again.",1
"Tells you the first day that you should quit your job or drop all of your other classes and just have his for the semester! He expects your to study minimum 2-3 hours a day. If you're 100% that you'll be in the medical field, then take it. A lot of people dropped his class within the first week. He made me feel like a dumb college student.",0
She is an awesome teacher will be taking all of her classes that I can. She's understanding the work is very clear and straight forward and she responds to all emails and questions,1
Dr. V is fair but tough. If you do the work and ask questions there is no reason you should fail. He asks a lot but overall and fairly enjoyable person to learn and work with.,1
"WORST PROF EVER! DO NOT TAKE HIM. He is a extremely socially awkward man who does not know how to answer questions or teach a lesson. His way of ""teaching"" includes skipping the entire lesson throughout the book and doing about 30 hw problems without explaining the theorems and with horrid, sloppy handwriting. Also, doesn't give any sort of review.",0
"do not take this class I repeat do not take this if he is the instructor , really horrible grader , doesn't try to help, talks around the point and can never be straight forward.",0
"Basically it was like he was speaking a different language. Him and his ""games"" were a waste of time. I just stopped going and went off what I learned in HS and passed. Get Busch instead, the difference is like night and day.",0
"Elmore is the coolest teacher I have ever had.  He is a really chill & funny guy.  He's just not that great of a teacher.  He will give you loads of homework that he expects you to know (most of the class didn't know it) and when he does ""go over it"" he just does half the problem and gets bored with it.  However, just try and he will give you an A.",1
"Roberta will do everything in her power to lower your grade. She'll close online quizzes early so you cant do them, she'll take 10% of your grade away for handing in a word document over a PDF and she doesn't post power points or any helpful learning material for exams. You wouldn't learn much from her lectures, nor will you be entertained.",0
"She was an amazing teacher. She was very helpful with anything that you needed, in lab she was very hands on and demonstrated anything that you needed. She would spend the first 15-20 minutes of class to go over any questions that you have about the lesson before.",1
"Hard marker, unclear.",0
"After I took this class I decided that I wanted to go for it and become a writer. I am now taking more advanced classes and working on my writing all the time, with Brad's encouragement all the way.  He is a GREAT teacher and anyone who gripes about him is probably some lazyass who never bothered coming to class and failed.  He knows writing!",1
Lisa is great! She works so hard to make sure that every activity in class runs smoothly. She is really easy to get a hold of and she is so passionate when she lecturers. Participation is critical to the class though but she lectures are great. Its a great class!,1
He honestly should not be teaching math at all. This class is a joke! He is extremely unclear when he teaches and he makes solving problems 10x harder than they actually are. He also freaks out about the smallest things! Avoid taking him.,0
She is very good at explaining things if you do not understand. She gives pretty quick responses for the emails. I highly recommend her for Anatomy and Physiology.,1
no a good idea!,0
"Professor Mancini is great at what she does! She loves teaching, and will make the class enjoyable. The assignments she gives are very easy. My class was a hybrid and it was still easy to follow. She gives you credit for showing up to class, so don't skip! Overall I would recommend her!!",1
"Very nice guy, but not a good professor. Hard to understand, little information in his lecture slides, and his tests required so much detail over a lot of information, which  made it difficult to succeed. Try to get a different professor if you can.",0
This class is not terrible but his teaching style is so dry I have to drink a large coffee to stay awake most days. I recommend taking the online course but overall it is an easy A as long as you do well on the exams,0
"Professor Guerra is one of the coolest professors in UCF's College of Business. He used tiger king to make concepts such as litigation and common law much more interesting. His videos aren't boring, and the content just isn't very challenging to understand. Watch the videos and read the assigned readings and you will undoubtedly get an A.",1
I was very interested in this course but I did not like her style or the lack of clarity from the teacher. I would not take a course with her again,0
What I saw happen was that more than half the class was so demoralized and afraid that they just gave up because they knew he would fail them if they said anything. We were not being lazy or afraid of putting in the work. It was the teaching that was missing. Professor Fontenot shows up makes a few jokes and leaves. The TAs were just like him.,0
He is very convincing when it comes to acting as if he has no idea what students are up to. He is a very good writing teacher. I was able to improve my writing skills drastically through his Humanities course.,1
"This professor wants you to work. Wants you to figure everything out on your own. If your a marketing major, you have no other choice but to take him. I support his method and would reccomend him as long as you are prepared to work! If not, I would highly reccomend you change your major because he can become a challenge.",0
Tests: Does not allow students to see scores after test. Many answers are not in the book or have 2 answers which can not be researched without seeing the test. Expects students to drive to her Blue Ash office to see test or meet with her.Can't skip a questions and come back to it-takes up time searching for answers that aren't there.Condescending.,0
"To be honest, Judith is a bit nuts and can contradict herself at times. For example, one week she told me to completely change the premise of my play and the next week gave another student an idea that was identical to mine. However, she knows what she is talking about and you will come out with a great product in the end.",1
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
Marks is not a teacher I would recommend. All we do in class is read the book then do homework online which is not helpful at all. I hate going to class and he is a very tough grader. It has made me loathe Spanish this semester. He is nice but just not a good teacher.,0
"This professor is a total jerk who is only interested in his own opinion. If you type a paper and he doesn't like your view then your grade will definitely suffer. If possible, take anyone else. He is the absolute worst prof. I went to him for clarification on a grade, and he gave no assistance. I am an A student who received a D!",0
"Her tone is always condescending. Especially since shes smiling 24/7, even when irritated. Her instructions can be extremely vague but then she's very specific about what she wants from you. If you miss class then that's at least 3 grades going in as a 0 cause she'll put the report that's due the next week in as a 0 as well",0
Horrible Instructor. Does not communicate whatsoever. Pretty much getting paid for setting up blackboard & leaves you on you own afterwards.,0
This class was really easy. Attending class seemed really pointless. Read the book and stay on her good side=easy A.  Robi is often very negative and an extreme workaholic.,1
"Great professor, really knows what she's taking about. If you pay attention it'll help you become an overall better writer. You gotta work for your grade, take her up on her offers. All in all, great professor who makes you work for your grade. I'd take her again.",1
"This guy lost my papers, and gave me an incomplete for the semester due to his mistake.... also very bias in his opnions - caused a lot of stress for no reason and didn't learn much from him",0
"Her class is pretty interesting especially the debates if you have a lively class. Although her homeworks are unbearably boring, long and intense. She assigns 25+ page articles and you have 2 due every week. She is still a great professor, no tests just homework and an analysis paper due at the end of the semester.",1
"jean is awesome! I am so glad that I got to be in her class. She has taken my thoughts about education to a new level and she has truly brought out the best in me. Her class is fun and she does a lot of projects. No tests. If I could take every single class with her, I would.",1
"Good teacher, definitely a take. Not too difficult and expectations are very reasonable. Pretty good amount of reading, and if you read it all an A should be very easy. Not a tough grader.",1
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
"Does not teach course material whatsoever. Talks for hours instead about barely related topics, and students are left to teach themselves. That's fine, though- not only is the textbook a better teacher, it has a better personality too.",0
This class was very boring but it is an easy A. There are a few quizzes and three tests so it is not too bad. I did not use the book that was needed and I am doing just fine. Take this class if you need it as a LASC,1
Easy grader and assignments for each week take under an hour.,1
"Had him for Calc I, really easy!! Tests are from homework problems, and just memorize couple of theories.",1
"Dr. Arnold was wonderful. She had great passion for the material. Though she wasn't always perfectly clear, she was excellent with clarifying when necessary. She also had a keen interest in students exploring their interests, and so was very flexible with projects. As long as students were eager to learn and willing to work, she was wonderful.",1
I was sick for two weeks and he never emailed me back. I asked him so many times for extra help because I wasnt doing well and it wasnt until I was dropping because I was Failing that he did. He basically told me I wasn't ready for this class and it seemed as if he wasn't really willing to help me get on track. Probably the least caring prof ever.,0
"Barely uses Blackboard. He posts homework assignments with solutions that are barely legible and some solutions are incorrect.  Dont bother going to class. He takes the easy way out by just deriving formulas and going through theory, rather than doing examples. 65% of the class failed the midterm and he told those with low marks to drop the course.",0
"She seemed to be very caring, but was a terrible teacher. We never once actually went through a power point. She would always leave it on the title page and then go talking about her life. Though we never once went over any actual material she still expected us to take the test which proved to be very difficult. Must buy textbook to pass.",0
"Proff itself isnt too bad at teaching. She is nice and caring, but very strict. Her tests are alot more difficult than other proffs. Take any other proff if you want a good mark, or else youre risking your gpa!!",0
"Frank is definitely the kind of teacher that will change some people's lives. I am currently leaving this class with not only an entirely different perspective on life, but also a deeper appreciation for smaller things. He's one of the nicest people I've ever met, he even stresses you call him ""Frank"". I highly recommend his class to ANYONE.",1
"Lots of quizzes and homework, no final exam, just a big group project with 5-8 other people, she tries really hard to make it interesting but it just isn't and the concepts are just annoying to have to remember, we get a cheat sheet for exams and she grades attendance. Easy class but veryyyyy boring...",0
"Professor Pearl is a very solid teacher. He has so much experience in the Business field and really provides great advice and knowledge to the class. There are 3 exams and there is a decent amount of homework. Overall, very good class and an easy A!",1
"Excellent in lecture, readings were helpful. An easy grader, but helpful as far as evaluations and how to improve your work.",1
"Erkoc is a very fair teacher. He teaches a very difficult subject and does his best to simplify things. If you pay attention in lecture and have a natural inclination to Programming and Excel and will devote the work to the projects, an A is very attainable. Beware though if you miss class and do not learn the tricks on Excel/Arena",1
"Here at Montclair, Professor Booker is a solid choice. Although her class can seem long and boring, her class is basically an easy A class if you show up and do the work. She does talk a lot about activism, but I didn't really mind it, because most of the time she's talking throughout lecture. I don't know why she has so many bad reviews...",1
"I took Math 1000 online with Danny Dyer and he literally did NOTHING. The TA's marked assignments in their own language and they offered no clarification nor did he. He used someone else's lectures for the entire course and always took at least a week to answer emails, which isn't helpful when the assignments are released 4 days before they're due.",0
"He was the worst professor I've ever had, the quizzes were hard even if you study and read all the lectures and slides. He wasn't helpful with the project or the final exams. I would never take him again.",0
"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors! He teaches it as if you need physics to succed in the world, every class there's a quiz and you have to read the textbook to do well on them but even then the textbook is hard to understand. Goes on tangents a lot and he will always keeps you until class has ended.",0
"Her grading system will not always make sense. I took her her class online and got a zero on one of the Essay. Had the Essay checked by online classmates and they were mostly positive about my Essay and I met most rubric requirements. Unfortunately, her way of accepting ""credits"" is from a different perspective.",0
"I took him for both ENC1101 and ENC1102. Mr. Forde-Mazru is pretty clear on how he grades, following all assignment requirements will pretty much get you an A on your papers. He is extremely helpful and understanding toward his students,  always open to office visits and responds to e-mails quickly. Pretty chill and funny, I enjoyed his classes!",1
One of the least caring professors I have ever encountered. He. Does. Not. Care. He is downright rude to students. I once mistakenly addressed him as Mr. instead of Dr. and he replied very rudely. AVOID!,0
She is nice and will do makeups but she has got to be the worst math teacher ever. She doesn't even know half of the stuff she teaches and she doesn't know how to speak English but when you talk to her in Spanish she gets bothered.,0
"Professor Lombardo, is probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. He's super helpful with every assignment that is given and clarifies things when need be. I had issues with my project and he helped me every step of the way and made sure I understood what mistakes were made so I wouldn't make them again. He's a great professor. ",1
"She tries and fails to relate to students. She lectures about the exact same topic day after day, ad nauseam. She is probably one of the most boring lecturers Ive ever had to sit through.",0
"I was really disappointed with the way this class was taught. I found the lectures to be sloppy and confusing. Many mistakes would be made during and corrected by students. Overall, the lecture was not helpful to me which made the content much more difficult to learn. I feel like this was a class you had to teach yourself through other resources.",0
"Professor Wood is the best. I'm so happy I took her. I wish all instructors were like her. Seriously, I'm telling the truth. She cares about her students. You do need you book. Take her class if you need or want to take COMSTD 2.",1
"Terrifying and bizarre experience. ""Accidentally"" marked my answers wrong throughout the semester and then continuously denied it, repeatedly pretending like they had no idea what I was talking about. One of my exam grades went from a B to an A because of these erroneous deductions. Very, very scary.",0
He is nice but very confusing and the quiz level doesn't match his teaching.,0
"Personally I felt the course was a bit unorganized and formatted in an usual way. There is a lot of reading and the course is broken down into multiple assignments. If you put in the effort, it's possible to get a good grade in this class, it can just start to feel dragged out pretty quickly.",0
"She is a tough teacher, makes it harder than it really is. Her test are made to flunk you. Her labs are poorly designed, also uses Physio Ex which is irrelevant to anything we do. Don't take her unless you can remember an entire textbook with powerpoints and useless animal facts.",0
"Shes the worst prof I have ever had at bsu. She doesnt care youre a college student, she doesnt care if you have to wait until pay day to buy her mandatory expensive textbook ( which she only wants you to buy bc her weak writing is included. Certainly she did not publish anything decent) shes no willing to help. She always thinks shes right",0
"Dr. Keeling is kind and very patient. Her concentration in young adult and children's literature shows and makes the class much more interesting. Quizzes follow the day's reading, just 5 questions. Small group discussion before class compilation is helpful and fun. She is very clear about grading and her expectations and will love to help you!",1
"Love Dr. Conrad. She is very straightforward, not to be mean or too tough, but realistic and cares about how you do. I wish more professors would lay it out like she does. Need to keep up on reading, homework(sapling), and attend office hours, she is amazing at helping you understand concepts of you take the time to seek help.",1
Jeri is an absolutely amazing teacher. I'm looking forward to  taking another class with her in the future. She grades all work very fairly and is willing to help you with just about anything. You have a lot of freedom when doing all of the projects! This was my favorite class of the semester!,1
"Lectures have attendance taken because you can't learn from anywhere else, and she makes it impossible to learn there. No notes, nothing. Just hope you heard what she said. Heavy and unfair grader, don't expect an even decent mark if she disagrees with your thesis. Also, lecture pop quizzes that spring up out of nowhere, somehow even in seminar.",0
"One of the best English professors that I have ever had. Makes you look forward to going to class every day. Personable, kind, and has an extremely fast email response time. Very willing to help and accommodate, making the class go as smooth as possible.",1
"She is super nice to all of the students. She cares about everyone and she wants her students to grow. There is textbook reading and many discussion posts. If you are present, you will pass. She is organized and communicates to students a lot!",1
This class was easier than any class I have taken ever. Super easy credits and Caitlyn is great. The tests are legit the practice jeopardy games.,1
"Although she may have been teaching communications for the first time, it is no excuse for the level of difficulty the class was. She assigns way too much homework, never gives due dates until the last minute, and grades way too strictly. I think she bit off more than she could chew and we as students payed for it.",0
he is a very helpful teacher. he is funny too! before he give you quizes he will give the answers right before the test. if you make a bad grade on one of your papers he will let you revise it to get a better grade. very easy teacher!!!,1
Very disorganized. Class work isn't difficult but is useless and expectations are not clear. Out of date information taught. No grades were give until the end of the course. Did not learn anything I didn't already know going in to the class.,0
"This was the worst professor I've ever had! not only is he completely unclear about his assignments but he has absolutely no regard for anyone's privacy and he will tell your business to the whole class. His grading scale is ridiculous and between his monotone lectures and his rambling on about unrelated topics, I found myself frustrated daily!",0
"If there is any possible way to avoid his classes, DO SO!  He is a very smart man, but has absolutely 0 teaching ability.",0
"He does not go through any examples and just shows the answer. Rather learn on my own. Spends way too much time explaining concepts and its hard to follow along since he struggles to speak fluently and constantly says ""uh"". His lectures are the opposite of engaging you'll wanna just teach it yourself and wish you switched to another professor.",0
"This class met once a week for about 3 hours or so. He spent each time playing music while talking over it trying to describe which genre the music belongs to but Its incredibly hard to memorize which genre a song aligns to when he talks over it the whole time. Some of his teachings are outdated and when you try to correct him, he gets mad",0
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
late marker. had to self learn course.,0
"Took his phil1301 class and we were behind all semester. 4 reflection papers, 1 page each, super easy and based off of readings. Lectures have nothing to do with readings/papers, but he takes attendance. It's not for a ""grade"" but uses it to determine bump grades. Super scatterbrained & drags on topics. Maybe his higher level classes are better tho",0
Really nice and sweet teacher but make sure you do your work because you might think its an easy class if you skip or fall asleep don't its an easy A class cant get below a B if you do your work,1
"This is the second class Ive taken with Prof. K and I wish I could take a third. Shes one of the best teachers Ive ever had. She wants you to learn, and tries to facilitate that in SO many ways! As long as you participate and communicate, her classes are awesome.",1
"REGRET taking this class. Yes, she gives EC but that is because she knows a large chunk of her class will fail without it. The quizzes and tests are worded tricky and even if you study, do the review and read, her test questions aren't clear.",0
"I loved Professor Bigler! She does not hand out grades and WILL make you work.  She is very intimidating, but do the assignments, volunteer in class every now and then, and ask questions when needed and you will do fine. Not a hard class by any means.",1
"Dr. Hanson is a professor who teaches cohesively and honestly.
 
 The class contains a heavy workload of note taking and small and large papers almost weekly. Although it's labeled as a freshman level class, it feels more like an upper division class.
 
 Not recommended to non-History majors as a class to fulfill your History requirement.",1
"Horrible teacher. He is inconsiderate, and is very unwilling to help.",0
"Awesome prof.  Goes over everything in class in  a lot of detail, makes midterms and exams easy. If you can write an essay, you're set.",1
"Oh boy, this was not what I expected when I signed up for his class. I barely passed this class. Its true, he didnt teach and he didnt prepare us for the longest and worst exam of of life. Pure hell with him. At the end he let us retake exams and that helped me pass but I wouldnt ever take this again. F ++++ for his teaching! Worst professor!",0
This professor is not good! She wants everyone to rate her the best on here. Like who does that she just isn't good at all. I wouldn't take her if I were you.,0
VERY BORING! Avoid him if you can and use high school calc notes. I only took Pre Calc and they was more helpfull than anything he could offer!,0
"OH DEAR GOD KILL ME NOW! I DREADED this class every wk.the tests are beyond hard,& he shows the first films EVER made in EVERY country.try to take cinema 2 to avoid this.NEVER out early.nice guy tho.i just thot his exams were way too hard.BUT I HATED THIS CLASS",0
An amazing teacher. He will teach you the ins and outs of government. Take good notes and you will succeed.,1
"I did terrible on one of the essays, but his comments were useful and way more detailed than feedback I've gotten in other English classes, and helped me get a good grade on the revision. Lectures aren't always exciting, but were useful, and I liked that he always tried to show us how concepts were useful beyond just his class.",1
"take chem of cooking. the class is easy and dr vohs is very good. fun,easy class. not enough cooking though.",1
"Overall, a great professor!  Sometimes the notes that he provides on the board get a little unorganized and he goes through the material quickly so listen carefully!  Notes AND lab activities are both covered on the test so don't forget to study the lab activities as well.  I made copies of labs for study in case he collected them for grading.",1
She was one of my best professors I have ever had!! She was very kind and caring! If you show up and pay attention to her lectures it'd be hard to not get an A (you don't need to take notes bc she posts her Powerpoints on bb). I highly recommend her!!,1
"I took her class in summer of 2011,and I couldn't have asked for a better instructor. I would gladly take her again in the future, just for fun. HIGHLY,HIGHLY RECOMENDED.",1
"She thinks that she is better than everyone else, when she is truly not! She thinks that all the attention needs to be on her, and does a good job trying to make people feel bad.",0
do not take this class if possible,0
"He is a great professor that is always willing to help! As long as you do your work, you will pass his class.",1
She is the worst math teacher that I've had thus far... she never gives enough examples and I always find myself confused and reading the text book to try and figure out whats going on. If that's your cup of tea then i suggest her for trig...,0
"Took him for an online Intro to American Lit course. We had to do weekly discussion board posts, read 3 books, write 2 papers (about 3 pages each), and write 2 short essays (about 1 1/2 pages each). Sometimes the reading can get frustrating, but as long as you don't decide to read the day before an assignment is due, then it shouldn't be too bad.",1
He is a great professor! A lot of homework so prepare to work your butt off. Quiz every week but its a group quiz and its fairly easy. He grades pretty tough and is very helpful and always try to help you get obtain an A. Tests are long and hard but study the review sheet as they should be some what indentical. Great professor!,1
"Laid-back guy. Doesn't seem to take teaching very seriously - he canceled class twice to stay home with his son and took a whole week (3 classes) off to complain about the election. He also canceled the final since he ""doesn't believe in exams"". Class is mostly discussion.  Will single out anyone w/ a different opinion, and offers trigger warnings.",0
"Prof. Druffel is my favorite professor so far. She is really caring and wants you to pass. I was worried about taking a chem class online, but she split the class up with recorded mini-lectures followed by a quick 2 or 3 question quiz after each. Labs were done with breakout groups but were overall not too bad. Loved the weekly pet pics she posted!",1
Dr. Hart has a vast knowledge on biology. The major DOWNFALL of her is her teaching method. She is very unorganized. She goes all over the place with her lectures and gets distracted very easily. Most of the time she wouldn't even lecture. She would just talk about herself. Then she would squeeze in a TON of information in the last 15-20 minutes.,0
"extremely intelligent, one of my favorite classes of my college career. it was evolutionary psychology, senior seminar. man i loved that class. i think if people think it's boring it might just be they're not that into the material or something.",1
"Gets angry that people don't take her class seriously, and acts incredibly demeaning to those who ask questions. I wouldn't dare ask a question that she might think is stupid, out of fear that she'll give me a snarky response in an annoyed tone, making sure the whole class knows that ""you should know this"".",0
"Amazing professor, excellent class where I learned lots!  Dr. Fredrickson is extremely helpful and is a great character to work with. Would absolutely take another class with him.",1
"Bad professor, bad man",0
Awesome!,1
"We had a paper that was a minimum of 6 pages, due over one weekend (3 days to complete), and it was worth about 40% of our grade and it took him about a month and a half to grade it and it was after class was over.",0
"Gave papers made classmates revise or else itll hurt your grade.. didnt have class the last two months, still had essays due tho!",0
Syllabus says you are not allowed to contact the professors. Backtests aren't relevant to what you will be tested on. PILOT tutoring wasn't helpful. 3 exams make your entire grade. Grading system unfair and system to ask for a regrade basically doesn't exist. I took an exam in October and no one ever responded to my regrade request.,0
"Dennis didn't teach anything and was extremely disorganized.  He was unavailable for help if you needed him with lots of other obligations and other students...plus he didn't even notice if you were in his office.  His grading was abstract, and he was totally confused himself.",0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE HER! she is super nice, funny, responds to emails quickly. I don't have anything bad to say about her. I appreciate having her there as someone i look up to. She presents very clearly, connects with students if you make an effort, and has a wonderful personality",1
Dr Kelley was a great instructor. She provides rubrics for assignments and gives great feedback. This was an honors class and we had 10 annotations to do which were kind of hard. Shes very responsive to emails and gives extra credit. She provides all of the notes needed on class instead of a textbook which is great!,1
"He is a super easy professor, but he will put you to sleep so fast. He gives a good amount of writing assignments, but they are all really simple. Lots of grades so it is easy to make an A. Requires attendance. He let me redo a paper that I did bad on and then he gave me full credit. Nice guy, just boring.",0
Perez rocks. His class can be a little confusing at times but if you get clarity with him and visit him during office hours you will get an A. The paper you write will be a semester long process but visiting him and working on it will pay off in the long run.,1
"Compared to Wilson for Intro to music, she is probably 10 times harder, 10 times less helpful, and does not need to be teaching an intro class.  Its there for students to get an easy grade by doing a lil work, not the work required for a 3 or 4000 level class. Shes ridiculous.",0
"Overall, I loved having Jim as a professor and enjoyed listening to his stories and experiences. The class consists of a lot of busy work and assignments. Assignment expectations can be disorganized/unclear which was frustrating at times. Gives study guides which consist of book pages from the textbook that you need to read for the test.",1
"I really liked Professor Pearson, she is very clear about what she expects but allows you to venture out into your own ideas. She's super easy to talk to and is really understanding. Lots of books, but they are all super interesting. Luckily my class was super talkative so we always got into in depth conversations.",1
Good class for getting your feet wet in a lab. She is helpful and gives you clear instructions on how to write a lab report. She also provides great feedback once you have turned in your first lab report. She graduated from umbc so she understands what being a GES major is like and she is able to help you more because of that.,1
"Alyssa is incredible and makes sure that all students are confident in their work. Despite the numerous papers and homework, the deadlines are reasonable and she is always easy to contact. Great professor (don't forget your jellybeans)!!!",1
This course is a tough one. Sister Derby takes a very long time to grade the projects which makes it difficult to improve the next project. She's not very helpful until after the projects are turned in. Again this is frustrating when you are not aware of the many resources available to research until after the project is turned in.,1
"Hes a nice man, but this was the worst class Ive ever taken. The first 1/4 of the semester was a waste because he quizzed the class on the different edition of the book. Class average was a mid/low C at the time of the final. Syllabus is inaccurate and the final exam was cumulative without a study guide. Do not take this class.",0
"Amazing Professor! Extremely passionate, charismatic, and cares so much about his students! He does a great job at explaining pretty challenging stats topics and wants you to actually understand whats going on with statistical analysis. He gives you all the tools you need to succeed in life and his class!! Go to class or watch his online lecture!",1
"She was a great teacher and an even better friend.  I will remember her for a lifetime. Plus, she very pretty, hmhm.",1
"Avoid this professor, She is extremely rude. Not approachable & she will make you feel stupid. Grades are always your responsibilty but providing education is theirs. She has no conceptual understanding of this. Reads off old slides and if your answer isn't verbatim it is wrong. Participation is encouraged but makes you feel dumb when you do!AVOID!",0
"There is no reason to fail one of this guy's classes. He will take as much time as needed so that everyone in the class understands how to work a problem before moving on. And he is always willing to give extra credit on tests. I highly recommend him, whether you're good at math or not. Also had him for MATH 1710, and made an A.",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had, I wish he could be my professor for every class. You learn so much in this class, he makes it really fun too. Expectations are clear, questions are always answered. He is laid back and very good at creating a comfortable environment for his students. If you get the chance to take a class with him I would.",1
"Goodman was really nice, and the class was an easy A. He takes attendance, so you do have to show up. Always pay attention when he's talking about the requirements for lesson plans, because they're kind of hard to find on d2l. He lectures off of a word document, which is pretty boring and hard to pay attention to. Overall, really nice guy.",1
She has a clear criteria on written assignments and will make the assignments reasonable and doable as long as you put the effort in. Her exams could be quite tough since it's a lot of information. She's try to help you as much as she can but you need to reach out for her for help.,1
"Mr. Prey is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Yes, his tests are hard. You have to study, and do so regularly, but you will make memories. You will learn a lot, and you will get out of your comfort zone. I had a tough time with the content in this class. There's a lot to learn, but he makes it as easy as he can, while making you work for it.",1
Don't take it out on me just because he didn't give you a good grade.,1
"Nice guy.  Great sense of humor.  Took his online course and tests were extremely hard.  People I've talked with say his in class tests are easier. Assignments weren't bad.  Not too bad overall, but you had better know the material backwards and forwards before taking one of his online tests.",1
Dr. M is great....you will enjoy any class with her!,1
Makes you work terribly hard,1
"He's such a brilliant mind! Granted, this class isn't easy; it requires a lot of reading and intellectual reflection. However, Falcon (doesn't seem it but) is very approachable. He has an unmatched passion for teaching, and expects students to step up. He's certainly shaped my way of viewing the world, and I'm taking another class with him.",1
"If theres anyone that can take an easy concept and explain it in such a way that leaves you more confused than when you started, then this is your guy. He's smart but he's not a good teacher. This guy needs to go back to working for some company because HE CANT TEACH.",0
"If you can avoid her, do it. The worst professor I have ever had. If you have her I recommend dropping the class if you can. I have no understanding why she is still teaching.",0
"Worst teacher I've ever had. She often seems very clueless, she just gave us a test that was over FIVE chapters and SEVEN power points, with 85 questions. She draws pictures on the board frantically that don't make sense. Does not tell you what you need to know for a test even when asked she will not make a study guide. Not organized or effective.",0
"Karen is a great math teacher, I personally don't like math and have struggled with it in the past, but she makes it easy to understand and is always there to help.",1
"Very serious and straightforward. Don't even try being funny around her. Still, I LOVE saying her name!!",1
"Brilliant, so helpful, and absolutely made me a better actor. (Also have a little crush on him and his family.)",1
"Dr. Allen is very knowledgable about seismology and is always ready to field questions, no matter how ""dumb"" they may seem. He is always enthusiastic even though students may not be. Great class: pay attention or re-watch a course capture and you should be fine. Probably the best class--3 units--to get the L&S physical science breadth over with.",1
"He was a really awesome professor! Of course you have to actually try, and pay attention or you will not do well. He really relates the information to teachers and KIN majors, he also provides everything you will need online. I would not bother buying the book, I never opened mine& got an A! :)",1
His grading system is extremely frustrating.  He grades harshly with no feedback to give you room for improvement next time.  His grading system is ambiguous  and inconsistent.  The works studied are borderline X-Rated.  He specifically tells you not to use any outside research.  You must accept only his interpretation of the material.,0
Shes a really good professor,1
"Patty definitely does love the subject she teaches, and is a very nice person.  However, her classes are very dull and boring, and usually cover material that never appears on tests.  Her marking is also really hard! I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs!",0
"I strongly recommend a course with Professor Drake. The class I took moves at a quick pace and requires careful study of notes taken during lecture. It also required reading 6 books, watching a few movies and reading some essays/articles posted on the course webpage. Professor Drake is an incredible resource for UM.",1
Best teach Ive ever had! Made me want to be a tax accountant,1
"I took him last semester fall of 2015. He's a funny guy, and he knows what he is talking about. Very organized with his lectures. Interesting class. Homework isn't hard and not a lot is given. The most work you'll do is writing research papers, and they have to be 3 pages, which isn't much. I say go for this class.",1
"I was terrified to take Speech class, but this professor immediately addressed that and helped to ease the anxiety. He didn't make it easy, but he made me learn and grow in front of crowds. Really appreciate his style.",1
"This professor was very unprofessional. He was immature and unnecessarily rude when answering a simple question over email. When I asked for feedback on a grade I received he insulted my work and made false accusations about my lack of effort. I did well on every other test and assignment but his opinion on my ""creativity""  hurt my overall grade.",0
Just gave the exam. Fair exam. Great prof who knows how to engage students,1
"David is incredibley intelligent however not a good prof. Rambles, spends the first hour of lecture playing music videos, repetitive and monotone. The content has the potential to be so much more interesting. This course has really put me off from indigenous studies. However it's an easy A, attendance is not mandatory and marking is very lax.",0
"If you want to cover an entire chapter in an hour and a half class period and be quizzed over the material almost every single class, she's the teacher for you. She sits at the front of the class and lectures with a monotone voice so it's hard to pay attention. Since she covers an entire chapter in one class, it's hard to catch up if you fall back.",0
Worst teacher ever for a summer course. Very unorganized and lost my work.,0
Never responds to emails. You can miss one or two classes in the beginning. But do not miss in the end that's when the big assignments are. The final and the midterm are fun. you get to design them yourselves. If you miss too much class she is not very helpful and does not care whether or not you pass.,0
"Terrible Person. she may be the worst professor at IU. Does not care if your family members die she will refuse to help, make any exceptions, or even respond. Awful wretched women. IU should fire her. This woman gets off on kids failing and begging for help. Again awful racist lady.",0
Professor Niu is a really nice person and her intentions are to help you but her teaching style is bad. She does not explain in a way you'll understand and may be unclear to comprehend. Do not take her if your math skills are not sharp.,0
Awful teacher. You can not ask her a question without her making you feel like a fool. She will assign quizzes back to back and they count for a big portion of your grade. She is not an easy grader either. If you have to take physics I strongly encourage you to look at other teachers. Not to mention she's so boring while teaching.  Learn from me.,0
"Even if political theory is not your interest, take Stoner if you need a social science class under your belt. This guy can can make any topic interesting. I Loved the books he assigned us. Easy A too. 80% of multiple choice questions on final are selected from the 2 previous exams.",1
"Wendy's a great professor.  She's accommodating,  engaging and genuinely interested in what she's teaching.  The subject matter was difficult and sometimes a little abstract, but at the same time she's very willing to give out A's.",1
Lizza is overall a nice guy. I feel bad mostly because he talks for an hour 20 and no one listens because he never stops talking. This class was a waste of time and effort. There isnt one paper you will get better than a B on so be prepared. The midterm is also heavy on the readings so make sure to buy the book and actually read,0
"Another great class where if you do your work, read, and write, you'll be rewarded with great grades.  Dr. Crews is a challenging teacher who expects a lot of his students.  Perhaps others haven't done so well, because they're not capable of focusing on college-level work.",1
"ENT 3114 ""New Venture Lab"" is all about a semester-long product-prototype & business-plan development group-project assignment. It is almost impossible to get an A. You will need really reliable group members. Standard group sizes are 6 to 8 people; split between 2/3 business students and 1/3 engineering students. It is very stressful. Good luck!",1
"Almost 100% sure you will regret taking her. She is the worst teacher I haver had in all of my schooling. She doesn't respond to any of her emails or texts. She also grades with her eyes closed, she is very inconsistent and does not provide explanations. She will give you 100% on the first half of the test, and 0 points for the rest. Horrible.",0
"Though her class is lecture heavy, she is very good at teaching. She draws out a bunch of diagrams to help you understand. The only reason why people don't pass this course is they don't memorize/study/put in the effort. I took this in the summer for 5 weeks. ASK HER FOR HELP!!! She's really nice. Thank you Dr. Yamazaki!! I learned so much!!",1
"There aren't many tests, but you do learn a lot by participating in discussions.",1
He has no idea what he is doing. Extremely confusing and rude. His notes are chicken scratch.,0
"Tough but fair. Interesting, knows her stuff. Pay attention & put in effort, & you'll be fine. Quizzes/tests mostly short answer/essay. All PowerPoint lectures, but not on BB, so take good notes. Only homework: textbook/outside readings, all relevant & on quizzes/tests. 3 papers/projects: easy, due at end of semester. Recommend her class for GenEd.",1
"I would NOT recommend this professor. You WILL have a quiz EVERY SINGLE day you have class and they cannot be made up. It is awful and she does not teach, she expects you to learn on your own.",0
"Her labs are awful. Her classes are okayish but could be better. You read powerpoints, you get the questions from book. You read both book and powerpoints, you have no idea where the questions came from. Tests are hard, not because students don't read it, but because the questions are vague. She does give bonus points , which is the only good thing",0
"Dr. Haldane does a great job of making the class interesting and relevant to what students want to learn about. This class was very small and so it became largely discussion led. I would definitely recommend Dr. Haldane as she communicates what she wants on assignments very clearly, and doesn't simply assign ""busy work.""",1
Jean is an absolute doll. She cares about all of her students and will fight for you. She is really an inspiration and I am so happy that I had the opportunity to take a class with her.,1
"If you want to take nutrition and not be so extensive in research, don't take Dr. Kelley. The amounts of homework and requirements made me overwhelmed at times. She does give good feedback and is preparing you for a university, but i felt myself saying she was extra with it a lot of the time.",1
RUN! DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! Boris Maizel has to be one of the WORSE teachers Ive ever had. Find ANYONE else but him.,0
Least organized professor or academic advisor Ive had in my three years at MSU. Would not recommend to anyone. Never responds to emails. Irresponsible and lectures were basically useless in teaching me anything other than whats happening in her life not the course. Truly sad the lack of care she gives in teaching class.,0
"If I took this course in person, I would not get an A+. The weekly tests were the only reason I did well, and I could not imagine going to his lectures. He explains the math concepts really complicatedly, and I memorized everything. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Took calculus in high school and did very well, but Coop's approach to teaching isn't very helpful. Write down his in class examples, but try to read the book for further understanding",0
"Professor Zlesak is one of a kind! He is very easy to get along with,  and goes above and beyond for his students. He is availble outside of class if needed! He cares about his students, wants to make teaching fun, and he brings snacks to class!!!",1
"I found this course very hard and I regret take it because my GPA went down after taking it. The material is very heavy and hard to understand because its not clear about whats the course is! I am in a program of the education department and the course is EDUC, but it doesnt have anything with education. Do NOT take this course, VERY HARD!",0
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
"Painfully boring lectures and takes 15 points off for 2nd absence.  Class participation is a must. If you are abnormally enthusiastic in class and she remembers you, you can get a good grade. ",0
"Professor Burrows is the best of the best. Take her class, you won't regret it. 10/10 recommend.",1
"I took him online. His work was super easy. Only required a discussion board, which you only have to respond to one person and then a journal. But when it came to the Mid-term & Final, he gave no review. They were each over 7 chapters. The hardest tests I've ever taken. Aside from that his online class isn't too bad.",1
"She is the worst prof I've ever had. If you ask her a question, all she ever replies with is ""read the textbook"" which is also written very poorly. The Mobius quizzes are the literal definition of torture. It is timed 1h and you won't know how many questions there are (involves a lot of calculations as well). I don't understand why she is a prof.",0
"He can be interesting, but he records and posts all his lectures and slides online. The text was very interesting. He is a bit rude. Had no problem until grades were released and it said I hadn't taken the final, which I had. He ended up losing my scantron and giving me a lower grade then I had earned. His TA was useless.",0
"Excellent Professor, fun in class, teaches from experience, very open for questions and down to earth. He has been one of the best professors I have ever had! I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in criminal justice and policing",1
"Professor Ratner's class is beyond dull. He stands in front of the class and reads off the slides the entire lecture. 3 exams and 1 project. No room for error. His ""curves"" are points reimbursed for mistakes that he made on the exam. He's also pretty inconsiderate, he doesn't care about your situation unless you provide hard proof. Dont recommend.",0
"There's only one word to describe this one: loopty-loop! But yoga is cool so take the course. Hint for the final: Sikhs avoid meat not because of compassion for the animal, but because humans are not designed to ingest the adrenaline flowing thru the animal at the time of slaughter. You were not going to get that one right.",1
"Amazing professor! Loved her course! You can tell she loves what she teaches. She's also super nice, understanding and helpful.",1
She doesn't answer emails. She gave me a 0 on an assignment that I completed. Only gives two tests a midterm and final which are take home. Never get any quizzes.,0
"Honestly probably the best professor I've had at FandM. She comes off as tough at first, and she can be if you slack off, but she is also very understanding and caring when needed. Her lectures are amazing - she is incredibly knowledgable about her subject. You will learn a lot from this class if you put in the effort. 10/10 would recommend.",1
She is the best art teacher I've ever had. She gives really good suggestions and has a very good eye for what needs work. She has taught me so many new techniques and has helped me navigate things that I struggle with. She's very kind and won't embarrass you if your art isn't the best.,1
Liszka was very boring and defensive. She isn't open to other ideas except her own even if they are just theories like evolution. When I stated it was a theory so she got very defensive saying it was FACT. Umm no? So I would not recommend her because she is very bias as a professor. Lecture heavy!,0
"Arrogant to the point you felt her lectures were less about the material but more about how she climbed her way to the top at any job she worked at. Disappointing to hear her say, she took others people's jobs away and how she went about it. Watch out Clark  Professors!!!",0
"He can go off topic a lot. Sometimes he doesn't talk about other cultures unless an exam is near. I noticed he talks a lot about Christianity than any other religion, mostly not in a good way. He's passionate in what he loves but barely knows how to teach it. You pretty much have to read the textbook to understand the class.",0
"Extremely pleasant and helpful, always willing to listen. Tests are not overly difficult but a good deal of studying is required.",1
"Dr. Nelson is a great professor, because he was able to teach me chemistry when I have very little aptitude for it.  If you need assistance outside of class, he's more than willing to assist you. If you need to take a physical science course, don't miss out on Dr. Nelson.",1
"He expects way to much from his students, doesn't give us guidelines of the course and whats expected of us. He's tries to be funny and mean (which he is) but then in turn it makes students scared to ask questions, then he gets mad and yells at us that we arent asking questions. Buddy curved our midterm form 23% to 46% ... he will give everyone F's",0
Awful professor to have if your an athlete at the school. I had her and she expects you to learn new material before the class and do the homework that you have not been lectured on. When i had a game i had to miss the class and she would not accept the hw because i was not there to turn it in when i was already gone. Would not take ever again.,0
"Was a nice guy, his lectures sucked though. Got sidetracked often. Fit too much material into tests and quizzes. Posted previous exams online and did a lot of copy pasta, so that helped. Went easy on grading of papers. He would assign 100s of questions and would make it all worth 5 points. Gave a lot of EC to those who stayed for the whole class.",1
Better than most of the high school teachers i had!,1
Ryan was a chill professor to have for 3001. He genuinely wanted his students to pass and was obviously interested in the material. I really enjoyed his class and would definitely recommend him!,1
"He is a very hard professor.  He does have favorites, but he does not punish those who are not his faves.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but he does it to make you think through what you learned. IF you are up for a challenge and really want to learn something- he is the prof for you!",0
I loved Dr. Pittman. She really cares about her students and will do anything to help you out if you put the effort in.,1
"Professor Miller is very old-fashioned. He is very willing to help students outside of class if they need it. It is almost impossible to get an A in this class, even if you're putting forth 100% effort into all the tests/quizzes/presentations/etc. Not too heavy of a load at the beginning of the semester, but the workload picks up at the end.",1
This class blowed! He didnt teach us anything. Had to figure out everything on your own. All quizzes where on excel.. sorry kiddos!,1
At first I was super annoyed with her lectures it was super difficult to sit through 3 hours of lecture then be expected to practice what you were just shown-wore me out! But I stuck in there and if you put in the work and support what you don't understand with tutorials then you can get through it! In the end I learned a lot!,1
"His lecture was heavy and did not help my goal to earn from what I've learned in his class. His office hours were a time conflicting with my other class. I asked him to meet at a different time but he refused it. Nothing on the test looked similar to what I've reviewed. Overall, he won't affect me anymore. I will do it better this summer school.",0
Best ECO professor !,1
"Horrible teacher! The textbook basically taught you how to do math. He did one example of a lecture and the rest was up to you to figure it out. I love math, but he made me hate it.",0
An educator should never make you feel stupid for asking a question. We are in school to learn. I found this professor to be very difficult.,0
This professor is great! Juarez at first had me a little worried because we turned our desks 3 rows on the left and 3 on the right to face each other on the first day of class. And there was a walkway down the middle. But I actually loved going to this class. I learned a lot. I enjoyed the visitor presentations we received.,1
"I had Lutfi for 110 as well and didn't like his teaching then and I didn't like it again this time around. He is extremely confusing, he jumps around in his lectures, he is awful at communicating through email, and he made me feel dumb every time I went to office hours. It would be a million times better of a class if he was not the one teaching it",0
"Professor Hegbloom cares a lot about her students. She will learn your name and teach you a lot. However she is rather unorganized, takes a long time to grade papers, and assigns several long projects. She cares about her students, but be prepared to work hard for a good grade.",1
"Gross may seem intimidating at first, but he really cares about his students deeply, is hilarious, and an all around 5 * professor.",1
"Barcley is quite focused on experiential learning methodology. His book choices are from the Lean Start-up gurus with a focus on current epistles from Eric Ries and Steve Blank. Absolute enjoyed trip to Chicago for Hyde Park Angels seminar. However, I do not share his love of Apple technology, Android is fine.",1
For online classes I took this teacher and she gave us so much work. Its all small assignments that arent to hard but they start to build up and there is pretty much something due everyday of the week. She makes her class it seems without having regard that any of her students are taking other course. 7-10 assignments due a week.,0
"This professor during a pandemic does not provide any extra credit that will actually move your grade up. There are only 3 exams that make up the majority of the grades and she does not curve or care. Overall the professor can't keep her personal life away from her professional work, which is a bad trait to have as a professor.",0
"Be warned, if your in the slightest way conservative do not show it in class. Your assignments will usually involve reading political opinion articles that are not only extremely left leaning, but usually offensive. If you do not see yourself being able to handle having to carefully word you papers as to not offend avoid the prof stay clear .",0
Grades are due in 5 days... she hasn't graded anything in over 3 months. You'll be expected to write huge summaries on topics that are barely a paragraph long (usually 3 huge summaries per chapter). She doesn't answer her emails either. She allows rewrites if you want a better grade... too bad she hasn't graded the original paper yet. 4/10,0
"This class was no joke. He does not lecture and you are expected to read and know the material before class. There are four exams and a final, all of which were very difficult. It is possible to get an A but you have to really work for it. Go to SI, ask questions, study with your classmates, and DO ALL HW AND MOCK EXAMS! Do this and you'll pass :)",1
"Survey of Am Lit CLASS ONLINE. NO TEXT BK REQUIRED. THERE IS AN ASSIGMENT MON-FRI. BUT THEY ARE INTERESTING. READ A STORY HE POST AND WRITE DISCUSION ABOUT IT. TOPICS ARE INTERESTING. SLAVERY, WOMENS RIGHTS, PURITANS LIFE, POCHANTAS..ECT...",1
Insanely hard grader on 8 micro-themes and 1 paper worth 25% of your grade. She's very intelligent but expects us all to teach her something new about the Old Testament which is nearly impossible so unless you're willing to devout your whole life to this one class do not expect an easy A. The midterm + final are long and require lots of writing,0
"He is a very good professor with efficient teaching methods. if you want to get a good grade, just understand the material he gives to you.",1
"Thoseis a tough class as she expect you to have perfect knowledge from 1101. Shes nice, but I wouldnt recommend you take this class unless you learn at a fast pace. Bad semester",0
"I have had to spend a lot of time re-teaching myself because I can not understand a word she says, she seems very nice but I wish I would have known how bad her accent was before I took her class. I am problem solving what she is saying while I am trying to solve the math problems.",0
Never again he doesnt teach us anything at all your book is your best friend. #facts,0
I took the Cuba course with this professor and I don't regret it at all. He was super helpful in and out of the classroom. His test aren't that hard if you study. He's a super nice guy.,1
he is not as bad as all of these comments. yes talking to him in person is a bit challenging because he talks over you. you can literally sign in and then leave the class. he gives extra credit and the project is a group presentation (easy). 2 take home finals (really easy grader) other 2 are multiple choice so you get what you get but its easy.,1
"Professor Lee is a great instructor, she teaches well to where the students understand. she gives extra credit assignments to help improve grades. Which helps students that are struggling.I do wish she was available to tutor outside of class it would be helpful because her style of teaching is understanding but some students need extra attention.",1
Dr. Currier explains a difficult subject very clearly.  This class does require you to study.   Attend class and take advantage of the extra credit and C should be easily attained.,1
"Dr. Lee was mediocre. With COVID19 disrupting the semester, he made the class harder and increased the weight of the tests to a higher percentage which was unfair. During the first normal half of the semester, Dr. Lee didn't really teach; you'll need to teach yourself. Heavy accent and doesn't understand questions. Free PDF of book online. Tophat.",0
"Une vrai Joke, y connait meme pas sa matiere.",0
"Thad is a fantastic person.  Unfortunately he has a very time consuming day job, therefore it takes forever to get your tests/quizzes/labs graded and back to you.   If you don't mind this he is really funny and makes the class fun and labs are really interesting.  He is also lenient on turning in things late and always making up tests late.",1
"Fantastic teacher.  Ms. Fox is a very tough teacher, but you will learn a lot from her class.  She responds to emails in a very timely manner and is always willing to help, if you ask.  Hands down the best teacher I have ever had.  If given the opportunity, take her class!",1
"Be ready to work. Professor Paler will teach you a lot and she is a solid professor. There are times when you will question why there are so many pages of reading (sometimes totaling 100!), but you'll learn how to get through it. This is a class where you put in what you will get out. Paler will reward you fro your hard work.",1
"GREAT teacher by far my favorite! Really helpful and understanding. Makes jokes in class, he is one cool dude",1
This is the one class that literally helps me relax. I thought I'd hate it since it has nothing to do with my major but he completely changed my view. His lectures are simple but keeps your attention and his tests are easy as long as you pay attention. I loved everything about this class. The professor is always ready to help and he's very sweet.,1
Study hard for these tests. The lectures are all power-point but Dr. Hill does a great job interacting with the class even though there are over 200 people. The clickers really help involve the class as well. Dr. Hill certainly knows her material in the class so do not hesitate to ask a question and she'll gladly help you out.,1
"Love this professor! Extremely knowledgable, friendly, and funny. Although her lectures may seem dry, they really help students understand readings more in depth and keeps things simple. Exams are simple if you actually read (some readings are long). Always willing to help during office hours. Would definitely recommend taking a class with her! ",1
"He is not that bad, those who wrote below are probably used to professors spoon feeding them info like most other professors...Weiner is a nice man and he is very helpful when help is asked for..his syllabus is clear from day one, and he's no nonesense. The work load is low and the book is an easy read..take this guy if you want to learn something",1
"This professor responded quickly to emails and graded quickly. However, She does not provide additional instructions for assignments. So, even though there is a good bit of extra credit, you may end up with ZERO points if you don't complete how she expects it. And if you reach out to ask questions, she is somewhat rude.",0
Participation doesn't matter. Not a very good learning class? Wasted time on out class debate.,0
"Be prepared to not know when you are presenting, however it is not that bad of a class. He helps you get comfortable with the people in your class and has your best interest in mind.",1
Hard on grading and doesn't any mercy on helping you out on your grade.,0
"took intro to public speaking saturday mornings. class was done in 8 weeks instead of 12. she graded very easily. class activities were fun, videos boring. her voice was screechy some days, but her hotness made up for it.",1
"Dr. O'Gorman is a great Prof. These older ratings of him from nearly 10 years ago bring his grade down, but it is evident he has become one of the better PLS professors at MC. His tests are a lot of writing, but if you study, it's a great chance to make great grades.",1
"I have taken multiple classes from Mrs. Henderson, I now try and pick classes that are not being taught by her. Its not that her classes are too hard its just that everything feels like busy work and she spends too much time during the lectures trying to talk about her personal life, oh and get ready for you email to be flooded with notifications.",0
"Not very helpful, but easy if you read the notes and read each chpt.",0
Nice guy but not a good teacher. He did not reach me and didn't make an attempt to do so.,0
A retired accounting professional who clearly has excitement about teaching others about accounting and the different professions within the field. Straight shooter with great stories. He confirmed my feelings about going back to school to get me accounting degree. Great instructor.,1
"Super nice guy, pretty funny too. Only three essays throughout the semester and if you show him that you are trying, you will easily get a 4.0.",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, however you should go to best understand the content. Decent amount of homework that is graded and can help boost your grade. Very funny and keeps lectures engaging!",1
"Really disorganized, although he tries really hard.",0
Great prof! Explains concepts clearly. Approachable.,1
"Jason is a good professor and is clearly passionate about his field, as a psych major I found the content rather difficult and not as exciting as other psych classes. Jason gives good examples to help students learn, and draws the more important diagrams during lecture. The tests make a majority of the grade, but review sessions are held before.",1
"Would definitely not recommend her to anyone. She gives out a lot of assignments, papers every week, takes weeks to grade them, its November and none of my papers have been graded from the first month of school yet. She goes off-topic a lot, never responds to email, would never take this class again.",0
"H e was easy but he never graded stuff a lot. For some reasons, he posted stuff the day before it was due.",1
"Where do I begin. How about the fact that we finished the curriculum BEFORE SPRING BREAK. We hadn't had exam 1 and he was already teaching exam 3 material. I use the term ""teachcing"" VERY loosely. He does not work out problems contrary to what he says. He puts a piece of paper on a project and reads the numbers for 15 seconds. A V O I D. ",0
"This class was way harder than expected. The exams are really hard even though you get a cheat sheet. Class attendance isn't part of your grade but if you skip you'll miss a bunch of in class assignments and quizzes. He says he doesn't care if you come to class but he really does. The homework is pretty time consuming, and doesn't relate to exams.",0
"Professor Wolfe is an amazing professor! He is very nice and comforting if you are nervous. If you mess up your speech the first time he usually gives you a second try. He is also a very easy grader. The class is not just speeches, it is many different activities like acting out things, reading a children's books ,etc. We even had a party!",1
"Prof. Neff is amazing! A truly wonderful guy. His class is interesting and he loves open-ended class discussions. Readings are engaging and he makes everyone more open to talking together. A kind, funny, exceptional person and professor.",1
"Laura is nice and very young. Had no control of the class, it was very difficult to listen to class instruction. She offered no make up tests or assistance with progress or lack there of! She said most of the class was not passing, yet did nothing to control the class noise for those who need to pass or help them achieve that! Doomed for failure!",0
"Professor Alemayehu is a professor who really cares if his students pass. His classes are pretty easy, just do the worksheets that he assigns and you'll be fine. He usually goes over the answers in class, and often lets you use your worksheets on tests. There are around four tests rather than a midterm and a final. Easy A if you pay attention.",1
"He is by far the worst professor I've ever seen. He has a very thick accent and I barely understood what he was talking about. Not only he has a thick accent, but he also did not go through the materials very thoroughly. He will explain something without reason, and he expects you to understand the concept. He repeats stuff over and over again.",0
"Terrible class.  She needs to realize not every student can remember exact details from several books. She has quizzes every day. She is nice and has a good personality, but needs to make her reading a lot easier for those who can't read and comprehend easily.",0
"I have taken all of Professor Deluna's classes that are provided at SAC. He is organized and clear about the criteria required in class. Pay attention to his lectures and final review - that's the key to passing his class. He's not strict, but he has expectations from his students and holds them to a higher standard. He's one of my fave Prof's!",1
She was thrown into this course and has absolutely no knowledge about any of the content being taught. She brings in other profs as 'guest lecturers' to teach her class. She forced us to get Twitter accounts to see updates about assignments yet she's barely used it. She's unclear and a hard marker. Exam questions were incomplete. Fels ya later.,0
"He barely knows what he's talking about it seems like, students are constantly correcting him. This confuses the students and makes it hard to understand. He seems to not care about failing students and probably thinks he's doing his part in helping explain the material which he isn't. Don't take him, you might as well teach it to yourself.",0
He is the RUDEST TEACHER I EVER MET ,0
The content of this course is very interesting but unfortunately the prof for this course makes it hard to find interesting. Plus she makes the midterms worth 45% of your grade with nothing in between to fix your grade if your screw up. Plus there are many slides and not enough time for notes on each bring a camera and lots of memory or dont takeit,0
"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",0
"Excellent professor and interesting topic! All we did in class was watch videos. Yes, her notes were all over the place but the key points could easily be found on google and wikipedia. Try to attend the majority of classes and ask questions (yes, she did have favorites). Read everything on the syllabus and you will be fine.",1
"Professor Wang is a really good teacher.  If you like numbers, then this class will be super easy.  Just study the material and do the homework, as you will learn the material better.  3 tests and no final, but there is a final project.  Very informative and kind.  She will also write you recommendations if you need it.",1
I loved this class! It was really easy for me and Trina was extremely caring and genuinely wanted the students in her class to understand the material. She was born to teach!,1
"Has good knowledge, but lacks in presentation. sometimes hard to catch him. surprise tests count for grading. don't miss class :(",0
"Very straightforward, tells you exactly what she wants. The exams are tough but she if you show signs of improvement one bad grade won't kill you. I also agree her accent is very cute.",1
Lots of reading but the book is interesting enough,1
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED do not let her be your 1st choice. She is a kind teacher &loves math but she is higly confusing&wants you to spell out each word&number if your problem is 2+24 she wants you to explain why and how do you know for a fact that  4. Makes everything more confusing than what it needs 2b. Group projects? what are we in highschool?,0
"Flipped class, where you watch a pre-recorded lecture before class and spend the entire class reinforcing in the form of a recap followed by a 3-5 person group packet. One person in the group gets graded, groups switch roughly after each exam. Terrific class. HW is on MML, and grades are posted quickly to MML as well. T/A present, which helps! ",1
"Boring, notes are terrible & teacher is arrogant. Also, complains about students missing one class. Do not recommend!!!",0
"Point blank: wish every professor was like this guy. Personable, kind, interesting, honest, helpful. Just go to class, listen, participate and do the homework. Do that, you have an A. Definitely recommended.",1
"Professor Cordova was great! She only assigns 2 assignments and 4 exams for the whole semester. You have a whole week to do the exams and the assignments are open from the first day so you can get them done ahead of time. Overall, great professor and easy class. Easy A.",1
Just finished taking the class. He is very fair. Was about to quit class but he kept encouraging. Is there early and stayed late if you needed help. He won't give you the answers but helps you work through it. I would def. Take his class again.,1
"The best professor I have had in my nearly 5 years of college. He is a caring, funny and understanding person who is insanely educated on anything he teaches, works with you both in and out of the classroom. He has an ability to get you into anything. Usually has a midterm and a final, nothing more, though split between takehome and inclass.",1
"Dr. Ostrowski is a very good teacher. She gives lots of extra credit and lecture assignments are easy points as long as you work hard and are accurate. Tests can be a bit difficult but the class really balances out. She gives a solid study guide with key points but be sure to understand more than just the basics, Lots of T/F and multiple choice",1
"Very encouraging, he convinced me to 'stay the course,' when I  considered leaving TESC due to issues with administration and the school.  Great instructor, informative, helpful feedback.  Thi s was a guided study course so there was only email contact but he went well beyond what was expected.  Highly recommend, I'd take him again if I could.",1
Not very accessable and she's hard to get on with. Don't take the online version of this class as it's hard to get a clear answer and there's no leeway.,0
"Professor Humber isn't very good, though he does try. His tests are difficult, but he grades very easy, though sometimes it's frustrating how arbitrary his qualifications are. Take him if you want a decent grade without too much work (at least, in comparison to other sections), but if you really want a good Calc II professor, try someone else.",0
"If you are looking for a traditional class atmosphere, this isn't for you. However, I learned more in this class than I have in all others. Mayor Street and his TA (Jeff Carroll who is a professor himself) make a great team and are EXTREMELY committed to their students.. Everything you need to know about local government is within this class!!!!!!!",1
"Professor Hunt takes a fun approach to teaching topics that many people might find boring. BL431 is one of the most useful classes I have taken at WIU. With Covid-19 restrictions our class was online. I normally try to avoid online classes, but the recorded lectures cover all required topics very well. Don't hesitate to take it online.",1
Very Very Very easy! Lots of essays but grades easy! Expected to show up to class for participation,1
He was a really great professor for the whole semester. Classes during the pandemic are hard but he was always available and answering emails almost right away. Does not give a lot of work to do but to pass you have to make sure to turn in assignments ON TIME and just be aware of everything he posts. Overall easy A and an interesting class.,1
This is an online course.  The semester is over and there are still unanswered e-mails that need a response. Not a good communicator at all.,0
"he is a very tough grader and he posts reviews for exams the night before, and also teaches you in a very confusing way",0
"Page is SO knowledgeable! She shares so much insight. You will learn so much every class. There are lots of projects and assignments, but you learn a ton!!",1
"This class was very hard! But, Mr. Purser gives you several extra credit opportunities to boost your grade. He is a very funny guy and was very helpful whenever I emailed him. If you stay on task, do the work, and study, its possible to make an A!",1
"This guy's pretty boring and isn't very good at teaching. He flies through chapters but highlights what's going to be on the final for the most part. If you want to do well, you're gonna have to study a lot on your own. The textbook is your best friend but he definitely isn't!",0
"Dr. J is quite frankly the best professor I have ever come in to contact with. She guides you, as you are typically a freshman in her class, through your experiences as a freshman english education major. You will be grateful for the high demands she has for you after you complete her class and have a grip on your life as a whole. TAKE HER CLASS! ",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! I have NEVER had an online class with as many assignments due each week. If you take this professor you might as well quit your job if you want to pass. Professor also wants nothing to do with the students so good luck getting in touch with her. Also all tests require computer lock down and webcam.,0
This professor knows the material- cold. I think someone must have received a poor grade a few years ago and put up some cra* here. He doesn't have a final- you work on papers through the semester- so you know what you're doing- he helps and answers questions- unlike most other professors at the school-  take his pretrial lit- you'll know whats up,1
"I really hope CP24 knows about this. WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS?!! I never knew a professor can be this bad. I got an A 100% because of my own hard work. What is learned in class is ""The course is called ITM 100"" PERIOD!. And whats with the rat tail?",0
"Very nice teacher, willing to help if you have any questions. He created a class study guide for everyone before the final. The quizzes are easy if you read and take class notes.",1
"Spaeth's passion lies with Rome, not her students. She's far more concerned with rushing through powerpoints than engaging and educating. Yes, there's a lot of material to cover, but the class just feels like watching someone rapidly talk to themselves. Don't buy the textbooks; just review the power points online. Take only if you love the subject!",0
this class is very frustrating. She gets corrected almost everyday in class. Her teaching method is to just read from the projector and not explain anything. She clearly lacks confidence in this subject. Her tests and even quizes are riduculously hard compared to how she teaches.,0
Major Nelson is an awesome prof always willing to help out students and truly knows and comprehends what he teaches.,1
Absolutely the hardest and worst teacher I have ever had. I don't want you to think that I'm some student who does not care I have a 3.5 gpa. the sad thing is he will never change and faculty department will never replace him. the highest test average was a 52.,0
I had her for Summer 1 and she's just a really nice teacher. Even though it was fast paced I got a C even though I really hoped for a B..Anyways I'd recommend her because I understood math more with her than any if the others I had...It was less confusing with her...,1
He is a great professor he is really funny and loves it when the class actually engages in conversation with him. as for showing up thats all you have to do show up and take notes. you really dont even have to do that he give 3 sets of 3 essay question if you make them about 1 1/2 pages long and stick to topic you are most likely to get an A!,1
"Every class was professor Amey talking about random stories that kind of relate to the slides. He gave random pop quizzes almost every other class which were fill-in-the-blank with no word bank on really specific details that he didn't mention in class. I asked him my grade and he said ""he didn't know"". He's nice but doesn't know what hes doing",1
Hard grader.  Often goes off on a tangent and wastes class time.  Would not recommend.,0
"Poorly prepared, makes exams unneccesarily hard with picky/tricky questions",0
Do not take this prof. She seems all nice and sweet while she is talking but as soon as you go to approach her she treats you as if you are a child and dumb. save yourself,0
"Never take this class as an elective. Forget about the online component, It's way too much work (readings, assignments). You are supposed to read the whole, 300 page textbook, as well as watch hours of lectures. Every now and then you are supposed to buy the newest version of the textbook (which she was an author of) that costs $100+. Ridiculous.",0
"Don't take this class, especially online. Can't learn anything, I've gone to the resource center and still get none of it. I've spent at least 50 hours on homework and have spent more than that trying to learn the material with no success. Homework only accounts for 25 percent of grades rest are on his impossible tests.",0
Be sure to do readings or you wont pass. If you dont get that why bother with university. Come to most classes but you can also get away with skipping a lot.,1
"Very unclear in lectures, but explains well one on one. Don't miss a day or you'll be very behind. Exams often do not reflect the study guide. Typically, 20 page multiple choice homework due every week, test every couple weeks covering multiple units. Tagged him under ""get ready to read"", bc I found myself teaching a lot of the subject to myself.",0
One of the most insecure profs I've ever had. She knows her background and lectures are useless so she demands attendance as part of your grade. She cannot give explanations for the grades she gives and she definitely grades off her personal opinion of students. The assignments are super easy but just time consuming. Textbooks are not necessary.,0
"As an English teacher, her English really sucks.",0
Greenberg's lectures are the bomb diggity,1
He is enthusiastic and explains things in a way that is very easy to understand. Definitely my favorite. Doesn't hurt that he's hot.,1
"This instructor is GREAT! CARING! Very easy going man who is not hard at all. Just do the essays and you will be fine. He gives a lot of time to compete them. I can't sing his praises enough. If you have difficulty with writing, this is the man you want to take. Actually, there should be a hunger games to enroll in his class. He is that awesome.",1
He definitely cares and wants students to succeed. The problem was is he did not teach in a way that helped that. He mostly read off lecture slides and class was boring. Tests were difficult and he does not do nearly enough examples in class to make sure you understand material before class. Homework didn't really help you learn and was very hard.,0
"This is the worst Professor I have ever taken a class from. There is a quiz almost every single day and they are waited heavily in the class. The concepts he teaches are fairly easy concepts to understand, but then tests and quizzes are very challenging. The class averages on all the tests were around 15/30. Great guy, terrible professor.",0
"Dr. Knight is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is quite a hilarious guy and is quite passionate about his field. Unfortunately, I am only limited to 250 characters but definitely, take his class! Pros: The class is relatively easy and there isn't much homework besides weekly class readings. Cons: iClicker quizzes every class!",1
"Great! He is great and easy to talk to, super funny. Office hours are always available",1
"be ready to do a lot to pass his class , tough grader",0
"He is honestly one of the smartest profs I've ever taken. He is an awesome instructor. Exams are fairly challenging and you have fifty minutes to answer roughly around 5-8 short answers. However, I would not recommend taking this if you are a freshman and are taking another science course. I did that and I awfully regretted doing thistake it slow!",1
"He is extremely lecture heavy. However, hes just reading from slides that arent even his! When he goes off script, he just confuses the class. He knows what the topic is but hes not good at articulating anything. It feels like hes still stuck in 1972. Theres no curve too and he LOVES saying it too. Avoid him. Hes not mean just a bad professor",0
"I am not a botany fan or anything, but this was one of my fave classes during my undergrad. Whatever your field of interest is, if you're planing on pursing research he knows a lot and will be a great idea to learn from him as much as you can about it.",1
PROBABLY THE EASIEST PROFESSOR AT UCBA!,1
"Just don't. She made the class WAY more difficult than what it should have been. She went on the most random tangents I've ever heard, fussed at a student who was two minutes late and told them not to knock on the door if they wanted to enter (I know right?), and was just overall a little off. A plus is that she was always available if you needed.",0
"Professor Schlortt isn't a normal history teacher, he is not date heavy, and unlike other professors' he understands that life happens, so he is flexible with due dates but don't take advantage of it.",1
"i'm sure i would be more engaged in the class if there was a child in my life and i had a vested interest to pay attention. the class felt disorganized, crowley just took her notes and wrote them on the board. low discussion/interaction in class, so it's very easy to fall asleep in. 3 tests, 1 essay. take for reqs, not to learn c&a dev.",0
"Great professor, great lectures, and relaxed atmosphere. take notes, you do not need the book if you have a classmate that lets you look at theirs when you need to. I bought mine from the school store and I can say it was the worst investment ever. Only negative is that he grades until the end of the semester. I guess that keeps you on your toes.",1
"She is a very nice teacher, will give extra help if you need it. Do NOT miss a test or quiz unless you have a good excuse.  The class is hard but if you read and study for tests it'll be ok.  I hate history and have always failed the classes but I PASSED!!! Take it and learn alot!!!!!!",1
Easily the worst math teacher i have EVER had. He does not attempt to teach at all his idea of teaching is mumbling things to make himself sound good. Absolutely do not take this class with Dan I with-drawled along with 13/25 other kids in my class. Dan is a joke of a teacher. Youtube runs circles around Dan.,0
By far the worst prof I had in my 5 years of undergrad. Always too busy to discuss anything with any of his students. Also amazingly rude has no social skills. It is clear to see why he is teaching business and not actually in the business world.,0
"Professor Harding makes a boring topic seem pretty interesting. Solid professor and nice guy. A few short papers, 2 midterms, and a final group project. Memorize the terms from the book/lecture and you'll do fine on the exams.",1
Nice lady but her demands for the class are overwhelming. I'm a science major and her class took up more than half my life and was more unnecessarily demanding than my other classes. Work isnt tough but extremely time consuming and tedious. shes a tough grader so get ready to rewrite everything all the time and never feel sufficient,1
Her lectures are confusing. Had a better understanding when i read the textbook. Very rude often taking shots at the students for absolutely no reason and also for asking genuine questions. Course project groups formation is a nightmare as there are no deadlines so students don't respond early and send emails in the final month to join a group.,0
If you like being stressed out and failing classes because of a single pass or fail exam then she's the right prof for you.,0
"Jaymi is a very boring lecturer, even while teaching an intro to public speaking class. The lab sections for this class are hit or miss based on your TA. If you can take this class online or with someone else definitely recommend, because it will be easier if the lectures don't put you to sleep as fast.",0
Boring class.,0
"His lectures are funny, but no need to attend. Graded on 4 main projects. Group projects graded more leniently, but the two projects done alone are really harsh. Tries to be Cool Guy, occasionally succeeds. Makes weirdly sexist remarks, tried to convince class that female brains are physically different, which makes them good at feminine stuff.",1
Amy is a great professor! She makes class fun and interesting by having you do creative projects. She is open to hearing students' ideas and is a very fair and clear instructor. She sometimes brings candy and treats for the class!,1
"Dylan Shields is one of the BEST professors in the Cinema Dept. I took him for editing, advanced editing and Cinema Business. I got A's in all of the classes. He's really easy going, easy to talk to and very lenient with deadlines. The editing projects are fun and you spend hours doing them. Time to be creative! Fun class, fun professor! Easy A!",1
"His class was definitely not for me but I wouldn't call him a bad teacher. In class, we talk about the philisophical side of technology, and how it impacts humans. The homework has little to do with class discussion, and a text book is mandatory if you want to pass the quizzes. Sometimes you have to build things. There are no due dates.",0
"She is one of the best professors I had!!! Period! She is really cares and passionate about the subject. She is not that strict. Yes, she will ask you to keep the Journal and bring two pages per each class!! I submitted over the course only half of the journal pages and still got an A. I definitely recommend her! You will learn a lot from her!!",1
"Don't even bother reading about any other professor. You will be glad you took him. I've never liked math and I looked forward to his class, partially just because he's hilarious and SO cute, but I actually learned and understood what he taught. He also teaches high school, so he knows how to appeal to those who hate math.",1
"DO NOT take this professor, you will regret it. I only have 350 characters to describe how bad he is and that is not enough at all. I can go on for hours, he's unfair, grades your work as if he gave you a detailed grading rubric (which he does not), if you ask him a question he can't even answer it completely and he is VERY rude. Very bad person",0
"I'm going to be very honest, he is not a very good teacher. He bases your essay from best to worst in the class. The whole class he spends talking about god knows what and worst he does not keep up with the schedule or assignments. I ended the class with a B but still wasn't satisfied with his teaching or how he graded the assignments.",0
This class was definitely not what I thought it would be. Heavily reading based. If you read the articles you'll be fine and he gives you opportunities to miss some of the reaction papers he assigns. The book essay is a big part of your grade: START IT EARLY! Overall he's an okay teacher but kind of boring and the class is not based on medications.,1
"Course went online after the pandemic. He was basically just reading off from slides for three hours and it was hard to keep focused. The course would be better if he presents an outline of everything we are learning, and revisits it every week for a few minutes. I felt the topics skipped unrelatedly each week.",0
"Very difficult class.  He pushed us very very hard.  He was willing to help me whenever I got really stuck, but made me do everything that he thought I could possibly do by myself.  He made me stretch to do my best.  It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.",1
"Absolute great experience with this professor. While he can be a little strict when helping you with code, you can tell he genuinely wants you to learn. His lectures are very well organized and he gives real world examples. His assignments are very manageable and I felt like I walked out of this class with a lot of gained knowledge.",1
"Dr. Ferguson is a nice enough guy, but the class was difficult. There was way too much reading assigned and he is a hard grader when it comes to assignments.",0
"Out of the instructors at OSUIT, he is one of the best.  Unfortunately that is not saying much.  He knows his stuff and you will learn alot if you listen.  ",1
"Steve is the best, kindest math teacher ever. He takes time to help with homework, tells you exactly what to prepare for on tests, gives partial credit, and his lectures are detailed, clear, and easy-to-follow. He clearly loves what he does and is happy to share his gift of teaching math with his students.",1
"I passed this class, with little to no help from adam. He speaks in monotone, is extremely difficult to get a hold of, and is extremely vague with his explanations. i tried going to his office hours, but both times he was not there. homework every night but thats expected. Good luck!",0
"Her lectures are helpful but you need to really pay attention. It's like any other math course. If you don't pay attention don't expect to pass. The material for this course isn't very challenging, so, if you spend at least 2 hours a day studying, you won't have an issue. She does assign homework but doesn't collect it, it's just for extra help.",1
"Economics and the Law is an extremely poorly structured class. The material is not taught, there is excessive and unproductive reading, interpretive discussions do nothing in the way of furthering one's understanding of the topics, and it is challenging to know when any assignments are due. Be ready to read hundreds of pages with one days notice.",0
Although she is extremely nice I probably wouldn't take her again. I actually wanted to learn in that class because its for my major but i really don't feel like i learned at all. If your looking for easy tests but not to really learn then she's your girl. Overall the class was a cake walk.,1
"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again. The content of the final assignment was entirely around coding in R when the there has been literally no content covering R until that point. An absolute embarrassment.",0
"Lisa is one of the worst professors I have ever had, hands down. I have had for a few classes now and she is a good teacher when in the classroom but her online classes are some of the worst experiences I have had at school. She is the least helpful teacher I have ever had both in and out of the classroom.",0
Rachaels History 150 course was rather easy as long as you go to class and read the book. Do the work and its an easy A,1
Dr. Souaiaia gives excellent lectures that will make you interested and make you want to listen. Take this class only if you have an interest in the Islamic Civilization. Easy to get an A if you work very hard and listen. Please throw out any preconceived notions of Islam before taking this class to get more out of it! Yoko is the best TA ever.,1
"Terry means well, but sometimes you can tell that he doesn't have an education degree. Though he's an excellent player and guy, he sometimes lacks the skills needed to show how a student becomes a player like himself. Don't get me wrong, I love him to death as a person, but as a teacher he's not as talented.",0
Very bad at teaching his lectures were insanely boring and the information on the exams are much more difficult than the information in the power points. You basically just have to teach yourself literally everything and hope you have a good lab professor!,0
He loves chemistry. I had him at 8am and every morning he put me in a good mood with his excitement and enthusiastic personality. He loves what he does and is very open to talk to students.,1
"You're back in high school with Rankin. Does not help you at all, just says it's test material and she can't comment on it, even though it's in class and not an exam day. The Lab skill training taught me way more than she did, it's pretty easy if you just do the lab assignments a couple of times. Would NEVER recommend Rankin to anyone.",0
"tough grader, I tired really hard in this class but she kept on giving me a low grade",1
1 word  HORRIBLE. Never take an art with this prof. Its just beyond so many quizzes and the tests will make you fail trusttt me! If your going to take online get ready to literally memorize and study 9 hours a day 63hrs a week to get ( C ) even if ur good at tough majors.. she will never teach you.. This art class is horrible so No for me.,0
"Be super careful on tests as she will ding you for the slightest thing. Lectures quickly, making it difficult to understand everything. Goes over time on the lectures every time, making it difficult to make it to your next class on time. Believes that memorization is easy for everyone. Not the worst professor I've had, but definitely not the best.",0
Ridiculous with her grading. Not helpful with quetions or willing to help. Made this online class unbearable. Do not take this course online with her.,0
"This class is the easiest CS course I've taken because most of the quizzes and all of the tests were take home. Content is interesting and is pretty broad, anyone with above average knowledge in computing will easily pass this class without much effort.",1
Good teacher. Lectures a lot but all of the work including tests are online. Just show up to class and do your work and you will pass.,1
She assignments are quite hard but she lets you re-do them. If you email her your assignemnts ahead of time she'll give you amazing feedback. You can't fail her class unless you don't put any effort into it. Anyone in the Science program I recommend her course. She's extremely sweet and helpful!,1
Dr. Lewan is one of the best teachers on campus at ACC.  She's a genuinely nice person and will be happy to talk to you during office hours about improving your writing. I took her english 121 class and enjoyed it so much I'm now taking 122 from her.  She'll definitely make you a better writer!,1
"Shes pretty nice teacher, theres a lot of hw, but its easy, just dont wait till the last day its due to do it all. its all due a certain day so you have time to do. She goes over it so if you have questions shell help you out. Its a lot of to remember so don't miss any class! I work around 45 hours a week and still passed.",1
"Professor Bonner is very clear about what is expected of you for the class work and attendance wise, he gives quizzes (which he calls opportunities) every week or so with no more than 2 or 3 questions regarding the chapters recently covered in lecture, which are very useful in reviewing for the exams. The lectures are always useful and not boring.",1
"She obviously did not want to be teaching the course, her attitude to the students was dripping of condescension and a lack of respect.  The material was interesting but presented slowly and the class was often unbearingly boring.",0
"I had such a great experiance with this professor and I must say I learned a lot. She was very supportive. It is a lot of writing for this class which I thought was too much but since it was a winter class, I was expecting the work load.  But over all I think she is great!",0
Very fair with hard tests.,1
"The class wasn't structured whatsoever, I don't know if other factors contributed to this but I'd avoid taking her class. In the beginning the class was interesting and she'd use great materials but then it went down hill. Assigned too many readings and wouldn't discuss them, used them as fillers. Little to no assignments. Easy A.",0
Has an excuse for everything and does NOT give useful study tools! He even brought his daughter to class during a midterm which was very distracting. Would not recommend this prof. He is a nice guy though,0
"Right now she is it for A&P lectures so you have no choice. Her teaching style is very hard to follow, doesn't make it easier to understand.  Her testquizes are hard.  Feel like she is trying to trick you. If you have to take her use other supplementary material to help you pass this class. You will have to spend ALOT of time studying.",0
"Well, I have been in VC for 5 semesters but I have never rated any professor but this time she made me do it because she is not a good professor as I was told about her. I will never take with her again, also I don't recommend anyone to take with her unless (if you want to work harder than your ability to expect a grade b or maybe less).",0
Very straight foward pay attention and you will do fine great teacher. make sure to do homework or you will not pass.,1
Very passive aggressive and honestly rude in general,0
Very quickly answers any questions. Commends students when performed a good job on assignmentstests.,1
"I only lasted 4 weeks in this class. i dropped it after i realized that this class was only going to go downhill. if you take this professor, get prepared to teach yourself all the material. he teaches through powerpoint and lectures are very boring.",0
"There is a good amount of work in this class, as the subject requires a lot of practice. The weekly quizzes go off of what is in the book rather than what he actually teaches. He ""assigns"" reading every week online, but never mentions it. I would recommend taking him, as there are in depth study guides for the midterm and final.",1
Are you ready to do some math? ;),1
"Linda is an excellent teacher.  She really makes the class interesting and has a great personality.  I learned far more in her lab than in the a and p 2 lecture. Tests are easy: multiple choice, matching, fill in the blank-not tricky.  Tests also include identifying body parts on dissected animals so make sure you pay attention when you do it.",1
One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Speaks horrible english,0
"I took this class and made an A.  However, it wasn't because of her.  I needed help constantly because I couldn't understand what she wanted on the assignments.  She never e-mailed back, and I mean NEVER!  I didn't even know what I was making in the class until the last TWO WEEKS!",0
"Moved to online courses and he did not adjust material at all, actually had more work to begin with. Constantly ignored emails and uploaded materials late. The class became more work than all my other courses combined. Spent 7 hours on one exam that he said would take 2 hours max. Worst professor at wcu and hoping to get him removed",0
To be honest she isnt very helpful and she can be very rude she gives out too much work and she gives out too many essays and she is very specific on what you need to do would i take her class again nah,0
I did not really understand her explanations during the lectures. Better off studying on your own.,0
"If you have to take a literature class, take this class!! He is really reasonable and fair. there are short quizzes(5 q.)and you get 2 trys, there are papers but there not bad. If you just do the work every week you will get a good grade.The way he has everything set up is really organized and clear too.The class is not hard, and hes a good teacher",1
This guy is a freaking joke.  I'm am astounded as to how he hasn't been let go. His packets and handouts are extremely hard to follow. His lectures make zero sense and he can barely speak in a coherent sentence.  Grades tough. Good luck understanding his annotations because his handwriting is impossible to read.  DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!,0
"He's not a difficult prof. but he sucks at teaching and likes to hear himself talk. He'll go off on tangents that have no real importance to the subjects and its unfortunate he's the only surveying lecture prof. I don't know what he's like in labs, but be prepared to deal with a lot of nonsense in his lectures",0
"Professor Dunham started out great, was very clear of his expectations and grading criteria. But a few weeks into class he had a family emergency, and we didn't hear from him for weeks. We couldn't get feedback until almost all assignments were turned in. Grades more on APA style than actual content, very tough grader! Good Professor though.",1
"Dr. Lyons is a great prof. Her lectures are heavy but if you pay attention you'll be fine. She's got her moments for jokes, but she genuinely cares about her students. She's very passionate about her material and knows a lot.",1
this prof's #1 goal is to make his students life a living nightmare. avoid at all cost,0
"Professor McEntire did an outstanding job instructing the Film Appreciation materiel. He is easy to talk to. Must have the book. Exams are a bit hard if you don’t put the study time in. Honestly if you have it together, and do your work, you're golden. If you’re just a seat warmer, expect to fail hard. He will drop you for not attending class.",1
"I have scored high 90s and even a 100 on exams but her projects bring your grade down immensely, She's such a tough grader and expects you to do exactly what she wants BUT doesn't tell you what she wants.",0
"best teacher, explains everything,helps if you ask him",1
"He's one of the WORST most disrespectful teachers I have EVER had, talk about 10 year. If you have question or want to participate in class be ready to be humiliated. He makes fun of everyone for not understanding the material he doesn't know how to teach. Its not a good sign when the other Stats teacher tells the other classes Guetter has lost it",0
"Great professor; you have to listen and you have to work to do well, but he's passionate about his field and it really flows over into his lectures. Recommend all the way.",1
All my prior interest in terms of research vanished when Pam was assigned to the class. Doesn't know how to budget time to teach all material. Doesn't understand how to assign appropriate amounts of work. Her exams were a nightmare - unclear and silly. Avoid at all costs!,0
This teacher is not good i dont know how his reviews are high. Its a 101 class but he expects you to write like a person who majored in writing essays. He trys so hard to find things to mark you do with. ,0
1. You can't understand him 2. He is picky on how you write your essay questions on the test 3. Will turn your paper down if it isn't a full 2 pages 4. You cant read his hand writing 5. We will let you retake your test but he huffs and puffs about it This is a 5 step warning you that if you take this class you will be miserable. MISERABLE!,0
"Peter is a nice guy, but his class taught me nothing. Very focused on sewing and design, but did not really teach us how to sew. Taught us the bare minimum to code, still didn't understand. The way he explained things was very confusing and never answered his email. If you asked me to code now I couldn't do anything basic. Nice grader tho.",0
Worst class EVER. I'm a straight A student and I failed this class. His expectations are waaaaaaaay too high and he won't stop talking about his glory days at the UW and their expectations. He's the only teacher that has made me cry.,0
This professor truly helped me get through my freshman year.  He gave me great resources and made the transition from home to school great!  I enjoyed meeting great peers in this class and getting to do many group assignments (in class) so that I could learn about working with other people.  I appreciated Mr. Jensen for being a great professor.,1
"Initially I was scared to take Professor Wolf because of all the reviews I read but she was NOTHING like how these reviews perceive her. She is so sweet. She makes class interesting by adding in her own experiences as well! Weekly reading quizzes, two exams and a short paper. She pretty much gives you the answers to exams/reading quizzes in lecture",1
"Took this class this summer. 2 exams, one project, HWs, and bonus HW question. 50% on the exam and other 50% on HW, project and learn smart. To be honest, you have easy 50% on your hand and the Bonus HW question. HWs are easy but exams are not that easy. if you learn and understand the concept. This class is an easy A. Do bonus HW question!",1
he's good and full of character.,1
Homework assignments are very easy to get 100 on. Two group projects that are mostly graded on the idea and not really how you present it. Test are easy if you study sometimes he throws some questions in that are not fair cause they are trick questions.,1
"Written homework was pointless, but webwork wasn't that bad. Gives good examples in class. Open for any questions and will spend time with anything you have trouble with.",1
"SWEET person, bad professor. The readings were so boring and the assignments were so long. All 6 projects took a substantial amount of time and she talks and talks and talks and talks. You get bored. Really bored.",0
The person before me is spot on.Caldwell is very interested in the subject. That's it for good qualities.Tough grader.Distant personality. Boring class. Can't read comments on papers so you can't improve your papers...Difficult to track down outside of class. Its a lose/lose. Take someone else for this stupid english req,0
"Ervin is ridiculous! He might be nice in class and seem helpful but his tests are the hardest I have ever had. I'm an A student and got a C in the class after doing all the homework, going to EVERY class, and studying a ton. Studied forever for the final and still failed! Cheat sheets don't help. Good luck.",0
"I took his PSY101 class online and it was it very frustrating. He was very unorganized and for it being an online class, it was pertinent to be well organized. He was consistently late getting his recorded lectures out to us and had to keep pushing back due dates that all piled up at the end of the quarter by his doing, not mine.",0
Great teacher!,1
Not at all understanding of missing class. It is a pandemic and life happens but to him nothing should be more important than his class. Often did not explain assignments clearly. Ignored students email. If you were oh so lucky to get an email then all he'll tell you is to look at the syllabus.,0
"She was fun, tried to relate to the students a lot which can be annoying but it made the class less intense. Homework wasn't excessive or overwhelming. Good teacher overall. Worked with the student well.",1
"Grant was very fair and unbiased when he talked about some sensitive issues that went with the literature.  You do have to write a couple essays and those weeks are difficult but other than that the homework is manageable.  You need the textbook.  He requires that you write on the discussion board with word count minimums, which was tough for me.",1
"She's a really sweet person but not very clear when teaching. I have nothing against her because she did try, but I think she needs to change the way she teaches. It is possible to pass but do not expect an easy A or B. Learn the material conceptually and READ THE BOOK. Attendance isnt mandatory but go to class, she goes over hw sometimes",0
"The worst experience ever. She doesnt help at all, you ask her a question,  What does your book say? Will be her response. The amount of work expected is excessive. Please save yourself the time and pick another professor. She expects you to know 8 chapters worth of material for her tests, no multiple choice questions either. Just horrible!",0
"Not my cup of tea, graded negatively on discussion boards that did not align with her train of thought. I love to learn but being forced to see things one way is not learning. Not being able to share my thoughts on why I feel or believe a certain way was unfair. Glad it's over and never looking back.",0
"Intimidating, but I learned a lot about different art forms in ""writing across the arts."" And she did give good feedback on papers.",1
History is history. You read about it in the book (so boring) and you write a discussion post about it each week. It wasn't hard it's just time consuming because you have to read a lot. The quizzes were tricky sometimes but the answers are usually on the internet. I took her 8 week course and I had to prioritize the readings but it was manageable.,1
Probably the worst teacher ever.  There was no point to even goto class except on Friday's for the quizzes because all he did was read off the Power Point slides and then post them on Angel.  Tests were so long for 50 minutes.  What a dick.,0
He is a very sweet teacher. He very quiet and shy. Attendance isnt mandatory for lecture or recitation. Make sure you go to lab though. Weekly hw but he opens them up at the end of the semster if you miss one. He also gives all his test online but the final is in class. I love him and would totally recommend,1
hesss amazing!!!! take him,1
"Some people were permitted late work and some weren't despite same reasons. Grading of drawings is inconsistent: a student loses 5 points for having a dimension line that is too long and another student loses 1 point for the same same line, same length. Why? I don't know. You teach yourselves, get others to help you. He does a short demo each day.",0
The worst teacher I have had. He didn't show up on the first day of class and yet gave us an in-class graded quiz. He put problems on tests that had no answers and refused to give us points back. Failed to give us the equations we needed and forced us to memorize all of these equations including the whole unit circle. Avoid him like the plague.,0
"In order to do the assignments, you need to first buy the text book. I didn't buy the text book in the beginning so I wasn't able to do any assignment and received bunch of 0s. This class is a self teach class because all of the stuff we learn is just reading text book. I don't understand why I pay all this money to just learn from the text book.",0
Ann Woodside is an awesome professor!,1
"Worst class ever! She never puts grades in on time, or sometimes she doesn't even put your grades in. The grade you get on assignments is based on if she likes you. I did the same work as this other girl and i got a 60 while she got a 100. So basically, if you're not the kind to want to be a teacher's pet, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
"If you don't understand accounting DO NOT TAKE HIM. You will FAIL. He thinks we should all be accounting majors and when you don't understand it he doesn't help. 4 Quizzes, lowest dropped, and a project. Quizzes  impossible.",0
Dina David is not a great professor. You will 100% regret choosing this class. She does not give correct detail for assignments leaving all students confused. Do yourself a favor and don't do it....,0
"This was one of my favorite classes at UC Davis. Dr. Wolf not only teaches about family, but also about all the other issues that impact the family. It was a super interesting class and I learned a lot about the family as well as societal issues surrounding it. Tests are straightforward if you put in the work (readings and attending lecture).",1
"i took accounting in high school so the course is easy and understandable, but if i hadnt taken accounting prior, i would be so confused",0
"Dr. Wang is a great prof. She cares about your success and will help you outside of class when needed. Her lectures are clear and homework is helpful for quizzes and tests. She is very dedicated to her work and is always in time with assignments, grades, and lectures. She does a great job at explaining the material and making sure to give examples.",1
I got a good grade but I don't feel like I learned anything. I emailed him a few times with no reply. That's not good for an online class!! If you don't need to talk to a teacher he's the man for you.,0
"Her lectures are based from the textbook so I suggest reading the textbook ahead of time then going to lecture for a clearer understanding. Your grade is based off of 3 exams, 1 group project and a few other assignments, but the assignments vary depending if you have her large lecture or smaller class.",1
Avoid at all costs. She is completely unclear and unhelpful. Her tests and HW are unfair and never returned on time. She also shows up late to every class.,0
"Monica is an amazing professor. I would recommend her to anyone. She gives great examples in class that will actually help you on your quizzes. Even though she does go over everything (which is a good thing), she hits specifically on points that you will see on quizzes/tests. She helps out however she can. She is a HUGE sports fan!",1
"It's all been said already. He is very knowledgible, but doesn't know how to teach it to students.",0
"Honestly, not as terrible as everyone says. She is an awful lecturer and makes the material dry, but if you show up to every lecture, take pictures of the images that she omits in her lecture notes, and have good memorization skills then you're fine. Easy A for science (biology) majors. The tests are a lot of writing, so you can BS a lot of it.",0
"I am usually an all A type of student, and I received a B- in this class. The papers she makes you write there is no feedback for and simply gives no points for certain sections often. An extremely hard grader. Exams are very difficult even if you read the textbook and study notes as I did still does not guaranteed you know the info needed.",0
do not recommend,0
"She takes her job too seriously, her test doesn't match the lectures, her slideshows are horrible she tells you the definition by mouth instead of giving you the one she will use on the test. Expects you to apply terms to real-world situations.",0
"He's great - funny but really informative. You really learn a lot from attending his class.  Plus he's interested in what he teaches and in students.  I could honestly listen to him talk for hours, he's that fascinating.",1
She failed to teach things well to the point I learned more about U.S history in my Africa class. She spent two whole days going over Indians in the new world and spent maybe five minutes on the American revolution. Her class is random crap she decides to talk about. She repeats things differently and goes too fast. Powerpoints were useless.,0
"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",0
Great professor. Class is mainly him giving examples of problems exactly like test. He gives a lot of pop quizzes so you can't really miss class. His lectures are easy to understand and all homework is online. Tests are only 6-8 problems,1
Tolich is the man,1
"His exams have nothing to do with whether you learned the material or not. He simply takes small details from photographs and picture captions and tests your memory, of 8 CHAPTERS AT A TIME!",0
Professor Mock its a great passionate teacher of history. Good at helping students with what ever question. Takes his time and give plenty of examples.,1
Euro history to present online. He is very forgetful and would not open the units til late in the week. Test were very hard you must read and listen to online lectures. Essays must be at least 2 pages but he is lenient in grading and is consistent. I think he switched two of my grades by accident. Not bad if you read and do the assignments.,1
"This professor just does not seem to have any knowledge on teaching. He is extreamly unorganized, and you just cannot follow what he is saying. Honestly I don't think he has any intrest in his students.",0
Simply shouldn't be teaching in 2020. It's time ASU did something about this,0
"Excellent professor! His examples in class are straight from the text book. He is very funny also, however a little antisocial. Sometimes for his exams will give you something crazy that you have not seen before.  Easy grader.  He is always 5 - 10 minutes late to class and tries to make up the lost time by forcing the class to stay 5 minutes longer",1
"Boring lectures but easy assignments, quizzes, exams (everything from sample questions); helpful during office hours; recommendable",1
I have a problem with him making us buy his book during class.,0
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
"Nelson may be a ""brilliant"" author; this does not make him a good professor. Nor an ""OK"" one. His classroom persona/schtick/call it what you will, precludes his engagement with material and students. His classes exude what appears to be a lot of knowledge, but you'll leave class everyday emptyhanded- because everything Nelson does is about Nelson.",0
"ridiculous grading. Math is universal, but not for him. You not only have to learn math, but also HIS math. He wants you to copy exactly as he does it. Very discouraging as he states that not even D is guaranteed. Avoid. He says and believes that calc is hard and that most people will fail. If you want to succeed, get someone that believes you can.",0
"It's hard to understand her not only because of her accent/ways she words things, but because she likes to complicate the big picture before you're able see what it was to begin with. She's a sweet lady, but I'll definitely be avoiding her classes in the future.",0
"I have to say some people are meant to teach and some are not. This ""teacher"" is not. Goes off topic a lot. She is no help in lecture, doesn't explain things well in lab, and doesn't review for test.  I would not suggest anyone to take her. If you do Good-Luck!!",0
Not a nice teacher. Very rude and condescending. I felt like I was a bother to her if I had an issue. Not a people person at all. She was late to class on the first day.,0
"He is so interesting! BEWARE: He's switching up the old exams- do not just study them alone anymore- after 10 years, he's finally beginning to make a new exam. You can get a B or a B+ from studying the exams alone presently, where in past years you could have gotten an AA-. Read his slides. Bolded or things in red are crucial.",1
"One of the best professors at St. Francis College. She'll make you enjoy coming to class. Makes everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Lots of group work, but also lots of extra credit. I've taken her before and am taking her again. Would def recommend!",1
"Professor Stewart is a great professor to take for accounting. I enjoyed his class and wish I could take him again. He doesn't take attendance, but you need to attend because he lectures heavy over the content. Also, the TEXTBOOK is MANDATORY!",1
"I'm a Bio major that has to take a lot of science classes, but I chose to opt out of a lot of them for her classes, which shows she's worth it. She does give a good amount of papers, but if you go to her office hours, she proof reads them an unlimited amount of times. Her exams and quizzes are easy, so long as you take minimal notes. Show you care.",1
Never available to get help from.  Grades are based off of midterm and final only.  He didn't even know my name!,0
the information was easy to understand and apply but the test just seemed complete 180° from the quizzes and homework,0
I decide to take Stats with professor because she had really good rating.... her teaching skills are awful and always has typo in her lecture notes. Her homework is useless when it comes it studying so much work for nothing....,0
Awesome class! Very interesting. Enjoyed every minute. Must take class.,1
He's a bad Prof that doesn't know how to teach material. He also showed some kids email in class to everyone saying that he was sick and wanted to email his assignments. Rick then complained about the email for ten minutes. Basically a volleyball coach that for what ever reason for what ever reason was able to land a job as a Prof.,0
"Nice, energetic and helpful, with really interesting routines in modern. Not the typical boring contemporary stuff. Definitely would recommend.",1
"All I have to say is good luck! This professor is a very tough grader and gives tons upon tons of homework. There were always various assignments due at one time, whether it be a lab, worksheets, or online homework. I took 20 units last semester and never had as much homework in all of my classes combined than I did for this single class.",0
"Poor class with too much work. It focuses more on the communications as a whole than from an IT perspective besides several weeks. Helm himself is actually a nice guy to talk to, but the class content and course itself is tremendously difficult. Sadly the reviews of the class itself are very accurate. Prepare for long hours on homework too.",0
"Listen for nonart majors, this class will kill your GPA if you think oh that's an easy A. He's rude and tough grader. I took an upper-level painting class and got an A, this is a 1000 level class and he gave me a C?? this class makes no sense like is this even art ?He's too demanding someone needs to put him in his place cause it's 1000 level class",0
By far the hardest class I have ever taken. Never have liked his attitude. Don't be fooled by his niceness on day one. He belittles students in class for asking questions. LOTS of papers due that take tons of time. Be prepared. Worst teacher I've ever had. You won't feel confident in your work. Does not encourage you and makes you hate  the subject,0
"Great professor, would definitely take a class with her again!",1
He is a great professor and I can't wait to have him as my professor again.,1
Taking French 2 with him he expects us to be basically fluent in French and expects us to know every exact detail FROM French 1. Comes off friendly but can be uncaring and unsupportive of students who need help.,0
"His lecture is absolute garbage. Not relevant to hw or exams. He is a hard grader as well. In other words, he is smart but teaching is not his thing.",0
"She is a great teacher, just have to give her a chance. She gives a lot of homework and the class is very independent, however she is always there for questions if needed. I would definitely choose her again!",1
"This class was a nightmare. I am a 90+ student, but I struggled to get above 70. He throws in unpredictable twists on his exam questions that have not been covered in class. His examples on the board were always riddled with mistakes and made understanding the content very challenging. Definitely go to office hours and do all practice exams.",0
"She is frustrating to say the least. Her grading is entirely inconsistent and arbitrary. She will leave you contradictory remarks on your drafts, and will mark you down a grade without explanation. She has her favorites and for some reason refuses to grade anonymously like most law schools do. She made me want to transfer schools.",0
"This man knows absolutely nothing about Muslim Fundamentalism. However, that does not stop him from giving his ""expsert"" opinion every time he can ""grandstand"". Stay away!",0
"Mrs. Moseley is a great teacher! As long as you come to class and put some work into it, you'll come out with a good grade. She gives short quizzes everyday that are easy as long as you read the night before and she gives out bonus points. Make sure on essays to go to tutors, that will help save your grade!!!",1
Awesome professor. Highly recommend her for COMSTD-2. The group projects were really fun and she gives you a lot of feedback to help you be more comfortable speaking in public.,1
"I took Botany, Plant Bio, and latin and greek scientific terminology from Christine. She is a tough teacher if you don't have any interest in the subject. She is an amazing teacher if your are interested. Sharp as a tack, witty, and just sweet and caring. She doesn't have patience for slackers though!",1
Good prof. went through the material pretty fast but gave good explanations of everything. You can skip a few classes here and there but don't miss too many or you will fall behind.,1
Professor Long offers a ton of assignments to ensure you succeed in her class. She offered a study guide prior to the tests. Most of the assignments are very easy and only take minutes. She cares about her students and wants everyone to do well in her class.,1
"Professor Ramsey has no communication skills what-so-ever with her students. She has a poor attitude and I don't like being snarked at when I ask for help. Overall, the class is easy... But communicating with this professor is a chore.",0
"Dr. Crawley is one of the first professors I've had here at Marywood. He is kind, understanding and you can tell he really loves his job. He is the head of my department and whenever I have questions or concerns he answers very quickly. His class is tough but he helps you through. I'm disappointed I won't have him again before graduation.",1
Chidinma Udezeh is awesome professor i took her class on fall and i got A+ ,1
Professor Logue was amazing!:) I learned so much with her and her grading and expectations were very clear from the start. I have had her for Spanish One and can not wait to be able to take Spanish Two with her!:),1
"This is an online course during covid, and the professor made this class much harder than it should have been by the course being so disorganized and the material being so heavy, but also not clearly/fully explained. I do not recommend taking this course online with this professor.",0
Go to class and show her that youve learned something. She really appreciates creativity so if youre not an English major you dont have to do an academic paper. Expect group work. Juliet is a lovely person and really cares about her students. If you show her you are paying attention you will get an easy A.,1
"Horrible, more interested in where you put a comma than if you got anything from the assignment. Question if he reads the papers or just looks for MINOR grammatical errors. Tests so long you can barely finish. He talks to fast to take notes and then reads long quotes that are needless. ""A"" student that may pull a low B. ",0
"you basically need to study on your own, lectures are super boring and no quizzes to boost up marks. He is also very picky and a tough grader when it comes to wording for the written part of his exams. If this is your first time taking the course, you should probably get someone else to really explain the information since bio is generally hard",0
"Not a good lecturer at all. He mostly faces the board, and goes really fast. Homework is worth a lot and graded for accuracy, so make sure you're getting all of those problems right. The tests are based off old exams and the homeworks, but are generally still really difficult.",0
"She is a riot, but the class I took was a bit like a tour of a museum of exploration.",1
"He provides lecture notes, but they are very unorganized and involve a lot of unnecessary detail, and he doesn't tell us what is important for us to know. He goes off on tangents, wasting valuable class time, and further confusing his students. Averages are in the 70s on most of his tests, but he does nothing to change that or help his students.",0
"Very sweet and caring professor! My first semester of college and she gave me a great learning experience/atmosphere!I recommend her to everyone, pretty simple grading scale. You go mrs. p!",1
"The class was fun. Prof. Goldner a bit of an awkward lecturer, but he clearly knows his stuff. He assigned 4 (pretty interesting) books to read, and you need to write a short essay for each of them, but he drops the lowest grade and grades pretty nicely, so you can get away with skipping one if need be. Tests are mostly multiple choice. Easy A.",1
Couldn't understand a thing he talked about all semester. Doesn't help his students. Horrible. He will let you out early but thats about it. You can go to all the tutoring in the world and show up to his classes. Even when he clearly sees your trying he wills till fail you. Avoid.,0
"Dr. Brown is one of the worst professors NC State has to offer. His lectures are absolutely useless in which he emphasizes stuff that does not matter I would extend a whole semester than to take a class with him again If you are unfortunate enough to take him, I would suggest treating the class as an online class and learn the concept from YouTube.",0
"Shes pretty nice and I understood alot of the things, but when it came to certain types of science she just wasn't very clear about it. The workload can get too heavy soemtimes.",0
"Hands down worst professor I have ever taken. Save yourself the immense headache and take this class with someone else. He is terrible at explaining things, and makes you use a textbook that he wrote which is full of mistakes. He doesn't know what he's doing, and he's rude to students who ask questions. Nor will he help you outside of class.",0
"The tests are very much based off the slides, but go to class so that you can write down the extra little details that can pop up for some questions on the test. The hw is tedious but not hard, its easier than the tests. One test drops, and 2 hws drop, plus opportunity for extra credit. Not much outside studying is needed if you just go to class",1
"This guy is the man.  He's a police chief and you can tell. Loves telling personal stories, makes u always interested, makes you understand and learn. No book needed, good grader- take this class.",1
"Easy class. Do what he says, study, and you'll pass with no problems.",1
If you have to take computer science at USC Upstate I would NOT recommend Mrs. Con. She almost never replies to emails and when she does it is not helpful to you and is rude. She takes this class VERY seriously. She is a very condescending person. STUDY FOR TEST!!! They are incredibly hard.,0
Great Professor. As long as you do the reading and re-read slides you can pass the class with a good grade. Discussions are a key part of the curriculum. Took it during summer and therefore it was very reading intensive. Clicker questions about the readings. Just do what youre suppose to to and youll be fine. Is lenient with attendance.,1
"This is without a doubt the hardest class I've had yet. The amount of information he wants you to understand is astounding. Especially when you're taking it online and you are in an exccelerated class. Watched the lectures, read the text and gone over the slides. I wish this class was not required. Even people I know in the industry already laugh.",0
"Really, really awful professor. He's intelligent, but not at all helpful, and doesn't really want to make things helpful.",0
"HORRIBLE!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He hates life. Never happy. It's his way or no way. You opinion doesn't matter. Have no idea how he still teaches there. He will give you a zero for wrong format, wrong folder, if he doesn't like your opinion. Should not teach. He hates everything. He's the devil of English. He enjoys being miserable. No sympathy!",0
Took his calc 2 class at Scripps and loved him! Very hard class but he makes it so it's easy to get a good grade even if you don't do everything right. Homework assignments are very long but you have a week to do them and they are graded very generously and he tells you exactly what will be on the tests. Be sure to take good notes!!,1
"Very interesting class, she is very nice and helpful. You will be bored by the material but love her stories.",1
Prof. Cummings is great.  She gives excellent feedback and really cares about the work you turn in.  She actually reads all of it.  She's also very easy to communicate with and is very responsive.,1
Very interesting.  I am glad I signed up for her class.,1
He is really cool,1
There's a ton of homework. Quizzes are pretty easy. You need to put a lot of time into this class if you want to pass. I do that and I'm on the edge of failing still. He makes his tests very hard!! He's a nice guy overall however so I can't hate him. I just wish he would not make his tests impossible to pass.,0
The BEST english teacher I have ever had!!  He was always helpful and understanding!!  Just the best teacher!!,1
Worst professor ever. He uses slides in his lecture that are dated 1999 and do not match up with his book which the homework and test questions come from.  He is arrogant and shoots down all questions asked.  Also keeps referring to taking Econ classes which I didn't and was not required.  He does not teach this as an Introduction to Finance.,0
"She is a good person, but I feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc. She always wants MORE. There is no way to avoid her. Put it this way, I would rather take Human Neuropsychology than take a class with her.",0
"She was really awesome, I genuinely enjoyed the class. Assignments were fairly simple, just 5 300 word discussion posts & 8 easy quizzes that can be done quickly if you have the power points & outlinesreadings handy, which she gives you unlimited time for, shows the answers rightwrong, & lets you try again. Overall she is nice & understanding!",1
"take him,u will not regret b/c he is the best lab teacher. willing to go around the room to tell the parts of the organism models when u want him too. quizzes r a lot easier than the other teachers'. he doesn't look good tho.",1
"Awful, awful, awful, awful. She goes off on tangents more than teaches the class. I've never had such a terrible professor in my life. All she does is read her ridiculously wordy powerpoints instead of actually teaching, and lectures you on how you should know the material as much as her. Stay away if you can, she enjoys making you feel dumb.",0
If by chance there is another analytical teacher definitely go with the other choice. TTS is cool but she is very unclear and unorganized with lecture material and lab material. I was completely lost the whole semester despite asking for help as much as possible. Online format may have posed an issue for her.,0
Yemut gets frustrated when students ask questions... rolls eyes and goes fast when going over the material. He will ask if anyone has questions but expresses irritation if a question is asked and has a strong accent. I used to love math but since i've taken his class i now hate math,0
"She's a sweet lady, but very quirky. She has a very specific way of grading assignments, and if you don't follow it exactly she'll take off points. It's easy criteria, she's just super picky about it. I didn't feel like I had the freedom to really get better as a public speaker because she forced us to use such a plain mold for speeches.",0
"Please take this with a grain of salt. I had the pleasure of having professor Adrian Garcia as my film 3 professor. All though hes nice and very easy going, I wouldnt take any of classes again. Hes unorganized, seems to make things up along the way. Doesnt speak thoroughly (ex: he informed my class that we had to present a film idea to...)",0
"Terri is very nice, but she can't really teach. She just reads straight off the PowerPoint and doesn't elaborate on anything. It's pretty much up to you to learn the material on your own. Her tests and quizzes are all multiple choice, but she words her questions weirdly and asks things we don't really cover in class. Avoid if possible.",0
Easy class if you do the work! He is open to any questions and will often explain them in an easy to understand way! Probably the most helpful math teacher Ive had!,1
"He's OK, knowledgeable but like some others pointed out a little too frank which comes off intimidating. I'd take him again if I had to. Class is way to easy once you understand the way it grading, quizzes, etc works. ",1
"Really lively, funny teacher, although she might not seem like it by looking at her.  Once she starts speaking you can tell she really loves the subject and she made the class very interesting.  Had to use the book a lot for studying.  The class had very interesting topics as well.",1
"He definitely knows his stuff, but also expects you to know it all as well. When it comes to the exams, they are not at all what he actually teaches and what he makes the practice exams look like. It seems as though he tries to trick his students which I do not understand. Ive 4.0d all my other science classes... this one not so much.",0
"Great class, I would take her again. Clear on requirements although there aren't too many. She had a lot of experience and it shows in lectures. Show up and you have to take notes, but I liked the class a lot.",1
"I took professor Luckett for social work, and I loved it. He answers your emails and questions almost immediately. And his test are everything he discusses in class. ",1
"Professor Tulin is amazing. He tells you exactly what you need to know, but it takes time to adjust to the type of memorization and regurgitation that he expects on tests/essays. He is always available outside of class, and is really knowledgeable so talk to him. First 2 absences are free, takes away a full percentage point for each one after.",1
"He reads straight off the chapter outlines so the ""lectures"" are really boring. He grades only a few things and he's not a tough grader. I think he mainly did a completion grade for the four essays (400-500 words) we did. All your work is done online, including the tests. It's a pretty easy class. I don't think you even have to show up to pass.",0
"His lectures were pointless and he would often ramble, but I went to every one because his clicker points are extra credit. Other than that your only grades are 3 super hard tests. I thought this would be an easy natural science, and I was so wrong. He can be pretty funny, but it's not so funny when you're borderline failing cause he doesn't teach.",0
"If you just want to take the course, yes he's a generous grader. If you want to do some research, you should rethink about it",0
"Has the ""fun teacher"" personality but publicly exploits students when they do something wrong or harps on when they ask a question he doesn't feel like answering. Also provided mandatory course content that wasn't even accessible for most students and told them to ask classmates to do it. Basically could fail if a classmate doesn't do me a favour.",0
I took her 0314/1314 class this semester. Her teaching methods are hard to understand because she would teach the long way for problems. She teaches you 4-5 chapters every class period and then wed have a test the following week. She provides notes for the lecture and does go over the test review. Shes a nice lady but I would not take her again.,0
"He gives extra credit worth a whole exam to replace your lowest score. Like the reviews state 3 tests online multiple choice, easy questions, even if you get average scores, the extra credit brings you up to an A. The discussion board was about the budget due until finals week. Easy A class.",1
I really liked him. He is very down to earth and the class was very interesting. Only a couple papers and a final group project. Class field trip was fun too.,1
Autumn is a very intelligent teacher that knows what she is teaching and can apply it to teaching the students well also. The class is hard but she makes it easier and is very thorough with teaching .,1
"Zimmer is amazing! He's a really caring and incredibly funny teacher, and if I could, I would have him for every class. He does assign you a lot of work, but it's all pretty manageable, and he always makes his expectations clear. He's also always willing to give feedback, and while he can be a harsh grader, I really feel I improved bc of his class.",1
Not very clear with paper grading(even if you follow what he asks for). Reading quiz every class so make sure you read. The readings were interesting but there are easier options out there. Don't take unless you have to. Attendance is mandatory cause of quiz and participation grade. Tough grader.,1
Very rude to her students and does not respect them. She does not care about the success of her students.,0
No feedback on any assignments.  Takes him the whole semester to get your assignments back to you.  Grading scale for A is 95% and higher.  He doesn't respond to emails.   He isn't teaching this class. Links to rubrics for assignments are not there.  No link to grades. He is awful.  You don't learn a lot.  ,0
"I may not like her but I do respect her. Good teacher, thorough explanations and applications of the material. Certainly has an attitude and will not hold your hand: pay attention to the syllabus and assignment descriptions. She's the only professor I've had who I felt held us to college standards, not high school standards.",1
She has too many things to do after class. And all the deadlines and submit links are mixed and confusing. She rarely answers emails. And she grades very slowly.,0
"She seems like a smart professor but just cant convey her thoughts across. I try so hard to understand but the language barrier is tough. She tries her best to make sure we understand but doesn't really help much, rather confuses more! tests are very ""unique"" as well!",0
Tons of readings that were only useful half of the time. The lectures didn't include that much participation from the students and he had a tendency to trail off on tangents and lull you to sleep with his voice. He is a great guy and if you're somewhat engaged as a student you'll pass. But not as enjoyable as it could have been.,0
Loved her. Wonderful professor. Easy to get along with.,1
"Worst I've ever had. She doesn't give any bullet points for the tests, the material is extremely long with tons of new scientific terms. She reviews the chapters AFTER the test is taken, which proves her lack of professionalism. Gives you Ds and Fs no matter how well you do the homework and refuses to give clear explanaitons. She will ruin your GPA",0
"Asking a lot from the students, maybe too much. It's true that he knows his stuff very well and he's a world-leading autority on many subjects, however he is a bit old-fashioned.",1
Great professor. Makes you work alot but will help you any way she can. Fun lectures. She's a bit strict on showing up tp class on time and turning in assignments on time but otherwise she's nice.,1
"Sa Signature:Écologiste humaniste altermondialiste coopérativiste postcapitaliste. Si vous préférez un cours où l'idéalisme prend un second rôle derrière la réalité, voir ailleurs. De plus, sa plus grande exigence est la présence, donc c'est pas un gage de haut niveau.",0
He's very energetic and gives great feedback. Always willing to help. If you attend his classes and participate you're sure to get a good grade.,1
Really confusing.,1
Mr John class was very interesting. I learned alot how to use grammar with new vocabulary to wite correct sentences. He spent alot of time to help me too in his office with another class I had. Mr. John is very good teacher.,1
"Professor Kobak is very passionate about developmental psychology and it is evident in his lectures. His lectures are insanely boring. They seriously seem eternal, but he does not put his full slides online so it is good to go. Also he has clicker questions he uses for extra credit. If you don't read you will not get an A.",1
"Very lenient grader, especially for tests. The content is pretty doable and her lectures help a lot. Tests are pretty similar to her reviews. Assignment wise there are webworks and assigned worksheets which aren't too bad. Lectures can be a bit slow boring and she can be a bit disorganized but overall a great professor, highly recommend!",1
"Don't believe the hype. He turned out to be pretty average. Left-winged, Dependence Theory; same things you would hear in other classes. Lectures consist of him reading off slides 90% of the time. He tries to get input from the class, but the same 4 opinionated people, more than likely naive Freshman, dominate discussion. VERY DISAPPOINTING",0
"Thick accent and just moves to hard tricky problems to give for your test. Has a complicated grading system of extra credit and quizzes and tests.  Really beware of pop quizzes, it used to be open book, then it wasn't. Multiple choice tests-very hard and no partial credit for problems (150 pts)",0
"Sincerely hope no-one ever has to get this prof ever again. He is quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  Refuses to actually help students, belittles students, and is very sarcastic.  He should, without question, be fired.",0
she is a great teacher. always willing to help. she gives a lot of homework and quizzes but it all helps for tests. I had her for intermediate algebra and college algebra and wish she was available for trig!,1
It is not difficult to do well in his classes if you go to class and listen to what he has to say ON TOP of what he has in his Powerpoint slides. He is a very nice person and  quite cheeky when he wants to be (he has perfected the stink-eye)! He is a incredibly knowledgeable and can be lenient with conflicting midtermassignment dates. Not so bad ,0
"Tests you over rote memorization of schematics. Schematics are very detailed. You talk about a horrible approach to teaching. Why does it matter if I can remember the exact location of a capacitor if I can tell you exactly how the circuit functions. Essentially, he is the teacher that dissuades you from becoming a teacher. Nice guy though.",0
"Gives great lectures. I enjoyed the time in the beginning of class when we talked about current events/issues. The class is easy if you review the key terms, topics, and big concepts in the books. You don't need to read all of the textbook/s to do well, just know the definitions from the book. Some of the things he says in class are on the exams.",1
"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",0
Dr. Hansen is probably the most down to earth professor that I have had. He understands that your a busy college student and will work with you when something gets in the way of your work or a field trip. He's really passionate about what he teaches that help out with some of the boring lectures. But Dr. Hansen is by far one of my favorite profesor,1
Show up for class and study hard.,1
Gives plenty of extra credit. no need for textbook. sends out reminder before test and assignment due dates. ,1
"*Sighs* I took this class because it was supposed to be fun and easier. This is the most ridiculous ""class"" I have ever taken. The quizzes and exams are literally impossible no matter how you prepare yourself. I could not believe my scores, I am an A student and this class will certainly affect my GPA. Stay away @ all costs!!",0
By far the best teacher I've ever had. Tests are from lectures (so record them). Do lab questions before going to lab. If you're ahead of the game she will appreciate that. Always ask a lot of questions. She's extremely smart & a very impressive teacher. I learned so much from her. Highly recommend for future RNs. You won't regret taking her class.,1
A genuinely great teacher. Has the best sense of humor any mathematician has ever had. Makes retardedly hard math bearable. I wish I'd taken more classes with him. Nice guy to boot.,1
"Sadly the lack of reviews on this guy led me to take his class due to this class being set in the morning. First off, he relies heavily on the book to teach which isnt great because his tests barely reflect what you were taught and was supposed to learn by doing the homework. Also very inconsistent. Overall, take someone else.",0
This class was easy. Grade consists of a paper based on volunteer work and a paper based on a movie. I barely went to class and got an A. She's so sweet and willing to help all the time.,1
"I like her but not as a teacher. She doesn't mind you coming by her office hours and she's helpful. Apparently 070 has a strict rubric and she has a lot to get through in one class. Makes you feel dumb for asking questions... but rushes through content. You have to come to class, textbook she'll project so just get the book HW out of it, thats all",1
"All throughout the semester the class I thought was going fine until halfway through the semester no grades were posted trying to get ahold of him was impossible. If you wanted to know your grade you had to ask wasn't readily available, just a total disaster.",0
"First math prof. at MUN, great guy and great teacher",1
"The teacher is fine, the class was fine for me. There are around 4-5 papers with enough time to turn them in. there is not much to learn mostly just understanding the readings and writing.",1
"Some lectures were rough around the edges, due to him not teaching microeconomics for a while, but he showed a clear passion in the subject and I am sure the minor problems will be fixed by the next time he teaches this class. He tries to make economics interesting by showing pop culture clips related to the concepts. Definitely a great professor.",1
"Lots of reading but the Connect portal made it pretty accessible. The portal asks you if you want to read first or try the questions first, and if you get the question wrong, it provides you with a link to the specific part of the online book with the relevant info. She also let me makeup a discussion question.",1
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"She is an amazing professor! She really knows what she's talking about and even cracks a corny joke now and again. Her readings can be a bit dry, but she's so willing to help if you have any questions. She definitely helped improve my writing :)",1
He has a very strong accent and I have felt as though he does not want to help his students. He moves on without working with you. Terrible,0
"Personal experience and friends taking the course, he tells you what will be on the exam .... he gives you the complete opposite.  He definitely knows what he is talking about but is very boring in class.",0
"Weighed way too heavily on the Aleks program. No in-class instruction, aside from answering students' questions one on one, which was not always helpful or clear. Didn't really teach, only intervened when she deemed necessary.",0
Is not attentive to students. She does not answer emails. Grading is straight foward but assignments are beyond confusing. Textbook used is confusing as well. ,0
"Prof Chambers is excellent ! Although she makes students participate in class, it is actively engaging, which helps students remember the material. She makes statistics understandable and helps understand the concepts behind the formulas! One of the best professors I have ever had!",1
I loved the material but not the professor! She was unavailable and literally late to class every single day. The worst part was that she also let us out late every day. She never responded to students emails and very unavailable for office hours. She also constantly forgot what she had assigned. The material itself? Amazing! Totally recommended.,0
"I loved Crawley both times I had him, for physiological psych and for psychological apps of stats. Tests are tough and there was a quiz every class for physio, but that was only to help us stay on track and ensure we were reading our books. You can tell he knows what he's doing and he loves it. He's always gone out of his way to help when needed!",1
Dr. Mark Miravalle has to be one of my favorite professors. I've taken Mariology and Christian Spirituality with him. He knows his material very well and knows how to present it in an easy and relaxed manner. He goes give you a lot of information though and you really have to study hard for his exams. But it's all worth it!,1
"He told us on the 1st day of class that he was lazy. What kind of a teacher tells you that. He gets mad when the class did not get what he was teaching, and he even used very BAD words in class. NOT COOL!",0
"Sometimes contradicted her text, but overall knows her stuff very well and really tries to help you.  Puts people on the spot but only because she wants to help.  Very funny, and I learned a lot from her. Songs are so much fun!",1
Hard class but not necessarily a bad teacher.. you just need to do your part. The tests are very hard but his curve is awesome. He also gives a quiz almost every class worth 10 points to keep you on your feet. I would say it's not the end of the world if you sign up for him but he's probably the hardest teacher for 120/121.,0
If you participate there is no way you can get anything less and A. He is passionate about COMMUNICATION.,1
She's helpful and makes the class fun! Definitely promotes friendships within the class and wants you to pass. She makes sure to answer every question that you might have! She also posts the book (an older version) link for everyone so I never even looked at the book. ,1
"Professor Vitz genuinely cares and is passionate about what he teaches. However, the lectures are sometimes irrelevant to the material you are required to learn and his lecture slides are not of great help. You have midterm exam, 3 reading reflections (1-2 pages), a short essay (5-6 pages), and a final essay (originally 9-10, reduced due to COVID)",1
"Wike was an AMAZING Professor! Her class for me, was overall pretty easy. 2 exams. 1 final and i want to say 6 quizzes, lowest one is dropped. She is very clear on what she expects you to know for the quizzes and exams. The only downside is it's all in essay format. Alot of reading to do! And lectures were dry. But a great teacher! TAKE HER!",1
"Very helpful, she wrote the book, literally.",1
"Easy online class for comp but very anti government, white people rule the world, everyone is racist, grades hard on the papers but all around easy work. One paper due each week and many discussions but they're simple.",0
"So this professor wasnt necessarily helpful, he did not provide good feedback at all and can be very unfair. The only thing I liked about his class was lecture. Everything else was a disaster. Prepare to be disappointed.",0
Great professor for history. Clear with what she wants you to learn. She gives you exactly what is on the test before hand and reviews it offering extra credit. There was 4 primary source papers that she grades really easy. ,1
She is wonderful.,1
"Really cares about what he teaches. When I become a professional, I would like to be like him!!!",1
Don't bother to take the online class.  You will receive little to no specific or constructive feedback on assignments.  You will do tons of useless busy work.  She will have you write rough drafts that she will not bother to grade or provide feedback on before the final draft of the paper is due. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.,0
"The work load is RIDICULOUS!!! I dont think he understands that we have lives outside of schools. We have familys and jobs! his class alone takes at least 4 days out of the week worth of work! He's a great teacher and person, very helpful. You can really tell he likes his students however its not worth the stress!! I do not recommend.",1
"Tana was a really nice and engaging professor. But you can easily get drowned in the reading and the memos are graded incredibly harsh. Though, because I participated a lot during the class Tana noticed this and bumped by grade up because of it so she's an understanding teacher as well.",1
Would not recommend unless you're a freshmen. The class was a dread to go to and kind of annoying because it was a waste of time but it was extremely easy.,0
"Very rude,mean,disrespectful to student I don't know why he hasn't been reported to the art department !",0
"Homeworks is optional, but do it! Trust me! I didnt do my homework the first half of the semester and only passed this class by the Grace of God! VERY test heavy. Does not give extra credit. Usually only explains things one way even if you ask because you do not understand. She tries hard to be helpful and great; but in my opinion, she isnt.",0
I absolutely loved her and loved this math class. She was absolutely an amazing math teacher. She was my first math professor at college and I ended  up taking her again another semester best decision ever. If u put in the work you will pass if you ask questions she will answer and she also extra help class available. Would take her again,1
"Prof Moscarella is really caring, which makes it even harder to leave a low rating. She wants students to succeed, but she doesn't really seem to understand how to make that possible. The lecture material doesn't match what you're tested on, everything is disorganized, and there are way too many assignments, leaving ZERO time to actually learn.",0
"First of all I just want to say Thank You to Professor Slate for teaching me the materials that I didn't know of. I'm a Second English Learner and it's pretty tough for me to understand the materials, but she explains everything clearly to where I understand and was able to do it. Take her and you'll never regret it. She is an awesome professor.!",1
"Brown is the WORST teacher at Ball State and is what is wrong with the fitness industry. He is sexist and ignorant. The first half of the semester you have 5 point quizzes twice a week, but the last three weeks of the semester you will have TWO HUGE projects that will drop your grade. He grades so hard, especially because he teaches you nothing.",0
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
"He is a great professor who cares about his students and also he tries to accommodate  everyone. He is one of the best teachers you will find at ECC. Before any tests or quiz, he goes through review with you and also he breaks down his work step by step",1
I took Professor Fink's course for the Understanding Historical Change requirement and she was a fantastic teacher. I'm not a History person so I was nervous about taking this course but her assignments were super straight forward and her passion for the material really motivated me to put in the work. One of the best Professors I've ever had!,1
"2 Exams worth 60 percent, 14 quizzes worth 40 percent of your grade. He gives you no reviews also no powerpoints. Stay far away from this class.",0
Hard hard hard,0
An excellent course. So much to learn from the course material. Completely applicable class. I learned how to complete organizational and case analysis. A very good class.,1
"Dr. Chang is a great professor, with good teaching skills and a passion for the material. He made probability theory very graspable for me. The only problem is that he often shoots down students' questions if they require ""too much ink"" to go over in class. Keep your questions short, or he will blow you off.",1
"I started at URI in 2002 and registered for this class every semester and dropped it until Fall 2004.  First assignment I hand wrote and when I turned it in she said ""No, type, type, type."" Instead of being scared off I stuck with it. She always  wasavailable. Dr. Ferguson gave me the firmness I needed. Currently finishing my Doctorate! Thank you.",1
"Professor Woods was a terrible first choice. She over explains way too much, gives enormous amounts of homework that barely count for anything, grades HEAVILY on tests, and thinks the entire world revolves around her class. Had to drop her to save myself from miserable failure.",0
"Do not plan on getting any help because it won't happen. DO NOT Communicate through email because it's a disaster. And he is very rude, super confusing, and cant hold a conversation. Save yourself the time and do not take him.",0
"Jan is an amazing professor. She has inspired me to become a college professor. Although her courses are difficult, she presents material clearly and is very fair in her grading. Study hard, take lots of notes and you will do well.",1
Dr. vohs is more focused on getting through the class rather then making sure we no the material. If you try to get help from him in his office he  seems rushed and annoyed. Take this class if you already know everything there is to know about chemistry because he isn't going to teach you anything,0
"I have to agree with some of the criticism here. Incredibly intelligent (seriously - very sharp), but if you want to witness an academic cult of personality at its most grovelling, take this class and watch how people who disagree with the professsor (there MUST be other poets than Holderlin and Rilke to examine) get eviscerated.",0
"bad lecturer Has long pauses in the middle of sentences then starts talking about new ideas Notes are available online, but they dont help much Required to memorize 50+ ids for both midterm and final a lot of writing needed for a class without a writ. req",0
"Took this class two years ago about technology and education, lesson design and assessments. The professor drew on a broad variety personal case studies from his elementary school teaching days to broaden your understanding on best practices for 21st Century classroom.",1
"A lot of papers and reading, he is a very harsh grader and his comments on your work are not always the nicest. I wouldn't recommend.",0
"I failed the class, so I might have a bit of a bias. That aside, I found O'Leary's lectures very dull. He struggles with technology more than most and tried to stop students from using laptops for notes (we used 'em anyway). He moves through the material at a good pace but doesn't really explain much. The Tutorial is a must.",0
"My favorite professor at Cal, period. I agree with what others said, I just wanted to to add that she is so helpful in office hours and when she graded my essay it was the most marked up paper I've ever gotten back--I learned a lot just from her comments on my paper. In her class you never forget why you love English; her passion is contagious.",1
"Diffenetial equations is already a difficult class made more difficult by this professor.   Bad: reads directly from book Maple computing assignment BRUTAL tests BRUTAL grading Avg50% Seems reluctant to give specifics when asking for help   Good: easily understandable and seems to care  smart guy, just not a good teacher. You will struggle.",0
"Attendance is mandatory, taken every day. There are only 3 big grades: midterm, a paper and the final, so don't mess up. No other homework. Make sure to take notes and pay attention to his lectures. Reading of primary and secondary sources required. Very passionate about history, interesting lectures.",1
"She was very rude in some of her feedback she gave in the discussion forums , she was not a very good grader she gave me poor grades because i spelled a name wrong , and she seemed like she didn't care to work with people problems that they had if they couldn't do the assignments on time. i would never take her again !",0
"is making an effort now, but her way of interacting with the class at the beginning of the term was very negative. I like the material but i'd suggest not to take this course as an elective, you won't get a good mark with this prof",0
"Really nice guy, will help you if you ask for it. He is very enthusiastic about what he is teaching even though the subject was kind of difficult. However most people find philosophy tricky. If you put effort into this class there is no reason why you can't end up with and A or B. Also mention craft beer if you want a fun conversation.",1
"O'Hara makes the class on their toes by calling people at random. He brings many of guest speakers from the world of journalism to his class. Get ready to go out and interview people, in Coverage of Public affairs you actually get to meet people and post the interviews. Make sure to read the chapters, all quizzes are on the chapters.",1
"I don't even have this guy as my professor but I hate him already from all the reviews I have been reading, I genuinely despise these kinds of people.",0
"Great professor! I took theclass during the Mini Winter session. Though it was condensed into 3 weeks at the most, the professor was so helpful and replied to questions in a timely manner. At first I didn't know anything about HTML and feared of failing the class and the difficulty of it, but it was very helpful and fun to learn. Enjoyed it!",1
There really isn't that much homework.  There are only three test but they are hard.  His reviews suck not helpful at all.  He just expects that you know this stuff bc he is used to teaching higher level course.,0
"If you signed up for Pynns RS class for a challenge, you got one. He makes the course material interesting but hard to learn and keep up with. The tests are 5 strict essay questions long and the lecture itself doesnt even come close to covering enough material for them. Unless you are a Religious Studies major, your money is best spent elsewhere.",0
"First professor rating Ive ever done, but needed to for this one. Genuinely cares about his students and is intelligent and humble. I respect this professor greatly for his genuine caring for his students learning. Would gladly take again.",1
"Take this class only if you have no other classes. He expects you to reach two chapters of a book, summarize all lectures , read an article and summarize those EVERY week for a weekly quiz. On top of that, you have tableau projects due every two weeks and they are lengthy. Aside from his unrealistic amount of classwork, he's a nice guy but cmon !",1
hard teacher and can be rude at times so watch out,0
"This Professor gave us no essay requirements for our final essay. The requirements that were given out previously were vague, and the Professor proceeds to grade us hard on these essays. The work load is excessive as well, and even if you do it all on time it doesn't matter because those who were tardy get to remake the assignments scott-free.",0
Tests are impossibly hard. Don't take!,0
Sociology what? Is there such a science? Don't know cause I didnt learn anything.,0
I really enjoyed this class! A lot of information was provide and we explored a variety of techniques.,1
"She is a horrible professor, absolutely horrible. She tell you you're doing something wrong and will tell you how bad something is embarrass you in front of the class and not even help you to do better. She always brags about how much experience she has yet it doesn't show. I have never met a professor that almost every student has a problem with.",0
Professor Paul Kirz gives it how it is. Awesome class and his work is the best work ever. Gives some homework and will take you far in the music industry. In his class you will learn not the material but also how the industry works and will give you gigs as well!!! make sure to bring him food too! when you do he will give you your fist pro-gig!,1
"I took English 100 as part of the high school accelerated program. Her expectations were clear and she does care about her students. Lots of readings but you only have to do 4 essays, one forum post a week, and a final exam. Feedback from essays were helpful and informative which will be beneficial for your future writing. Would highly recommend.",1
Prof. Valvo is one of the nicest ladies every! it was her first year teaching so she didnt really know what she was doing. But she made Freshman sem. the easiest class. Attendance is mandatory but pretty much everyclass only last 15 mins. You only stay the whole class is there is a speaker! Really easy fun class. Take her for fresh Sem!!!!,1
"3 chapters in the 1st week with 10 assignments that took multiple hours to do each. He lets the book teach, I outlined the chapters & did all the extra problems from the book. He is very strict about the academic code. You have to make sure you re-word everything into your own words. Syllabus & FAQs are frightening. Math was easy.",0
"In the middle of a worldwide pandemic this ""teacher"" was nothing but rude and unprofessional. Would definitely not recommend.",0
"He's a very nice polite man. It's too bad his lectures were very boring and sorta awkward at moments. I'm not sure I would take him to learn or have him as a mentor because he's very black & white & goes by what's given. Class was very easy though. He allowed a typed cheat sheet for exams, curves a lot, and kind of an easy grader. DON'T BUY BOOK!",1
He will prepair u 4 the industry he knows his stuff,1
"She's not bad, but really boring lecturer. You have to remember all the readings though, and she takes off for every little thing on exams. Nice person, but boring. Tests aren't bad if you really know about everything she says in class. You need to go to class to do well in the class. ",0
"Great class....still can't believe we get to talk about current issues in sport every class!  Excellent guy, because he encourages and listens to what students have to say.",1
"Very smart, knows what he is talking about, obviously knows the material very well and is quite good at presenting it.",1
"My previous comments have been deleted, but I dislike Denise so much I come back here and post again about how terrible that class was. Enough said.",0
"Dr. Lamas is a great professor, he is very helpful, and understanding. His lectures are very interesting along with his readings. Not alot of homework just the readings. He provides the readings so, no need to buy textbooks or books. He provides extra credit. Amazing professor highly recommend to take him!",1
"His tests were really hard. The tests were nothing like the labs or homework. His lectures weren't so great, he started off expecting you to understand Matlab and how to code. Major of the class failed or got a D. Not an easy class at all.",0
"Going into the class it seems okay, grades are made up of three tests (drops the lowest of 4) and participation. But the tests are ridiculously specific and difficult, i9f she mentions something in lecture, even in passing, assume its on the test. The average participation grade was 12.5/17. Unnecessarily hard, don't take it.",0
"She is a good teacher, but it takes a lot of effort to get an A in her classes. She grades pretty hard, but she also does a good job of explaining and leading you to the right answer",1
"I had no choice but to take him because he was the only professor teaching Survey of Calculus at Armstrong. He was the worst math professor ever. He teaches terribly and the homework website is so hard to use. Don't buy the textbook, the SMART center on campus and youtube will be your best friend in the course.",0
McGurr is boring but pretty straight-forward with regards to exams and homework. Gives good study guides and extremely helpful homework sessions.,1
Everything is done through Pearson so know your deadlines and complete them you will get a good grade. The powerpoints are available through Pearson that helps with concepts and the math nature. He posts videos on D2L on how to do some of the math so if you save your excel sheets from the homeworks it makes taking the exams much easier.,1
Horrible online teacher. Does not communicate well with students at all. Is not willing to work with students and most importantly she is very rude to some students.,0
"Li Liu is amazing! Her lectures are very INTERESTING, quizzes are based on a textbook, discussion posts are pretty easy. Li Liu has great communication skills, she's very CARING and will work with you if you have any problem or need extra help. Her assignments helped me to become a better communicator, succeed at work and understand people better.",1
"Tompson is hilarious and energetic (even in her 8am section). Her lectures give you all the information you need for the test, so as long as you attend class you don't need the textbook. There were 3 midterm exams (50 multiple choice questions), one paper, and a cumulative final. The tests are easy if you pay attention and study the notes.",1
"Quizzes: based on chapters that are not seen in class yet (always one chap in advance) Assignments: Good for preparation but never discussed in class. Deadlines are not based on what and how fast the material is seen in class.  Midterm: not too hard  Teacher: horrible handwriting,  discourages questions, cannot explain beyond class notes...",0
The lectures don't have content but the labs are great and really helpful! The online quizes literally have nothing that we have ever learnt !!! but there are only two.,0
Sanda has been one of my least favorite professors in the VCD program. Her talk on the first day of classes dismisses any chance of thinking you can get a good grade with her. Her critiques are demotivating and not very helpful. Her project guidelines are vague and usually she is displeased with what students bring in. Poor communicator.,0
"I actually didn't mind this class, everything is clear and straight forward. She allows you to submit late assignments but don't make it a habit. Her quizzes and exams can be found online but you still have to complete virtual labs and discussion posts. The discussion posts are pretty long, but you can honestly just copy the PowerPoint.",1
Cassidy is an awesome professor that leaves the ball in your court. Everything and I mean everything is written out on the syllabus so no excuses. Cassidy even reminds her students when assignments are due. You have to try to get a good grade and you have to try and fail. The choice really is up to you. There is a decent amount of work.,1
The best!!! I can't say more than that. ,1
"Professor Grant was a great professor. His lessons and discussions were very clear. He responded very quickly to emails. My only complaint would be that he took a long time to grade stuff. Going in I had no care for literature and I wasn't really thrilled with taking the class. But, Grant made it enjoyable and I actually feel like I learned stuff.",1
"I came in HATING math but after taking the class with Prof Wells I understood the material very well. Show up to class, do the work, and Id recommend visitng the tutoring center if you dont have the time to visit her during her office hours. Class is easy as long as you put in your time and effort. Prof Wells is amazing 10/10 recommended.",1
He is your worst nightmare come alive in flesh and blood... enough said.,1
If you need lear don't take this calls only you pass if you stay in this contry about 10 years agio or complete your hiss school in usa beacuse he not teach and when you take this class think you take army not class,0
"The worst Professor on Earth, not only is he a tough grader hes also highly inconsiderate. If you have him just consider dropping out.",0
"This teacher is very easy, however, he has a lot of ""war stories"" that he shares time and time again.  THese stories are generally related to the class and are interesting, however, I found them interesting.  I recommend this intructor.",1
I really liked that she was willing to help students.,1
"He Cannot teach, he undoubtedly knows the material but is incapable of explaining it in a way that is understandable. He has horrible hand writing and jumps all over the board making it impossible to follow his teaching. He doesnt offer help to students who ask and he supplies test review and then test you on material that wasnt on the review.",0
"So rude, just do yourself a favor and dont take her",0
"Seemed nice but this class is for the few that can teach themselves an entire 600 pages of material without any help or direction. Mostly he seemed uncommitted to the class, not giving us study guides (just old tests that might be relevant to what we were studying) wouldn't post grades, and took weeks to hand back short papers. Just a bad class.",0
"He is all over the place when it comes to his lectures , he talks really fast and you can never read his handwriting. Its hard to keep up which him when he teaches. Never gets into any real good details in his lectures. At the end of the day, he is passionate in what he does and is a nice and caring person but it can be hard to keep up with him.",0
She's a good teacher,1
For someone who always taught online you would think she would be good but this was ridiculous,0
An easy class to pass but you have to watch out for mood swings. Saw her yell at a student for asking a question. Major attitude problem. Surprised there arent more reviews reflecting this. Probably because her class is so easy.,0
"She is literally the best, I took her online class she is very responsive and makes sure you are taken care of. SHe gave us extra credit and some point I was not even aware we got. She is awesome 3 exams(drops lowest), 1 essay, and final online!",1
Wonderful professor and advisor Attendance matters,1
"I am taking Physiology with Thad right now, nearing the end of the semester.  He has a good sense of humor and makes this hard class much easier to understand.  He enjoys what he does.  Grading takes a while sometimes because he is a business owner by day.  That's ok with me, because he is pretty lenient and I appreciate that!",1
"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS GIRL EMILY JOHNSON! I am not a religious studies person, but she is amazing! She knows what she is talking about and actually made me want to come to class to hear what she is going to say. The whole class is centered around a final paper, so no tests! Easy enough class so that I am engaged but also not overwhelmed",1
"Ugh, biochem is hard but there are other professors you can and should take than him. I understand that teaching through zoom is not his thing, but he rushes through his lectures very often. This class is only based on your exam grades and that is something you should look out for. Fail one exam, and you're out from the race of getting an A.",0
Super easy-going teacher. Very accommodating with her timelines and gives little homework while still being exceptionally knowledgeable in her field.,1
"Well I was interested in the class till attending it turned into a recruitment session for the armed forces. It's packed full of lies and personal opinion, Seals don't make over 100k a year Randy. The fact that you lied to the class shows how uneducated on the subject you are.Just reply Word FOR WORD! from textbooks  and you should do fine.",0
"Lectures are not engaging at all. She attempts to get people involved by asking questions, but is just greeted by awkward silence. Going to lecture/recitation is not necessary to understanding the material. Just read the textbook. Prelims are based on recitation and homework problems, so if you do those, you're set. Low effort to get an A-.",0
"Very helpful and easy to understand. Not boring when lecturing (he sometimes makes jokes and has fun in class).  Slightly difficult, read the material and you will do well.",1
"There were 30 students in the beginning of the class and two weeks later there's only 7 students. Most students dropped because of the workload and it was so bad that the department head noticed and made her talk with us on how to fix the class. If you want to read a lot of useless text and fail a class, then you should take this class. Don't do it",0
If you have no prior experience with physics this class is going to be hard but Wallace is probably gonna be your best choice.,1
"The tests DO NOT match the reviews. If you are taking this class as a requirement and know most of the material already, it's straightforward (tests/hw only). He doesn't ""teach"". He works out a problem of every kind in the chapter (whether you need it on the test or not-overload of info) . He does this quickly & with no patience for questions.",0
"Wow, what a joke. This guy is horrible. Changes his mind on everything from day to day. Makes fun and insults people who do poorly on assignments and/or do not understand the material. Told the class ""if you don't understand my lectures, don't come to class!"". I honestly can't explain in 350 characters how big of a jerk he is. Avoid him at all cost",0
"Dr. Meehan is the funniest sweetest lady in the psych department. She's always willing to help you and she really goes the extra mile to make sure you understand the material with in-class examples. She likes people that come to class, and her tests aren't easy As but you'll learn a lot and she keeps you interested. TAKE HER!",1
Really nice guy and passionate about what he teaches.    three helpful hints: 1) get DB entries done early don't wait until the last minute (trust me i had to learn the hard way) 2) take lots of notes trust me they help and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need  3) take advantage of the extra credit it honestly really does help,1
"She was enjoyable during the beginning. Later on, she became very rude to other students and was often late for grading. She made multiple promises to students but never upheld until EVERYONE started to complain. The workload was fine and you can honestly pull an all-nighter to finish everything.",0
"Before coming to college, I heard horror stories about crazy professors who didn't care if you got an A or an F. Dr. Hauck proved those stories wrong. He set time outside of class to help me understand all of the material I didn't understand. His tests were straightforward if you paid attention during lecture, and he was super fun in lab. Take him!",1
"Plenty of people are saying this guy is great, do not be deceived. Take this from somebody whos been around the block a few times, trust me Ive dealt with some bad professors and I took this class twice with him, none have been as vindictive and cruel. The tests are incredibly difficult and tailored to ensure that you do poorly.",0
"If you need assistance dont look to her for anything. Just do the work and you can get an A but if you email her about small things like extra credit or difficulty understanding an assignment, she doesnt care about it. So its another class you can pass if you can teach your self.",0
"Literally lectures off-topic the entire course. Always mentions ""if it were up to me the corporate tax would be 0%, that way all the people sitting on their couch, drawing checks, would have some jobs"", and always says something about robots taking over at least once each class. I would recommend finding a diff prof",0
Super great teacher. Her tests are just testing if you understand the ideas nothing really there to trick you. She is super nice and the lecture is not too bad. As long as you go to the class and pay attention you should easily get an A on every exam.,1
"Mrs. Moss knows her material, and can answer your questions to the best of her ability, but be careful if you ask a question on something she doesn't agree with. Dissections you basically have to do on your own and hope you do it right. We were given a crayfish, a knife and ZERO instruction. Interesting material, but poorly designed tests. Hard B. ",0
He assigns too much reading  which is too difficult anyway. Trys to talk to students on a high conceptual level when they haven't read the material.,0
"The class material is very interesting and it would have been amazing to learn about if there was a competent teacher. Did not receive a single grade the entire semester and the only thing we received was a reading schedule. There were supposed to be lectures each week, but after 6 weeks in he stopped posting any sort of lectures.",0
She literally reads word for word from PPT and expects you to know how to do the practice questions prior to class. Her online homework assignments take hours on end to complete. Don't recommend taking this class with her at all!!,0
"Justin is clearly exceedingly erudite and intelligent, but he is also a wonderfully down-to-earth man. A philosopher, Justin also has a working knowledge of economics and other disciplines, which only further informs his brilliant lectures. Justin is lenient, true. But if you give your best you will walk away truly enlightened and inspired. A+.",1
"Makes sure to share several good sources of, well, sources.  Loves the topic, very knowledgeable.  Plays guitar.",1
She arbitrarily takes points off for small things that don't even affect the final answer. Very confusing and rude when students ask her questions she thinks they should know. It's tough material but she flies through it and doesn't help that much. She was also gone for a month and we had a sub and she didn't review what we all basically failed. ,0
"Engaging lecturer, absolutely brilliant thinker, and astonishingly helpful in office hours. Brimming with poise. Her class will push you; whiners need not apply. I learned more in her class than any other so far: new words, new  appreciation, new approaches to lit.  Challenging, but clear and patient when you need help. The next gen. of great profs",1
There is a lot of material in this class and it is worth learning. She will clarify anything that is confusing as long as you take the time to ask.,1
I have very few good things to say to her besides the fact that she is nice. Her teaching is reading off a PowerPoint and her tests ask the most obscure and irrelevant questions that are not important Big picture questions. When half the class was struggling through with the pandemic she just said suck it up and would not offer much help.,0
"Marek is a very courteous and professional individual but he has many flaws in regards to his job as a professor. First of all, he does not tell you what he expect. No rubrics or guidelines are given for projects, so you have to do your best and accept the bad grade that comes with it. He also is very inconsistent with his marking. ",0
She is the hardest grader I have ever encountered in my life. Based on this alone I would avoid her.,0
"She was a great teacher. Very well prepared for each class, and even used problems from homework on the tests. All she asked was that you try and she will help you along the way. Great teacher, I do recommend taking her!",1
"Dr. Green has completely changed the way I write. He inspires his students to say and argue for the weirdest things possible, to find what interests them in a text and run with it, and to be confident in what they have to say. I can only hope to be half the teacher he is someday. Take his class.",1
"I don't understand why this teacher yells during his lecture as if the class cannot hear him. He is ineffective as a professor because during a group quiz, none of the students knew what was going on. I would advise to take another professor over this one.",0
"She's loves math. She even has easier techniques other than the book's way to solve problems, be prepared to take lots of notes. Make sure you keep your binders up to date with notes and redo test, b/c she checks and gives extra points for that. Go to tutoring because you get extra points for that as well. Be prepared to buy 150$ TI-84 calculator",1
"There are assignments due for each class, they usually are pretty short though. Sometimes her grading criteria is unclear but she is willing to work with the students to change. There is A LOT of small group work so be prepared to meet EVERYONE in your class because she will make you work with different people multiple times in one class period.",1
she was nice and really cares. lots of homework but will help. you know whats do 3 weeks before. ,1
"CDR Felker knows his stuff when it comes to naval history.  He is a great lecturer and does a good job at presenting the material.  The class requires a lot of reading, but that is just the nature of the class.  He is a GREAT military role model.  Highly encourage you to get him as a teacher.",1
I hate speech and I was not looking forward to this class at all. But Kelli Worrall is such a wonderful teacher and she really helps you feel better about speaking and speech in general. The way she taught made me really enjoy this class! Take her. You will not regret it. ,1
"one of the best, most passionate professors on criminal law. expect a B if you come prepared to class and do your reading.",1
"She is the worst, plz don't take her class if you really want to pass CHM 122. She is so confusing. Never gives you feedback. If you go to her to see if you got a question right or wrong she might change your right answer to a wrong answer. Her tests are hard. Even if you red the book, when you go to class she will confuse you with her lecture. ",0
I took her on line nutrition class and it was a lot of work but not terribly difficult.  A lot of writing.  She did a great job of keeping us engaged and motivated and involved which is tough on line.  She writes a lot of the reading herself and it's very easy to understand.  HIGHLY recommend her.  She's funny and knows her stuff. I learned a lot.,1
"Be ready to dive into the readings! They are absolutely mandatory, and you will be lost if you do not read them. Especially when it comes to the tests, since the questions are not obvious ones. But overall, a nice, very interesting professor.",1
"Great professor. She is outstanding and very helpful. Unless your a freshman who isn't use to the real world and how college works and what professor expect of you then there is no downside to her. She is the ideal engineering professor who goes above and beyond to ensure her students understand via projects, tests, and hands on experience.",1
Lectures very clear and helpful. Exams challenging but interesting.,1
Pia is SO nice and helpful. She is a wonderful teacher and one of the best I have had at Simmons. She makes learning spanish interesting and easy. I highly recommend her as a spanish teacher. Shes the best! Attend class and pay attention and you will do great.,1
"He's a typical overworked PhD student who doesn't want to teach. He often rushes through slides and responds rudely to questions. He won't take late hw though he doesn't grade it for weeks, and he will make your life hard if your project doesn't interest him personally. His pop quizzes are easy & open note.",0
"OK so the homework-It's hard but doable. He's a very easy grader. For the tests, I never read the book- just went through the clicker questions & slides on D2L and got an A on all of them. The quizzes were online.. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS because he puts those exact same questions on the exam! 5 exams and drops one. He also rounds up A LOT!",1
"Prof. Clausen is AMAZING! She goes out of her way to make sure you understand the material. She hosts outside class review sessions after each topic, take home midterms, and tons of practice questions. Does on call by the seating chart, but not harsh whatsoever-just give good faith effort. She feels like the cool aunt you can go to for help.",1
"A TON of homework. One Chapter may have up to 10 homework packets, which should be semi-completed by the time he gives lecture, (which he rarely does.)  Study guides do not match his exams. Grading is difficult to understand. Every other word from his mouth is ""I wont explain it, you guys are at a 209 level. "" Very rude",0
"Ridiculously hard tests, that don't focus on the ""main concepts"" he says he's trying to teach. Lectures are hard to sit through, although he did cut a deal with me when I failed one of his tests. So I can't rate him terrible as a person, just his class sucks.",0
"We're taking an online program called ReadingPlus and its the WORST. I get it done, but I dont learn anything from it. Has nothing to do with reading really. It FORCES us to speed read. we should be able to read at our own pace. And forces us to advance when we're not ready. The whole program feels like a video game. Horrible program.",0
Professor Blackburn is fantastic! He really helped me stay motivated and worked with me to extend assignment deadlines after I lost my job. He really cares about his students.,1
"If you are scared of giving speeches infront of people, take this class with Levy Zamora. He is very down to earth, humble and encouraging. He makes the class atmosphere comfortable and friendly. This helps students feel less anxious about going up in front and speaking. Highly recommend this teacher.",1
Go to class and pay attention and you will be fine. He is straight forward and will tell you what to study for each test and the final exam. His notes are very good and labs are not that bad. MUST TAKE FOR ME3500,1
Great professor! History was never my thing but he makes it so easy!,1
"has an accent but not hard to understand, explains things well and is happy to help. Exams are easy if you do the practice problems. No grades except 4 exams and a final but you can have notecards. He makes statistics very simple. Get out of class early almost every day.",1
"Awesome teacher, not a tough grader and gives a lot of useful feedback and advice!",1
"Awesome teacher! Extremely helpful and available, but you have to go to class and do all the work. Tests are not hard and a major project easy and fun to do. I definitely recommend her!!",1
"I honestly hated this class due to the overly-difficult and dry material, but DJB is one of the best professors I've had. She's so funny, tells awesome stories in class, and is extremely dedicated to making sure you have the help you need to get through the material. The one thing I didn't like about her class was that she cold calls intensely.",1
"Accounting is no joke, but with a good professor you just might have a chance. I took prof Mirbod for (201, 202) and she is officially my favorite professor of all time. Her classes are long and very lecture focused, but it's not hard at all. Make sure you do the Wiley plus homework's and study for exams. She's very understanding as long as you ask",1
"This will be the worst Econ class you take at Creighton. Dr. Wingender will basically ramble on about Obama for an hour and fifteen every single day until the day before the exam. The gist, only show up that one day. Exams are taken over two class periods! Look at the test go home study for two days, come back. If you want to learn Econ, stay away.",0
Read! study the connect homework he gives you as an additional source. This class is easy if you are constantly ahead. Get behind and you will fail. Overall the lecture felt unnecessary. I would have rather taken an online class because It was basically the same thing. Lectures not helpful :(,0
"He'd be fine for someone who is into reading, analysis, and writing detailed papers but I was really just out here tryna get my 102 credit. He's a good guy but his grading is pretty tough, his directions are so confusing, and you have to read so much of the textbook. So if you can, don't take him but if you're stuck it's not the end of the world.",0
"Makes students cry regularly. Gives lectures, but doesn't actually explain anything. Don't take him. Just don't. If you ask him any questions he's condescending and rude.",0
"The king of ambiguity when it comes to big project requirements- you'll fly without radar until the last couple days before something is due, when he tends to finally drop a big hint about what he wants. If you can live with that, he's a great guy and his lectures are very interesting and informative. Talking to him in his office will always help.",0
"Great professor!Practical experience as the top executive(CEO) in several large and small companies. He is intelligent, articulate,fun, very approachable and highly competent. I would recommend him to anyone with an interest in business.",1
"Professor Dunham is by far my favorite professor. He teaches everything you need to know in class, is available for students if they need help. There is no homework but online quizzes. I had to take this class again and the change in professor made such a difference!",1
Very difficult class. Lectures do not help you on tests or homework but attendance is taken. Be ready to teach yourself.,0
"He is very nice and respects students. He is also very empathic, effective and teaches so that students would understand the concepts. Try to attend class and pay attention and you would pass. If possible record his lectures and make your notes from it. His exams are not difficult if you listen to him in class.",0
"I've had bad proffs before but Mr. Haze is very unorganized it's almost unprofessional. He talks a lot about irrelevant things and his directions are so vague and poorly put together be it verbal directions or even written. He doesn't grade timingly ,doesn't keep your grade current,and just generally isn't very direct or responsive when confronted.",0
This class is way too much work during a pandemic and when all our courses are online. This woman acts that we only have her class to worry about!Her explanation for projects is horrible! Would make it easy if she can actually clarify what she wants. Expects way too much. Only class that I have numerous extra stuff. Dont take her stay away!!!,0
"really nice guy and open to trying to clarify any confusion on topics during his lectures which I found out not all profs are willing to do (would rather you ask in office hours or after their lecture). tests are pretty easy as well for the most part, and tests mostly on concepts rather than math and equation heavy questions (only a few per test)",1
Professor was obviously new but semester got better over time.,1
Fenster incorporates Chemistry into History making for great lectures and an even easier time trying to learn the material. Solid Prof!,1
Very fair but critical. She helps you to understand the basics of nursing research so you can be successful and critical.,1
"His online class is super difficult if you fall behind with the material. Quizzes (Chapters 1-17) 40%, Midrerm (Chapters 1-8) (200pts) 30%, and Final (Chapters 9-13, 16-17) (200pts) 30%. Honestly, a lot of work and memorization. Practice Exams are nothing like the midterm or final. Waste of time. Take him in person, or don't take him at all!",0
absolutely do not take his class. this man should not even be employed. he plays favorites like its his job and will make the peoples lives he doesnt like a living hell. he acts like hes grading a harvard students paper. he grades so tough to the point where its ridiculous. he took off my introduce yourself discussion board. like what?,0
"Dr Harkness is an excellent Professor, and makes the difficult (and sometimes boring) subject matter he teaches engaging and much easier. He works so hard for his students and gives every opportunity to learn the material and get a good grade.",1
"She has a bad attitude. She makes a lot of unnecessary comments, snarky remarks and jabs at students for literally no reason, it makes the class environment uncomfortable and makes you not want to participate. She explains things well. If you listen youll understand. But shes very harsh when even though its only a freshman/beginner course.",0
"I dont use this ever, but here I am to warn you to not take David Stone. His average on his exam was a 47% (the first was a 58%), and the final was a 51%. He refused to say what the final exam average was until I asked the TA. He literally sent out a PDF explaining he's not fair bc life isn't fair and hence he wouldn't curve and to just suck it up",0
Horrible student feedback relationship experiences when typing up poorly written via e-mail communications; stumbles upon discussion entry assignments marking off participation points (penalizing students for mistakes); limited availability outside of classroom environment; and final essay exam must be completed for achieving full accredited units.,0
"Class is easy, but boring.  Tests are really easy.  Lots of PowerPoints and movie clips. He does not get to know the students so do not be surprised if he has no idea what your name is until the last week of the semester.  He does check attendance daily, and if  you miss 6 days, you lose a whole letter grade. Miss 9, you get a D, miss 10 and FAIL!!",0
terrible,0
"Yue laoshi's class is clear and although attendance is mandatory class is fun to attend. There is a fair amount of work, but if properly paced the workload actually seems rather light and learning is not difficult as Yue laoshi does her best to answer any and all questions. She's also very accessible through office hours and email. Would recommend.",1
"Assigns labs, projects and exams all coinciding with each other giving you too much work due at once especially if youre full time. Very tough grader and does not give partial credit. Rude when you ask questions and unresponsive to emails. Dont take this professor.",0
I think that she is a wonderful person but I do not that she is a good professor. The class is three hours in class and then three hours online but the time spent in class she does not spend teaching. It makes it really hard to learn.,0
"I've had this professor for two weeks and already, I'm hearing political propaganda that has nothing to do with sociology. I'm not liberal or conservative, but it's really annoying when I have to hear about ""Bush getting his way into Yale free"" when I'm trying to understand what the hell I'm supposed to be studying.",1
"I took her summer online class and she gave an extreme amount of homework. Her reading questions were basically all essay questions that were very difficult. She gives way to much reading and work to do for an introduction class. Also when you tried to ask a question she replies with a snarky comment which, made me never ask her anything again.",0
Prof. Luallen knows what he's talking about but was not willing to slow the pace of class or cater to anyone not immediately up to speed on material. He moved relentlessly through lectures and delivered tests that had to be curved up from low averages every time. Mentions kegs/beers/frats when possible. His class effectively weeded me out of econ!!,0
"Chef Haze was never in class! He was either writeng emails or gone while we cooked the food of the day. If we have ?s, too bad! Poor class, poor teacher.",0
"I would not take her. She makes things difficult on purpose, and for no reason. The class is very boring and there's a lot of weekly work.",0
Statistics is not an easy class to begin with but he tries his hardest to explain to you what is going on. If you can get another teacher for stats DO SO because the word is that Rayburn is the hardest of the two stats teachers.,1
"He is loud and he talks very fast and not clear at all, he can be very theatrical or wimsical when explaining things which can make it fun at times. He never remembers his students, it was an easy A for me though.",0
He made my CSUN experience so much better. He really cares about having his students learn things that we can use for our own career later. He's so understandable. I looked forward to going to class. If i was sick i wanted to be there. He's so inspirational and his grading is amazing.,1
"Pof. Connelly is actually a very good professor. He does Federalist/Anti-Federlist ad nauseum, and you'd better not disagree with him, ever, but he's a good lecturer and he makes you know your stuff.  Granted, he is unapproachable, but he can be helpful once you get past the initial response.",1
"The class itself is super easy, but I wasn't the most fond of Gray as a professor. I liked her at first, but from some of the remarks she's made I realized she's kind of an insensitive person. Aside from that, get ready for boring group projects, being treated like a 12 y/o and lectures that seriously drag. Should've taken the 6 week online course",0
"This is my second course with Professor Wilson. He inspired respect for each other, and he is a fair and compassionate educator.  He's working on his PhD thesis and he is a faculty advisor for several Leadership organization, so I think this might have been the reason for his not showing up for the final.  I would take him again.",1
"I loved Patti- she was a great teacher. A real tough grader, definitely not a class to take for an easy A. Quite a few papers, but overall she really made sure I understood the texts and was always open when I needed help.",1
"His grading and homework is straight forward, but its gets boring often. ",0
She is very smart in her own way but cannot express what she is trying to teach. She is probably one of the smartest people I have ever met but cannot teach what she knows. I relied on the book and other people in the class to get an A. She does post a lot of quizzes online that can really help your grade if you look for the right answer.,0
"Mr. Allen was a GREAT teacher. If you put in the work and respect him, you will do amazing in this class. I would for sure take him again. The people that complain are the ones who dont go to class or dont do the homework after the lessons which for sure help you later on do well on his exams.",1
"Pickiest man on the planet for sure & you'll find out why. Material & tests aren't too difficult but you will have to teach yourself some stuff cause his lectures only help for about 30% of the homework he gives. Lectures feel long and boring. At the end of the day this class is not even that hard, just TIME CONSUMING and PICKY, read the syllabus!!",1
This guy is a total jerk....Really offensive and demeaning.,0
"Easily the best teacher I have ever had.  Also the only teacher that I would stop by her office just to talk to her, because she was very nice, fun, funny and hot :). Bye Chino-sensei, you will be missed but not forgotten.",1
"Overall, I really disliked the class. He talks extremely fast, and is very hard to follow. ",0
"I'm a history major so I thought this would be an easy class being that I have finished most of my upper level division courses and for some reason skipped this one. I've never in my life failed anything history related and I failed all three tests that she gives. Her tests are all essay, and she expects you to almost quote her verbatim.  ",1
"Personally I'm glad I didn't need to learn anything from her. Handouts are poorly-worded, test questions are ambiguous and lab projects are step-by-step directions. She doesn't teach so much as hand out material and test on it later. If questioned on something in a handout, she admits privately to being wrong, but doesn't correct herself publicly.",0
"One of the worst professors/teachers I've ever had. Sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Tough grader but also takes a long time to post grades so it's hard to know how well you're doing. Do not take her class unless you have to.",0
"If you want an easy A, take Caruso. Funny, energetic guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind on crazy things. Lectures are often his coverage of the material along with class input. Tells you what you need to know for the tests, of which there are only a few that he lets you use your notes for. Get ready for a fun, entertaining class.",1
"Not going to lie this class was my most difficult this semester. Bobs a bit of a tough grader and the speeches take a good amount of time to prepare. However he gives back great feedback. I actually think Ive grown as a person in his class. Im glad its over, but Im really glad I took it.",1
"I have always loved History Theory but Rob ruined the class for me and many others. He puts down students publicly, wastes our time when we have group assignments that need to be finished within 2 hours, and grades unfairly. He gives the same grades to students in group assignments that do nothing or do everything. He needs to fix this class.",0
"Very nice guy, who wants everyone to do well. Sometimes disorganized or unprepared. Easy grader but gave lots of work.",1
Failed me just because I messed up a PDF citing and didnt even offer a re-do for that part of the paper or a reason why it was wrong.,0
"Professor Maojoudi's course was really intense. He may seem very difficult at first, but he's always willing to help. I've learned a lot from him, and be prepared for a paper due every week.",1
"Not really a cinema class, more of a study on social cultures and politics' effect on movies made worldwide. Some movies were genuinely a bore to watch but some were great films I wouldn't have seen otherwise. I made it through the essays, group presentation, and quizzes with only seeing 3/16 movies. The lectures were very boring as well.",0
"Unfortunately Nassau Community College does not have many chemistry professor options during the spring and the fall semester. Do not take this professor! confusing, misleading, sarcastic, and is very tough on tests. Half the class failed the first test. The only reason I passed was because this class became online during the later spring semester",0
Where should I start? just know you need to eat the book and teach yourself everything. lots and lots and lots of homework. does not understand the situation of his students during the pandemic.,0
"Honestly one of the best professors I have had at SJSU. He knows what he is talking about. Clear when it comes to exams and quizzes no trick questions. You have to show up to class for his lecture. Is willing to help you with any questions you have after class or during office hours. 2 midterms, 1 excel project and 1 final exam.",1
"She is not very precise in her lectures on what you need to know for the tests. She didn't quite answer questions in a concise way, and frankly kinda rude. Honestly, thought I was alright at math before her class. She uses SPSS and expects you to know it.. without hardly any guidance. Very hard time finding a tutor for this class. Good luck...",0
"By far the best physical education class I've taken, where I have enjoyed it and seen results. Coach Milburn is a great & awesome instructor, she motivates you to keep going and she makes the hour or so the best in working out. Take her!!at first it will be hard adjusting to sitting on the bike, but like she said you'll get used to it:)",1
Professor Chu was just an incredibly rude person all around. He often caught an attitude when people asked questions and literally yelled at someone during a quiz. His lectures are useless as all he does is read from the textbook and the quizzes are not reflective of the problems he covers in class. Do well in lab because it will save your grade.,0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I didn't receive a single essay back until the last day of the semester. The professor is not clear about what she wants at all and she never shows up to office hours to ask questions.,0
Roberta was not a great teacher. Our class work consisted of either Roberta going on about something not related or bringing in guest speakers. 6 classes to be exact. 4 of the schedualed clases Roberta was either away or simply did not run class. I dont feel like I learned anything in entrepreneurship 293 as she was no there to facilitate learning,0
I'm getting A's in all my other courses but did terrible is his. Class is 2 midterms and a final and he's a terrible and unfair marker. He'll only accept the answer he is looking for and will even give 0 on questions out of 10 if you don't write specifically what he wants (even if what you say on the topic is factually correct and from the notes).,0
"I wouldn't take again especially for an online class. He doesn't explain the assignments, the readings are difficult and long, and the lectures are overall boring. It seems like the more rubbish you write the higher your grade will be.",0
"I really really enjoyed taking her class. I did have to miss some of class due to work or being sick which brought my grade down.... I should've had a 90%, but I have a 75%. So seriously attendance matters in this class. Learned a lot and she's a great professor would definitely recommend.",1
Very very tough grader. Challenging and very interesting class but it is not worth destroying your gpa. CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSOR.,0
Great professor. She is big in citing your work. Do the work and you will pass. I would take a class with her again. She's very forgiving and easy to get in touch with.,1
Dr. Konen is amusing and does not give out much homework. Always tries to keep class interesting with jokes. The powerpoint slides can get boring if the earth and science isnt your thing. Overall would take again.,1
Worst teacher I have ever had at Augusta State!!!! Does not teach!! All he talks about is football when he should be discussing math. The sample tests look NOTHING like the actual test!! I took him because this site said he was good!!He doesnt answer email and never has office hours!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU WANT TO FAIL!!!!!,0
"Very fun class, flexible with assignments and is there to help, she is prompt in her responses as well. Tests were hard, but not impossible, study hard and don't slack off and you will be able to get an A.",1
"I've had Antonetti for two semesters now and he is beyond great.  Lectures are insanely interesting and he makes sure he takes the time to present all material clearly and so everyone understands.  He is hilarious but never take anything he says about you personal, he likes to mock when people mess up. STUDY YOUR NOTES + DO NOT BUY THE BOOK!",1
"Dr. Hartman is the best professor I ever had. He is funny, intelligent, and will challenge your beliefs (in a good way). I cannot recommend him enough. If you ever have the chance, take a class with Dr. Hartman. He is an amazing teacher and and is always there to help. ",1
While the class is not difficult Professor Zaech is unclear in her expectations. The discussion board work is usually vague and unrelated to the textbook. The textbook was hardly used for the class as the discussions usually did not relate to the chapter that was assigned that week. When you email her for clarification she does not provide it.,0
Great at explaining material and giving extra credit. Likes to bring in treats to hand out to students. Very nice and friendly.,1
Very knowledgable. Went through essays with the professor but failed them each time. Have to give yourself a few days to do the quizzes with them being very long and difficult. Would suggest meeting with her very often to go over your essays over and over till she's very happy with it. Would suggest to show up to every class.,0
"The best math professor I have ever had! She is great at explaining the problems and if you need help, just ask. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She is not a tough teacher, just show up to class and pay attention.",1
"Avoid this guy..Worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of taking a course from. Like the others have said, BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF! He hardly ever lectures and when he does they hard to follow and boring. He has the students do the homework prior to class and then has the students provide the answers. This guy is in it for the paycheck.",0
"He was very picky about work, you would ask him for feedback and he Rufuses to email you and tell you what you are doing wrong. all my assignments are 70 and why I don't know , he hasn't told me",0
"She is AMAZING for online courses! In class it is so different. She talks slow, is homework/textbook heavy and has tried to discuss religion on several occasions. Disorganized, schedules too many presentations and field trips. Would not recommend for on campus courses.",0
Professor Allen is super enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he teaches! He works hard to engage with all of his students and the lectures are always well-structured and never dull. A great class to take!,1
Dr. Konen is a real inspiration to environmental science nerds like me. He teaches you so much information simply through his power points. All of the notes you need are online (blackboard or whatever system NIU uses in the future) and so are the study guides. PLEASE do the study guides- they are exactly what the exams are about. Minimal homework.,1
"Suhaan is honestly one of the best professors out there. Not only does he care but he is a fair grader and teacher. As long as you participate in his class and cooperate with him you'll have a great time, learn something and still get an A. Highly would recommend taking any class with him!",1
I took discrete math online. Take notes and do homework because its the same on the test. I recommend him!,1
"Prof Hart wants you to learn but is very unorganized, if you can stand hearing the word ""um"" 10000 times then its the class for you, dont even bother printing the handouts because you cannot follow them! The readings are pointless n mean nothing. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
"He seems to be a good guy and he is passionate about the topic but he jumps around so much in lectures and gets so off-topic that it's basically impossible to take good notes. His tests are really hard and encompass things he didn't really go over in class, so you have to read the textbook.",0
"Goes over material too fast, doesn't ever give out handouts to learn from. All he does is just talk and do quick problems on the board..",0
She was all over the place in her lectures.  I could not understand or follow what we were talking about.  Assignments were hard and often vague.  I ended up dropping the class.,1
"Sinha is not a well-organized professor and does not express care for her students. Not helpful during office hours at all and makes you feel dumb when asking questions:( study guides do not match test at all so don't base studying off of it. Work with TAs to learn the plant material. Try to avoid taking her, wasted studying time on class.",0
"Awful PHD instructor. This class is all about organization and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. Funny how that works, right? Her assignments make absolutely no sense and when you ask for clarification she sighs and rolls her eyes. On top of that, she deducts points for going above and beyond and takes months to grade assignments.",0
Dr. Wolff is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. Her style is engaging and you'll remember the material because she also has clear outlines for every class and study guides for each exam.,1
Poor online presence probably because there are so many students it takes a while to answer back questions (so be prepared) and the instructions he gives to revise a paper are vague and he will fail the paper if you don't understand. I got the impression that he would fail someone he disagrees with.  Avoid if you're shy about your work being public,0
"She is really sweet and teaches very well. has a load voice where you can hear her across the room even outside the class room. She wants you to learn and she will help you. you do have to read for PBL, if not you can not do quizzes. test are confusing but you have group projects and labs that help. if you take her you will enjoy it but its alot of",1
"Not terrible but not good either. The one good thing is that he curves your final grade at the end of the semester. His exams are brutal, but they're mostly based on the homework, not the slides. Very nice person, but too laid back... except for his exams. Lectures are pointless. He just reads from the slides.",0
Misses Persaud's Spanish class was too accelerated for me :( Don't take the class if Spanish isn't your first language.,0
"Seems like an easy class at first, however the amount of assigned reading is insane. Little gets done in class, and all the pressure is put on you to learn the material as well as do the outside readings on your own. Lectures connect little if at all to textbook/reading material and is super vague, which leaves you scrambling for the final.",0
"There are weekly online quizzes, which are generally pretty easy and follow the book. However, his lectures do not follow the book at all/boring. The midterm and final are essay questions where you are expected to write 2 pages per question. There are 3 major papers throughout the class based upon supplemental books and a topic of your choice.",0
"Sara is seriously one of the best professors I've had at Iowa.  She clearly loves her job and social work, which helps students learn easier.  The class was really easy, but definitely enjoyable.  Can't wait to take more of her classes",1
"She is a dismal teacher- a combination of incompetence and apathy.  Never returned emails, changed requirements constantly with no warning, let the class know the criteria for grading projects AFTER submission.  I could go on and on.  BTW, she doesn't know her subject - I finally quit trying to dialogue as she just spouted her opinion as fact.",0
I enjoyed Professor Rico's class. Even though it was an 8 week blended class he made the material as simple as possible and worked lots of practice problems with the class. There wasn't too much homework and he always did his best to answer every question. You could tell he cares a lot about his students and wants them to do well.,1
"This woman loves thermo so much, she'll make sure you love it too! She is an AWESOME prof and definitely the best I've ever had. Really helpful in class and out, has clear notes, explains topics thoroughly and has reasonable exams. If you have the choice, take thermo with her! You won't regret it",1
Incredibly knowledgeable about most topics great prof. Definetly makes you work for marks though. Good at keeping lectures interesting!,1
fantastic lecturer,1
Two Exams. Super lazy professor. Doesn't seem to know how to use tech or online systems correctly. Tried to conduct the class via E-mail. Only good thing is that the class is based on two papers. But don't expect to learn anything through his lectures. It's a self teach type circumstance. Oh and he looks like Bob Ross. No joke.,0
"Very hard to understand, doesn't teach well at all.",0
"He's knowledgeable, but doesn't communicate what he wants in the class effectively. I felt as if I was spending more time trying to figure out what he expected rather than actually learning the material. Only employs lectures, homework, and two exams. If you mess up one aspect, it'll be hard to catch up",0
"I showed up to class like 4 classes all semester. Easiest A ever. All exams were take home exams and all homework was online. Got full participation points for the whole semester, so he never took role.",0
"Took this professor for Objects as History class, and had some of the most amazing lectures. She's really inspirational and teaches in a really engaging way. I definitely recommend her.",1
Do not take any class with him. Very boring class and need more time to practice and you should be good at MATH.,0
"Shartin is a really nice guy and always willing to help. Class is very difficult and hard to wrap your head around. However, if you go to at least 1 extra help session and he gets to know you, you will at least get a C. Was failing class and went to extra help for the final and ended up with a C+",1
She is ok. She doesnt respond to emails in a timely manner. Live chats are annoying but hw otherwise is easy. Overall class was decent.,1
"1500 words comparative paper, 2500 words research paper and final exam make it like 400+ level history class.",0
"CoVID-19 has been a challenge for us all, especially for college students. Our worlds have been completely turned upside down. My Professor is available to us, and is very understanding, when it comes to us completing our assignments. That means a great deal to me! Thank you.",1
Narcissist,0
"I am a transfer student and a current Junior. Flannery is the best teacher I have had at Missouri State, and it isn't close. He is really awesome at making sure the whole class understands a rather complicated subject, and if people don't understand, he will take the necessary time to ensure they do. I would recommend Flannery to every student.",1
"She started on topic A then jumped into B without satisfying questions or concerns of students.  Quite moody at times, rolled eyes when asked questions.  She was all over the place, scatterbrained.  Very confusing.  Did not give partial credit for answers on exam which were close but not on point. You either wrote what she wanted or you are wrong.",0
I'm a 3.9 GPA student and I've learned NOTHING from this teacher.. The only way I'm passing the class is because I bought the answer guide to the homework book and I've been teaching myself. He confuses me more than anything else.. Always correcting his own mistakes in class.. Horrible at explaining.. AVOID,0
Paoline is a great teacher! I loved his class. It goes by fast and he is very intelligent and helpful. Also a smartass which I like. He is very easy on the eyes also. You will learn a TON of info but make sure you show up on time!,1
"Prof. Easterly knows a lot - he's an accomplished and knowledgable professor. The issue is, he's a horrible lecturer. He's incredibly slow and uninteresting in his presentation style, showed up late to class each week, sometimes did not respond to emails, and did not engage with his students. His material isn't horribly difficult to learn.",0
He is extrememly easy. I took him for writing 201 and class was a joke. all you did was watch videos and write a couple 500 word essays which you have to. He has to fulfill a  minimum amunt of papers to write. He cares about grammar but he is a good grader.,1
Responds to emails in a timely fashion. very helpfu!,1
"This class is graded evenly between 2 tests and the pop quiz grade. He expects you to put in a lot of extra hours a week into reading the textbook, make sure you own one. I genuinely thought I was going to fail this class or have to change it to credit/no credit, which a lot of other students did in my class. I haven't worked harder in any class.",1
Contradicts himself and then denies it. Very disorganized. Gets defensive when you ask him a question and takes things wayy to personally. His tests are much harder than the material he presents in class.,0
She has no idea what she is talking about sometimes and often relies on outdated information. Tests are quite unique and are fairly simple.  Very condescending with no good reason and students have even shown to better comprehend the textbook material. This Prof was the very reason I switched institutions.,0
"The class wasn't difficult, it was hard to understand what was expected at times. She gives either an A or a 70. The lack of feedback doesn't allow you to improve your work. She doesn't respond to emails. I did learn how to use the writing lab at Pima. That was the only way to get feedback and learn anything.",0
"It is not difficult to get an A, but you must do a lot of work. 500word minimum discussion posts each week with the information usually in the chapter. A midterm and final which are 5 discussion posts in one and a 5-7 page paper. Do the work, you'll get an A, I got a 101 in the class.",1
"Does not care about the students, does not care about the class. Not that it's a difficult class; he rambles for 85 minutes and teaches actual substance for 5! One of the most disheartening and dull classes I've taken. Literally told students to not get an English major. Just awful.",0
"Professor Wallace was an incredible Physics teacher. I owe all success to his explanations in lecture, and his homework assigned are like the tests, which allows you to prepare. If you do the assignments and take good notes, you will do well in this class!",1
She is an amazing professor who is really care for her student and gives a lot of feedback. (Took her in Spring 2017),1
The class is almost 100% lecture based. Most of your grade is based on a few short essays and tests. Professor Goldman has extremely interesting lectures and is willing to go above and beyond to answer student questions. The non-textbooks are necessary for test questions and the essay. Foner is really only needed if you have issues with concepts.,1
One of the better professors in accounting. I learned a lot from this class and passed with a B. Theres online homework and tests where she lets you use a notecard. I would recommend!,1
"Honest review here, Professor Fels is such a Fels. She has no idea how to teach this course because she's a researcher. She brings in guest lecturers that think we're high school students. Our exam was to write 15 pages of complete BS with questions that makes no sense. It Fels good to finish this term cause I can't stand another term with her.",0
She might not be the best instructor but she really cares for her students & very understanding. She is still new & getting used to teaching; there is not much to teach in crit think & philosophy! It's all self-study. Gives good feedback and respectful towards students. A lot better than other teachers for the same courses in SAIT. Super Nice!!,1
I took her Global Women in Leadership class and she is absolutely wonderful! Started off each class with a safe space for us to discuss our days and weeks which was awesome. Her three assigned books are good reads and she is super flexible with people. Would 100% recommend.,1
"Miss Davis is beyond a shadow of a doubt my favorite professor I have ever had. She is caring, intelligent, and works hard with you to make sure that you understand and succeed. If you put effort into her class, you will do well. I can not say enough good about her, truly a fantastic instructor!",1
Hard to get in contact with via email. Failed to pique my interests in the subject. Quizzes where pretty easy as well as the final which was on campus. He put in the final grade after D2L closed the class so I was unable to even see my grade for the final smh. Wouldn't recommend him unless someone had no choice. ,1
I was first scared of all the low reviews I saw of Eric but after having him for College Algebra I think he's a good teacher. He was always willing to help better my understanding and was accessible during office hours. There are a lot of quizzes and he sometimes gets off topic and falls behind so you might need to teach yourself but I did learn.,1
"I would never say I was good at math, like at all but Mr. Eisenberg is a really good teacher. His lectures are easy to follow. He has the class set up so that as long as you pay attention & actually try then you will pass with a good grade. He gives you examples of the exact types of problem that will be on the exam & is always available for help.",1
"I came in with huge interest in the topic and left with a better understanding of the issues and a bigger interest. outlines r super clear, blogs r weekly and not too stressful, papers r alright. Marc is a really cool prof with interesting experiences. he also hosts coffee talks at slow train for students to explore beyond topics covered in class. ",1
He is an absolutely amazing professor. He knows the material well and is passionate about it. It's pretty easy to do quite well in his class if you just do your work and study for the exams. Plus he is SO HOT.,1
Ms. Moore is as hard-working and committed as she expects her students to be. I learned a lot about theories directly related to art education and was better prepared for student teaching because of this course.,1
Diane is extremely nice but I would not recommend her if you're looking for a professor who will help you out. Tests are basically all she relies on for grades and she doesn't give any extra credit out. She talks about her kids a lot so she gets side tracked and then starts rushing through sections.,0
Wouldnt accept google docs because I couldnt get Word to work on my computer,0
Best IT prof i have ever had,1
"He sat on his computer the whole class and when you asked for help, and didnt understand the way he explained it, he just got annoyed. He told me that if I was too stupid to learn it in high school, he couldnt teach it to me now. It was a really upsetting experience.",0
He is an amazing teacher! I suck at bio but he made it interesting and he is pretty funny.,1
"She is very tough, her grading method will hunt down your grade. She says that she is tough, and the test will be tough. You study very well, and you know the material, but the questions in tests are so specific that you don't know what she is talking about. Be ready for a lot of tricky questions. DON'T FOLLOW HER STUDY GUIDE, just study everything",0
"Very nice, fairly laid back, but gives an interesting variety of assignments. A bit of a dork, but in a good way",1
"Took this class in the online synchronous format, but going to lectures was useless. Read straight off the PowerPoints he gave us. I read every textbook chapter and did all his practice questions, but then didn't do great on his tests. Don't recommend taking this course with this professor.",0
"Stay FAR away from this teacher/class unless you are 200% dedicated. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video & discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and ended up having to drop it. May have been easier if this was the ONLY class I was taking that semester.",0
"Her teaching skills is really not all that, but she's really lenient if she sees you work hard in her class. Make sure your lab notebook is extremely informational because that might just save you. Also do the extra credit reading as well even though it's 1%, might seem little but it just might save your grade, trust me it's from experience.",1
"She is really funny, but often crosses the line. She has a hard time staying on topic, but is receptive to student feedback. She also down plays how hard the course is,so when students do poorly, they are shocked. She could use some social grace training. But nice lady overall.",0
"I failed his class, It was super hard and his exams was hard also. will not take again ",0
This the absolute worst professor anyone can have he belittles your opinion and he's always talking about thing that are not related to the work itself.  He is always bringing in his political views constantly. He never explains his papers thoroughly and gives no helpful information. Talks a lot of irrelevant things rather than teach!!!,0
"There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. I took the summer course for this online class. It was really hard to keep up the work. My suggestion is getting help from the tutoring center.",1
"This was my most challenging class by far.  Quizes on most days, make sure you read before you come to class.  His tests are tough.  No Extra Credit opprotunities.  He is helpful if you ask him to help you during office hours.  Challenging class.",1
"If you don't know how to draw, DO NOT TAKE HIM! In drawing 1, he was expecting photo-realistic drawings our 2nd week. He likes to critique viciously without us knowing the proper techniques for how to fix them. I've never seen him draw anything. He told us to drop the class if it wasn't our favorite, he's apparently never heard of student loans.",0
She was a great professor! Her tests were easy as long as you studied her notes and attended the discussion with the Jeopardy game. Go to class and make sure you read! The research paper can be easy if you start early and have a good topic. She gives you plenty of time to start it.,1
"This class seemed a little too difficult for a 101 class, and she definitely had big issues with clarity for me. Helpfulness was sort of hit and miss but she would at least try to help. Would not recommend taking her for your first college English class if you can help it.",0
"class is definately hard!! he tries to help you understand the text & is willing to meet with you-class is interesting though, you just have to pay close attention to the essays & be willing to participate in class and do the work.",1
"Wasn't terrible but wasn't teaching much. Gave us a midterm, we never take notes or use a textbook so, where'd she get those questions from? Who knows. Nice, loves marine biology but isn't ready for a teaching position just yet. Project heavy but they're all about going outside exploring which was cool but not for people who have jobs AKA 98% of us",0
"I loved her class! She is very funny and nice. Overall, the class itself was not terribly hard, but the tests were hard. Luckily, projects helped pad the grade.",1
Dr. Liu is an amazing professor.,1
"This teacher is amazing! she grades super easy, shows videos, does power points, and tells you exactly what will be on exams. she also does tons of examples for the capsim project. i definately want to take another class with her.",1
"I had a great experience with this professor. Especially during the pandemic, she went out of her way to help me achieve my goals. Would take her class again!",1
"Shes a very critical grader and never gives full credit. I added up my points at the end, and she did not give me the grade I earned. Shes big on attendance and will drop your grade if you miss. The class is boring and long, but she does try to make it interesting. You wont get out early. Shes nice, but I wouldt take another of her classes.",1
"This professor is awful. Her lectures vs. her homeworks/worksheets vs. her textbooks are completely off. She teaches you like she expects you to know what is already going on, and she can't be bothered with questions. The only good thing about this class is that it's a ""free class"" meaning you don't have to buy a textbook.",0
Great person. VERY knowledgeable on the subject matter. she gets a lot of negative feedback but a lot of it is just due to the fact that she tends to teach classes that are just a lot to understand anyway. holds office hours often and is very generous when it comes to getting points back on assignments when you go talk to her.,1
A relax class. Groups projects r fun. She is willing to email you back with answers until you understand. Reading assignmentshomework is to help you learn about women in global economy.  Essay paper due at the end of quarter is quite fun to write if you like your topic.  class was quite fun depending on the people. No textbook required.,1
"Kelli was great, lecture is inclusive and encourages students to participate. Slightly easy grader, as long as you do the work according to the standards. She's young so it can be easier to relate with her. However, if no one participates in class, lecture can be a strain and she can get frustrated.",1
"Professor Benton as a person is great, as a teacher that's a different story. She takes a while to respond and her responses are vague. She'll post items with due dates on the calendar, but if you were to check canvas to do them the night before they're due, they'll still be unpublished. If you put the work in and read the book you will be fine.",0
Makes lessons funny and personable,1
"Great professor, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Basically read, show up and participate and don't wait for the last minute to do the group project",1
Worst class ever!!!,0
"Besemer seems cool at first, but she's actually just rude and should not be a professor whatsover. She also showed up about 15 minutes late to every class.",0
"Worst teacher ever. Studying in KPU from 2 years, never dealt with this kind of stupid teacher. Never take any course with this guy. Doesnt know ""C""m of coding just copying code from internet and showing videos. If the teacher is reading, I want to ask how data structure is related to AVENGERS movie budget.",0
"Qualls is very interesting and insightful in class, but grades with a vengence. He is an extremely hard grader at writing. Overall he is a good tracher and a good person, but this class is not for slacking off.",1
"Great class. The professor is super chill and fun.  It was honestly one of the funnest classes I've been in. Sounds weird cause it's reading, but it's true. The in-class lectures are great and we get to work with class members throughout each class. Highly recommend!",1
"Overall, he should not be teaching.  If you like a professor who thinks they know everything and thinks they are higher than you, this is who you should take.",0
I have been taught by Ruchika ma'am in my Bachelor's and believe me she is the best teacher anyone would want.,1
"She is very hard to understand. She uses powerpoint, but I think she just photocopies the pages out of the book because it is exactly the same. She doesn't explain anything and acts like she doesn't understand what you are trying to ask if you have a question. Most of the people in my class were completely lost the entire semester.",0
Medlin might be my favorite professor in the law school. He's an outstanding teacher and a genuinely nice guy.,1
"Professor Koziol was amazing, I was in her class during the pandemic and she was understanding and caring. Would recommend her wish she taught more classes that I could take with her :).",1
"Dr. Newman refuses to lecture for her students.  It is infuriating when she asks for feedback on her teaching and says, ""do not write down to lecture more because I will not do it.""  Every class you read some paper of Cystic Fibrosis from 30 years ago.  That is about the whole class.  You split into groups for most of the class and talk about CF.",0
I wish didn't have to take this class. I felt like I drew the same trees for most of the semester and it bored me to tears. I suck at art & I still wished we did something more challenging. Most of the projects are geared toward 3-d for 1/2 of the semester(??) He's nice but you do not leave feeling you learned anything.,0
"She is a good teacher but the material can be boring at times. It is somewhat difficult too grasp some concepts but she does a good job of explaining things throughly. Do the study guides for the exams because if you know that, the test is the exact same. The homework is graded based on accuracy but it is easy. Do not forget to do online quizzes.",1
"This class was an easy A! She has so much extra credit available that it could boost you a whole letter grade. There were 3 tests total, 1 HW/week, 1 project, and 3 article responses. To be honest, she doesn't seem that knowledgable about enviro sci because I literally didn't learn anything in her class, but if you just want the A, then take this!",1
nice guy. was not easy class.  real tough on grading. no curve or extra point. take him if you are science major or considering transfer,1
Love this guy!,1
Amazing teacher! He is so inspirational with his lectures and makes English really interesting. His assignments really make you think about the world around you in a new way. He is definitely there for his students and really strives to get them to do their best. Amazing! ,1
Michael is a great choice if you're looking to go into animation. He will give you honest feedback and an honest grade of your work; which may seem rough but it help will your improve your drawings/animations for your portfolio. Although his class is a lot of work it's all to prepare you for the work ethic of the program and the field.,1
"I made an A in this class simply because the exams were departmental, and they were much easier than the work we did in class. He is a really nice guy who is willing to help, but he is just not a good teacher. He made things so much harder than they had to be in class, and he confused me more than he helped.",0
"Great professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to be successful, but you have to put in the work as well. The tests were somewhat difficult but if you study the study guide and homework (he gives a short hw assignment a week before you have a test), then you should do well on the tests.",1
"He's a cool guy, I'll give him that much, but he just isn't the best teacher. He gets distracted a lot. He also doesn't explain the criteria for assignments very well or clearly. He didn't seem to be that concerned with helping out his students, you had to hunt him down if you really needed help. Overall not a horrible prof, but not great either.",0
Rude and demeaning. She doesn't care about her students. She goes over your head and never bothers to clear anything up. She may know the material but can't teach it. ,0
Really fun teacher. He breaks everything down for you. He listens to everyone's opinion or interpretation to make sure we understand and will compare to modern ideas.I recommend him to anyone who thinks they won't like philosophy.,1
Great prof. Easily the best prof I've had for online teaching. His resources are actually useable and couldn't ask for more not having access to a microscope. Highly recommend Dr. Gaidies.,1
"Gail will forever be one of my favorite professors. She is kind, brilliant and has a beautiful way of teaching tough material.",1
"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",0
"This was the most challenging online class I've ever taken! Notes- don't have much info Tests- Not easy to understand (75 Qs, 15 Point), most of the time the notes didn't even have the answer Exercises- long and really confusing (3-5 pgs, 1 point) Discussion Qs- 5-6 Qs asked, you answer 2, long and time consuming! 1 point Save yourself #Honest",0
Awful.,0
"Mr. Perez was by far one of the best professors I have had at riddle. No matter the size of the problem I had he always responded to his emails fast with an answer that actually solved my problem. At the end of my online class, we had a group project where I worked alone. Mr. Perez worked with me to help with the lack of team effort.",1
Professor Dewart is a great professor. He has so much knowledge of the subject and has seen so much around the world. He truly cares that you learn.  Any student wanting to learn and not just pass the class should take him. He is inspirational.,1
"This was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken.  Bailey is extremely knowledgable but does not communicate the information well.  Chemistry is hard no matter what, but I got very little help in class.  I had to go to the science lab, and even had to hire a tutor to get a c in the class.  I was thrilled with the c too!",0
"Great teacher. she is a great instrutor. I did not remember much about math, but I am doing great.",1
"I didn't learn much in this class. His demonstrations aren't super helpful because he's difficult to understand and he doesn't tell you why he's doing things. Also, we got NO feedback on our work during the entire semester, and our grades were based entirely on our final projects, which he barely glanced at! Really disappointing. ",0
"Even though he has 40+ years of experience he is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He goes too fast, doesn't care if you get it or not, is demeaning, and DOES NOT know the definition of a teacher.  He is one who thinks just because he gets it everyone should.  I had to practically beg him to explain (teach) me.  I hated going and cried A LOT!",0
"She's a great professor who respects other people's values. When it comes to her class, i strongly suggest that you come to class, i never studied and did fine in her class. Ended up with a B.",1
"Very tough grader.  If you're not an English major, but want to take this course, you should not take it with him. That said, in spite of the B or B- I will take from this class, I would take it again if I could. I love Nelson's lectures and had the best time at his house when he had our class over for refreshments and gave us Japanese Maple seeds.",1
"unclear policies and grading methods, failure to hold attention of class, misdirects TA's to lower grades of students",0
He is the best guy that you can meet. He knows everything about his field and is willing to help at anytime. I do not have his class anymore and we still talk frequently. He is just so dedicated to his students.,1
"This Professor is a devil in human form. She is very rude, with great accent. When you ask questions she laughs as if students don't know anything. She thinks that she knows it all but i am not surprise that she is not married and don't have kids. No one can live with a difficult, rude and heartless person like 'Subadra'.",0
"Old school prof. While I don't mind an old school prof, and everyone teaches differently, this man reeked of pompous arrogance. His class was him ensuring everyone realized his importance. 50% midterm on an Econ elective to a fourth year class, and a rude class-wide email responding to the low average. 8000 word essay. Needs to check ego at door!",0
"Her directions are unclear and almost rude. be ready to spend some serious cash on makeup. $80 for the makeup set then another $25 for the ""Lab fee "" when there is not a lab. Required book cost over $200 because it's out of print. Only uses that book cuz friend wrote it.  If you miss a day she will call you out in front of everyone. Horrible teach",0
"Professor Ortmann is very understanding and sweet. The book is only used for in-class analysis, so make sure to bring it to class. She provides word lists to study that will be on the tests, as well as the essay questions. A very easy and informative class if you attend regularly and participate.",1
"out of 100 students starting off, after the second test there are about 40 people left...he does not teach, he reads off of a power point, the only kids who pass are the ones who are stong in physics from highschool...if you can avoid dr. dick",0
take her Class if ur PASSIONATE about reading a bajillion pages of history.,0
"Professor Olsson is very sweet and cares about students however, shes very bad at responding to emails. She doesnt give much homework but her assignments are difficult, she doesnt respond to questions about the assignment and grades very hard. Her lectures are more or less reading from slides and when she goes off its very complex w/ no explanation",0
Yvette is a great teacher she teaches the class using her own personal experience and is very passionate.,1
"You have to work very hard to just pass this class. It's hard to understand her and she is very particular about your work. Doesn't help you out very much, but she will push you to do your best.",0
great sensei,1
"Ron is an outstanding professor, always willing to help out if you have any questions. Super funny, laid back, all around awesome. Best class ever!",1
"Boring class, does not go over content clearly in class so you basically have to learn everything on your own. Doesn't care about the effort you put into the class.",0
Professor Kim had really long and boring lectures.  He flew through powerpoint slides and didn't really explain concepts well at all.  Never actually had an in-class test until the final so I had no clue what his tests were like until then.  Just was not a good teacher when it came to teaching or testing.  Somehow got a B-.  Would not recommend. ,0
"i realized I did not even need this. but the fact that he is actually pretty cute made it, not a total loss! LOL",1
"I left a review earlier and had to come leave another one because throughout the semester he changed my mind. He's actually very decent, but had a rough semester because of leg injuries he had. He does care about students and their grades, and wants you to leave his class having learned something, which I did. I don't regret taking his class",1
"don't take this professor! on the last day of class, he said we 'can't ask any stupid questions', my friend asks him to repeat a question and says ""class is dismissed, get out"". He assumes we ONLY take his class with no other work for other classes, is the rudest prof, and will call you out in front of the class if you have your phone visible.",0
Amazing Prof. He gives great direction and feedback. I trust his opinion bc he has worked in the industry and knows what clients are really looking for and how to do it. He is really preparing me for my future. Thank you!,1
A very fair and approachable instructor.  She takes her job very seriously as well.  She is also very respectful of students.,1
"Such a hard grader! He gets down to the nitty-gritty of his rubrics, you have to do everything specifically how he says or you won't receive full credit. Discussion boards have to be 3 replies DURING the week, God forbid you post 3 replies/day. Only good thing I can say about him is the material is good, other than that, wouldn't recommend at all!",0
She is very picky with her instructions and expects way too much out of an online course. She makes it very confusing and complicated to submit your work.,0
"This guy is the worst guy you can take for 330, he doesn't care about,  and he thinks u're only taking 3 credits per semester because you have to constantly study for his pop quizzes.  Avoid it at all cost.  When I took this class he gave us the pop quizz in the second of class .... like seriously ?  u have not time to warm up with him ",0
"I do not like sociology, but her class is a must take. Gives extra credit for just showing up to class, reviews every test showing you the answers prior to taking the test. If you et lower than an A in this class then you are trying to fail! ",1
"Is confusing when he speaks. Seems to speak in code. Teaches the language like a science, he really likes to break apart every part of the sentence and ask questions about it. He calls on you to answer his questions even if you dont want to. I would avoid him if you have the choice. Kind of ruined my interest in the french language.",0
"I had to learn everything from Khan Academy. I have no doubt he might be good in-person but online his videos are 10 minutes for what is supposed to be an hour lecture. He only does ONE problem per section, and his mind seems very scattered. I am not LEARNING from him. I feel like I'm being set up for failure for the future in his online course.",0
"in office hours he refused to tell me which multiple choice questions I got wrong (after the exam): how is someone supposed to proactively improve their stratgies and weak areas, if they are not told which questions are wrong. What is the ppoint of picking up an exam that has no marks except for a total on the top. He doesnt even post an answer key",0
"One of my all time favorite teachers - she is very good at getting students to think, rather than just memorize, which is rare in science.",1
Writer as the Reader:  wonderful spirit and energy.  Kept class very entertaining and kept students' interest high.,1
Her lectures are amazingly funny she really cares about you and will talk to you in private if you need help,1
"stupid fool,idiotic in mind not in the field. wants to find a problem in evry1, but cant solve it.",0
"Great teacher. You want to pass? Need to study. Tries her best to help you with all she can. She is flexible. She does not want you to fail. You will learn in this class as well, not an easy class but not a super hard one either.",1
I don't even understand how she is actually employed...,0
"This class shouldn't be as hard as it is made. Exams are confusing and a few questions were incomprehensible on each one. To make it worse, no specifics are given as to what will be on the exam, just how many questions from each chapter will be on it.  If you have the time to do every single reading you can do well, but you won't be able to cruise.",0
I woud take this prof again in a second.,1
"Prof Engleke is great!  She is very helpful especially during clinicals.  She will always call everyone to observe/try a new procedure.  Her lectures could be a bit too fast paced.  Somehow she expects you to know the contents.  But then I took her during 203, so I guess by now she expected a lot from us.  She made nursing very interesting.  A+",1
"He has some good lecture notes, and this is the only good thing about him. If you think you can learn Matlab, latex, or maple with a book by yourself, don't take the class. If you need someone to teach you, find someone else.",0
"She's not the best lecturer but if you take this class with Physics 1 background, you'll be fine. Make sure to do the homework and any book questions. Reading doesn't help, the book is only useful for additional problems. Conceptual stuff will come from lectures, so make sure to attend them all.",1
Mr. P is a great teacher who made english fun and was extremely helpful. He used blackboard for weekly discussions & an online program to assist with writing. You only write 4 or 5 papers which can be rewritten for better grade. Definitely take if you can!,1
"He gets down on your level so you can easily understand things. His test are very hard, but aren't heavily weighted. You can make test correction for half credit and he grades your final grade on a curve. Good teacher, nice guy. I recommend taking Algebra first or some of the math might lose you.",1
"The only way to learn is through the lectures, which is hard to understand sometimes because of her thick accent. She gives examples that make no sense and are not relate able, and just complains about how most of the class sucks at the material and she cant wait to get rid of us. The material is not overly difficult but she is not good at it.",0
Nobody I knew got above 60% on their tests and we all went to every class and studied before each exam.,0
She takes quite a while to grade assignments but is very helpful and quick to respond to emails. There are assignments available for extra credit. She certainly cares about her students passing.,1
"The class I took with her was essentially self-taught. She was only present to post and grade assignments and gave no input of her own regarding the lessons. Gives an unreasonable amount of work, deducts points for petty things, and is generally just absent as a professor. I learned nothing from her; all knowledge came from the assigned textbooks.",0
Exams are so unnecessarily hard. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Great guy, but rambles a lot. The course is centered around writing a research paper at the end of the semester. Throughout the process, he is often unclear on what exactly he expects from students as far as assignments go. Overall, not a bad teacher to have for this GE class.",1
"This course was disorganized which added to the difficultly. Recorded lectures were posted late and assignments+essays took a long time to be graded. This course was so much work, and was not that rewarding. There was 10 group assignments in the semester which was difficult, especially being online. MIDTERM ESSAYS WERE GRADED BY STUDENTS?!",0
It seems like he even don't understand the concepts for this class when he lectured. He always made mistakes. Although his notes was extremely helpful.  I knew what fugacity is from his notes.  The only way I prepared for final exam was to read all his notes.,0
"Took this class online, and I loved this professor! By far, my favorite teacher at GCC. Assignments were easy and clear to underatand. Didnt read the textbook, only used it for the online quizzes. The class consists on 2 DQs and one quiz a week that are due on Sunday, one individual speech, and a group speech which is your final. Easiest A!",1
"AMAZING! One of the smartest people I have EVER MET IN MY LIFE!!! enjoy this class, its awesome",1
He pulls down your course off the D2L before you know your final grade without any notice. I was new to D2. I contacted his boss and the Dean. I scored a couple 80s on the quizzes but mostly 90s and 100s. I scored a 98 on the final exam and I still got a C. I was stunned! He doesn't return emails in a timely manner. I DO NOT reccomend this guy!,0
"Great teacher, laughs a lot, smiles a lot and chats a lot, but in reality this subject doesn't need a teacher. That's why all you have to do is look at the online work. All the tests and stuff are open book, plus you can look up the answers anyways. Pointless dumb class, good guy.",1
"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass. The exams are way more involved (and graded harder) than you'd think, given how easy the day-to-day work is, so study hard for the midterm and final. Overall, don't love, but it's still a pretty easy class.",0
"WORST PROF I'VE HAD YET!!! 0/10, would not recommend. Summarizes textbook & reads off slides in lecture, awful midterms (unnecessarily complicated), and terrible teaching skills! seems more interested in getting students to memorize textbook examples than actually understanding concepts. Do not take a class with this prof! ",0
easy a,1
"For a communication teacher she doesnt communicate very well. I took this class online and it was very difficult. The tests are so vague and you are expected to read 50+ pages for a 10 question quiz weekly, and everyone I asked agrees that the questions are based on material they didnt find in the text. She expects way too much. A lot of work.",0
Dustin is the BEST professor anyone will ever have at WSU. He understands the material and knows how to teach it. If you are having a difficult time he is more than willing to work with you. Gives helpful tips for exams and goes through many example problems to help you prepare. Having trouble in other engineering courses? Hes the one to talk to!,1
"She is an amazing instructor, doing amazing things. She heads the Chemical Dependency Program at ELAC, which is a great program that allows for a Substance Abuse Counselor certification, if passed. Her psychology/addiction lectures are lively and interactive. She covers a lot of the material, though having a book is good. Take her class!",1
"Karen is GREAT. I ended up doing the hybrid class with her and was not disappointed. She always brought a level of energy with her to class that was contagious. She is a tough grader but is very transparent about her expectations from day 1. Online courses can be harder because of self study, but she helps as much as she possibly can. 100%Recommend",1
He is an nice man but not a very talented in the teaching department.I learned very quickly just to read out of the book and to show up for Friday quizzes.that's right he does a quiz every Friday and they don't help on the test. All in all you are stuck taking him for organic because oc only offers him.,0
"Laura is an awful teacher.  She got the clavicle bone and phalanges confused on a skeletal model.  Thank god I only had her as a lab instructor.   Her assignments were incredibly easy, but I couldn't stand her lectures.  She has no idea what she's talking about ever.  And if you ask her a question, good luck getting a logical answer.  Horrible.",0
dull,0
"This was my second time taking Mitchell, as I had him for CHM1025. He's a hilarious professor, making lectures fun. He does an okay job of explaining topics, but they can be pretty convincing, as he uses the same slides from previous classes. His tests don't always match the lecture, but he does release topic lists for the exams.",1
"She's very rude, don't bother asking her anything. When you ask questions during lecture, she will make you feel stupid for it. She is very biased in her grading of labs. Address her as Dr. Aikins, she like that. That's all the bad stuff, if you study her study guides you will pass.",0
Worst professor at appalachian state. Cannot understand his lectures because he just rambles on about nonsense. He does not answer questions you ask but instead makes fun of you for not understanding and then continues to speak nonsense. If you have the option to never take this professor do not do it!,0
"Very helpful and encouraging. I've tried to pass this class soo many times, this was the first time i succeeded, and I attribute that to her genuine encouragement.  She was VERY easy to Email and get a hold of outside of class for looking over your papers.  It was a fantastic class and she encouraged a real bond between students. We had fun.",1
She deffenetely knows her stuff. I really don't like the way she speaks. She has a big accent and it annoyed me so much. He is one hardworking professor but she demands a lot. I consider myself as a very good student but for some reason no matter how much I tried I could not do that good in her class. I ended up gettin a B in her class.,1
"Honestly did not teach me anything in class, had to learn everything from the textbook and from the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube. Three tests all with averages well-below 50%. No homework, really nothing other than tests.",0
Terrible professor. Guarantee he will not help you at his office hours. Boring class. A shame to NC State's CHE department,0
"You will read nonstop. He is a kind dude, but if philosophy is not for you don't take his class. All exams are written essays, workbooks that are worth 5 points each there is 3 or 4. He will drop the lowest at the end. Nice guy but um, hate his class. Got an A",0
Makes many mistakes and doesn't take questions. Would not recommend if not STRONGLY proficient already in math 122. Be prepared to be given hours of homework each night.,0
Group projects account for 40% of the total class grade. The first project takes about 2 weeks to finish and is insanely long.  This class isn't hard but has a ton of busy work.  Teacher gives very little feedback and the syllabus is confusing when describing assignments.  Teacher doesn't add to discussion posts at all.,0
I've learned alot from him with his real world experience. Never a dull moment in his class. Only wish I could of had a chance to work with him.,1
He does not appreciate questions and is very condescending. He promises extra credit but he does not actually put it in the grade book. He does not like enthusiasm for the material so its best to just show up and lay low.,0
You cant miss classes or speeches. Shes grades kinda harsh. Shes really nice though.,1
"Spends a majority of the class ranting on about his own personal opinions and beliefs, has ZERO written explanations on how to do well in his class, will grade poorly for doing anything outside of what he demands but wont tell you all his demands, insulted every member of class no matter skill with no instruction on how to do better. Condescending.",0
"She reads from PPT and cannot answer simple questions unless she given time to flip through the text. And if she doesn't know the answer, which is often, she will ask the students what they think of the question and move on.",0
"The class was great. There were many quizzes but they were not difficult, plus there was no final. Two papers about 5-8 pages. Lectures based on power points and the textbook is rarely used. Make sure to do your work and participate and you will pass easily. Stories about his job were funny as well",1
Can an accreditor please sit through this course and give me my money back? At least look at the homework assignments he gave us. He never taught us Verilog but all of the homework assignments were poorly worded (if worded at all) copies of homework from more advanced courses at other universities. Most people failed but still got grades...,0
Quizzes and exams are hard. All of the assignments are all rushed together. Most confusing class I have ever taken at UNA. ,0
"I took Dr. B's class at rose state. He is very funny, but his test are way to hard. He does give you a chance by writing critical essays and things like that.His opinion of you I do think might effect your grade and he is not afraid to call you out.I really like him as a person though, very funny guy.He does make History interesting.",0
Edwards is one of those professors who eventually grows on you (after 5ish labs). He teaches Labs and if you are a competent student you will get along. He can be a bit rude sometimes but that is just his humour and you get used to it eventually. Stay on his good side and you will be fine. The only negative is that you have to write lab reports.,1
"Ning is a horrible teacher. I dont know why he is there. I ended up dropping his class, if you dont understand math very well, do not take him. Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself.",0
Take CHE 118A with Schore if you can! He has a really generous curve. I did ok on the midterms and even worse on the final but I managed to get an A-.,1
"Freshmans, be aware. Her class is more designed for grad students. Her lecture are very particular and can be so so so hard to follow. I had her for my freshman Inquiry and I did not learn anything from this class. We talked about so much subject, none of them had to do with the class subject. EXTREMLY nice woman though. Tries her best to help.",1
"She's a nice professor, her class was just very dry and a lot of busy work.",0
"No clue what was ever going to be on the quizzes and our class was often blind sided. Harshest grader I've ever encountered in a math course. Took points off for not labeling ""x"" and ""y"" on the x, y axis. She blows through notes and jumps around so good luck following along. You will need to be a very fast writer. Good luck, have fun and godspeed.",0
"Sexy, and fit",1
I am currently taking a class with this professor and I am finding him hard to understand. Beware he does everything on powerpoint and rarely uses the board. I have found it hard to learn math being done on a powerpoint. He is also extremely fast paced. We had a test last Monday and We have one again this Thursday.,0
"Really good class, Dr. Swint is known around the country as an author and political expert, so it's cool to have him in the classroom. Class is one day a week. Good discussions, not much reading.",1
"The class overall was good. It was entirely online. Every week there was a discussion board and something else due. The work isn't necessarily hard, you just have to do it. Some of the questions on the quizzes we kind of ridiculous; they just had very little to do with the information in the class. Textbook was used.",1
"I was so looking forward to this class, in the beginning. I enjoy writing, after all. Unfortunately, this teacher is boring, rude, and is unwilling to help her students. Do not take this class, it is unnecessarily difficult.",0
Mike is an awesome professor! Take his classes!,1
amazing man! totally recommend!!,1
Dr. Maillert couldn't have been less interested in teaching this class. She always seems bored and never wants to help students. I could have read the textbook upside and it would have helped more. The problems are dumb and all refer to a previous problem and then that problem refers to another problem so each question takes 3 other problems.,0
"he doesnt care about students.  he thinks the world revolves around him.  he is funny, but you will barely remember anything he ""teaches"" 5 mins after class. He is not ment to be a teacher.  just go to class and fill in some bubbles on the scantron and you got a B",0
"pat is a pretty average cs prof. its as if hes a substitute teacher for his own class. TAs never know whats going on, never replies to emails, slow marker, doesnt answer questions clearly if at all, tests have mistakes in them. posts lectures to youtube and videos are equally useless as sitting in lecture, so just dont go to class. lmfao",0
"Shes very particular in what she wants and if not followed you will fail the course. She tries to help you, but isnt the best at explanations to resolve the issue.",0
"She's straighforward and smart.  Um, I don't think ""estrogenical"" is a word.",1
"This professor is honestly so mean. He grades super harsh. i dont know how he has so many good reviews on here. essays are 65% of your grade. he doesnt care how hard you worked on the essay if it isnt where he wants it to be, he will give u bad grade. wants everything written his way. not opened to different writing. considers everything as bad.",0
"Khajavipour really cares about his students and their grades. However, if you're taking other classes, I do not recommend taking his class b/c you really have to be on top of the homework and the reading. He goes off topic and goes over class time sometimes & will almost never let you out early. He will work around your schedule for office hours.",0
"I really don't have anything really good to say about this professor, and the things I want to say wouldn't be allowed on here.",0
"Took her MATLAB course. It had a good balance of quizzes and homework, with the final project being the most daunting part of the whole class (but turned out not being as scary as I thought). Reading the textbook helps when you get confused. She's very willing to help and explains things well, and is available outside of class. Overall, good!",1
"If you are a Food and Nutrition major, the semester you take NHM 362 is going to be your hardest semester of your college career. Not because the material is hard, the professors pile on the work. It's busy work and group projects. You will be taking around 5-6 classes. Dr. Park's tests are super hard and tricky. She is a tough grader.",0
Graded on a 1000 pt. scale with 2 major assignments; one worth 300 and the other worth 500. You have two chances at each to improve your grade if you did poorly on the first. He did not get my 500 pt. assn. graded until the qtr was completed. Did not get a chance to reattempt 500 pt assn.,0
Just memorize random facts from his book and you will do fine on the exams - if you have sharp memorization skills. There's actually little to no actual learning about NUTRITION in this class. It's basically Biochemistry 2.0. I am disappointed because the instructor failed at articulating the material in lectures. Just memorize his book.,0
Save yourself the time and take anyone else.,0
"The tests for his class were somewhat confusing. The multiple choice questions were sometimes misleading and when a question was asked he was not helpful. Also, in reviewing for tests, he suddenly brought up things not previously discussed.  At times he can be hard to understand. He runs though everything quickly. I would not recommend him.",0
"Solid professor, he cares about his teaching and is passionate about biology. You might find his lectures funny, or you might find them dry, regardless he's good at synthesizing large amount of material into a more reasonable slide show sets. Goes at a good pace and encourages participation and getting to know his students, would gladly take again!",1
"Reyes teaches more of immersion style, and participation matters. If you do the work and show up for class, and he knows you're trying, he can be generous with grades. Learning another language is hard and he knows it. Very responsive to emails and willing to meet before class. Genuinely cares about students and checks in with everyone often.",1
"Your grade for the whole semester will be determined solely by your grades on the four exams. There is little room for error. Also, you will most likely get frustrated in class if you do not agree with Mr. Wingender's political views, because he spends most of the time trying to push his views on you.",0
"He would rant about random things that had nothing to do with class. He has his ""lunch bunch"" that is very creepy and unprofessional. Not a good professor but I did learn a lot from the class just from the readings. Never from his lectures.",0
"Believe all previous reviews. She posted a take-home test (a day late) with only 77 of 100 questions and didn't send an email after she updated. Several students showed up to class with only 77 questions answered. She randomly gives good papers Fs, but usually gives full credit. Final exam tip: most questions from chapter summaries in book.",0
"The lectures were SO boring, and class participation was essential - unfortunately, Prof. Cividanes has no idea how to properly foster participation, instead asking questions that were rhetorical or so random that we were at a loss. Expect a lot of work on Latin America (where he's from) He didn't even MENTION foreign aid until week 6.",0
"He is a very nice guy, but his class is nothing like I expected. He gives quizzes over the reading, which is usually 30 pages to read, every week. He lectures the entire class time but his notes are not beneficial to his quizzes. He gives a take home midterm and final, as well as two book reviews, but his grading is very inconsistent.",0
"Dr. Field is the best instructor that you will find at UNL. He is laser focused on developing a culture within individual and groups of studnets that he works with. Take as many classes as possible with him. If you have the drive to work hard, desire to succeed, and want to lead then you will really enjoy your time in any of Dr. Field's classes.",1
"The most boring teacher EVERRRR.  He's a really nice guy, but everything he says is full of crap. He really does make up a lot of the info in class, and sticks to what he says claiming the textbook is wrong. Lectures are EXTREMELY boring, consisting of him writing on the board and not addressing the class whatsoever.",0
"Dave is quite passionate about the topic of food science, he just isn't the most effective teacher. His lectures are very long and dry- I would have just learned from the slideshows myself, but there aren't makeups for the pop quizzes without pre-excused absences. The labs were easy and fine, and those instructors were more helpful.",0
I really enjoyed SPAN 225 with Luna. She had us to presentations a lot (great way to practice speaking) and always let us pick our topic. She also connected the class to the real world.,1
"My favorite teacher so far at APSU. Tests can be tough, but overall....she is great. Very understanding and if you don't get something, she doesn't look at you like you are dumb!!",1
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
"literally the most boring lecture i have been to in my life. no need to take notes, all of them are already on quizlet so just look through those before tests and quizzes. the lab is also insanely boring, the TAs all have no idea what they are doing and its a mess. i would never take this class again, but its an easy grade.",0
"He is one of the sweetest professors here on campus. He motivates his students to become confident with themselves. He brings out the best in people. A lot of work but he is very helpful.Loved his class, good therapy.",1
"a complete mean, arrogant man. Had for visual fund. He recently told the class that we deserved to die if we did not vote (in which it is against some of the classmates religion) and also that 85 percent of the class is waisting their time in school and will be working in retail in their future. Forgive me if i am wrong, but teachers are to help mo",0
I had Professor Johnson for my first Web Development class. It was easily my favorite class in the program. Really great videos and super helpful. Felt like I learned a lot!,1
"While she's the nicest woman, her level of being disorganized ruined my interest in Children Literature. She's extremely unclear in her expectations on papers, and returns papers late without failure. It got to the point where we couldn't improve our writing in her class. You can take her classes, but be prepared for a very frustrating semester.",0
"Terrible prof, very anal retentive about minor issues. Goes through content too fast then wastes time talking about her son. She missed a class due to personal reasons and rescheduled the class on a Friday during a time where others may have had classes. And then she refused to post the notes of that class online. Take with someone else if you can",0
"I loved her class! Her first classes were a bit boring, but she adjusted throughout the semester. The first exam was hard, but the final was much more easy (though a little long!). Considering it was her time teaching, I can only imagine how she is going to improve over time. Would take another class with Melanie any time!",1
"She's by far the best instructor I've ever had. She gives a very clear precise outline for ur notes, provides xtra credit assignments & is constantly concerned with ur engagement & understanding. She won't GIVE u a grade, but she'll give u everything u possibly need to earn it. Textbook required. Fun Labs. Keep up& pay attention you'll do just fine",1
The class was extremely difficult. Extra credit was given sometimes in class randomly. There were a couple group projects with your lab benches. I studied so much for her tests and read the textbook but still got around 60-70s on her test. There's a lot of grades though so it doesn't hurt your average extremely bad. You need to put in work.,0
LOVED cathy! She explained everything thoroughly and if you didn't understand it she would put it into a different perspective. She had mini quizzes each week and i would highly suggest taking advantage of open lab!,1
"Have problems? Talk to him. Basically spelled out how he wanted his essays to look like, and even when I didnt have a whole lot of time to give to an essay I did what he said and got a B. ",1
"He is a very smart person and knows his stuff but can be a little hard to follow at times. He needs to ""dumb it down"". He has lecture slides that are exactly what he goes over in class so only have to go when there's a clicker quiz. It's difficult material but the old exams are given to you so study those for exams. They are extremely similar.",1
"He gave hard tests. However, my biggest complaint is that he went on tangents instead of teaching o-chem. To make matters worse, he tested on the tangents. One test question asked about the 2010 nobel prize. Also, the quizzes took time away from practicing the problems in the book; the problems in the book provided more benefit than the quizzes.",0
She was very nice but did not explain the material that well. At least one person in our class would end up crying out of frustration. I would not take her again.,0
"Horrible instructor for the summer class. Went too fast, rarely explained the processes behind answering questions but rather just wrote the answer down and moved on. She seems to think she's being fun and friendly but in fact is the complete opposite. Maybe she is better during the term, but I was very disappointed at her standards of teaching.",0
Best professor at Kline! Makes coming to evidence (even in the summer) enjoyable.,1
"I really enjoyed his CS 150 class, which he created and wrote the textbook for.  If anyone is remotely interested in computer science, I would recommend this class - there isn't too much programming because the focus is on computer science as a whole.  Exams and assignments can be challenging, but are open-book.",1
Absolutely wonderful teacher.  Just skim over the readings before class and have some things to say and you'll be golden. She's a techer that actually makes you think about life and have interesting conversations rather than just memorizing facts. It's conversation based and is definitely an easy A gen-ed if you're okay with talking. Easy grader.,1
Farzin Irani is a great professor. We did our quizzes and case studies online on mindtap. The quizzes are based directly from the book so you cant go wrong. You will get an A if you put the time into the class. She knows a lot about psychology. ,1
SHE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!! She literally does not know how to grade papers because she thinks that putting awk or ?? Is grading and explaining what was wrong. She is constantly repeating herself to her students because she does not know how to explain it the first time. Being in that class is so annoying!,0
She can be very grumpy.,0
"3 quizzes over terrible movies. 3 essays, final essay is 3000 words (tons of reading involved with these). 1 group presentation, which was stupid. 4 Absences and he will fail you. Very difficult to stay awake in class. If it's not required, don't take it. It's not a blow off and you have to show up, plus there were no good movies on the curriculum.",0
Just terrible. Does not teach well nor have respect for students.,0
"Definitely has a thick accent and is hard to understand sometimes. But she's super caring. Ms. Van Der Poel would graciously stay after class and even after her scheduled office hours to support students and go through in-class problems. Very caring professor. Note: her tests are very hard and she does not curve. Practice, practice, practice!",1
this class is hard to sit through,0
This class is easy. you barely have to try on your assignments and you'll get an A. Def recommend her!,1
"I've never written a review before but for him I needed to warn others. I won't lie if you're really good at programming then his class shouldn't be that difficult. Regardless, he grades late, and is very disorganized. Has labs for homework and gives 3-4 tests that don't always relate to the material. Also he's culturally ignorant and picks on kids",0
"Lutfi's lectures are unorganized, boring, and he tends to ramble on. Went to his office hours and he was kind of rude, but in lecture he seems nice. Didn't do well on the tests personally, but the tests were mainly just definitions, so if you study for them, you should do fine. Don't buy the book, totally unnecessary. ",0
"I feel bad because this Professor is a very kind man, but if you are someone like me who absolutely sucks at math and needs time to learn material, this class will be a nightmare. It is very fast paced and tons of content needs to be learned in a very short time. The professor wasn't willing to help me outside of class either, so I dropped.",0
Professor Ostlund provided timely and valuable feedback. She would not accept late assignments after 1 week. She followed the rubrics. In all she is an excellent instructor and I would take another course from her.,1
"This is my second time taking a class taught by him. He lectures, draws what he is lecturing, and his lectures and drawing coincide pretty closely to the textbook. He's always willing to help during his office hours. The term project was super hard but it was really cool to actually use what we learned. He has been my favorite professor so far.",1
"I took an ELI course with Professor Parker and she was extremely helpful. It's not an ""easy"" A, but what part of college should be? It's math and it requires some learning. She is responsive and explains things so students understand. I'd take her again in a heart beat.",1
"I took his online Evolution of Hip Hop class. He doesn't show you just how much is due each week, he releases the week's work all on one day exactly 7 days before they're due. One week he assigned 3 quizzes, an hour and a half long documentary with 3 required posts afterwards, and an 8 page research paper all due on the same day. This class is hard",0
"""If you don't read EACH chapter THREE times before the test, you won't get above an 80."" He's not lying, his tests are extremely hard and you learn 20 chapters in 3 short months. Your saving grace will be the MindTap homeworks and the business plan. Really passionate marketing guy, really hard professor.",0
"You will not learn anything from Mingyang's class. She is very confusing, and her exams are impossible. She will help you with the hw if you go to her office hours, only plus.",0
"LOVED her!! She is the sweetest lady. I only took her for BIO lab 118 (for bio 112) but I loved every minute of it. I always found BIO to be so hard, but she made it fun and understandable. I was so sad to see that she wasn't teaching lab for 113! Take her if you can, she is super helpful and an overall good teacher.",1
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
"This class is relatively easy, but it is frustrating and annoying. The program used and format of the class is completely inefficient and not at all user-friendly.  Rankin is not helpful and cannot even do the activities herself many times. Her teaching is immature and ineffective. I would suggest finding a better professor for this class.",0
"The level of difficulty should be 1 but this professor has impossible expectations. I received a 100 on every module, but debatable discussions etc. that are graded by her were given a 70. I followed the rubric step by step to ensure points were not deducted. Either she didn't agree/like my viewpoint or she just didn't actually read it.",0
"I signed up for a different professor and for some reason they gave me him I sat there for a day and was already unimpressed he's very rude doesn't listen to what you have to say, puts you on the spot first hand speaking Spanish if your not good at Spanish don't take him.",0
Ms. Feagin knows a lot about American history but I feel that she tries to cram too many activities into one semester.,0
Nice,1
"Dr. Heth is so great. Beyond just being a genuinely nice man, I learned a lot in his class and enjoyed it. The study guides are great and the tests aren't too bad.",1
"It's clear that KMack is very knowledgable about ECON, but his ability to transfer that knowledge to students is nonexistant. Syllabus is outdated, and tbh useless bc he doesnt follow it. No one understood how much each exam was worth. No explanation was ever given. No grades were distributed. Went into the final not knowing where I stood.",0
"He class was interesting and I had a lot of fun. He is definitely one of the best instructors I had. His class was always well organized, which I really like. He cared about student's performance in class and always gave feedbacks to our assignments. Be sure to read the material in advance, it will be easier to participate in class discussions.",1
He attempted to teach us more material from Calculus instead of applied math. I went multiple times to ask for help and all his response was to look at the homework. The tests were nothing like the homework he assigned and the tests are the only grades he gives. He is by far the worst professor I have had and I would not recommend him to anyone. ,0
"The class was online, you had to respond to a discussion once a week, and had 3 days to complete a 8 page papers. Take her if you don't mind all of your weekends disappearing.",0
She can be a bit disorganized as far as class assignments ... she frequently does not give out a schedule for the semester.,1
"Funny dude, but thats where the list of positives end as far as his ability as a teacher.  Showing up to class was about as useful as watching bill nye the science guy re-runs. Useless teacher so enjoy learning everything yourself.  Hard tests but he does curve. ",0
This professor is the worst. Does not care if you understand the material. Reads to himself instead of teaching. Often times made so many mistakes. Tough grader to the max. Overall does not take the time to teach and expect the student to pass. I took his summer Chem 131 and it destroyed my GPS. DO NOT TAKE his class. You've been warn.,0
The best professor at ACC.  Has an amazing ability to explain complicated stuff in a way that makes it fun to learn.,1
"She is super hesitant to give As on anything. Even with little 10 point assignments; you do everything she tells you to do and you still won't get full credit. Must read the book from cover to cover to do good on tests. Also, lectures are a waste of time. Avoid taking!! ",0
"Very bad. The class is supposed to be aboud culture, but she ends up teaching mostly history. Is unclear, lectures have little to do with exam material. Without discussion sections, the exams would be utterly impossible. Accent sometimes hard to understand (she's Polish) and rambles in lectures on nonrelated material.",0
He is my favorite prof at CSUSM so far! He is so smart and is really passionate about what he teaches! His lectures are almost fun to listen to because he makes them so interesting and usually adds funny memes and videos. He is very clear about his expectations. There are only 2 tests and 1 five page paper. He gives very detailed study guides!,1
Jenn is a real gem! Had her for diff eq and I hate math usually. Her study guides have everything you need for her exams and the homework helps. She gives extra credit on exams which is great. Always happy to help and office hours are always open pretty much. Just make sure you study her guides and ask her if you're stuck on anything.,1
"I disagree with the post below. Prof Weiner is a little tougher than you can perceive initially. As the semester goes, the readings become harder. However, he's a great lecturer and professor. I am definitely taking him again. He also has a very funny sense of humor.",1
"The top ISOM professor at Mason. Took him for MIS310 and his lectures are organized and clear. He is responsive by email. Homework, quizzes and exams are challenging, but As long as you attend the class and read the slides, you will get a good grade. Lectures are interesting. There's a quiz before every class to be well prepared for the lecture. In",1
This teacher is a very funny teacher. Shows up to class late every day due to traffic problems but is still worth it. There are a lot of presentations and papers but they are pretty straightforward and are graded pretty easily. Good teacher.,1
"class is straight forward and direct.  he gives you everything you need to do well on the exams, reading isn't too crazy, and there are no surprises.  come to class and it's a breeze",1
"Avoid this class if its not mandatory. Assigned useless papers, took an easy class and made it as hard as possible. Would never recommend :/",0
Oh my God where should I start. Stay away Professor Thompson is so very terrible. If you like sitting through long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on then this is your class. His Tests are made up as riddles and have nothing to do with the material gone over in class. Stay away very far away.,0
"Loves what he does and is happy to answer all of your questions. Has a workbook, which you work each day by answering question and answers, just like in English.",1
"Not terribly difficult, though her final exam was somewhat overdone. Her grading is in fact subjective, and her lectures are both boring and do a terrible job of actually communicating the information. Having her for 101 made 102 a real pain because we learned so little compared to the other 101 classes. Avoid her at all costs.",0
"She is the best yoga instructor I have ever had!!  This is an excellent class to take, and you can get a letter grade!!",1
Do not take this teacher unless u want time to do literally nothing else. This class is required otherwise no one would be here. She give tons of homework and talks OVER the three hour class schedule. Its brutal. Its history not law. She gives homework like this is our major. Its crazy and avoid her at all costs,0
"Allen is a cool guy, lectures really boring though he just talks the whole time hoping somebody will ask a question. Gives a few exams that are blue book style but pretty clear and fair. Assigns four books but I doubt anybody reads them he explains them in class. Decent class for a GenEd easy A.",1
"The worst online instructor I've had. Expect lots of point deductions with no explanation. He contributed nothing to the class. In fact, he in no way enhanced my learning, he just hindered it. Very disappointing.",0
I had Prof. Dattolo and not only did I learn so much in his class he showed his students that he really cares about our learning. He was always there for extra help and he would always be so clear in his lectures. I really looked forward to going to his class . He has made a lasting impression on me. All professors should be like Prof. Dattoolo.,1
Ana is my favorite prof at Chapman!! She assigns the necessary homework and really cares about her students. She is so sweet and has a happy disposition every day. I learned quite a bit from her class. Make sure to take her class because she is an absolute gem. It's a great class to take over interterm.,1
"I took BIO101 and it was quite possibly one of the worst classes I have ever taken. It is extremely exam heavy and does not offer open note. No lectures, book is completely online, and it is a weighted course. Where the exams are 45% of your grade. Absolutely ridiculous. I would have dropped the class if it was not required to graduate.",0
"Dr. Mueller uses the POGIL method which definitely has its pros and cons. Overall, I would say it works. People complain about wanting just lectures but then just space out don't learn anything from them. I definitely feel like I have retained more info from using POGIL. Dr. Mueller is also a great guy. Will always help you when needed and really c",1
"Teacher very unclear, worst online class I've taken along with the professor. Like taking a class with a robot in charge. You get ONE chance for everything in the class unlike other teachers. The homework, discussions, quizzes, final, projects. Provides absolutely NO feedback on why she gave the grade.",0
"She's a genuinely a good person. If you go in after class to ask for help you can tell she really wants to help you . However, this means nothing since she is not a native speaker; you literally cannot understand her. She is also unforgivably strict on assignments, and will not accept anything from you if you are even five minutes late to class",0
"I had no idea about astronomy before this class. I have come to find that my perspective on the universe and reality was incredibly flawed. This class was great and you will learn a bunch of cool stuff from a guy who really knows his sh**, he works for NASA for God sakes! He wears the coolest(nerdiest) shirts abd hes very approachable. Take it!",1
"I found that Professor Smith was very disorganized. It felt like he didn't have a solid plan for the semester. He's not the best at lecturing, but if you go to him and talk one on one, the feedback and help you'll get is very good. Definitely not a professor I would take again, but he's a very nice guy.",0
"I love Jane! I wish she could be my teacher for everything! I never got above a C in stats before...she explained all the concepts so well that I really understood.  I know she's not teaching this class again for a while, so I won't give tips for doing well, but consider yourself lucky to enroll in one of her classes. Ask her anything.",1
I read on here thinking this class would be an easy A and somewhat enjoyable . No book is a plus  because it saves money but.. the handouts we have to print out are Boring! She is an older lady and goes off topic majority of the time. This is one of those classes you are basically teaching yourself.  She has a sweet personality but is very boring.,0
My first semester with her was an awesome one. I wish I could have her for the remaining 3 semesters. She gives you all you need to succeed in the class. She will not sugar coat and there will be no misunderstandings from her. She says what she means and means what she says. If you have the opportunity you should select her for 1300/1451,1
"VERY BORING. class moves very slow even though material is easy. Could do the lecture in half the time but it drags. Allows one absence. Does a lot of group work during class that is pointless. Discussions, no textbook, essays, group projects. SO BORING and she is kind of confusing ",0
Clueless!  Takes forever to grade and always has an excuse.  Took on online class with him and he spelled things wrong and messed up due dates all the time.  HARD grader - who knew a 94% final average is actually an A-?,0
"Best advisor ever! His class was really awesome. It made you think and challenged you, but not in that mind-rape sort of way.",1
Maureen is the <b>best</b> teacher I have <i>ever</i> had. I know I can speak for all her students that she is very understanding and helpful.  I have learned so much from her in 2 semesters!,1
"Greg is my favorite prof at Highline. He isn't a prof who seems particularly invested in his students, but his appreciation for good work and good participation in class is admirable and respectable. I have taken multiple classes with him and work with him on projects even now that I'm not in class with him. Excellent prof, hilarious too.",1
"This class is not easy A class anymore, because recently she changed her lecture. Such as finish minimum 2800 words 12 pages report paper in a week and 20 pages reporting paper for final. unless you love to write reporting paper, I am not recommended this class.",0
"Complete waste of time. Barely covered any course material. He told us that nothing he teaches will be on the exam, but will help us out in the future: not true. The classes were useless, and extremely frustrating. He can't answer questions properly. Do not take this class with him... get anyone else",0
"Picks hard & confusing books to read and assigns reading due EVERY class. Papers are also confusing, midterm not too bad. She is a nice person but she makes the class difficult.",0
Dr. Wisner was the the best professor I've had thus far during my college education. I am definitely going to take  English 1102 with him,1
"This class is very interesting but dont sign up unless you are ready to go to every single class. You get 10 points off your attendance grade every time you miss a class, which counts as a test grade. and 10 points off if youre caught on your phone. the lectures are very interesting though and always have guest speakers. tests you can find online",1
"Early on he's critical of grammar mistakes. As the semester progressed he seemed more concerned with content as opposed to grammar. Regardless of this, follow his feedback, do the assignments, and write/rewrite your papers multiple times and you will be successful in Mr. Paquette's class.",1
There's never a dull moment in Professor Warn's class. He always tells awesome real life stories and somehow relates it back to what we're learning that class. I never missed a class last semester just because of how interesting Warn's lectures are.,1
Her past as a living history museum historian comes out in her classes which makes them interesting. Attend her classes as she brings in material culture items that will appear on tests and if you do not attend you may miss particular questions.  She is very fair and helpful if you are willing to work to expectations.,1
"I truely enjoyed/enjoy having Ms. Randle as a teacher. She explains everything in a manner easy for me to understand, and is always willing to help with ANY problems you may have on homework. Don't hesitate to go to her, she will help you. Do all your homework and you will pass the test - as long as you pay attention on the test.",1
He isn't very clear on how he wants you to write your notices and be prepared to read non-stop. I do not recommend this teacher. Taught the class closer to a masters program than a gen ed for a bachelors.,0
"If it is your goal to learn the science of nutrition, do not take this class - with this professor. Expect to find all of her test questions searchable on Quizlet (even the online midterm), and to be blindsided for the final. Personally, I know a lot about nutrition - A LOT, and I hoped to learn something here. Nope. She is a robot, sadly.",0
"Doesn't really do anything except grade the mid term and exam. You're basically teaching yourself with the textbook and Connect assignments. No lectures or supplementary notes by the professor. You can't even email him, as he directs all the work to the recitation professor.",0
As a counselor shes inspired me to change CCs and has shown me why ARC has a transfer rate of only 7% She is late to every meeting 20+ min It turns out Ive been taking classes that arent even transferrable She recommends you change majors because her gf is unhappy in the career youre after & she claims to have not gotten your emails Worst experien,0
"This class was WAY too hard for a GE. The lectures were boring, and we had a group project that was worth 29% of our grade. The project was anthropology oriented, which had nothing to do with what we were learning in the class. We also had 5 exams while other professors had none. If you have other options, take the class with someone else.",0
"Teacher required 7 fully typed lab reports.  Honestly spent more time typing these up than anything else.  Tests are a combination of multiple choice theory, short answer, and calculation problems.  Lots of pop quizzes sometimes the day before a section test.  The book also has almost no answers to practice problems.  W/o youtube i would've failed.",0
I love Professor Lopez!!! he is so nice and caring. He really tries to make the information relevant and funny. He's a great dude and I recommend him to everyone!,1
"Hilarious! Great at grabbing your interest. Text was great for first 2/3 of instruction, but last 1/3 is fluency. Text isn't needed if you're trying to save money but was helpful for additional info and some assignments (but you could get that info online if you are good at researching). there's 4 exams and about 5 10pt assignments.",1
Lane was great! I had him during the COVID-19 and we had to switch to online classes in the middle of the semester and he did not skip a beat! He was very helpful and answered any questions without hesitation! I would take him again without blinking an eye! As long as you go to class take notes and pay attention you will pass!! GREAT INSTRUCTOR!!!,1
"My favorite quote???  ""I don't know how to pronounce this word, and I really don't care...""   Kate does little to prepare students for the medical profession. I appreciated her kindness and willingness to work with her students, but I didn't sign up for this class to have someone make me feel good...",0
The class is very easy if you buy the textbook and follow the powerpoints. She does a good job explaining the material but kids don't pay attention because she is kinda boring. But she gives a lot of extra credit on each test - a 70% or higher was a A. If you put in a little effort and pay attention you will do fine,1
"I dont know about these ratings but, she required online text which was highly expensive and ridiculous and weekly quizzes. Pointless to go class but yet she takes role. Mostly for under division students. Overall, very bubbly personality",0
Avoid at all cost. The professor cannot teach and makes atleast 10 mistakes per class. He is very unclear when explaining and gives rude answers to people who asks valid questions.,0
"The way he explained things was confusing, so it's better to stick with smart people. You can missed a few classes and made the points up with extra credits. Overall it was an easy lab class, just a bit confusing. No textbook. If you take this class, you will surely get an A.",1
solid teacher.,1
First of all i definitely could have gotten an A or B+ in this course but grading criteria is so awful and unclear made me get a C+. This instructor is always unclear about what are we doing in the labs and doesn't explain stuff well. If you got a bad group than you are probably gonna have bad grade in the final project. Lectures are boring.,0
"She is all over the place, she tries to assign us homework that we've already done. I don't blame her though, all the busy work she gives us is the same. She gave me a 0 on accident and I asked her every class period for two weeks to change the grade on moodle and she still hasn't. Get it together girl.",0
"One of the nicest professors ever!!! I love his teaching styles and his concerns for his students. He will do anything beyond his powers to help his students. Never seen a professors that cares for his students like him. Also, very professional and fair!",1
"she was so nice, i made sure to take another class that she taught!! i handed in a summary 2 weeks late and she gave me full credit!",1
"I LOVED Dr Kumari. She truly allowed me to love economics. I loved her discussions as they were real time and so interesting. I talked about what I learned outside of the classroom. This class is a lot of work but she is a fair grader. I took her both microeconomics and macroeconomics. If youre excited to learn , she is the best!",1
"I did everything right: I read, I participated, I studied, I took notes on everything, I went to her to get help on my mid-term and my 1st paper. The only thing I did not do was go to her several times with my paper and midterm questions. She teaches like its an intro class, gives out exams fit for a 2000 class and grades like it is one too.",1
He is pretty tough but if you show up and seem like you are trying he will give you a decent grade. I did horrible on the labs but the sign in sheet got me a B- in the class.,0
Big exams consisting of lots of terms. Four chapters each exam. READ THE TEXT,0
"Easy way to fill quan requirement. He's a CPA, so he knows what he's talking about, but doesn't teach the class very well. Just reads off of powerpoint, shows out of date videos on Fridays. Easy multiple choice midterm and final, minimal online homework, 15 worksheets due at end of semester. EASY!",1
"really hard to understand. he moves very fast with out giving alot of examples. there are alot of office hours, but when you go if you don't understand something he seems mad at you. test was 6 questions, 2 mc, 2 put in order, and two worth 25 points each...stay away!!!!",0
"WOW.. SHE IS VERY DIFFICULT DONT ASK QUESTIONS YOU WILL LOOK STUPID STUDY GUIDES ARE USEFUL, SHE MAKES AN EASY SUBJECT VERY DIFFICULT",0
"Senora Pilkington is a very kind professor. If you took a couple of years of Spanish in HS, you will be fine. She will get you up to speed if you feel rusty. Keep up with the homework and ask questions and you should receive an A.",1
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
"Great class, very interestng, and Rothstein is very informative",1
Goes on so many tangents. Lecture slides are not detailed. HW questions are made by him and so specific to what he says in class. I find it hard to learn in this class because he doesn't necessarily follow the textbook and there's not that much outside sources that help since its such a specific topic.,0
"This class isnt difficult. However, you can't slack off. Powerpoint are just pictures so you gonna have to watch the lecture or come to class. Gives 2 quizzes that are extra credit (basically your curve). 3 exams and no final, so you can't screw up on these exams. This class is not hard. Lectures are pretty boring tbh. I would take his class again",1
"only one thing to say: a final exam, in college, consisting of 11 fill in the blank questions??????? you decide.",0
"College of Engineering Dean. Lectures were difficult to follow and disorganized. Classwork (lab) and homework was meant to help students use technology to solve engineering problems, but I found it to be elementary and a waste of $263/credit hour. Nice guy, but disorganized presentations without a clear purpose. Recommend another instructor.",0
"Easy class, she does space out your essays which is really helpful but overall extremely boring lectures and you can't doing anything else but bare through the monotone for an hour and a half, would not recommend this teacher.",0
"Class was garbage just like the quarter before, just as unforgiving and overall didn't teach anything well. He graded the homework at the same percentage as the tests and the final was only 20% of your grade. Absolute joke, stay clear of this man.",0
A joy,1
"Polanco is a tough grader but she a very nice professor. The grades included a midterm, final, journals, RPS credit, Reading checks, a final paper, and 5 group projects. It's a lot of work but I enjoyed the class. It's not an easy A, you have to participate to get a good grade!",1
This guy decided to change up his grading policy mid semester thinking it would help students. This was the first time I have ever gotten curved down in a class. He is a new prof and thought a 100 question final was fine and said 300 questions was bad. He is new and doesn't teach. I highly recommend you don't take him,0
"I'm a senior and I had a 4.0 until this class. Take this class somewhere else. This is the worst prof I've ever had. She is low-key unprofessional. I have so many things to say about this prof... Just know her tests are crazy hard. On our second test the average was a 40. Good luck to anyone who takes her, you're going to need it.",0
His lectures aren't exactly lectures he does I Clikers and uses those examples to lecture. The homework that is assigned does not go relate to the weekly Monday quizzes. Which makes it really hard to pass his class.,0
"Very knowledgeable guy, passionate about his subject and really cares about his students. His readings are heavy, and you'll be quizzed every week. Lectures are interesting with video interludes. Attendance is mandatory. Quizzes are composed of MCQs and short answer questions, and are easy if you read the slides religiously. Definitely recommend!",1
"Hardest ""Intro"" class you will ever take. She knows her field cery and excpects everyone to know it as well as her. Lectures are absolutely awful, as she does not shut up about her dog and how smart she is. Tests do not include anything taught in class. Just don't take her class unless you have a strong psych background already you will not pass.",0
"I would not take her class. Worst teacher I have had by far, gives no direction what so ever and is not clear on anything. And she kicks so many people out of the class. DO NOT TAKE.",0
"took her for bio lab, she is the nicest TA youll ever meet. shes lenient, nice, and actually gets back to your emails fast. would definitely take her again and would definitely recommend",1
"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government. He invalidates opinions that aren't his own. If you don't want to be in an echo chamber, I'd suggest another professor.",0
"Love her! Class is easy, but you have to go. Easy A, if you try. She brings cookies and candy all the time!",1
"Prof Hulsey is amazing! Take her, take her, take her. She's emailed me back at midnight multiple times, which is so helpful considering I had her online due to the pandemic. Accounting is such a difficult intro class and she really helped. I think she bumped my grade up like 5 points so I'd get an A, but I'm not positive about that. Take her!!",1
"If you are taking Trigonometry with Prof. Gaworecki, then get ready to spend most of the semester focusing solely on Trig. You will have to keep up with her during lectures and she hands out pop quizzes every other day. (I would recommend studying the homework before class in order to not fail the pop quizzes.) Study weeks before the exams to pass.",0
"Best professor Ive had in several years. Lots of writing notes but its an easy grade if you just do the work. Practicals are easy if you can study the models off photos. The exams you definitely have to put in the work to memorize the content but honestly even then, its not that bad!",1
"In 4 years of undergrad and 2 years of grad school this was the worst class and worst professor I ever had. There is a text book, but he literally only uses the inside covers. Dropped the class, but it was mandatory and he was the only one to teach it.",0
"He's a sweet guy and a great professor. You'll learn a lot from him when you learn how to follow his lectures. He subtly mentions important things, so take good notes and do some research after class. He knows a lot and has a lot of great stories",1
"It was difficult for me to understand his lectures. He has some resources that may help his students on blackboard, but his study guides did not help me at all. I would study early for upcoming exams and I would barely pass it. What saved my grade was the lab assignments, lab tests, and the homework.",0
"Professor Mendes has been an absolute nightmare. She does not respond to emails and occasionally did not show up to scheduled office hours. She offers a fair amount of extra credit, but does not explain lecture material clearly. Always seems to be in a rush. Also, she was about 1 full month behind on grading assignments during the semester. Avoid.",0
Prof Berger-Hill is THE BEST online teacher I have ever had. I normally hate online classes but loved hers. She is 110% experienced in her field and it shows. Her guided lectures & key terms in the modules are so helpful and kind. She is so sweet and always available for help or questions. TAKE HER! You won't regret it. I'm already taking another!,1
He gives everyone basically the same grade and doesn't event tell you what needs improvement. He is hard to understand and doesn't really teach well over all. His grading is ridiculous. He'll give you the same grade every time. If you don't want a C or a B- on every paper I suggest to not take the class. Save yourself!,0
Worst math professor/strictest grader that I've ever had. He is distracted by everything and he bunny trails every single class period. Takes an hour to teach a topic that should take 10 mins. Google taught me more in two hours than he has taught me this entire term. Homework feedback is degrading VERY unhelpful.,0
"Online Math 90 Class.  Class runs itself.  If you have a question, don't expect an answer until after the assignment in question.  Don't expect your tests graded in a timely manner either, he'll blame the school for not delivering them to him.",0
"By far Professor Lee is one of the best teachers I've ever had. His class is fun, challenging, and never ever boring! He really cares about teaching and is always helpful to students. His class is well-planned and he teaches in ways that make me really enjoy going to his class... All in all, I would recommend his class to anyone.",1
"Even if you need to take him for accounting 101 DO NOT. Very nice guy, joking and funny but not a single class I payed attention in and makes a difficult class even more difficult to try and learn. Strictly shows youtube videos that we could look up ourselves",0
"Lectures are dry and quite boring honestly. As a required class, you'll have to deal with it. Maybe just don't take it as an 8am class and the lectures would be more enjoyable. He seems like a genuinely good and funny guy. I just don't enjoy his lectures.",0
"He's interesting to listen to, but gives uber-hard tests.",0
"As obviously smart as David is, he is a terrible prof. His lectures are all over the place and completely disorganized. His voice is monotonous and he mumbles to himself a lot - it's incredibly difficult to pay attention to.",0
"Incredible Teacher. Extremely Smart and Knowledgable, but totally down to earth and real. Very funny in a subtle way. Probably around Mid 30's with young kids. Very Approachable.   He gives about 8-10 short quizzes over a chapter. He will tell you which chapter and the questions are fill in - with a word bank. Study the keywords of each chapter and I'll do well. A MidTerm and Final are only two tests but it's over things covered in the lecture, so take notes. 1 RP and 4 short essays (easy).",1
"always unclear expectations. she talks down to students. the entire class struggles putting together assignments and essays, unsure of what she is wanting. low class test scores due to not covering the material clearly before test. very agrivating and stressful class. she's nice. but pretend nice. she does not care if you sink or swim.",0
"Professor Canedo structured this in a way that most students will either barely pass or fail. Quizzes are 8 questions, each worth 5 points, and they are based off of a reading of 50+ pages. No study guide. He won't work with you or consider your feedback. If you can avoid taking this class with him, please do so for your peace of mind and good gpa.",0
"Mr. Cage grades subjectively,  doesn't teach the curriculum and is sarcastic. He is unclear and is easily the worst teacher at ccbc.",0
Most unorganized prof i have ever seen. Makes it very hard to follow notes. does not prepare you for midterm/final at all. Labs dont make sense and not even the GAs know what theyre doing,0
a very gifted teacher...but talks too much. it seems like she has to cover every little thing in the book and still add more stuff.her three hour lecture classes are just too much. doesnt give too much time for lab(20 min tops/wk im serious) i also think she gives you very tricky quiestis for the exam.im def. not taking her for a&p2.,0
Awesome professor! He builds up to speaking in front of the class that by the time comes your nerves are no longer an issue.,1
"Tricky as a clinical instructor.  Assignment instructions unclear, and clarification is lacking even if you ask questions.  Requires in-depth detail when it comes to all 3 long group projects, plus a group paper. ",0
"Owen is as zany as they come.  You're basically learning chemistry from Jim Carrey.  He inundates you with content and requires total comprehension.  50% of all test questions are trick questions in an already difficult subject.  He is not very approachable in office hours.  If you can't pay attention for the entire lecture, you will not do well.",0
"Dont sign up for this class. RUN. Average exam grades are Ds. The only reason youll pass is because of the exam drop. If want to keep your 4.0, choose another class.",0
if you think your gonna go in this class and take exams on Jazz History your not.  All 5 of your exams will be on distinguishing what type of jazz you are listening to. not easy because in class ALL he talks about is the history which is not on exam. So u teach yourself from vids on blackboard! If your not a music major avoid! Extra cred impossible,0
Anderson is my favorite teacher ever! I had never taken a Calculus class before I took her and I came out with an A. She made calculus fun!,1
"The first quarter is difficult cos you have to get accustomed to her teaching style. She isn't looking for your work to fit into specific guidelines, just write anything basically has yo do with the topic she assigns. If you turn in work and participate you will get an A. Great class great professor. I'd love to take classes from her in the future.",1
"Believe only the bad reviews, impossible to get an A, no makeup under any circumstances, narrow grading scale, doesn't give full points only partial and fractioned points ie 3.25 pts out of 5, focuses on irrelevant items on exams, lectures are weighted more than quizzes and exams. Shall I go on...? Avoid taking, will ruin GPA. Unhappiness :(",0
"Ridiculously unreasonable rules that do not apply to favorite students a/k/a female students who share her propensity to chain smoke in the ally or parking lot. 5 minutes late to class?  That's an absence and counted against your participation points - unless you are a favorite.  Forget freedom of speech/expression.  Makes her ""grumpy"".",0
"boring class, but easy grades. very repetitive and i really didn't learn anything new at all. good professor, just boring teaching style.",1
Yes this subject is hard but this teacher made it very difficult to pass. No feedback why 0 points were given when answers mirrored lecture material. Very disappointing that some professors make things harder than need be and make students feel discouraged.,0
"Loses temper easily. Even if you have an excused absence, he will get annoyed and will not let you make up work. My friend told him weeks prior that she had a surgery and he said that was too early to tell THEN later told her if she doesn't take it on the day she was planning on leaving that she will get a letter grade off. Nice guy, rude prof.",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER. This teacher uses many unnecessary vocabulary words to throw her students off during exams. Her tests make absolutely NO sense, but make up the bulk of the grade. It's almost like someone is using google translator to write these exams. Discussion boards are graded RIDICULOUSLY TOUGH for writing our own opinion. STAY AWAY",0
"This guy teaches the class as if we're professional accountants. He moves way too fast, tip-toes around ?'s when u ask them, he is very stuck up and condesending. The material is hard enuff without this fat idiot speeding thru the material and making u feel like an idiot when u ask ?'s. He also sweats alot during class,do yourself a favor AVOID HIM",0
"I had Dr. Irani for Abnormal Psych, she was super easy and a very sweet professor. Very helpful and understanding, keep up with quizzes and readings and you will do well. There is one exam, the final and  her exam almost  70% pulled from the quizzes you take all semester long. Great class. ",1
Knows her stuff very well! Ready to help out. Particular about assignments and attendance. Overall worth taking the class.,1
Alisa is an amazing teacher!! I was terrified of taking math and I passed with a B! I would suggest to ANYONE needing to take 015 to take it from Alisa.,1
Suck,0
"She's one of the best professors in the Public Health Department. She truly cares about her students and goes over plenty of examples in class just to make sure we understand the material. Overall, she's really understanding and knows students have lives outside of class.",1
"Fifty minutes into her lecture and all Ive heard is how great of teacher she is (shes not) and how easy this class is to pass (it's not). For some reason the most difficult class I have is this ""blow off class"" and let me tell you it is not. Her mid term is huge and only 4 days to work on it. ""At least you woke up this morning"" Almost wish I didn't",0
"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class",0
"I took this class for my ""literature beyond ENGL1102"" credit, and I don't regret it. Betsy is super straightforward about her expectations, and as long as you make quizlet sets for each unit and do your homework, you should make an easy A. Her only drawback is that she's a very slow grader, but she is a grad student so that's kind of understandable",1
Fenster is the tsar bomba in the world of chemistry. Made me laugh every class. The Man.,1
"Very hard course, but thanks to his big curve I was able to get a decent grade",1
"One of the easiest and most pointless classes I've ever taken. Didn't learn anything valuable but it's required. Take Lee and not Kraas if you want a good grade. Show up, do projects and online quizzes and you will pass for sure. No need to read textbook, just used it for a few quizzes.",1
Warning. I had a horrible experience with this guy and his class was not what I expected. Be aware. ,0
"He used a graduate level text for an undergrad course.  Highlight of the course: ""This is a very important theorem that we will use a lot"" followed by, ""I am not sure it's true"" when after about 10 minutes he couldn't prove it.  I think he used that course as a vehicle to get paid to review group theory for himself.",0
I love Dr. Grapenthin. She is such a sweetheart and will take the time to help you if you don't understand what is going on. Come to class and you will pass.,1
"This teacher physically couldn't be any more boring. She doesn't understand the basic concept of a gen-ed. The tests will feature random factoids, that don't show up in the textbook nor the lecture slides. You are punished for studying the review sheet that she issues. This is stealing.",0
Amazing teacher.  Every class is interesting; a great lecturer and discussion starter.  You do need to pay close attention in class if you want to do well on the tests.  He's a tough but fair grader and lets you know how you can improve.  Very friendly.,1
Professor Lombardo was definitely one of my best professors! He made ITE very enjoyable.  He's always there for you if you have questions and replies to emails within minutes. His paperless style is easier for students and the projects/ assignments that are assigned are pretty cool too. I definitely would recommend his class!  +a relaxed atmosphere,1
Always late to class doesn't teache you hands on . You can't walk out the class without him even knowing,0
"this woman is out of her mind, during lecture she'll go on for an hour about her granddaughter and teach us NOTHING, come exam time, she pulls questions out of her ass about stuff she never ever taught, THANK GOD SHES RETIRING no one deserves such torture",0
"Not an ""easy A"" class but she's a good professor. Funny at times and has a lot of interesting things to say about the subject. If you work hard you should do well.",1
Very sweet and nice. Fluent in Italian.  Relates to the students very well.  But doesn't stick to a timeline plan of work (jumps around from assignment to assignment). Easy grader on tests. You'll learn a lot about Italian grammar with her. Speaks in Italian althrough out the class. She's very caring to her students. I recommend her.,1
Shes nice but shes just a bad teacher. I didnt learn from her lectures. I mostly muted her and did my hw during class. P.S. Almost all quiz/test questions are on Quizlet,0
"She's really nice, one of my favorite professors this semester. If you ask a question, she actually answers it in depth, and is great with grading. If you gotta take MAT243, take her!",1
"Brown is the worst professor probably to walk the planet. He doesn't give two craps about his students. Four tests make up 95% of your grade. His lectures do not make any sense, as he gets side tracked VERY easily. He makes a confusing topic even more confusing, never answers emails, and overall is just very rude.",0
"He's a really nice guy. He's much nicer than most accounting profs. He is strict about being there one time, so please just come on time. Class isn't too difficult, just a lot of homework.",1
"LOVEEEEE prof saks, she is one of the best professors at widener. I took her two semesters. she should teach calc so she can be my teacher again. She is very nice and isn't out to fail you. homework Is a must but its really easy and no way to fail unless you don't do it at all. reviews before test. I recommend her to everyone ",1
"If you're looking for a good College Algebra teacher, take Ms Gordon! She is so amazing! I never understood math very well before I took her class, but now I actually like math! Take her!!!!",1
Mike is one of my favorites professors in umich. He cares about students and willing to help outside of class. This course really needs hard work especially do a lot of practice questions. When you stuck ask for help right away. Go to the help room! Mike is an amazing professor. Take it with him! Less pain!,1
Great teacher! Kind and considerate.,1
"Nedd is hilarious. He's so easy, he doesn't know dates so he does not ask for them. If you are not an art history person take him. He can be frustrating at times, but you will catch on to what he wants from you after a few weeks. Any of his classes are an easy A. Oh and he is a HUGE soccer fan so just talk about soccer and he will love you.",1
"4 ""pop"" quizzes (he announces them the class before, so show up), 1 individual project, 2 midterms+final.  Gives out the pdf of the book for free, but he's such a gem you don't need it. He teaches you everything in class. Take good notes, learn your calculator (do TVMCalcs), and you are set for an A. One of the best professors i've taken at SJSU",1
horrible and very rude ! don't take any class with him,0
"He literally just reads off the slides. If you want to pass, ditch the book and just pay attention to his lecture slides. He gives study guides, which are useless, because they're very vague. THERE IS A LOT OF MATERIAL. He's the only professor that teaches this class so there is no way of avoiding him. ",0
"She's a lovely person and fantastic professor. You get out what you put in. Classes are super easy, as are exams. To learn, make sure you do the work. You can pass having done nothing so everything is up to you. Homework took me an hour a week. She's super helpful and always there for you. You also learn a lot about France.",1
Professor Dattolo goes out of his way to help his students. His lectures are easy to follow because he is so clear and organized. He is fair in his grading and will always be there for you . EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!,1
"Reading, a discussion post, and 1-2 assignments and quizzes per week. Everything is pretty simple and Prof. Lirenso is very understanding of people's situations. I took this class along with a heavy course load, but he provides notes and a good study guide for the final which made studying easier and I passed with an A. I recommend him for GEO 001.",1
"The best English teacher Ive had. I struggled in English classes in HS because essays had to be on how works were written(ex use of literary devices),not what they were saying/about. This class was about understanding the works and responding to the aspects of them that engaged us. Nice,grades leniently,+accepts late work,but you gotta read+work!",1
I CAN'T STAND THIS WOMAN!  Literally have been in her class for a week and regretting it so much already.  She is super rude and condescending.  She gets frustrated by questions and has the same blanket response for everything.  Its going to be a LONG semester.,0
"I learned a lot about people and myself. I liked the relaxation sessions as I have anxiety from an accident,it help me to relax in other classes as well. I learned how to counsel people with problems. Great man respectable too.",1
"She was so awesome! NO homework but class assignments and the group project is so freaking simple! I got an A and oh yeah, shes really nice and cool.",1
"Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!",0
If you're taking this class for a gen ed then don't take it because it is a lot of work and projects for a gen ed. It's an interesting class and I would recommend it because it's enjoyable but it's a lot more work than I expected.,1
"Honestly this class wasn't the most interesting, and it had 4 lecturers but out of the four James Denison was the most interesting and gave the best feedback. Overall very easily approachable, and willing to explain things in depth if you need more clarification. Great prof!!",1
Tries to teach too much in too short a time and isn't very clear or helpful if you have questions.,0
"She is so well known for her love of the LGBTQ+ community that even people in Africa have heard of: ""The Great STINNETTE"". Her ability to keep up with the times, and her academic professionalism (the way she teaches by using YouTube videos is inspiring) keeps me wondering how the world could deserve someone as dedicated as her. Chirp Chirp, Torian!",0
"Clausen is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. She breaks down the material like no other professor can. If you listen in her class, and study, you will do fine. I took no notes in her class but actively listened and studied for her final and got an A in Contracts and B+. I decided to be a transactional attorney because of her.",1
"Susan is all over the place in her lectures both in class and online (has in class lectures with her previously). She answers questions very broadly and confusingly, she just wants people to laugh at her jokes and be her friend. It is hard to communicate with her during online classes, she is very selective when replying to emails.",0
"Tests are multiple choice pulled straight from quest with a few added questions thrown in, so lecture is actually insignificant because he often covers material that is not on the homeworks or tests. As long as you do the homework and review learning modules, you will do fine in this class.",1
Be ready to learn and remain teachable!! This woman know her stuff and can spot a wanna be know it all a mile away. Do yourself a favor and try to remain humble in her class. She loves to help the struggles and will bend over backwards until you understand the material. Leave your phone off or in the car. Copy down ALL that she writes on the board!,1
I am a student who always ends up listening to his lectures when I start studying for my class quiz or when I have to do my assignment. Amazing lectures. Always awed by the way he drives the class.,1
If you show up and pay attention you'll do just fine.,1
"She is a very kind person and makes sure everyone understands was it going on in the class. There is a decent amount of work, but it is by no means difficult. The exams are easy and she gives extra credit.",1
I went into this class with absolutely no clear idea of what it was about. What I came out with four weeks later was a passion for understanding of all things new and exciting. Dr. R is very good at involving his his students in the here and now. I would take any of his classes. In the future I find him interesting as a teacher. A great motivator,1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich reminds me of a teacher running down the clock til he retires. Communication took FOREVER, and when he did resopond, he just reworded the syllabus without clarifying. Test questions were overly detail driven. Only take if you can teach yourself and memorize well.",0
"Dr. Mahosky is one of the best professors I have ever had at NAU. She is passionate about disability studies which improves your motivation to learn. It would be hard to not get an A in her class, as her teaching is clear and the coursework is interesting. I definitely recommend all DIS courses. They are all exceptional with wonderful teachers!",1
"Oks was an avg teacher. When I took him, he made the grading scale A=80-100; B=65-80; C=50-65; D=35-50; F=35-0. I honestly did not learn much from him. I knew most of the material bc I had a good high school physics teacher. Made an A in Oks class bc of this knowledge. NOTE: Oks is known make ""E) None of the above"" a correct answer on some test",0
"Network Architecture and Protocols was a living nightmare...Karvelas' slides we crap, his DL format was email vs. Moodle like everyone else, exams were absolutely impassable, and he didn't even admin his own exams...STAY AWAY!",0
If you take the online section beware of hours of homework. The book is terrible with little actual learning material.,0
"This class was very straightforward and easy. We had to purchase an online textbook that had the course system build in. We had a discussion every week based on the chapter we read in the book. We had a test every 4 chapters we read. Overall, the class was very easy and informational.",1
HORRIBLE.,0
"IONASCU CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS SO MUCH. Honestly, she really invests in us and is willing to go the extra mile. She's a solid teacher, and you will not have to read the textbook if you pay attention in lecture. Homework is online and fairly light, and her tests are straightforward and only cover material from lecture. Take this professor!",1
"I had a teacher say once that in math and chemistry if teachers use scantrons they are just lazy and that is so true. This gy uses all scantrons so it doesn't matter if you really know this stuff but make a minor calculation error you still get no credit for what you do know. Take from Hodge, his tests let you show what you've learned.",0
"Dude's a walking meme, love it.",1
In all honesty Ted is a nice guy but a terrible teacher.  He struggles to explain the material and makes it very challenging for students.  To survive in this course you have to teach yourself the material in order to succeed.  ,0
"I was so excited to take this class but the professor destroyed the passion I had for the subject. The material is choppy and there are no class discussions. The provided materials are stale, outdated, and unconnected. The test questions are confusing and conflicting information is in the materials provided. Do yourself a favor, pick another class.",0
"I like Coop as a person, but his lectures leave a lot to be desired. As an engineering student, I don't really care about the theory behind the math, I want to know how to do the problem and he wasn't very effective for that. Overall, wouldn't take him again.",0
Prof. Reyes is very helpful and her class is not easy or difficult. It's a matter of putting the effort and time like any other class. When one goes and sees her in her office and explains everything piece by piece. She's very patient and kind. She opens up the homework sections if one asks her to. Take her class if your hard working.,1
"Absolutely horrible...seems easy when you are in lecture and are reading the book, but exams are harder than the anatomy exams. MC with answers like A,B, None of the Above,All of the above, 2 right answers for all questions. Very detailed on exams with obscure questions from specific cases. Bad lecturer, lecture puts you to sleep, AVOID AT ALL COST",0
Dr. D is such a caring and funny person. She teaches in a way that you remember the material and is wonderful about helping if you dont understand. Such a smart lady but so down to earth.,1
"This class can be easy, if the professor was a bit more in depth with the material. The syllabus is very vague so it's hard to know exactly what to cover, and taking any of the exams are a mess. But if you are on top of things it can be done.",0
"I found this instructor to be infuriating! Her personality & teaching techniques leave a lot to be desired. She does not take into consideration that most students taking DE math are generally not good with math to begin with & she offers them no assistance or encouragement. In addition, the amount of homework & quizzes for her class is ridiculous.",0
"This professor was amazing! I took him last fall and although he was intimidating at first, he made it extremely comfortable to speak to him and in class. I enjoyed his lectures and have actually registered for the other two classes he offers despite them not being required for my degree. I highly recommend him to anyone who's willing to do it.",1
This professor is not truly professor I think she bought her degree. She avoids teaching because she does not know. I think she is getting old and start losing her mind but she still comes to FGCU. Avoid this old hag and take it with someone else,0
"I know Dr. Miravalle personally, and he is a man of great virtue and humility. I actually struggled a bit in his class due to personal issues, and he guided me through those with compassion and sensitivity. He makes you work hard in the class but certainly is reasonable when it comes to grading. And his zeal for the Blessed Mother is edifying!",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOUR WEAK IN EXAMS AND QUIZZES!!! I had to drop out of his class since my grade kept dropping since I have a weakness in those two things. Your only being graded by exams (45%) , quizzes (15%) and one project (10%). There is absolutely NO HOMEWORK and his lectures was confusing. I went to his office and tutoring, it didn't work.",0
She taught straight from the slides so if you have the lecture manual you could basically teach yourself everything and still pass. She does not know how to answer abstract questions (if it's not on the slide she does not know the answer). Homework load was a lot but not too difficult. The textbook was not useful but the lecture manual was.,0
"RJ was the bomb! He made this class seem like a breeze compared to what I've heard of the other sections. 7 online quizzes, and 4 noncumulative exams make up your entire grade. His study guides/powerpoints cover everything that will be on the exam, and he offers extra credit for every exam. Posts the powerpoints, with the answers, online! Take him",1
"Makes several mistakes, doesn't give breaks and gets aggravated if someone gets up to use the restroom, very condescending, rushes through materials, doesn't properly explain mathematical rules and applications, every chapter I used kahn academy to figure out the ""lesson"" plan avoid at all cost",0
She's cool,1
GREAT teacher. Torts can be a bit confusing so you must not fall behind. Start memorizing early on as he expects you to know every rule & policy verbatim or you will NOT get credit on his exams. Study his model answers & follow his suggested formating! You will be expected to know every detail of a case so don't skimp on briefs. You stand to brief!,1
She is very condescending and patronizes students. Not helpful and just plan rude. Avoid taking this class if you can.,0
Easy A if you show up to class and take notes. Homeworks/practice tests are bonus points. Attendance isn't mandatory. He makes math easy to understand and follow and he's really nice.,1
Professor Ostlund is incredibly caring and kind!! She does a great job at preparing you for online higher learning. Super easy class! Just remember to participate in the forums and complete your credo!,1
"Professor Stagg does not have unreasonable expectations, he simply wants his students to benefit and learn from the course. Because of this, the course can be challenging at times. If you read the material and stick to MLA format (stickler on this), you should be fine.",1
"Where to begin *sigh*. I'm a solid student, I make A's. She makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make an A in this course. She does not hold lectures, only Zoom/Webex meetings once a week-which are impossible to get into if you have a life outside of school. She is snarky, she's very picky with how she grades, and you basically teach yourself everything.",0
Wouldn't wish her on my WORST enemy.,0
"He seems like a brilliant physicist but unfortunately he is more concerned with making the class laugh or awe at his math prowess.  The book for this class doesn't seem to corrolate with the lectures, but I suppose I learned something.  I'm just glad I have Mohrman this semester.",0
"Really enjoyed the course overall. Had to come to class prepared for group discussions, but discussions end up being her talking a lot (which never bothered me). She is very nice, funny, and caring. Exams were take home and were easy to do well on if you put the time in. If you can, take her at some point while at Centre, you will not regret it!",1
He is a great Prof. Just take his class and you will get an easy A.,1
"She wants you to participate, so just read a few pages to answer some of her questions. If you do exactly as she asks on the syllabus then you will be good.",1
Worst prof ever- brought her toddler to class 3times including final exam! She expects to be accommodated but accommodates no student even if you have a learning disability. Boring classes- always starts talking about her own life for min. 1 hour every class. I tried complaining to the dept-  no reply! She should be fired. Waste of my money & time!,0
"Its like having that miserable Italian grandma next door as your professor. You have to love her because shes Italian, but man she has no buisness teaching in the year 2020",0
Everett is a fantastic teacher. Knows what he's talking about and is great at clarifying things. Tests are a little difficult and done times weirded strangely.,1
"The man can't be understood at all, and he straight up called a student stupid. If you can avoid this class please do, save yourself the headache.",0
"The most stressful class I have ever taken. He doesn't give clear instruction and doesn't really teach you how to take pictures. Make sure you submit something on the assignment due date even though you don't do a good job. Because he will only grade everything at the end of the semester, which means you won't know your grade until then.",0
This professor I would say is extremely difficult! She lectures the entire class period so be prepared. Her exams are very difficult and she does not like to clarify her rationales behind the questions. . My advice when preparing for exams are to do TONSSSSSS of practice questions and LISTEN to her lectures for things she put emphasis on!,0
"McCullagh grades none of the homework that he assigns. His GA may as well teach the class. He assigns long papers, loses them, then gives you late. He's very forgetful and has to be reminded that papers are due and where we are at in the lecture.",0
"Prof Ignacio is awesome! He is very thorough in lecture. I never felt lost on what was expected and how to successfully achieve a good grade. This subject is not the easiest but he is very supportive and helps as much as he can. Go to class, pay attention, try, ask questions and you will do great! Would definitely take him again!",1
"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",0
"HE DOES NOT CURVE. 4 lengthy and involved questions on each exam and his partial credit is a joke. Not allowed to bring a formula sheet. The Class average was 40 both on exams before I dropped. He has admitted to having only two people pass before. He marks homework as ""ok"" easy padding to your grade,but it tells you nothing useful. Avoid.",0
"The professor was good overall, but I took him via an on-line course. The organization of the class was not great and many times you wouldn't know what you need to accomplish. I think the system he selected changed from previous classes which made everything disorganized. He was very polite and respectful.",1
"Being in Dr. Coutinho's class was one of the best experiences I have had since returning to college. This course, and in particular Dr. Countinho played a significant role in my switching from the sales leadership minor program to the Industrial Psychology minor. Dr. Coutinho's experience and expertise made THEO 393 a great and awesome course.",1
The only reason why I am passing this class is due to the fact that I teach myself every single chapter. The professor is a nice guy but isn't good at explaining what he is doing on the board and half the time doesn't even know what he's doing himself. I would recommend taking any other professor for chem 2 over this guy.,0
"Based on my experience with Dr. Ayadi this semester, I do not understand the negative reviews. She is very knowledgeable and overall a great professor. Her class is organized and she tries her best to breakdown the  material. There are a few writing assignments but nothing over a page long. I recommend taking her.",1
"John Fu is a great teacher. His teaching style is a little boring, but he knows a lot about graphic design and is extremely valuable to students who are serious about a career in the field. Overall, wonderful guy, very passionate, and always willing to help. He'll surprise you! Will certainly take his classes again!",1
"Dr. Ayers is one of the best professors UAB has.  Great sense of humor, and has loads of practical experience.  He's likes fast cars, and anything BBQ or beer.  Oh and he's really great at breaking down how marketing works.  Fantastic class!",1
"This is the type of professor that will make you question how the hell did this guy get hired. Seriously he is the most laziest incompetent professor I've ever had he can't accomplish the most basic concepts of his job. I caught him copying his tests from online websites instead of making his own, which is a very unfair assessment. Don't take him!",0
"I didn't mind Dr. Lim as much until the final.  I've gotten higher than 95 on all my homework, A's on both of my midterm and 100 on the semester project, and I left finals with an overall of B-....... The 3 hours exam was so freaking hard, I didn't finish in 4 hours... and trust me, I studied my ass of for that class. so good lucj if you take him.",0
No visual aid. Hard to hear her lecture. Description of the class is very misleading. Only focused on a very specific vein of activism and movements. Does not always respond to emails. Do not take it unless you are prepared to read numerous several hundred paged books. Absolutely hated this class. This professor is not good.,0
"The best teacher I've ever met! Very clear but very complex. You have to push yourself hard,  but not beyond your capacity. A lot of hard reading, but his lectures clarify everything (if you are attentive and present).  Grades not based on Attendence.",1
"He is nice enough and discussions can be lively. However, this class shouldn't be required for anyone 25 or older.  Assignments and due dates are not clearly defined (they don't match the syllabus). ""Do a writing on metacognition"". Ok, what about it? Specifics would be nice. Too many papers to write overall, got tiresome. Also, don't buy Outliers.",0
"I would not take Professor Aguilar again only because her lectures are not really lectures she speaks about the reading but she tends to go off topic a lot. If youre not much for writing papers do not take her, she only has about 4 assignments and theyre all heavy graded and really long and does not take late work. A lot of research is involved",0
Super passionate and light hearted professor and gives great feedback. She makes new or shy speakers more comfortable and grades very understandably. Highly recommend this course,1
"Mrs. Langill is the WORST teacher ever. She is completely unorganized, she will tell you to study one thing and then test you on another, she doesn't provide any help to you, you either get it or you don't.The material is hard enough, and she is completely useless as a teacher",0
Scanlon gave us a decent introduction to poetry analysis. It's hard to get accustomed to literature analysis. I recommend recording his talks so you can listen to them again and again. He is straight forward but it takes time and effort to adjust to this mode of thinking.,1
Does not even try even a little bit too make her class engaging. Not to mention that the lecture and textbook readings are literally word for word. Her tests were tricky and with limited time it was really easy to mess up. Felt that she didn't want to teach or want her students to do well.,0
"Not only is this class hard, his lectures are beyond boring. He missed his calling somewhere and should not be teaching. Even his extra credit opp. are more work then all my other classes. I would never ever taking a class with him again",0
Easy A if you come to class and take notes. He does the practice homework as his lecture so the homework/quizzes/test are all a breeze. Highly recommended!!,1
If youve had the pleasure of being in Dr. Gs class you know she is such a sweetheart. She truly cares about her students and works at a pace to make sure everyone understands the material (mainly just reading sheet music). She understands not everyone has prior music knowledge and does what she can to help make connections. Very few (easy) HWs,1
"No lectures, just forced to go into labs where you just copy what the TA shows you without really being taught what to do. Then you are given assignments that say can take up to 10 hours to complete in the syllabus, with almost no instruction on what to do. Grading takes way too long, one day left in sem. and I still don't know what my grade is.",0
"I believe he is very smart and always want to help you to success. He is always late to the lecture as well as online meetings. He rarely help in lab, basically you just figure with your lab partners and he's doing his own stuffs. Takes forever to grade and provide very very little feedback on your homework. Tons of homework due at the same time",0
It wasn't difficult once you realized you will have to learn most of it on your own. Does not know how to explain things in class. Asking her in office hours is nearly as bad. I recommend asking other professors for help.,0
Lazy Professor! All she does is giving you a load of readings and then have the class talk about it while she just stands there and literally nods to everything. It is honestly pathetic! There is only 3 assignments that make your grade or break it. All based off a book and articles. It is really annoying & there is no real class engagement!,0
"Sheridan is a fantastic professor. He does expect a lot - there is a lot of reading and the lectures are heavy content wise. However, he does a great job clarifying what you may need help with and if you put in the work, you will do just fine. Taking him again in the fall and I am so excited.",1
As a lecturer not that great. Seems like he hardly knows material while speaking during lecture but when you ask him questions during office hours or after class he gives really good concise and clear responses. Definitely knows his stuff just poor presenter/lecturer. Subject material is not difficult. Fairly easy class to pass.,1
The class was full of long assignments and graded activities with unfair distribution of credits. You will have more than 10 assignments  activities together each takes more than 1 week to finish 1 quiz and 2 exams. He didn''t teach. He just made you work. Don''t know how something works Find out on your own. His feedback was ambiguous. ,0
"If the class is online, don't take it. Ive heard he's better in person.",0
"He has been the most passionate, inspiring, &, genuine profesor I have ever had. Each day was memorable in class discussion having us use different perspectives to analyze literature. This class is no cake walk, but he truly shows you how much you are capable of and opens you up to Chicago&Illinois history which has an incredibly unique timeline!!!",1
"The worst professor in the business school. She is completely unprofessional, and utterly boring. I would recommend avoiding her classes at all costs.",0
She grades really hard but the tests are probably the WORST part. She only gives you 30 min for 20 questions even though in the syllabus it says 40 min. Her reviews are almost useless because taking the test there is more info that you needed than provided. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
"Dr. McCartney was a WONDERFUL teacher! Sweet lady, really knows her stuff. If you're looking for an easy gen ed, this is NOT the class for you. If you're looking to learn/ challenge yourself, the class is great. Lots of reading, weekly 2-3 pg journals, map quizzes at end of sem, one current events pres., midterm, final, and 12-15 pg research paper",1
"Hes super passionate about ethics and virtue. He keeps it real and helps you to understand whats really important. Loved his lectures. Make sure you go to class, most of the tests are based on what was said in class.",1
She is hands down one of the best teachers I have ever had. She can come off as intimidating but many of grew to see her as a mother figure. The writing assignments can be a little hard but if you can find a topic you are passionate about it all comes easy. Show effort! She will quickly get to know you. She cares about you and wants you to succeed.,1
Took her class in the Winter of 2016. Didn't learn anything from it. When I had a doubt and needed help she told me that she was too busy. I regret taking her class.,0
"The class is largely based on a group project (interviews). Tests are very easy! He does not assign any homework outside of the group project material. Really nice guy, tries his best to help everyone to pass!",1
"Super informative, pleasant voice to hear for lectures. Her quizzes are straight-forward. You have to study a little but it's not terribly hard.",1
"Dr. Hill does a great job at lecturing for the number of students in the class. She is interactive and tries to make what we learn relatable. The tests are not too bad as most questions come from the quizzes, clicker questions, and end of chapter ""self-check"". Overall, as long as you go to class and put in some effort, you will get an A.",1
"Always had good answers to the student's questions; also ready to hear alternate points of view without being critical.  Shared opinions when asked, but always backed up her viewpoint with some documentation and got us thinking about how and why the mind works the way it does.  Surprisingly interesting class.",1
Raquel is the most misleading professor i have ever had. She does not accept excused absences if you've missed class more than 3 times. there is a quiz almost every week and they are ridiculously hard. if you do not openly support her personal beliefs than you will not receive participation points even if you show up to class. DO NOT recommend,0
Took Math81 with him and he is ok. He goes over all of the sections in a chapter and at then end of the chapter asks for the homework followed by a chapter exam. Also slips a 5 question quiz in the middle of the chapter. Attendance is not mandatory but it is reflected on how you on on the exams. ,1
Wonderfully dedicated instructor with high level of understanding and awesome ability to connect with students!  Extremely patient and willing to repeat instruction when asked.  Had her for several semesters and never once saw her become impatient.  One of the best math instructors who is an excellent example for student teachers.,1
"Strait is the best, so helpful and funny",1
"Every-time I asked for help, she made me feel like the dumbest person alive. She is so smart that its hard for her to dumb things down. If you dont have a strong science background, youll probably fail.",0
"No nonsense, very clear straight foward teaching. Do the homework ask questions, no problem. She is very helpful if you put forth the effort. Many quizes reinforce what you learned. She is also fair in grading, homework is not unreasonable. She reviews and will answer any questions about the homework, that I liked.",1
"He is a complete waste of space what you learn in class does not pertain to the tests, which are based completely off the book. He spends most of his time rambling about nothing and I would have been better off taking a REAL programming class.",0
"Never explains his notes, reply to your email with at most 20 words, arrogant and funny(in a bad way), I think this is the worst prof I have ever seen.",0
"I really like Angela as a person, and she's clearly knowledgable, but her First Year Seminar was a bit tedious. She only had three books on the syllabus but they were all difficult to find and once you got them you only used them maybe two or three times. If you do what little assignments there are you'll be fine.",1
"I was struggling a lot during the first half of the class, but she was so patient and caring when working with me and what I needed. The class is very discussion based, she can go off on tangents sometimes, but a lot of the weight is placed on students. Hard texts, but she's so awesome about meeting outside of class to discuss any questions.",1
Great teacher show up listen take the test and map. He is very interesting and laid back,1
She says herself that she makes this class easier than other teachers do. The only homework there is is taking notes from the book and three papers throughout the semester. Easy A,1
"Isn't clear in directions and blames students when they don't know what to do. I passed this class but worked harder than ever, not because he was tough on me, because he doesn't know what he wants. In my opinion, you should only need to get help from TAs and GAs if you are struggling, it should not be an essential part of passing.",0
"Thus far, he is my favorite online professor. He is very organized and responds to emails very fast. He looks out for students; he dropped a reading and extended deadlines. The course itself is interesting and the assignments aren't too bad. I have a full time job and a full load in school and it's still fairly easy. Highly recommended! TAKE HIM :)",1
"This is an amazing class and Paul Young is an amazing professor. He is funny and keeps class engaging. He gives class time to letting students get to know each other and network which is awesome. He teaches so much useful information in class that makes you feel so smart about the music industry. Loved this class, 10/10 would recommend.",1
"The worse teacher ever, hard tests and tough grader, she just copy and paste her answers, and if you asked her a question she dont give you the right answer.",0
"I have taken this professors class online for summer 1 (5 week course). The good news is if you're taking another class you can put off this class until Monday becase that's when everything is due. The bad news, her tests are HARD she does give you an outline and review questions for each chapter but those won't help you for the midterm/final exams",0
Avoid at all cost. Very distant and disorganized.,0
Prof Chalakani-Baier is the best professor Ive ever taken. Shes makes class fun and didnt make me feel like I couldnt get up and speak. We had great discussions and were free to give our opinion. I love a light hearted class. You do have to put effort in but she tells you exactly what to do to get the grade you want!,1
Very hard marker.Almost failed everyone in the final.Exam questions were easy but don't know what happens when it comes to grade.Lectures are boring.,0
He's funny as hell and a real class act. Exams are really easy and his lectures are bearable. Go out of your way and get to know the guy if you have him online. He's great,1
"bryan is my favoritest-favoritest!!  he is a great teacher, his lectures are fun and interesting and his tests are challenging but not unreasonable.  great prof for abnormal psych!!",1
She is not very good when it comes to teaching and also tends to get off topic a lot which takes away from what we are learning. Does not give very good explanations for assignments that are given to us either.,0
"Jenneke is awesome, she has been the best teacher I have ever had! Zij is een heel leuke meisje!",1
She is nearly impossible to understand. Her class is horribly organized and teaches absolutely nothing aside from a feeble attempt to expand your world view to fit her own opinions,0
"Dr Li's teaching methods are unorthodox at best and impossible to get perfect at worst. His lab section will really try your patience as he must correct every minute detail of drawing from lab samples. He also gives out random quizzes while still teaching using clickers. Know the study guides he gives well, they will save your life on exams.",0
"Gloria is a very passionate instructor and really cares about her students and their success in the course. That being said, she is really disorganized and the class is sort of difficult to keep up with. She has difficulty explaining certain things and kept us past class time. The textbook was confusing and not engaging.",0
"Zaino was probably the driest lecturer I've had thus far. He jumped all over the places and we learned topics in isolation, so it was difficult to see how things related. Weekly quizzes, tedious homework and his exams are okay. Recitations aren't that helpful, but go to office hours if you can. Avoid taking this class unless really you have to.",0
"This was the worst professor I have ever had !!! She is very condescending, I would NOT recommend her at all. You have to go over modules by yourself and then come to zoom sessions and ask questions, if you need a professor that teaches then dont choose her ! Her mid term had 8 or more answer choices per question!!! WORST PROFESSOR EVER",0
"Did not love her as a professor, but she makes the class extremely easy. Textbook use isn't necessary (although the case study book is used weekly) and she allows for notecards on every exam.",1
took during covid 19. where to begin with this one. the teacher had us use MML by Pearson for the whole class. every week we did seven or more homeworks with a varying number of problems. for a full explanation go to google and search mymathlab reddit (cant post link so gl),0
Don't take English with her if English is not your strong subject.,0
Cool guy. Really makes sure the class understands what's going on. You can tell he  enjoys doing what he does.  Tests are mostly written  (doing supply demand graphs  pp curves etc.)  Has an excellent visual teaching style and he's constantly reminding the class when homework is due and when quizzes are coming up. 10/10 would take again,1
"worst teacher ever.. dont take her.. you'll regret it.. she's mean, bitter and wont ever help you..",0
"Her class consists of talking an excessive amount about phallic symbols, being interrupted by her multiple times everytime you speak, and trying to understand her (which is difficult) whether it be due to her accent, terrible grammar, or flawed logic.",0
Dr. Jon visit class in China and have the deep thought and fun activity for our learning.  He is very nice man and good teacher.,1
"This professor has her PH.D; however, you would never know it. Dr. Lindsey has made a positive impact in my life as a student. I recommend her classes to any student who wants a professor WHO CARES. In addition, she wants her students to ask questions, LOTS OF THEM. Be proactive with reaching out to her. She taught us the proper way of citing.",1
"Loved her for calc 2!! Very easy to understand and examples done in class are very helpful. Tests are very fair and don't have anything too difficult on them. Good amount of homework, and you get 10 tries per webwork problem.",1
"He is not there for you. You are on your own. He does not teach well at all is usually unprepared and unorganized but expects all students to be perfect. His comments can often be offensive, just don't take them personally. He is not very professional and will often yell at students. Need I say more?",0
"I took this class as an elective to expand my knowledge base and was told the course wasn't too hard. The online grading components of the class are not hard, and the project was really interesting to do. The midterms seem to grade on things which are unimportant, memorization-heavy and don't match with the reading sections. Beware stupid course.",0
Autumn does NOT keep up with putting grades in the grade book. She grades differently than stated in the syllabus. She does not respond to emails and keeps you from knowing your accurate grade until the last day final grades can be entered. She tests on materials that is different than what she lectures about and refused to help me in lab.,0
"I wasn't really into the material of this class but Prof.Shimko is really awesome at giving lectures. Passionate and interesting. three tests each with 33.3%, no attendance, no quizes.",1
"He expects that you'll read all of the short stories and books, and hopes that you'll read ahead. Take good notes while you're reading. He never belittles a student's opinion or viewpoint--in fact he builds upon it and shows how all perspectives have value. He is available during office hours and glad to help.",1
He doesnt have a good online class system.,1
"I loved this class and instructor! Ms. Langille loves her topic and is very encouraging.  This is a difficult class and takes lots of studying.  At the end of the semester it is amazing how much I learned. Ms. Langille encourages class discussions about any interesting topic in A and P. Class was fun, hard but fun- I am very proud of my grade!",1
Hes a really nice teacher and super chill but the work in the class is busy work and so unecessary sometimes. He gets really upset when no one shares their thoughts so even if you arent thinking anything you better make something up. He grades papers as though its an english course and treats it that way sometimes as well.,1
"Not the best professor but not the worst either. Lectures are very boring and sometimes confusing. Learned everything from the textbook since he just throws a formula on the board and moves on to the next chapter. Does not teach actual concepts well but if you just memorize the equations from the text books you will be fine. 2 midterms, 1 final.",0
"Dont take this dude, he knows what hes talking about to some extent but the class is very opinionated, purposely makes the class harder than it has to be. If I had a choice between he and a squirrel as my teacher Id choose the squirrel.",0
"Mr. Abutayeb was, and still is the worst teacher I have ever had. He kicked me out of the classroom because another person kept turning around and talking, then he thought it was ME he was talking to. I tried to explain to him the what happened, but he just called security on both of use. WORST TEACHER EVER!!! GOOD LUCK WITH THIS GUY!!!",0
It warms my heart to know that SUNY awards mediocrity with tenure.  Since when does  standing in front of a class and reading verbatim from a book you wrote qualify as teaching?,0
all im gonna say is that the mean exam scores were in the low 40's for the ENTIRE CLASS. Highest was in the 50's.,0
"Couldn't ask for a better teacher. Clear, helpful, gives Extra credit and down to earth. What more can u want?",1
"He took way too long to grade things & never followed the syllabus. His class didn't seem to have any structure or purpose. He often arrived late. He has a tendency to come off as arrogant, rude, &condescending. I asked him roughly how many sources should we use for our paper. He said, ""I shouldn't have to tell a college student that."" Um what??",0
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it wasn't even for my major. Do NOT choose to take LAS with her. Like another post on here, I did have a 4.0 but I struggled by to get a C with her. Grading on papers is unfair for freshman level non-English majors.",0
"Those who can't practice, teach...BUT NOT GOOD @ THAT EITHER!!! She shrugs her shoulders when u need help, or refers u to vague study guide sheet. grades are midterm, final, project, and 5 HW's. However, the exams had questions on readings she claimed were OPTIONAL!!! Also had to completely remember an 11 part rubric by heart. 2 abs.=fail to her.",0
Had a tough time this semester and this was not an easy course but she worked with me to make sure I graduated. Held me accountable and made me work for it but helped me the whole way.,1
"Easily one of the best ECE professors at Purdue. I dropped his class the first time because it was so tough for me but my second time around I was able to pass with flying colors and learned so much. He truly is a one of a kind professor and even if you think his class is hard, let him show you the way.",1
Professor Kaufman was hands down the worst professor I have ever had at RVCC. He is a stingy grader and his tests are unbelievable hard. He doesn't care if his students fail and he is not flexible with grading. I highly recommend anyone to not take his courses. He truly made anthropology an unlikeable subject.,0
Dr. Currier is outrageously helpful! She wants you to do well in her class & will spend extra time w/ you if you need it. VERY knowlegable & approachable.  BUT if you dont seek her help out or bother to read the book then you will NOT do well.  She gives a study guide but honestly I did not find it particularly helpful.  Read the book youll do well,1
"Weird, but good teacher! Sample quizzes and tests helped alot!",1
"His lecturing isn't the worst, but he makes you fill in blanks and you have to add textboxes when you could be paying attention to his lecture. He tests on very specific and arbitrary details and the marking scheme is unnecessarily rigid (good luck reading his mind when there's five missing words in a row for fill in the blanks).",0
"If you're the type of person who loves speaking and reading a lot on history, this is the class for you. However, the exams are all free response, so if you're not good at those and prefer multiple choice, then don't take this class. You have to read the book because he will pick on you to answer questions on the chapters he's assigned you to read.",1
Very laid back with dates and assignments and is always patient and willing to help you out. His only downfall I've seen is he tends to re-use jokes that were somewhat dry in the first place to the point where it can be annoying.,1
class seem to be o.k. just do the reading & attend lecture & you will be fine.,0
I LOVED LISA! She was an awesome teacher. Every time I would turn in an assignment she would provide the best feedback. I knew what to change for my final draft. She is TERRIFIC! Take her if you have the chance!!!,1
"This guy can barely speak English, he zooms through chapters expecting you to know the material and constantly gets his own math wrong. I can barely stand this class. DO NO TAKE HIS CLASS. Expect a lot of homework and it's best if you know the subject already.",0
"He's great! really friendly, very approachable, and know a lot about his area. Take his class!",1
don't take her ever . she is not A PROFESSOR  i took her 240 with her last semester. i recommend you to drop her class if you register her class. Take another professor,0
"Juan teaches a required 1st semester m-tech course. Be prepared for a professor who really doesn't give a heck about students, and gives confusing mixing advice and nonsensical tests. just keep your head down and you should pass fine. He won't take the time to remember your name.",0
"he is a great professor. He really wants to help his student understand and learn. He works with you. Trying and understand the concept is important even if you got confused a bit and got the wrong answer. He will give you some credit. UNDERSTANDING, HELPFUL,  & PATIENT !",1
The one thing I liked about her is that her tests are usually like the review. One thing I didnt like was how strict she was on grading essays. She would take up to 15 points off for slightly citing something incorrectly and acted as if this were an English class instead of a sociology class. Her lectures were pretty boring but overall Was nice,0
"She told me that college isnt for me and that I will never get a degree, all because I was habitually late by 5 minutes, which she considered to be absent for class. I work full time and was trying to get degree. She was very condescending and ruined my self esteem.",0
This teacher is extremely hard for 100 level beginners spanish class. Wish i knew that before taking her. Although she is hard she is really thorough and does a really good job at explaining and helping you understand the chapters. Make sure you do every assignment possible and go to every class if you want the best possible grade (obviously).,1
"Knowledgeable in the subject and gives good feedback, takes forever to grade, lectures are boring, not engaging, and almost painful to sit through. the class itself is easy enough though",0
"Dr. Meyer's lectures are heavily focused on his personal life, trauma that he has been through and his accomplishments. He has a confusing mix of talking about the terrible things that have happened in his life as well as the things he has accomplished and is proud of. Pretty annoying to listen to, though he is a nice guy.",0
"Dr. Schumann is a real gem, I had him for two courses. He gives specific questions to answer for the writings so you know what he wants you address. He breaks up the class by showing documentaries so it is not just hours of him lecturing, and has guest lecturers. No tests or book for 4050. He answers emails quickly; only downer is group projects.",1
"This guy has placed me on the path to success in the TV/Video industry! The most helpfull person in the school. I cannot believe anyone who takes honest critique from a good teacher a problem. If you are one of them, drop out of school, and allow the rest of us to learn from him!",1
She made me want to drop out of college and move to another country.,0
DO NOT DO EXTRA CREDIT!!!!!  Unfair with grading students extra credit after working all weekend to complete a packet.,0
"The class was mainly lecture and discussion based. very little assignments given in class. All exams were papers that were about 1-2 pages. For final, there was only a project which you need to present in class. He very critical with grading his paper. He is a good professor and passionate about what he teaches. The textbook is needed!",1
"I took Spanish for 2 years in high school and passed with A's and B's. So when I had to take a language for my degree requirement, I thought Spanish would be a breeze. Boy was I WRONG! Even with my prior knowledge I was confused and he moves very quickly. SO MANY ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS. He takes points off if you don't show up (even when you are sick)",0
"Dr. Hill is a good lecturer and is very willing to help. His exams are somewhat difficult, and you will be graded on spelling and grammar. If you read the textbook, attend lectures to get the rest of the material, do the practice exams, and ask questions during the review session, then you should be able to pass the course. ",1
"She knows her material, but not how to teach or grade it. She grades on page space filled rather than quality of content with notes and will give normal scantron tests at home with confusing questions on material not covered in class at all.",0
Cage is a disorganized teacher. I'll give him a little credit because he was switched to the class last minute. He loves to pick on people. He assigned a project and changed the rubric multiple times. Pop quizzes are all over the place pertaining to information learned in the beginning of the semester and he won't give you any idea what's on them.,0
"My favorite professor I've ever had! This class was so interesting and educational. You DO have to show up because you won't pass the exams if you don't have good notes, but honestly I was *excited* to go to his class. There is a reason Jorgen is rated good; he is passionate, honest, and inspiring.",1
"Deb is my favorite teacher I've had at Duke so far. Her French is fluent and crystal clear. She is very nice and she puts all her effort into making class a fascinating an educational time. As long as you participate and do all the readings, her class is fairly straightforward. After this semester, my French is a lot better.",1
"I really enjoyed Sexuality in the Americas.  The readings are engaging and his lectures are focused and helpful to use on the assignments.  He really rewards creativity, which is a nice change from most mundane history classes.  He's also really interesting as a person, so I'd definitely recommend stopping by just to chat!",1
Very opinionated and rude. Does not care what he says. Makes you feel horrible after leaving his class,0
Did not enjoy this class at all.  Could have easily done it at home on my own.  She uses sparknotes!!!  Not a good teacher!  Did not help when asked.  Would never take her class again.,0
awful teacher. would never take this class again,0
"Margarita is a great teacher.  She has passion for the Spanish language and is very sweet.  She wants questions and answers them very clearly.  Expect online homework every night, usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.  Three very short papers due over the term, most had to be 200 words all in spanish.  Would take her again.",1
He is a great professor and easy to pass. His tests are open book and open notes so you will pas his tests with your eyes closed and if you get a low grade in your test he will give you extra credit so you can get back those points you miss in your test. He is an amazing advisor as well. If you are planning to study law he will help you. Take him.,1
"Dr. Whitt is a great instructor! I took him for Probability & Statistics Enhanced! I passed with an A! Come to class, pay attention to the lectures, do the homework, pass all the exams, and you'll be fine! It's a self pacing course, so I finished a month early! I recommend you all to take him!",1
"If you are a student with accommodations do not take this professor ! When simply informing her about my accommodations of extra time she acted completely unprofessional and did not understand why I needed this extra time, when clearly I have a reason approved by the SSD office! Terrible experience all around!",0
"I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and guess that her summertime switch to Canvas screwed things up, but it doesn't account for all of the negligence. As an online teacher, it is paramount to be responsive to emails. She has been thoroughly unresponsive and inaccessible. +tomorrow is the final day, and she's graded one assignment.",0
"ME 340 with Professor Brennan was one of the best classes I've taken at Penn State.  He is very clear in everything from his lectures to his expectations in terms of assignments.  He's also incredibly motivational; I always looked forward to going to class because even though the book is a little dry, he made the course interesting and enjoyable.",1
"film studies was much harder than I expected. Class is enjoyable, because you only watch movies. Rob is fairly annoying because he talks constantly throughout them, but maybe just a pet peeve of mine. He had great knowledge and experience on the subject though. Tests come from the book and are quite challenging because he doesn't cover it in class",1
This class was fun. Fun labs and kahoots for lecture. She was my clinical instructor as well. Shes great at explaining things and 1 on 1 conversation. Ask her about Terri time. Study the book and ati as much as you can.,1
"Holly does not teach the class. She spends the whole class talking about her personal life and will spend 10 minutes at the end of class barely teaching coding, and keeps us 10 minutes late after class because she doesn't want to teach during the actual class. She doesn't care about shy people and grades extremely hard. Lynda will be your friend.",0
"Amber doesn't care about you., don't go in thinking she does. She likes maybe 3 students and HATES another 3. Just pray you aren't one she hates. Cause she doesn't even try to pretend.",0
"Do yourself a favor and STEER CLEAR of this course/professor. She has terrible rapport with students. Unpredictable, unkind. And this coming from someone who did well in her class.",0
"So half the time she doesn't ever know what she's teaching us. We ask her a question and she says ""Uhm, let me think about that for a second... nope I don't really have an answer for you. Sorry."" How professional. We also wasted a lot of time in class talking about stuff in her slides that she ended up saying is not important to the test. AVOID HER",0
"I enjoy going to her class. She is gauranteed to make you laugh more than once in class.  She is very easy going.  She will occasionally get pissed about people talking, but it is a lot of fun.  We usually leave class 10 to 20 minutes early.  If you need to take intermediate math...take gordon!!!",1
"One of the best professors at MDC, he truly goes out of his way to help his students. He will give extra credit to boost your grade since not everyone is good test taker. It is for that reason he gives open book and open notes test, and mentions the questions in the lectures. I definitely recommend him.",1
"She is a great professor, you wont regret taking her class, she's easy to contact outside of class, and really cares for her students, Take her class!!",1
"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",0
"Excellent professor that is completely aware of today's student's situation. He understands the high costs of textbook so he does not require any textbook for his lectures. He explains real world important info and tips on starting a firm, saving and investing money, and biz choices that are extremely useful. AND NO CELL PHONES!",1
Great teacher and always willing to help.,1
English is very difficult to understand at times and is a tough grader. Teaching style didn't make a lot of sense and had to essentially teach myself many of the key concepts. Can be rude without knowing it but has the best of intentions to be as  friendly as possible.,0
"Amy is AWESOME. The classroom atmosphere was fun and relaxed, but also serious about the subject matter. Amy is very helpful and patient. Lots of activities. Show up and do the work, participate, and you are sure to enjoy!",1
"Dr. Lane has his moments where he rushes through certain topics. However, getting one on one helps a lot. He knows and loves physics and he is simply trying to spread his love around. By hearing him explain physics, I have learned to love it myself. There is no attendance requirements nor are their tests.",1
"Brilliant theoretical math professor, but can't really teach lower level math. His accent makes following already shaky lectures very difficult. Asking questions is pointless, he doesn't understand you any better than you understand him. If you already know calculus or read the book, you can scratch by.",0
"Don't buy the book; he will give you the notes in class. Three quizzes, midterm, final, 2 pg paper & 5 pg term paper. You will need to memorize certain words for the exam; some concepts are going to be used in subsequent exams. He is really chill & brings snacks when you watch Presumed Innocent in class. Easy A if you study for exams!",1
The most boring class and very essay filled. She goes essay crazy. And too much reading,0
"His lectures were extremely interesting and plenty of stories from experience, but I do not feel that my grade represented what was learned in the class: half of final grade came from test, and the rest from papers and projects that I felt were confusingly assigned and unfairly graded.",1
"Ms. Moody is hands down on of the kindest professors I've ever had. She wants nothing more than to see you succeed. There are SO MANY extra credit opportunities, and she is always accessible outside of class. Every single time you turn in an assignment, expect a full page's worth of constructive feedback, and snacks for the whole class. 10/10",1
"Reddy is an awesome teacher and is very kind and seems to enjoy biology. The class is fairly easy. Don't skip class because there's clicker questions each class (download the app). Also DO cogbooks because it's a lot of points! The tests can have tricky questions but just really study the lectures and cogbooks and you'll be fine! Easy A, good class",1
"No calculator allowed at all. Homework every night, due the following Monday. About a chapter a week done. Lots of examples and notes in class. Thankfully an older textbook. Tests are necessarily hard but go over every concept in the chapters.",1
Nice to get some real-world insights on strategy.  Very straighforward class.,1
She's a great professor! It's a pretty easy class but you learn a lot. She's extremely caring and knowledgeable about the subject. She wrote the text book and it has review questions in the back. Take her!!,1
i took this class and was so afraid of not passing it .i hate math and was never good in it. this teacher is the best teacher i had ever met in my whole life she is so nice and helpful . just follow what she says and u will get A in all your math classes not only hers. if u show up to class every thing will go smooth and easy.,1
"Dr. Hoffman is a positive, quirky, kind individual and genuinely cares about his students and their career path. I recommend recording lectures on your phone, and listening to it when going over slides. Exams are similar to practice questions, BCH369 consist of 5 exams, BCH370 consist of 3 exams and 4 homework assignments. I wish I had him again!",1
"6 reading reflections, 1 roundtable, 1 additional book to read for the midterm. The class was more about Native American law, and Carma did not return any papers, so I did not know my grade til grades were posted at the end of the term. That being said, Carma invited many guest speakers and was very caring and enthusiastic about her class.",1
awful awful awful.  could not understand her at all. she goes way too fast. knows subject so well but does not know how to present it to students. DO NOT TAKE HER FOR FINANCE.,0
"Shimul definitely cares about his students' success in the class. He cuts out the lowest tests, quizzes, and homeworks, making it easier to get an A. That said, his accent is very heavy and he can be hard to understand sometimes, but his grading system makes up for it in my opinion.",1
"Terri Renner is by far the worst teacher I have ever had at IU. She does not understand that life happens and some students need exceptions. Literally had 3 seizures and did not get any extension or anything. SHE IS HORRIBLE! SO much homework, and exams do not reflect the book or homework. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR EVER!!! You will regret it!",0
"Mrs. Ebron is a very competent professor, very helpful. She will give evryone a chance to do better. Very personable. I dd miss one single class with her, that is to say how interesting her classes were. Will definetely recommend her.",1
"FAVE professor! He is very nice &easy going guy. Makes terms and processes of the human body VERY easy to understand &will go over anything if you just ask! Def uses the textbook. 12 quizzes and 4 exams, takes away 2 lowest quizzes! REALLY helps your grade. You just need to take notes and study, only goes over what is needed. Wish he taught A&P.",1
"Ms. Jackson Is a great Professor and the best Com teacher of all time, all you have to do is take the weekly quizzes, do well on the speeches and you'll get an A.",1
The best professor I ever had. He basically designed a class that included the most interesting things about the entire CS curriculum.,1
"Prof. Scaltriti was honestly THE best Professor I have ever had. He is a native speaker with a sexy accent, so that made class more enjoyable. On the plus side, he is very handsome and that was a good motivation to study Italian. I hope I will have him next year! He is THE man!",1
"For his theo 103 class, just make sure you read and take notes in class because all of the quizzes are online and are based on the notes you take in class. He also is a really nice guy and offers extra credit. Do all of this and you will get an A.",1
I actually retook this class because I had missed a lot of online homework so I was confused when the teacher was a different person. But I'm really happy I retook it because I got to learn so much more and from a neurologist's perspective instead!! If I had questions she'd give me great answers and she was really passionate about her subject.,1
Heavy homework and long labs but they were fairly graded with feedback which I appreciate. Lectures too long. Cared about the student experience and spent time upgrading the lab equipment. Would recommend. Definitely learned how to program the AB PLC.,1
"She's literally thee best. Any questions you have she answers them with no problem at all. very easy to understand, makes everything related to something you know so you can understand the concept better. I would take her again",1
"He is HORRIBLE! Do not take this class! He has a syllabus, but no due dates, and he expects you to submit things on time. Then he does not remind you if something is due.",0
"Lectures/notes are long and he talks fast but he is a great teacher and explains very well, Extra credit available, has some good jokes.",1
"Great professor. One foot in the academic world and one foot in the world he teaches about, fully present in both. Knows his stuff front and back and answers questions effectively. Generous when helping students meet the demands of his class- make sure to communicate. Funny if you catch his jokes- keeps it interesting. Logical, professional, sharp.",1
"I went to her office hours, asked a valid question, and then laughed at me in front of my classmates. The class itself isn't hard, the issue is her. I can't tell you how many times I've woken up on a Sunday morning to an email saying we have a pre-lab quiz due that night. I would call myself a very capable person, but Vanderhoning makes 0 sense.",0
"She is a kind woman, but not a good professor. She would often go way off topic and we would hardly cover any material in the little time we had. I basically felt as though I had to teach myself accounting. When students would ask questions I felt as though she wasn't understanding what they were asking and she would clearly give wrong answers.",0
"Professor Endlich is such a sweet professor and really caring, she gives you a clear criteria of what and how she is grading, also the work in class is really easy, there might be a lot of work but it's really simple and as long as you keep up with it and put commitment to the class.",1
"Professor Deason is awesome! I always learn something in her lectures, and she is very knowledgeable about social psychology. Tests are easy if you do the study guide she provides and look back on her powerpoints. There are small assignments to keep you on track; not too difficult. Overall, take her. You won't regret it.",1
"The material isnt hard he just assigns a lot of homework each week. Easy A if you dont mind spending 4+ hours in SAL each week. Oh I forgot, his midterms are notoriously hard... good luck!",0
"Very great professor. She is lecture heavy, however the lectures are extremely interesting and engaging. The tests aren't bad , 40 questions with a study guide given that has everything you need to know on it. Don't read the book, 500 pages of textbook are covered and she wants you to read along with her lectures,but tests aren't based on readings.",1
Professor Marni is a great lab instructor. Provided good feedback on labs and would let you fix them to get full credit. Since the pandemic Labs were extremely lengthy but she was good at helping during office hours.,1
"Does not care about students at all. I told her my bf was diagnosed with cancer and that I'd have to miss one class a week to go to his doctor's appointments. I asked to do more work to make up absences, she told me to drop because I'd never pass. Thanks for being so understanding in the worst time of my life Terri.",0
The man.,1
"Dr. Hutchens is a pretty cool guy. He gives examples to help explain the topics he teaches. If you read the text and take notes, this class will be super easy!! There are no quizzes in class, but there is one every week on D2L plus the class discussions on D2L. The quizzes are fairly easy if you read the chapter.",1
"She's really nice and very fashionable! She talks to the students in class about whatever they want to talk about really, and to me that's a great way to practice conversation because you're discussing something you're actually interested in. The tests were fair and she's very helpful",1
"He would be better as a guidance counselor then anything. He was willing to help students on rewrites if they didn't do a good job on their paper. However, he was very strict on grading. He talked a lot, and the class was a very bad experience. My recommendation is to NOT take the class from him, unless you are a history buff like him.",0
Echo a lot of the earlier comments. He was terrible in the online format.,0
"If you show him you care and try, he will help you out with the material and with your grade. His lectures are funny and he usually doesn't bore you or make you stay longer than you need to.",1
I really did not understand what was going on in class half of the time. She didn't really explain things well and when reviewing the notes I had a very hard time understanding her own power points. She's a lovely woman and she was around to help but even then it was a hard class to understand.,0
"Took his 8 week class last semester. Seems like a lot of work in the beginning but as assignments get completed class gets easy. There are 2 quizzes per chapter plus a ""think piece"". 2 analysis papers are required but he explains to us how to do it and helps out! Checks in every mid week to make sure the class is on board! Great teacher !",1
"Good guy, bad professor. He asks very passive aggressive questions and makes students feel bad when they dont have the same political views as him. He cancels class a lot, and his lectures are very long, boring, and repetitive. Easy grade for busy work and can find answers because he doesnt teach what is on the tests.",0
"He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.",0
"This class is a decent amount of work, very manageable, however the teacher is very rude.",0
"Just the worst class I've taken at Duke. It's so poorly structured. Homework is arbitrarily long, exams are unpredictable, no supporting materials or practice exams. I was depressed for most of it; I just hope I haven't failed.",0
"Literally one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Very unfair with grading assignments. His standards, requirements, and grading techniques changed based on whatever his mood inspired. Narcissistic, condescending, lacks experience. Contradicts himself often. I do not recommend taking a class with Hass.",0
"I took this class for fun and I feel like it wasted my time. I got good grades but the load is ridiculous . This class is introductory, but does not go into enough detail. The assignment expectation seemed to change throughout the semester and feedback was incredibly vague. I could have gotten more information from a hefty google search.",0
"I took this professor a year ago, but felt the urge to inform incoming students because of how terrible this professor is. I ended up dropping his course after 2 exams because I was failing and he would not help me if I had questions. I ended up taking Chem 1 and passed with an A, yet intro is supposed to introduce you to chem. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!",0
She is so passionate and so knowledgable about the social work field. She is very hands on and open minded. She makes the classroom a safe environment to talk about anything and everything. After taking her class i decided to become a social work major,1
"Unbelievably rude and unapproachable professor. Claims he wants to quit his job because his averages are so low.. but doesn't try to change his methods. 10 people dropped his class in the first three weeks. Makes unnecessary rude comments about not caring if you fail. Also, he only knows how to answers questions and does NOT have a proper lecture.",0
"I dont know what he is like in person but his online class sucks. He has two sites that for assignments which can be confusing, and no notifications for when he makes a new assignment. For due dates some quizzes don't have a due date while others do which is misleading. Also you don't know if a certain assignment has a due date until it is too late",0
"Very rude, very condescending, help was nonexistent. He did nothing to actually help his students. Threw a tantrum in the beginning of the semester and cancelled class because we werent asking enough questions. Very unprofessional. If I could give zeros, I would.",0
"Worst professor at ASU. Might have been good in a post-graduate class but for a 300 level, it goes way too in-depth. I work in the industry and none of the things he teaches actually apply.",0
One of the most well rounded and knowledgeable people you will ever meet.,1
"He had some pretty cheesy math jokes.  Also, he liked to explain the history of what we were learning.  However, that was all he explained.  He didn't explain anything that he did which was hard for someone who hadn't taken a Calc class before.  Also, his weekly quizzes were different from what we did homework on and studied in class.",0
"HORRIBLE communicator, never answers emails and is very unclear is specifying what he wants for assignments. Never take his class if you want to keep your sanity. The workload is huge and he is far too particular when grading. No creativity at all in the assignments because if you don't do it to his liking, you will get a bad grade.",0
"The class isnt hard, but you do have to understand the material. His HW is useless for the exams, and is also very long and painful. 8-10 pages of HW reliant solely on excel or R, Rstudio is annoying when he doesnt teach you how to use them properly. His exams are mostly like the reviews. Do well on the 2 midterms, skip the final and get an A.",1
"took her for kickboxing, super fun. got a good sweat, she's funny and makes you feel comfortable. Lots of extra credit if you miss classes",1
"Talks entirely too much during class (especially for a 400-level one), talking points are incredibly repetitive, extremely flaky.  He does have extensive and interesting knowledge of critical theory, though.",0
Was very helpful and provided fantastic feedback to assignments. Class was great and she made it fun.,1
"You don't want Char for BIO lab. She's constantly unclear in her communication, difficult to get ahold of, and assignments are confusing. She's snarky and will call you out and be directly rude to you with no rationale. If you sit in the front of her class and laugh at her dry humor, you can get on her side a little. Overall do not recommend.",0
"I took online, had he is VERY hard to reach by email, he'd take more than a week and a half to respond; sometimes the thing I needed from him was already passed. 4 quizzes,2 exams, 5 discussion boards, and 8-10 page paper. There is an extra credit class on a Saturday; just go it is super chill. QUIZZES ARE HARD, READ BOOK!!!",1
"4 people in our class of 32 passed Professor Konya's Calculus 1 class. I understand that this is not an easy subject, but when 8% of the class receives passing grades it is no longer about how the students are failing to understand the concepts, but rather about how the teacher is failing to teach.",0
"Worst teacher I've ever had, homework is worth the most in her class and she grades it extremely hard, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR HER CLASS,  I showed up for every class, did every homework, and passed every test with a B- or higher. I'm a honor student and she failed me",0
"I took the online psych1 class. Bernadette is one of the kindest teachers i've ever had. Her feedback is great and she even adds "":-)"" to emails which I thought was cute. That being said you will do A LOT of group work in this class. You are basically at the mercy of your group members. Her exams are also really tough too. Expect to feel anxious.",1
"I dont know what everyone is complaining about. Tuppet is one of the best psyc professors here. She is approachable, helpful, and hilarious! Her tests are hard, but they are fair. You get out what you put in, keep that in mind when you read the negative reviews. Pay attention in class, stay current on the readings and you will do just fine.",1
"Dr. Sullivan is a nice person, but just not a good prof. His expectations are too vague, he never responds to emails, and his lectures are incredibly boring. He only grades you by two exams and a four-page paper (and on a HUGE curve). The only reason I took this class is because it was required. I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Nora was hands down the nicest professor I've ever had. She is always ready to help you with your lab or direct you in the right way. This class is all lab, 2 exams and a report so make sure you come to class and turn in the homework! Find a table you can work with and split up the group work and you'll be fine! Great class! Worth it!",1
Worst Prof EVER!!!,0
Needs everything to be very specific. do not be general ever!,1
"Remember English 102 is accelerating class. You have to run for assignments, essays and quiz. I took this class and I always work very hard for this class. Ms. Magallon is very helpful teacher to those who work hard and regular in class. I learn a lot from this class. She is amazing. If you work hard then u will definitely pass this class as I did.",1
"FInishing my third year in this field and she is truly one of the driest lectures and most useless teachers I have had. Reviewing for tests is impossible, between the half empty slides with color clashing font, and spending hours just trying to find readings she gives using only a name and date. Shoots down questions in-lecture, truly the worst.",0
"I like Dustin as a person but his class has horrible grade structure! 90% of your grade will be based on questions and problems that he has never shown you in class. And there is no homework, no tutor, cant see what you did wrong on the exams and Dustin is no help besides telling you that you suck pretty much. No joke, I hope you the best of luck",0
"Holly was the most difficult Professor I have ever had at SCAD. Her class was full of unclear homework and project assignments. She not only wants you to be an expert at using the programs, but wants your work to be grad level design work, ridiculous for an intro class. We should not have to use YouTube to teach a class we're paying someone $4k for",0
I LOVE PROFESSOR CARINA!!! she's soo awesome she lets you be yourself all the time even in your essays. She only gives short assignments every week and gives some reading that ARE NOT BORING! and she gave a short report by the end of the semester and THAT' IT! participate and be yourself and do small work and that's it. She's really funny + awesome,1
His tests are fair but the final was a killer. He went over a 'review' that was not on the final. Gives pop quizzes that will add 1-3 points to final grade; it doesn't really help. Doesn't bend grading scale. I'm a Sr and this is my 1st C. Reads off of pwrpt slides and you don't get anything from showing up. I would not recommend.,0
"Hope you can teach yourself Excel and Access. No lectures, no notes, no discussions, grading: lots of issues with items on quizzes and the case studies (heavy points!) that were not covered in the textbook. I had to email the instructor weekly or more (not something I would do in any other class ever).",0
"NEVER REPLIES TO YOUR EMAILS !! Beside that though, he's a really good professors because he makes you do applications that you would implement in real life for the labs and exams.",1
She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :( She's not a great teacher. Don't take her.,0
Hard class but Crawley makes things very interesting!,1
"Tough, but worth it. Welcome to the real world here people. She's the real deal and will have you ready for a Masters program.",1
"Meh. Her lectures were very ambiguous. She made already difficult concepts very hard to understand. I do think she knows a lot about plants and fungus, but just does a horrible job explaining it to the class.",0
"She is very nice and extremely helpful. She had help sessions for us before our final exam and essay. She also would send sources that she thought would be good for your essay directly to you. Class was not too hard either but a lot of reading assignments were given. Overall, Gender in Toyland did not meet my expectations but she made up for it.",1
"he really knows the information and can facilitate philosophical discussion well. papers make up most if not all of the grades, so definitely work hard on them. he is super accessible outside of work and cares about your well-being in general and in the class.",1
"Don't take her if you are lazy. She isn't going to spoon feed you, or give easy A's but definitely prepares you for tougher courses. Studying every day and working on the problems is a MUST. Also go to her office hours, and have thick skin. She can be a little rude but means well, she really wants students to understand and learn the right way.",1
"Was really excited to take Leverson as a professor because I had heard that she was great. Was really disappointed because I genuinely didn't learn that much from her, all she did was read off of powerpoints and the study guides that she claimed would be helpful did nothing for the test. Will not take another class of hers.",0
"For everyone bashing on Heather LaPoint, you clearly have not discovered the magic of prep u. If you are not prepared to put in more work than usual and dedicate quite a bit of time to a NURSING course, than maybe thats your problem not Heathers. If you are struggling and find her material difficult than bless your soul for junior year.",1
Love her!!! She enjoys what she is teaching. Tries to make the class more interesting by adding little activities. She is great!,1
"Very hard. He is not willing to work with students, and not willing to admit he is wrong. Expects a lot from all students and if you are not willing to work very very hard you will not do well in his course. His lectures were good, and I think I learned a lot, just feel like he could have been just as good of a professor without being so hard.",0
"Great professor. During lectures, he taught with such clarity that I scarcely needed to look at the book. However, he's a bit difficult to engage with outside of the lectures. If you need help with a problem, it's probably best to tell him about it ahead of time. He's also a tough grader on exams, taking off way too much for minor missteps.",1
"Great teacher, but tests are over the top. I'm used to getting 90+ on a test that I study decently for, but with her tests, I spend two days studying and wind up with mid 80's. But she knows her stuff, is very helpful, and gives great feedback.",1
"This was an amazing class. Taking notes is essential, but Mr. Wells makes it easy and interesting to pay attention to lectures.",1
Not very good ,0
"I love Abdo! She explains grammar very well and helps you understand the material. Homework is for a completion grade, one partner projects, extra credit opportunity, and short/ easy quizzes. She's a real gem and is funny. Let's students teach the class at times and has class discussions instead of just lecturing. ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT UTSA",1
"Would ask questions in class/during test and he would say ""I didn't write the powerpoint"" or ""didn't write the test"". Skips through powerpoints all the time. He just doesn't teach well. Obsessed with teaching JMP software but you can't use it for tests?? Nice guy but not a good teacher. AP Stat is only reason I understand the class",0
"Great professor, great feedback and easily accessible outside of class times",1
"She is such A DOLL, I really enjoy her and the class. If you do the work you well pass, if you need help she will help you because she want you to pass and do the work. Make sure you follow her direction if she changes the assignment up because you well lost point but if you do that it pretty easy A.",1
I went to Dr. Brooks and told him he could teach the class in Chinese and I would understand it better.  This class is difficult and will challenge even the best student.  Dr. Brooks has a tremendous amount of real world experience executing significant derivative trades and incorporates this into his lectures.  This class is exceptional.,1
"Dr. Burd is an amazing professor. She does what ever she can to ensure that her students pass. She is the only professor that teaches Nutrition so if you are a nursing major you must take her. It may be helpful to go to tutoring a couple times for this class, but as long as you understand the equations, and read the notes you will do fine. ",1
"Anne Paulet pretty much just reads from her slide notes the entire period, rarely taking a break to answer questions or have a class discussion. She assigns WAY too many group projects that require a LOT of time at home to complete. I feel like I could get the same education by just reading her power points at home. AWFUL TEACHER.",0
"great guy, very helpful, very understanding, comes to the bar crawl with the students at the end of the semester",1
"terrible time with this guy in LFS 250 and 350, 250 was the worst class I ever took, waste of time 4 hours gone a week just like that and the course was for a whole year, absolutely useless and nothing taught, very opinionated and we do stupid activities as if we are 5 years old, same in 350 if you value your time and brain cells don't do it",0
"Tolich isn't the most exciting guy, but that's not what you need from your physics professor. Lectures are clear and informative. He's accessible outside of class and seems to genuinely care about students. Was really helpful when I missed a midterm due to illness. Solid choice for sure.",1
"She was good, but I found that she inserted her own opinions too often.",1
"I was so excited to take this class because i find the topic so interesting. However, this class ruined the subject for me. Although I learned some cool stuff, the tests are incredibly hard no matter if you go to all classes and study. She goes very into depth into topics that don't even relate to the subject. My least favorite class this semester.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Very confusing and all over the place kind of teaching. His teaching is to give you 2 different textbooks and watch you tube video lectures-which he states not to pay too much attention to! Tests-essays on 450 pages of info but no specifics The ""reviews"" for the quiz/test are paragraphs and can't relate to the texts.",0
I took OS with him awhile back and have still have no knowledge of operating systems what so ever. He is a professor that specializes in networking and he seems to only teach this in what ever class he teaches. Not a tough class just wish I learned what was supposed to be taught.,0
Awful professor very push along kind of guy not very interested in a student personal success as opposed to maintaining his goofy persona. If you are a serious dancer take another professors class...,0
"Professor Weis is one of my only favorite classes , she makes class worth it you actually learn something , she doesnt just put the notes on the smart board she explains it and puts in her own personal examples and jokes she very caring and well would recommend ! Would take her class again if I could",1
Goodyear made the topic extremely interesting.  I would take a class with him again.,1
"Tough Professor util you figure out his style, then he becomes easy.  This was my second class with him and I was ready for what was expected before I logged in the first tiem",1
"I have always been a straight A student, and I wish I would've found the website before taking this class. Currently, I am in HIS1112 with Dr. Crews. He provides no help, ridiculous midterm and final, no study guides or preparation. This was my very first college class and thought it was going to be the death of me.",0
"Finance is a hard subject. 10 homeworks online, three tests and a final. Also small current event project.",1
Ms. Walkrt is the best teacher I have had at Moorpark College. She is hilarious and so sweet! Her class is actually fun and talking to her is so easy. She is very flexible on turn in dates but don't make it a habit. I hope I get her for my other business class as well!,1
"The only way I got an A in the class is by completing every extra credit opportunity possible.  You will get pages of Emails every week. You will be asked to watch hours of online lectures. You will NOT do well on his tests. You will spend hours and hours outside of class working on your project, so make sure that you like everyone in your group.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAMP! If he is the only professor available, wait until next semester. He seems great and wonderful until after the last day of dropping the class before having to pay. On one writing I decided to try and be a good student and find the entire book of the section the reading came out of and he counted off, DONT TAKE HIM!!",0
This is the best teacher at NOVA. NO other teacher can come close to being as good as she is. She is Nice and relaxed. She does not expect you to remember everything but does expect you to try your best. As long as you do your best you will get an A in the class. Another good thing is she pretty hot too. I would recommend this class to all.,1
"Goes through lessons pretty slowly, I personally got bored. Gives practice problems then will go over them in class. He's hilarious making him fun to listen to. Will answer questions but only gets annoyed when it's something he's already gone over. Tests are your only grades but are not difficult if you've done practice problems.",1
"He is ready to help but doesn't really help. He is too specific about everything and writes wrong emails every time he sends out an email or posts something on CC. After taking his class, I feel I lost confidence in Biology although that's my major.",0
Not an easy A but truly learned a lot. Tests were straight from his lectures. Lectures were great and made a 4 hour class durable. I would recommend this professor. Take good notes and study them for the exams and you should be fine!,1
Professor Beato made IDE very interesting and enjoyable. It was my favorite class this semester. His lectures are informative and I feel like I learned a lot. Beato also cares about the success of each student and tries hard to help everyone out. He took a lot of time to help my lab partner and I when we struggled.,1
"He will give you blatantly wrong answers that tutors will correct (once he's walked away), and refused to explain in depth (""I just have years of experience""). His class was scheduled to start on a Thursday (according to Pima's My Courses tab), and he still counted everyone as absent for Tuesday (the intended? date). I will never take him again.",0
"I took Professor Chris for the Winter semester. He was fun, enthusiastic, and his lectures were awesome. He gave cool study guides before the exams which were multiple choice and true/false. Prepare yourself to do outlines for your speeches which are timed, which was the toughest part of the class for me. Overall it was an excellent class!!!",1
She doesn't give feedback or let you see what you got wrong on quizzes. This is especially a problem because she has made mistakes grading. She gets annoyed when students ask questions. I basically taught myself using the online homework and book.,0
Hate all the class activities waste of time and exhausting just stick to material keep it simple,0
"I enjoyed the course subject, but Dr. Richardson is a bit difficult. Receiving graded papers can take upwards to 4 weeks. The grading rubric and feedback for the papers is vague making it difficult to improve from week to week. The group project assignments are tough to coordinate and complete in 1 week with the amount of research that is expected.",0
Professor Fry did a great job teaching statistics.  His grading is fair and he is very helpful.  He brought Scratch Cup-cakes for our final.,1
Leftists will love him. He only sees his side of things and grades accordingly. Will never take his classes again.,0
"Awesome teacher, really knows her stuff.  Listen, read, take notes and study this class is not easy but it is doable if you put some work into it....Then again if you don't want to work for it maybe your looking at the wrong profession.",1
"First totally online classes, and still learned a lot. This professor is very chill and realistic about homework and quizzes. pay attention and do the quizzes you will pass.",1
"Nothing on the exams was from thre study guied. He teaches sitting up front, hardly moves, and has a monotone voice. He got information across-- but it wasnt as easy to conceieve as i would of liked",0
"There are no curves in this class, but you can bump up a grade letter by doing online discussions and one-page essays.  I recommend that you study hard on the midterm or you'll end up with a grade you don't want at the end of the quarter.  There are a few attendance questions that will be on the test.  Lectures and audios are also uploaded online.",1
He teaches a class on how to teach and he totally sucks at teaching himself,0
This is very smart and knowlegeable professor. Of course he has accent but willing to help and with very broad knowledge in vitually all areas of business. It is good to have this type of professor at this university.,1
"This class had a lot of work. Mr. Dawson was great though and was always available to help. If you read the textbook, you'll be fine, but you should only take this course if you have an interest in astronomy. Pros: You'll learn a lot of cool stuff. Cons: So much work, I don't know how the accelerated students do it.",1
"Uses Matlab to avoid teaching. Super nice and has a lot of talk but cannot explain the topics. I think she is still faking it till she can make it. I had to retake course on transfer. Stay away. I don't understand why she was hired, they clearly did not ask students their thoughts.",0
"Wasn't a fan of the class, she did not seem to care for many people had her select favorites, not a good class for a Caucasian male(history of urban america) class was very anti white",0
"Very very hard! Try to avoid her econ 490 class! Her 300 classes are fine, but 490 is totally a nightmare!",0
"He is the worst teacher possible. All he want's to do is talk about himself. His quizzes and tests are based on novel readings, that have NOTHING to do with sociology. Tests and quizzes are short answer and essay. They are extremely specific questions and if you don't read you will not pass.",0
"He's a good teacher. He will help you, although sometimes it seems like he doesn't really like you. Definitely don't go to class late. He hates that, and he makes sure you know. He really knows CAD, and is a great resource. I would recommend him.",1
"Dr. Molina is something else. He has an cool personality but he CAN NOT teach, especially not in the summer. He skips over information & it will make u confused. He makes u memorize EVERYTHING and is a hard grader. Drop him if u can! Tests aren't BAD but be prepared for everything even if he says it wont be on there.. it will be. Hated this class!",0
"Nice guy, wants to do examples but gets sidetracked and forgets to finish example. His test are dialed down from material covered.  Overall, class is bs and shouldn't be required to graduate!!",0
"I don't why there is no option for choosing 185A as his class. I took 185A this quarter, which is complex analysis. He was a funny guy that alway talked about off topic material. He wrote down ever follow his previous notes during the class meetings, which is very useless unless you really understand it. Two midterms and 1 final paper. Aviod him.",0
"I love Dr. Childs, especially for logic.  She makes it easy to understand.",1
She really helped me out with deciding my classes for the next sememster. She's nice and gave me some suggestions that I never considered before.,1
Prof Mason met with us individually at the beginning of the semester and really took the time to get to know us and where everyone served their mission and stuff. Topics of the class were really varied between culture and politics. The textbook is really boring and so are some of the readings but the class is interesting and really easy/engaging,1
"Same weekly workload, so you know what to expect. He's eager to help if you ask him questions. Midterm is 30%, final is 40%, but if you do better on your final than midterm, then the final replaces your midterm grade. This seriously helped me bring my B to an A+. Definitely hard work and time consuming, but for sure my favorite math class taken.",1
OK. I took this class because of the ratings of this professor.. BOY what a mistake! Weeks 2-10 you are required to write a 3 page essay EACH week plus discussions with 3 replies min 10 sentences... then you do a 7-8 page research paper at end. no tests..im not one to shy away from work but this is crazy!! dropping this class!!,0
He's not an easy professor. He will call you out during class if you or not paying attention. But you will learn a lot about history. Highly recommend.,1
"MOST BORING PERSON TO EVER LIVE. monotone lectures are better than white noise for sleeping, reads the textbook, and does exercises, no initiative to ask students if they're learning, don't even read the chat if people have questions! HW and Exams are via 3rd party. no need to attend cuz he can care less how many ppl join, hell teach an empty class",0
Best professor I have ever had in my entire life!  Took him for both 351 and 352,1
"He shows up to class unprepared. He teaches as though he just learned the material before coming to class. Tries to make music mathematical and perfect, it pisses me off. All around he’s a great and knowledgeable teacher and besides his mistake of worshipping atonal music, he’s amazing.",0
I dont like math,1
"Easy class. One thing I enjoyed was the topics we covered and the television shows we watched. Take this class, even if you aren't a psych major.",1
"The class itself if so easy.  All you have to do is read some ancient story and then he'll discuss it in the next class period. There are mini quizzes everyday which are simple. All you do is watch movies. He cracks down on all cell phone usage, even though his goes off all the time. Wont let you leave until he dismisses you.",0
"you have to read the book and half way pay attention in class and you should do ok.  He grade on a cerve which is good and no longer does essay questions, atleast not on the 101 corse.  He is cool, laid back, and you miss alot of classes, but he is cool otherwise.",1
Great prof,1
"The quizzes give you 90 seconds to complete each question and if you start a discussion she will grade it right away. Discussions are graded as soon as you submit your post, I lost most of my points when she graded the assignment 5 days before the due date and hadn't responded to other people yet and she refused to change it on the due date",0
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
Really cool guy. Have him for teacher and advisor and has always been very helpful in all aspects of learning. Cares less about memorizing stats formulas and focuses more on how it will help you in other classes. Definitely the best professor I've met so far.,1
Jeri is an extremely fair grader and you dont need to be an artist in order to pass her class. She understands that everyone has different skill levels and as long as you try your hardest she will give you an A. Shes also extremely organized and accessible outside of class!,1
This prof is unorganized! His slides aren't labelled properly and he is horrible at explaining material in a clear and concise manner. I would not recommend this course.,0
"I found his class to be incredibly boring. The movies and discussion guides did not help me in any way other than wanting to not show up. His class is simple and easy to pass, but his teaching style is very uninteresting.",0
Not my favourite prof for a course that requires clear explanations. His slides are very detailed and he tries to engage the class but he's not an interesting lecturer. His assignments seem straight forward until he tries to explain how to complete them; very vague and confusing instructions which makes them harder than they should be.,0
"kageyama is cool. He may be a bit out dated, but i think that is ok for an introductory class. He is well organized and gives out a collection of knowledge synthesized from various sources including some of his own research papers derived from conducted inquiry. +++",1
"I normally wait until the end of the semester to write these but I just cant wait: this lady is way too picky. Ive gotten into it with her a few times bc of her unfair grading. She overcomplicates everything. Claims to not have gotten my emails, has yet to fix my attendance when I was in the hospital. She does too much. Condescending & boring.",0
"Proga is very passionate about what he teaches and is a very kind guy. He wants to ensure you get the material and the class is comfortable for you. There is no homework its just 3 tests and one gets dropped. He does love it when people participate, but he won't scold you if you don't. Good class to take for non-stem majors for the science credit.",1
"This professor is really rude and doesn't see, like the type to help you outside of class. I would not recommend him as a professor",0
Tough tests you can't image!!,0
"Bogdan is a great teacher who really knows his stuff. Hes a very relaxed teacher and his lectures are great. He is one of the best professors that I have had, if you have the opportunity to take his class take it",1
"He is  the best professor! I really like his lectures, and you can call him up if you ever need anything! He's amazing, and inspirational. I honestly want to take him for every class. He gives a big, generous curve towards low grades, and I feel lucky to have taken him, even in the most hardest topics, he understands where you are coming from. Take",1
"He is great! His class was focused around ""Fear and Desire in Popular Culture"", so the 3 essays he assigns are on topics that are actually interesting to you. He is a very fair grader, and doesn't call on you unless your hand is raised. Plus, he always makes the class laugh. He's really cool and approachable, and I definitely recommend him.",1
"Hard to summarize this course because Carter makes it a kind of overwhelming total experience of intellectual life. Nice balance between being really demanding and also being really chill about how demanding the class could feel. I'll remeber this class forever. Tibetan bowl meditation wa so good. A few short papers, long readings, and final paper.",1
amazing woman. she truly loves english and teaching. love love love,1
"Take him is you have to. He is a kind person, but very very very boring. It is very lecture heavy and he goes off on tangents that do not pertain to the subject you are learning about. He quizzes you every class and the quizzes do not correlate to the chapters that you read outside of class. He is nice though.",0
The lectures are boring. She was not very helpful when asked for assistance. I would not take this professor again.,0
"I am not sure how she still teaches this class. Her tests were made up of pieced together google tests and EVERY test there were correction errors and sometimes she said ""I would have to google it."".. I CAN GOOGLE IT!  Her study guides were not what you were tested on. Does offer extra credit via corrected tests",0
"Tripp is by far the easiest and most helpful teacher I've ever had. If you know what you're doing, you just show up and do your work and he wont bother you at all. If you need help, you just raise your hand and he's happy to help. If you aren't good at doing stuff on your own, then you wont learn though. He lets you do your work as you please.",1
Professor Lewis is approachable and encouraging when he deals with students. Knows the material and delivers  it in a very simple way. Gives everyone a chance to ask questions and answers them clearly. Exams are straightforward with no trick questions. Exams are based on material thought. He takes the time to review subject matter before exams .,1
"I would not advise beginners or students without prior experience, not CIS6 class assignments, to programming take his class. Lectures and lab assignments were ok, however h.w. and exam were very tough. Grading is 90% from exam while 10% h.w. Not a great teacher for beginners! Disappointed and sad for taking his class!",0
"Professor McPherson was a great guy and his class is straight forward. The lecture can get tiresome, but it is Chem. He really does care about his students and is  available for help if needed.  The tests are pretty tough, but the online homework does help to even it out. Very lenient lab professor as well, show up do the lab and get out early.",1
"Takes off for spelling mistakes if you don't close your a's. Otherwise, he'll think you spelled Indiu instead of India..",0
"Professor Israel did great at teaching online. Make sure you watch all of the lectures and take lots of notes on them. Homework is KEY in doing well in this class. If you try on the homework, you will get a good grade easily. First midterm was easy, and the second midterm/final was fine. Ask questions during/after lecture if you are confused.",1
her complete and total lack of meme knowledge was completely inappropriate. i give 1.5/10,0
Unreasonable strict on grammar. More strict than my English professor.  It doesn't like a planning class more like an art class. Lots of reports  and analysis. Too much details to lose your mark. I would drop his class if it wasn't mandatory.,0
I'd never take this professor again even if I'd end up waiting another semester for a new class to open up. Thought I'd risk it and take her but I regret it. You can't even email her. MUST contact thru BB and she responds whenever she feels like. Respondus Webcam on every exam. You had to teach yourself. No rounding scores. Worst professor ever.,0
Very great teacher...he grades papers very fair he also allows rewrites after he grades them.He does give tests but they are very easy. Perfect attendance will get you extra points he also gives a few extra credit options. He will help you out if you just ask he is a very nice.,1
"6-week course. Frequently goes off-topic in his lectures to talk about events or his own rants. If you are a girl, expect to be called up to the board or computer frequently to write stuff he's teaching. Lectures are usually him reading directly from slides, doesn't expand on material. Didn't follow the syllabus. I feel unprepared for CSC202.",0
If you wantt o lern to write well this is a good class.  People should take it earlier.  Not too hard if you do all the work.  Great professor.,1
"Worst prof I've ever had.  Made our entire class redo an assignment because he said none of us did it correctly, failing to realize he clearly is not good at communicating what he wants.  Quite harsh as well in his criticisms and expects you to do a LOT of work per assignment.  Tough marker as well.  Avoid this class if possible!",0
"You definitely have to put the work in to get a good grade. Quizzes every week, two midterms and a final, but he's not a harsh grader. Lectures were kind of boring, but he explained things in great detail. He expects you to remember a lot of stuff from Calc 1 and wants you to put the work in. Overall decent professor, but the class itself was hard.",1
"The yoga sessions are great, but she pretty much just reads straight from the readings during lecture.",1
"All STAT 201 classes take the same tests & are supposed to follow the same powerpoint notes. Dr. Pannell didnt like the powerpoints so he skips a lot. Which is really frustrating bc you have to go back & learn it yourself. My roommate is in a different STAT class and she got a review for the test, but we didnt get one.. but its the same test?",1
professor Love should be a role model for other professors at csun. She is very honest with you and encourages you to succeed in class. She doesn't babysit her students and is very professional. Her assignments are very straight-foward and not very tedious. I earned an A- in the class. I'm sure anyone who takes her will enjoy their semester.,1
"If you are not already fluent in Spanish, you will not learn with this instructor. This class is very difficult, do not let ""beginning Spanish 2"" fool you. I am fluent in Spanish and got an A, but my classmates who weren't struggled very much. he ""teaches"" too fast and doesn't allow enough time for a subject to sink in before moving to the next.",0
Bio311 is the worst class I have ever taken. Rosa runs a live class every week on top of various pre-recorded lectures. There are about 6 assignments due every Sunday on sapling on top of problem sets that might be due on Moodle. I am very disappointed in the way she has handled an online class . Complete overkill of work.,0
He would do experiments or solve problems in class &would forget everyone on zoom couldn't see. He would send us into breakout rooms to work on assignments during class which was a waste of time b/c many students didn't participate. His grading is awful & assignments are hard to understand. Exam next week not on the schedule. GA wasn't a good tutor,0
"Dr. Kosnik was the best professor I have had in my college career so far.  His notes are clear and easy to understand and his lectures are humorous and engaging.  I miss his class.  Ee is awesome at piano and the organ.  Also, he is the cutest, nicest old man ever.  Dr. Kosnik is a boss.",1
"Hurlee was a fair teacher, however if you didn't understand the material you basically had two options, read the book or go without understanding because if you went to ask for help, he would make you feel dumb by saying things like ""but it's so simple"" and ""did you read the book, look at it again"" not much help outside of the classroom.",1
Hilarious and super understanding,1
The worst experience I had so far at Hunter!,0
"Every other class period there were quizzes that were from the homework. She said the quizzes were your study guide for exams, but they were much more than that. She would get confused in lectures, homework wouldn't match lecture, & exams were tough bc didn't match the way she taught in lectures. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME. ",0
Huddleston expects you to write each of your papers according to his views. Your grade will suffer if you think differently than he does or try to express your own thoughts/opinions.  His tests questions cover all the material discussed in class from his never-ending powerpoint presentations. Don't expect to leave early.,0
"Flies through the slides, it would be nice if English awas used. By far one of the worst I've ever had the luck to witness.",0
"Mostly discussions followed by a quiz, per week.  Not very involved with the class, dishes out assignments with no specific lecture/power points.  Just A LOT of reading. Not very involved with the class.  Final was difficult, did not even provide a prep sheet or study guide and most of the questions were not part of earlier quizzes.  Not great.",0
"I had taken 13 years of French before and placed into 101 because I wanted an easy A (I don't recommend this in 101 levels you have class 4 times a week instead of 2 or 3). I was comfortable with the subject matter so I skipped class a lot, she doesn't take attendance. Assigns a lot of busy work and keeps you until the end of class. Nice lady.",1
Great professor in class quiz and final are super easy if you do the readings however online quizes were quite difficult at times and essay was hard seeing as I am not a philosophy major most essays are informational but this one is more argument based,1
"It blows my mind he has a good rating on here. I honestly believe he is the worst professor ive ever had. I respect the ""learn on your own technique"" but he refuses to answer any questions and will tell you to look it up. why am i paying for the class if i have to google everything? Its like he's trying to make the class harder.",0
"Everyone has their niche. Teaching & explaining is not Rogers niche. One of, maybe the worst professor I have ever had!  Take someone else.",0
"You need to read so many books in his class, even the blogs and wikis are easy but you need to take them every week. His test is not easy for those people whose main language is not English.",0
"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes. Instead of teaching or asking provoking questions, it almost seems like she is so bored that she could care less about planning out a thoughtful class discussion. Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",0
"David is great!! He makes the class very interesting by allowing you to write about what you are interested in. He uses a grading contract, so essentially if you turn in all assignments and put effort into them you will get an A. The class focuses on current issues and his perspective is more liberal, so decide whether that's for you.",1
run away from this teacher arrogant,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. SAVE YOURSELF. DO IT FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. JUST DON'T DO IT.  Lectures are awful, powerpoints are not helpful. The textbook is the driest thing I have ever encountered. No continuity in what is gone over in class with weekly exams. Expect to memorize 60+ pages a week to only get a B.",0
"best possible professor anyone could ever ask for. creates such a kind atmosphere within the classroom, and truly does her best to make the class as enjoyable as possible. always has a smile on her face, and cares deeply for her students. all around a wonderful and delightful person, as well as a respectable and capable instructor. please take her.",1
"ce prof la est malade je vous le conseille vraiment, tres exigeant avec ses eleves mais c'est pour votre bien passe sa vie à aider les etudiants par courriel si vous avez besoin! il est marier haha:P",1
"its hard to find anything nice to say. she is an awful professor. can't use moodle or collaborate. wastes an extreme amount of time in class, teaching nothing herself. very outdated ideas. very unclear, poorly worded instructions. is very rude if you have any criticism of the way she poorly runs her class.",0
Such an easy class! Everything is laid out for you and she gives clear study guides. Easy A and lots of extra credit opportunities. not extremely interesting content and a lot of common sense information but otherwise a great class. No need for the textbook.,1
"Expect to have to teach yourself absolutely everything on your own time, which is extra difficult because everything you research will be in a different (and more standardized and sensible format) than what she teaches. I have yet to meet a single person who thinks she is good at teaching material. Tests and quizzes are also obscenely difficult.",0
Teaches straight from the book. Doesn't write anything on the board. Not easy to take notes to refer to later. He was OK as an instructor. Glad I don't have to take anymore of his classes.,0
"Run far away! Although Dr. Simerka is incredibly intelligent, she's very impersonal and her manner can seem very snobbish. This class was really not a great choice. The material is dry and class discussion can also be dry. Incredibly harsh grader, but also good because she expects you to work to your utmost potential.",0
"Overcomplicates all of the topics, going to class hurts more than it helps. He burns through the material, and the review sessions and practice midterms had nothing to do with the actual test. Gives lots of notes and examples in class, but uses totally different ones on the homework. Would not recommend",0
"Does not make expectations clear. First paper almost the whole class received C's. She lectures like below average professor, struggles to get her point across, and only has you read the books and post on discussion board...yet grades like we are grad students. Even grades low on participation if you are active! I would not recommend her class.",0
"I enjoyed his teaching of AT. He made the topics easy to understand. At times, his lectures did get boring but he teaches life lessons which were helpful. Make sure you know basic math or you will struggle a little, but ask questions, he loves to help. There is a group project and group quizzes. Make sure you take notes! It's essential.",1
Celia is an extremely tough prof. As a science student who is used to getting a lot of work-don't be fooled she gives a LOT of homework. She is really strict and for some reason thinks no one in the class studies and puts in effort while everyone is struggling and crying. I think I've had maybe 3-4 nice cry sessions from her class. Not worth it.,0
You hardly have to pay attention in class in order to get a good grade: everything is common sense. Lockhart is a really nice professor and he is really funny. I enjoyed the class a lot. ,1
Dont take it if you cant understand someone who talks really fast and doesnt help much,0
Told us all assignments are on hold during move to online which was a 2 week period and then did not change the course load. Actually made us go back and complete assignments that would have been due even though we were not in session for that time period. Can't give him a bad enough rating.,0
"Worst teacher without a word of a lie l. Barely passed the course (usually As). He makes you look like an idiot when you get questions wrong and simply doesnt do well at explaining concepts. If he had his way he would fail everyone, he said 90% on success rate on a midterm question was too high so he would make it harder next time. AVOID HIM!!!",0
"Nearly absent from course most of semester. Finals week and still no grades/feedback from Oct assignments. Multiple weeks between answered questions by students, some after assignments questions regarded were due. Often unclear expectations of assignments, tough to know what to do. Very little engagement from Kristi this semester. Disappointing...",0
"Easy Bc all Homework, quizzes and tests are online. She's hard to understand and gets easily confused. At the end of the semester she opened every assignment back up to give students a chance to repair their grade.",0
"Very good prof., can be hard to understand at times but is always willing to clarify and does A LOT of examples with the class. This is the easiest time I've ever had learning math..",1
Awesome class,1
"A great professor. When he gives you the study guide, do every question. The test is word for word from it. Just a very nice, polite, and funny guy. I had no interest in philosophy, I just needed the credit, but I genuinely learned a lot from this class. He also has the cutest dog and I've seen him walking her around campus. Also he's hot.",1
"I took CJSA 2323, Book is MANDATORY about 60$ from campus library. If you don;t get the book you will NOT pass, all assignment questions come straight from book. Easiest A ever. All exams and quizzes are open on the first day of class and You have until the last day of class to finish all material.",1
"Took Legal Negotiations with this professor. This is a good class. Material is not as cut and dry as some other graduate law courses. However, professor does a really good job explaining the material/concepts clearly. Learned a lot/practical material.",1
Way too much reading and group discussions. A bit disorganized. Quite a few group presentations as well. Basically one midterm and one final and group presentation and book reviews. Take notes on what each group says to the questions she assigns. READ THE NOVELS!  There's almost nothing online for the novels she picks. Don't rly need the textbook.,0
"Dr. Bachmann's online geography class was reall y easy going and welcoming this semester. Her assignments were super easy. All it is discussion boards, current event postings, and weekly quizzes to the chapters you read from the text. (But most of the answers can be found online. :) She's also really nice and knows her geography.",1
"Professor Dillon made Pop Culture very fun, as it should be! Discussion topics were very engaging and interesting, and the class overall was a breeze! Just participate in discussions and you'll do fine.",1
"Great Teacher, interesting class! Learned a lot about human life span. Online tests were open book but you still had to study for an A!",1
"You don't really have to show up for class, she never takes attendance; very boring. She puts all of her notes online so you can print them out, even though she says they aren't the exact notes that she goes over in class, they are! You definitely need to get the book with the journals, they are on tests! Grades her exams + assignments very quickly",1
"Caring professional, but extremely difficult to keep up during lecture. Comes across as if unprepared and her dry method of facilitation does not help. She has conflicting information on her syllabus and seemingly is using a previous version of text and material; confuses students. Highly encouraged to avoid this professor.",0
"He wrote a recommendation letter for me for Hartnell that was pre-made and he prepared a new one for me. Kind, very casual sometimes, and it's not about your grade. It's about doing work.",1
"Dr S is the sweetest, but her criteria and wants were a bit confusing sometimes. She's new at Carroll so I can excuse that, and I still highly recommend her. She really makes you think about the injustices in the world and she opens your eyes to. various ways to solve issues. Lots of papers, but theyre relatively easy and interesting. I reccomend.",1
The class was....I don't know how to explain it. She doesn't really explain things well and then the whole class does bad on a test and she gives the whole class a retest. She always allows you to come by her office if you need help. But overall she's a good teacher.,1
"I take it back. Avoid this professor at all costs. She does not give good feedback and her advice is so vague that you're better off not asking. Seriously, NO DO TAKE.",0
"His lectures and notes aren't clear on what you are learning and what it applies to. Wasn't good at explaining things. However, go to the super tutorials and you will pass this course. You just might not learn anything.",0
"I personally DID NOT like her class, she once accused me for not doing my unit 3 work but I actually turned it in ON THE DUE DATE but never got it back until our production exam #2 and put it in the grade book. I would honestly rate her as a 0 if I had the choice",0
"Best Professor I've had at Wright ! TAKE HIM. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!**** He teaches the class in a way that makes math seem very easy. He will explain everything until you understand, show up, pay attention and do the homework and you will pass. I will sure miss going to his class.",1
He called the feedback insulting in class but he needs to listen to what we are saying. This format is not working for most people. He needs to change his grading scale & curve. Not a bell curve just a normal curve that all other teachers do. My last chem teacher added 5% to each test but he waited to announce it until the final. He should do that.,0
This was a fun class and not stressful.,1
"I took this class over summer and I do not regret it at all. With a quick 20 minutes every day, this class was super manageable for any type of schedule and was well-organized. The professor was extremely sweet and truly cared about what she was teaching. Highly recommend.",1
She is a Student Teacher. Took Spring 15'. Exams were exact questions from textbook that she tells you to study off. Tough subject overall.,1
"This is the worst class in the history of the world. The professor is horrible, antipathetic, and has a ego problem. I had never disliked a class so much until I took this one. The course is completely irrelevant and useless if you're not going into research or Ph.D. This class shouldn't be required.",0
Not sure what to say. He is a nice person but does not know how to teach well. ,0
He himself admitted that he does not know much about the subject and said that the attendance wont matter and grading would be easy. At the end he curved the grades only for those who had more attendance and deliberately lowered the ranks for the other students with lower attendance and gave them absolute grades. Do not pick him for this course.,0
"Meryl is not a good teacher. It is that simple. Ruined my interest in English which is sad considering my major is Journalism. Very judgmental, and very sarcastic.",0
"I loved this class! Catherine and our peer leader, Emma, were so nice and really made us feel comfortable with transitioning into college. The class is easy and there is a lot of hands on work. I definitely recommend taking her class.",1
"To the guy who says econ is not math, good luck in any future in economics.  Majumdar was decent, his midterm was a bit of a curveball but he gave us easy enough assignments to make up for it.",1
"Cynthia is a wonderful teacher. She really loves her students and her subject. She is very supportive and very helpful. No lectures, class is basically based on your own research. I feel like I learned a lot about what I was interested in!",1
"Really good class but was some of the hardest grading Ive ever experienced. While I managed to maintain an A, I spent more time on this class every week than any other. The class averages were generally Cs or lower. Dont take unless you have very strong English skills and lots of time to devote to homework.",1
I think Maria did a fantastic job. The class was interesting and she is a very interesting person and a great teacher. She is Russian and has an accent but I understood her perfectly and she articulates her engligh better than most americans. Love her,1
"Personality in one phrase: Hey, man, before you can learn anything about math, first, you gotta to learn to chill. Teaching method in one phrase: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. He has a super chill personality, lectures very directly, and grades fairly. He breaks down confusing math issues into coherent step by steps.",1
Homework every class containing about 20 questions. Each assignment takes about an hour to complete. Couldn't fully understand his demos.,0
"His lecture consisted of him scribbling incomprehensibly all over the board.  All learning was done entirely from the text, as he did not instruct in any sort of clear way.",0
"Organic II can be a hard course, but it doesn't have to be. She's very nice, but as a teacher she lacks the ability to communicate material effectively. You feel rushed, as if Organic Chemistry is some trial-by-fire all scientists must endure. It's a ridiculous notion to expect most students to absorb the material given presentation style.",0
Great teacher who really teaches on a basic level. Speaks to the class in a way they would understand. There is homework and a project but is not hard at all. If you have questions or need help he is there for you. He tells the class frequently about if it anyone is having trouble to see him. Really cares,1
"Not the hardest class just lots of reading/ writing. Some of the material was interesting. The thing I disliked the most was she was quick to push her opinion on students. Rather then grading my writing, she would leave remarks all over my papers on how my views were wrong. You should get along with her if you are a socialist vegan.",0
extremely tough grader. on all assignments I didn't get any higher then a 70% I highly recommended avoiding her class. She takes forever to grade assignments i turned in 3 assignments and she took the entire quarter to grade all of them and took 3 hrs to grade my final.,0
"Great professor, would love to have him again for other classes.",1
I have mixed feelings about Orser. She's a sweet woman and all that and I have taken more than one class with her but she can be extremely unclear about what she wants from assignments and her lectures are very messy. Take her at your own discretion I guess.,0
Hope youre not wanting to take this class in the morning because there is a 99% chance of falling asleep. To this day I still dont understand why attendance was mandatory considering absolutely nothing from what she calls lectures was important or helpful towards class work or assignments. Best of luck but I would not reccomend this class.,0
"Great teacher, id recommend her!",1
"Smith makes clear from the beginning his classes are designed to resemble the style of law schools: Grades and materials reflect as much. Though you will have to pay for a pack back (mock Canvas) program, it helps aid the discussion and topics of the class. Exams are hard if you don't read but the material covered is foundational to 104 series",1
"Even through reading the transcripts, I could tell that Dr. Kelley has a deep love and understanding for psychology. She made challenging and uncomfortable topics seem completely normal and understandable. The small details that she includes brought the online class to life.",1
"Greatest english teacher I've had in a very long time.  Knows what he's talking about, and he's obsessed with Tolkien.  The man is the English Department's equivalent to Prof. Caristi.",1
I don't understand his class. I am just attending and for credit. I need to pass it. Attend the class and u will pass.,0
He is an absolute awful professor. He will give you grades based on how well he likes you. Don't make yourself known to him. Sucking up to him is a must. Brown nose as much as possible. His grading is not fair and even if you are right and argue he will not do anything about it.,0
Do not take professor Ricar. This is not about art at all it is a history class. She gives tons of assignments per week that are graded purely on word count. She cares more that you address her by name and respond to her thoughts than she does about you understanding or doing well in the course. not worth it. do not take.,0
professor JACOBO  is the greatest professor that I have ever taken at valley  college.  we need more professors like her,1
"I Love her!!! Didn't want to take bio now I am minoring in it, she is wonderful!!!",1
Horrible professor!!! He doesn't help his students and he doesn't care nor teach the material. He is rude and he makes the class more difficult than it is. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!,0
Professor Felter is the type to read off the slides and expect you what she is saying. You have to work for everything yourself because she will just repeat the things of her powerpoint. I had already taken Statistics in high school so this class was easy for me but for some of my friends it was extremely difficult. Just be ready to work!!!,0
"This was the hardest gen ed I have ever taken. The test were difficult, and the writing we have to do is graded very harshly. His lectures are very interesting and it shows he loves what he teaches but the work that we have to do in that class is horrible. 3 test that over a handful of people failed? That should not happen in a gen ed",0
"Bad online course.  I've taken several at RCCC, and this was by far the most unorganized - poor page layout and LOTS of broken links.  Doesn't participate on the discussion forum.  Lecture ""notes"" and powerpoints are useless.  Tests are simply fact-finding missions out of the book - but not always from the chapter your studying.  Poor online course",0
"the only teacher that gives multiple choice exam on science subject, no partial credit of course.",1
Her elegance and poise is only matched by her classy style. She's really nice and well organized. Hands down the fastest marker i've had. she's tough and doesn't tolerate nonsense but if you're on the ball and know your stuff she is a joy to have as a teacher.,1
"Submitted grades halfway into NEXT semester. Plays favorites. No textbook for contextual support, but scattered articles on the subject. Unclear standards.",0
Mrs. H is a really funny and chill prof. She goes over your papers with you and gives you a lot of honest feedback. Very invested in wanting everyone to do well and very understand and kind in and outside of class. Her class has a lot of reading on politics and history which I thought would be boring but I learned a lot.,1
He's is very understanding if you can't make class for a valid reason. He is very nice and super helpful! Very easy to approach and ask questions and if you don't have certain supplies he is always there to help you out with extra stuff.,1
"I didn't love her. With COVID especially she didn't have grace for students, was pretty unmoving, hard to get a hold of. She's nice. She's very intelligent and knowledgeable. She focused on weird subjects that didn't really get covered by other course content from GCU. She was fine in person, but I didn't enjoy her with blended learning.",0
Great professor who gives great feedback on all your work. Very relatable to her students and pushes you to do your best work.,1
"This class is very interesting but her methods of grading are horrendous. She gives you the questions she will ask on the midterm and goes over the answers in lecture, but even when writing all that out and more from the textbook she says it's ""too vague"". She is very hard to talk to about how to improve, and lectures are VERY disorganized.",0
She is the worst professor that I have ever had. I was very interested in anthropology until I took her class. I would  suggest taking ATH with a different Professor.,0
"Very nice guy! He talks about himself a lot, but did a great job of structuring a class that was both workshop and lecture. All of our work was based around reading and writing creatively. Take his class if you can, he's a really solid professor.",1
Extremely helpful and engaging. Ensured students had every opportunity to pass the class and provides feedback and resources to help plan for your future in the program and after you graduate. Makes you feel like he truly wants you to succeed.,1
The class is very irrelavent to English and Literature and the professor also uses biases in his teachings and towards students. The class is very boring.,0
"Taking his Animal Science class, and I have to say, I'm learning a lot. VERY funny and engaging in his lectures. Sparks your curiosity and encourages you to challenge your knowledge on things. I look forward to this class every single time. Also the Lab is very hands on and interesting if you're adventurous enough.",1
"This womans opinion is the ONLY opinion that matters to her. The more I BS-ed on the essays and reiterated EXACTLY what came out of her mouth in class - the higher grades I got, i'm not kidding. Easy class, but advice: Take notes during lectures and use things she says EXACTLY in your essays and you will get an A. No Conflicting Opinions Allowed!",0
Worst professor I have ever taken. This class is not an introduction class and he is very unclear on what he wants. I would never suggest him as a professor! Was also very rude in emails.,0
"A great prof she cares about students and she has a positive and up beat attitude. She makes sure you understand the lecture and she makes time for students after class. The best prof in the libt field, lienent marker, and understands the students circumstances. If you have her as a prof you are lucky she is the nicest prof ive ever met.",1
"If you somehow get stuck with this ""professor"", drop the course and run. She doesn't understand any question asked and will give a convoluted answer that only causes more confusion. Nothing will make sense and you'll be left to teach yourself. The homework is online, doesn't work half the time, and takes up to 10 hours to complete. Not kidding.",0
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so energetic and loves being in class. One of my biggest role models ,1
"Good professor, a little monotone though, making his otherwise good lectures a bit hard to listen to. Take a lot of notes, tests are very hard. Extremely long-winded in answering questions. Still a good prof and a good guy.",1
Jason is awesome! His class can be difficult but that's just the nature of the course. He explains the concepts clearly and is straightforward about what you need to know. If you study hard for tests and do all the discussion work you're set.,1
"very good teacher, but she makes you read a lot and do a lot of quizzes.",1
"Very sweet man! The pace of the class is sometimes painfully SLOWWWWW, but it is an easy class and I would recommend. :)",1
This is the greatest professor around.  If you have any difficulty he will gladly sit with you and explain until you get it. He is very caring and knows how to teach math even to those that are horrible at it such as myself. You should take any math class with him.  I promise you will enjoy his teaching.,1
This was the most confusing class I have ever taken!  There was no syllabus and I was literally dumbfounded by us having to respond to ten posts!! I didn't really know what was going on half the time because of how the class was structured.  VERY CONFUSING!,0
There's a lot of writing for this class for it not being a writing intensive class. It's hard to focus on when you are a full time student.,0
"She is a super neat lady, and as long as you are willing to put the effort and time into your work you will definitely do well.",1
"Fun class.Do book exercises, make an 8 page website,have Prof. Nearing look at your work before submitting. Study for final exam and you'll get an A.",1
Never really learned anything in this class. Used Phys I knowledge and extra credit to get by. Aced the first test and bombed the second but still got a 92. Easy but you won't learn anything.,0
Dr. Comfot is from the Chemical Engineering department. So his entire class is geared toward Chem E's. If you are another kind of Engineer you will not to well in his class at all. I highly recommend a different teacher if you are not a Chem E.,0
"She was political (talked about trump constantly, including in test questions) which was bizarre for a grammar class and was bad at time management. We probably spend 1/3 of the class on a good day discussing grammar and the rest was devoted to whatever nonsense she decided to talk about. She did care for her students and the class wasn't hard.",0
VERY knowledgeable economist. If you dont understand something speak up because hell clarify. Exams are difficult but only because theres a lot of content covered for only a midterm and a final. You will definitely learn a lot. Also his discussion board entries can definitely boost your grade but dont procrastinate them.,1
"EASY class...all you gotta do is read from the book, tests are straight forward and simple. Theres writing assignments but they are easy because the book helps alot. She is very nice and understanding. I liked her alot and had her for two history classes.",1
"wpc 101 with Dwosh was very relaxing which is perfect for being a freshman orientation class, highly recommend him, little work outside of class you just have to participate when you are there.",1
"Marek has a very successful engineering career and he has a very wide knowledge of the industry. But when it comes to teaching, HE IS TERRIBLE. He gives you general information about very specific stuff - and he expects you to know everything. His marking system is unstable and unfair. Lack of clarification is his the biggest problem. 3/10",0
"a horrible professor and a horrible person, holds no regard to her students or those around her, grades inconsistently with no explanations doesnt respond to emails or even texts dearborn should just drop her",0
"Pre Calc is the second most dropped class on campus. Here's why, You do not get any of your tests back so you can't learn from your mistakes, you don't get taught concepts, you only go over a few hw problems in class that have very little to do with the hw. Mrs. Ryburn is a very nice lady but the way the class is taught is not well results> fail",1
Prof. Wood is an amazing and smart woman. She gives lots of assignments and two papers. Keep up with the assignments and reading and you will do fine. I could of done better but my grade is my fault so dont let that discourage you. She is also very understanding if you speak to her and let her know what is going on.,1
She is the WORST Professor that I have ever had. She sat and read off of the slides. She treats her students like they are little children. She also does not care how you do in the class at all.,0
"Dr. Baumann is very unclear with what he is looking for on assignments. Even if you answer a question correctly, he will mark off points for not including every detail he is grading on (even if you are not given a rubric). I would recommend taking a different professor . You might do poorly due to his grading, even if you know the material.",0
"Apparently he lost all his money investing in an app that's supposed to teach your goldfish to twerk, so he recently returned to the teaching game after a decade in retirement. Super awesome professor who simplifies advanced content. The only downside is he randomly loses touch with reality and thinks he's in rural Oklahoma birthing a calf.",1
"I picked her due to great reviews, BUT that may only be in class. DO NOT take her online! Had her for Summer 2. Only 4 assignments w/ a low grading scale (15,20,20,20)- No room for human error. Doesn't care to give a good feedback even when asked. Non-existent. Not her problem. I'd never take her again! I've had way better online class experience",0
The weekly quizzes are unfair and nothing like the homework. You spend an average of 4 hours on homework a week. She is not a good teacher and doesn't explain the material well. Just a bad teacher. Avoid her unless you can teach yourself accounting and have a lot of free time in your schedule. ,0
One of my worst college professors ever. She knows that material herself but can't explain it at all. I wouldn't even recommend this class. You really need extra tutoring and like help from multiple people. She literally only explains things once and will ignore your question is hse doesn't understand it or she has someone else answer it.,0
"Definitely take her for 1003. She is a great teacher and very helpful. You can earn extra credit for attending these small study sessions. For her quizzes and tests she gives you exactly what will be on the tests so as long as you study with that, you should definitely get a good grade.",1
"Crittenden is a very nice guy but his lectures can be very very boring for this class. This was his first time teaching math, all he did was write across the whiteboard the whole class. There is more homework and it can be time consuming but he lets you retake every test no matter what grade you received. He also kind of talks like Eeyore.",1
"Class was fun and interesting, good sense of humor- straight from the book. Do assignments and study for exams you can get an A. Fair grading and was very professional. Enjoyed class. No complaints.",1
Has been messing up lectures for so long that I have not learned a single thing. Better luck learning online if you can find anything on his topics...,0
"Dr. Schwartz is a great professor. He is tough, but he truly cares about the material. He has review sessions, responds to emails quickly and will help you if you need it. Put in the effort and you will do well. His test care challenging but so Anatomy is a hard class. Be prepared to study a lot.",1
"Took this class during Covid-19 Spring 2020 (graded pass/fail). Exam was easier than expected. Seems intimidating in class, but does care. I do not think that she dislikes Civil Procedure and did not get that feeling in taking her class. Be prepared for tough cold calls. Even if class goes virtual, you will be cold-called.",1
Best teacher ever easy A very funny and also makes sure you understand everything,1
"Worst class I've taken at CU. There was an issue with EVERY exam we took. She never responds to emails either. She legitimately responded to less than half of my emails, and if she did respond it usually took multiple follow ups. I honestly think she doesn't even care about her students. I would recommend taking the regular physics section instead",0
"He is a wonderful person, but his lectures are extremely dry. The labs aren't bad, but should be worth far more than they are. His tests are terribly formatted, as all are multiple choice and ""a, b, c, two are correct, all are correct"" without partial credit, and you could study for hours to only get a 60% because of this.",0
"This was probably the most unorganized class I've ever taken. You don't really have to go to class because the lectures, quizzes (7), and exams (3) are all online. As long as you complete the few assignments, quizzes, & exams you can easily get an A in this class. Don't rely on the syllabus b/c there are many typos and assignments left out.",0
YEA WHAT THEY SAID !,0
This man would tight rope walk the Grand Canyon if it helped you understand a concept. Awesome guy and really loved the material he taught. I suggest everyone use this class as their Tech Elective.,1
"I loved taking Spanish 100A with Alicia! She was hilarious and always cracking jokes. The only things we got graded on were quizzes, the midterm, and the final, but there was clear grading criteria for everything. If you need an easy elective, or want to learn basic Spanish, this course is for you",1
"Higgins was for sure my favorite prof at UW so far. She really cares about each individual student . Definitely needed the books for class because we talk about the readings in discussion and a lot of the readings are questions on the tests. Overall, great prof, hard class, but would take it again.",1
"Hardest class I have taken. I work very hard and make the best grades I can being an honor student and a math major, but this class was very difficult for me. The teacher is not helpful when you tell him you need help. He is confusing and sarcastic. I believe he is one of the hardest calculus teachers at GSU. Go to class and try your hardest.",0
You don't attend Thurs and have DBs about movies instead those days. Proceeded to look around at what people said the movie was about then pretend I watched it too. Final project poorly explained. No lectures in class; all you do is discuss assigned readings in groups. Why is this not an online class? Ugh. I couldn't take her seriously.,0
"Great teacher. Belongs at a University. She is cooky and aging, but you can tell she is still sharp and knows what she is talking about. I would suggest going to all her classes and taking good notes. Even though she is super nice, her tests are tough. Study, do homework and complete all extra credit she offers.",1
"Amazing professor.  If you study and participate, you will do fine.  Unlike many language professors, she actually teaches!  She puts a ton of work into writing notes on the board and is extremely approachable.  I even use my note from 3 semesters in her class for my French IV class at NYU.  She is a high calibre teacher.  :)",1
great teacher!! she is always willing to help students through any difficulty. She is extremely nice and really know chemistry very well.,1
"I love this professor, his grading is easy and not so persist on format.",1
"I wish I could pick more tags! Makes you think about what you say in class, and doesn't just accept things at face value! Papers are reasonable; you have to REALLY put in the effort to get a good grade. Give yourself time and revise them BEFORE handing them in so they're the best the FIRST time around. READ and PARTICIPATE + Go to office hours!!",1
Awesome guy- extremely friendly and happy. Material is HARD. I still don't understand half of the material and it's the last day. Don't take this class unless you are a neurologist or biology major. It's not a psychology course.,0
This professor was absolutely horrible. All she did during lecture was read her power point slides word for word. As if I can't read them myself. When test time came the answers to the questions could not be found anywhere in the slides or book. She expected you to have a deep understanding of the subject material without teaching it to you.,0
"Nice professor, but cannot teach. He has video tutorials up on youtube, but they still do not help. He will however take his time out to help you during his office hours, so if you have him and need help, go to his office. Grading systems is weird, but be sure to do assignments right.",1
"Mr. Carson is a great teacher that I am taking him again for English 1102. You have to go to class because there will be pop up quizzes over what he used in the powerpoint. This class was a hybrid, and he normally tells you about the friday assignment. He super chill with late work and even turned my classes final into a take home final instead!",1
"This teacher loved lecturing, the problem was she had such a thick accent I absolutely had to drop the class. I could understand maybe 20% of what was said on a good day.",0
"Lectures are good you do lean a lot , but beware of test, Quizzes,he grades them very very and I cant say enough harshly. Very little partial credit on test no partial credit on quiz. Also, beware of a loophole of RE-TAKE TEST, re-take is much harder then the original test. Tests are scrambled from homework to quizzes to examples from lectures.",0
"THE CLASS ISN'T HARD. HOWEVER, THIS PROFESSOR GIVES EXTRACREDIT( JUST 2 POINTS EACH EXTRACREDIT). YOU HAVE TO WRITE ALL THE NOTES BECAUSE YOU GONNA BE LOST IN HIS TEST, WHICH IS 20 QUESTION MULTI-CHOISE. THE QUIZZES ARE HARD AND HE NEVER GONNA HELP YOU, SO FORGET THIS GUY FOR SURE..iTS DIFFICUL GET ""A"" FOR THE ""HARDER"" QUIZ.",0
Avoid taking him. He failed me. I took Calculus 1. He expect the students should know everything. He just write notes on board and expects students to know everything.,0
"Mr Parineh is an excellent instructor and he knows his materials very well. He provides many real world experiences and quick tips like how to start an LLC, sole prop, etc. He encourages students to invest early and what is safe to invest in. I have learned many valuable info that are useful in starting a career.",1
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
"Disorganized, cannot hear a thing in his lectures, grading takes more than a month. His midterms are quite easy but the finals stab your back. He goes off tangent soooooo much it's kind of hard at times to understand if he's lecturing or not.",0
"I don't know why people are complaining about him keeping us the whole time. Isn't the point to actually have the class you paid for? Anyway, the class isn't difficult at all as long as you turn in the movie reviews and listen during lecture. Most of the movies are very good but I guess me had to show us 1 crappy French art film. I'd take him again",1
"Lalonde seems really interested in his researvh areas, and is very engaging when he speaks to these. Unfortunately, most of the time this is not the case; he seemed as bored reading off of a website as the students did. Study hard for exams; much different from lectures.",1
Good teacher but needs to take a breath during class he never stops talking.,1
"Lots of homework but after the midterm it gets easier and his grading is more lenient. The quizzes were challenging, as well as the midterm and final. There are a few group projects that are time consuming but easy A's. Should be an easy class if you are good at math. If not, be prepared to teach yourself the material. YouTube was a lifesaver.",1
"Li was a very nice professor, but he was so dry in his lectures and had the hardest tests of all the calc 3 profs at A&M. Don't take if you can avoid. Studied so hard for his class and got straight Bs on everything. DO THE PRACTICE and HOMEWORK!",0
"I absolutely loved Professor Doroshenko. She is super nice, and is willing to explain any questions you have. I do wish we were in person, but over zoom the class was still amazing. She has us use TopHat for homework, but some of her other classes used a different platform. She does have an accent, but you just used to it.",1
"If you are an EE major, this is the professor you want for EE205.  We were all better off in EE206.",1
Very strong accent that I could not understand at all. I'm currently taking this class and regret it very much. I wish I would have not purchased the book and have chosen a different professor. He does not go over examples with students like other Math teachers. Avoid if you can.,0
"So when I had him I thought he was a good guy, but whenever i asked serious questions, he would come back with really smart ass answers that were unnecessary. He is a fair grader but he likes to keep people between A- and B+... participation he rarely gives over a 90% and rarely over an 18/20... just to warn you, its not hard, but not so fun either",0
"Going to class was always a joy. We ate brunch, had class in the Cathedral lawns, and he played acoustic guitar. What else can I say? He's very straightforward, attend lectures, participate, do the online discussion boards, do good insightful revisions, and you'll get an A.",1
"Mrs. Wells is very passionate about her job. She likes to make sure that everyone understands her material in class. Homework was asked of us but not necessary to turn in. If you understand the material, tests will show. Show up to class to learn the material and you'll be fine. She also gives reviews before tests which obv helps a lot!",1
I'm gonna get strait to the point. Lovely woman but definitely do not recommend taking her class unless it's mandatory. I often find myself showing up to class and doing other course work during her lecture and getting all the info I need from the slides come exam time. Her labs are incredibly convoluted and barely relate to course material.,0
I don't know what people are complaining about. The material was pretty straight forward and the final was nothing special; you just had to understand the equation instead of only memorizing it.,1
"STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY! She is THE most disorganized professor I've ever had. It is currently November & she has yet to grade a SINGLE paper or discussion board post for the ENTIRE semester. Last week's REQUIRED reading totaled 170 pgs, yet the syllabus (which she's changed 3 times) says to only expect 50 pgs a week. She's so out of touch.",0
"WORST TEACHER I have ever had in my life. She went on about how we should already know stuff instead of actually helping us, and the worst part is that she made us do the Kanji on our own time which is terrible because thats my weakest area. DO NOT TAKE HER u will regret it",0
IF YOU ATTEND ALL LAB CLASSES YOU WILL GET AN A.  HE DOES NOT LET YOU LEAVE IF YOUR LAB IS LESS THAN A B.  SOME STUFF IS CONFUSING BUT HE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP ALL HIS STUDENTS.  HE CARES AND LOVES WHAT HE DOES.,1
"Would walk into class and say turn in papers, but other than mentioning things generally he never make clear what was due when. Turned in weekly journal entries but none were graded till the end and gave zeros for half of the entries because he said they ""were not MLA format"" but they were the same format as entries he scored as 100.",0
"Don is such a beauty. He is hilarious and made a late night lecture fun and exciting to attend, even online. He is a great prof and made a math-heavy class easy to understand for someone like me who is not a math person. He made me enjoy finance and inspired me to pursue more classes in finance/accounting for a career. 10/10",1
"Excellent instructor that loves his subject! He doesn't want you to ""retell"" what happened in the past, he wants you to research the past and come to your own conclusions. He seems to love it when students get active in what they are learning. Expect exams and research paper. If you take good notes and listen in class, you will do fine. Great guy!!",1
One of my all time favorite teachers!!! He grades really hard but extra credit and all the help you want makes his classes worthwhile to take.,1
"I enjoyed the class and the material, I learned a lot but I worked really hard and didn't do as well as would have liked. The reason is the tests are ridiculously hard, asks very obscure questions, and there is a huge amount of material to study with little direction. Also she said she would curve up the grades for the mid-term but she didn't.",0
Doctor Heth is a great teacher who also cares about his students.  His teaching helps integrate our faith with real life.  I wish there were more professors like him!,1
"Wilburn is straight up one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a gentleman, a scholar, loved by students and just a brilliant human being. I hold Josh in the highest respect. ",1
Great teacher! defiantly take him. Had 3 twelve page papers worth 33% of your grade. Lets you out an hour early each class. Also hilarious and keeps the lectures interesting. Textbook is not needed.,1
"If you find out that he's going to be your professor, drop the class IMMEDIATELY! This was literally the worst class I've ever had...and that's an understatement. He did not teach us one thing the entire semester and when we did poorly on tests, he would blame us. Not only that, he is extremely boring and DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR GRADE.",0
"Sam is amazing. If you are a music major, you will see him plenty as the Double Bass Professor. Every Wayland resident loves him. He is kind of awkward, but it's really okay, he is so passionate, caring, and very funny when you get him to open up. Make sure you appreciate this man to infinity. (I have never taken his class, I just know him personal",1
"He has little knowledge of economics outside what he's read in the textbook that you use in class. He ""encourages"" discussion, but anything that doesn't fit into his narrow ideology is shot down. One day in class he made the claim that, and I quote, ""libertarian ideas of economics are the same thing as socialism"". I'll let that speak for itself.",0
"Not helpful what so ever, doesn't post grades until around the last week of class. Waste of my time.",0
"Dr. Bonaccorsci is very clear in her expectations, and is a good lecturer. Her lectures were very reflective of what was going to be on the homework/tests.",1
"Paul is SUPER! Really understands the busy work schedules of his students and allows for flexibility. Involves everyone in the learning, keeps class fun and informative.  I'd do the whole program with him if  I could.",1
"Was a little apprehensive at first as she seemed a little intimidating, but really enjoyed her teaching style, for both Assets and Equities. By far the best accounting prof I have had, extremely fair exam questions, particularly the long answers which are worth the bulk of exams. Still need to do lots of work, but she makes sure you are prepared.",1
Literally the worst professor I have ever had!!! She is not clear at all of what you are suppose to be doing. There is a research project that is the span of the class and she doesn't let you know what to do until the day before it is due and then gets mad that you didn't start it months earlier. ,0
Great professor if you fail its because of you,1
"Goes over nothing in lecture all the quizzes are based strictly on reading from the book.  Nice guy, he's pretty funny and didn't have a final exam but was a terrible teacher.  Class time was pointless the only reason I went was because he would give us journal questions we had to answer and the only way to get them was in class.",0
"Honestly, you learn so many life lessons in this class. Prof. Wingora is a very wise yet funny teacher he can be amusing and makes class interesting. Theres homework on blackboard every night but it can honestly be a 2 sentence answer. Tests and final essay or presentations are super easy, simply study or memorize moral theories and add support.",1
"Evil! Evil! Evil! She makes me hate spanish, we have no other alternative to her, which makes things even worse! She's mean and never really gives you an awnser. She expects people to understand the first time, and never has any patience.",0
"She's the type of professor your conservative parents warned you about. If she could hug every whale and destroy every coal mine she would. LIBERAL. Can be mean to girls. She locks the door after the start of the hour (excuse me, I'm paying to go here). She also is so far behind the times in terms of resumes and cover letters it's not even funny.",0
Judges when you don't understand... Not entirely sure if he understands to be honest.,0
Proffessor Williams is a good person but a BAD examiner. The class is hard The exams are open book open notes but hey .. the notes should be hand written only and the book must be physical one NO EBOOKS. his exams are hard with a 50 minutes time window .. you've better hurry!!,0
"Professor Haldane loves what she teaches. She's great and tries to make the class interesting. However the reading, is beyond long and extremely boring. She gives random exams and constant WTL'S",1
Mi-Sook is a fantastic professor who gives great feedback and cares a great deal about her students. I have developed so many new skills in this class! Do not be late or turn in assignments late and you will succeed. I would definitely take a class with her again.,1
"Jacobson was great, she was entertaining and kept relaying her materials back to everyday life. I enjoyed the class and will look for classes from her again!",1
Meshelemiah is very passionate and knowledgeable about what she does which makes her a great teacher. She's fair and challenging but her class is very interesting; you'll want to go to get the credit and to learn. You do have to to do the studying but she gives out ample extra credit and tries to make the class interesting!,1
I loved Mrs. Fletcher!! She was a wonderful teacher! I did struggle through her class but without her I probably would've failed.,1
"Arguably the nicest woman on planet earth. Diana is an angel sent from heaven. I love her. Great Spanish professor. If you're worried about an accent, don't worry. She's extremely clear. Absolutely take her.",1
"Attendance was not mandatory so I started to skipped class all the time, but I wouldn't recommend doing that. I missed a lot of material and he gives ""labs"" during class that are graded but you won't know about them unless you are in class. Used mymathlab so a lot of the hw in online. very helpful in class and kinda funny, not boring at all",1
For those of you that want to pass English 1A there are many other instructors that teach this class with the student's success in mind. Stay clear of this instructor unless you want to learn English within prison walls. You will buy many books that you won't use. Be prepared for boring lectures.,0
"Dr Lenhart is a great professor and keeps class really interesting, tests are difficult go to class.",1
"Mr. Norris has skills that help students to feel valuable and smart. He is trying to teach the students, not to start hate the class. I always attended the class with satisfaction.",1
"makes you do reflections which are pointless, just teach the class IN LECTURE! the exams are so hard, nothing like homework, I think I failed this class, being my first failed class ever. Retaking with a different teacher, dont care. Awful. Nice guy, but doesnt care if you are failing. No extra credit at all. Makes you do pointless papers.",0
"Don't even bother, change the professor if possible.  John Tyler needs a system of checks and balances when evaluating staff for teaching.  He walks and talks erratically around the room, scribbles nonsensical information on the board.  Best part, he's the only teacher who teaches the subject in class, maybe one other guy.  Steer clear, he's bad.",0
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
"For having a class that was way too full, she was really good at being involved.  She always made you feel really good about your art no matter how bad you thought it was.  She had very good tips, if you were open to them. She will spend as long as you need showing you a certain drawing technique to help you out",1
"Excellent, Knowledgeable, fare professor",1
"I have mid 80's in all my engineering and math classes this semester, and mid 60 in his econ class. The exams make no sense, and the grading scheme is bizarre. His lectures are painful and repetitive, and he only covers simple topics. He uses slides provided by the textbook publisher. Worst professor I've had in 5 years.",0
Sweetha is a great TA for Bio100 lab. The prelab quizzes are easy. Everyone gets at least an 8/10. She also helps out a lot when doing experiments. She genuinely cares about the class.,1
"Dr. Hart. Her review slides are longer than the lectures themselves.. babbles on about her personal life more than the protists she adores and fingi she thinks are cool. Save yourself and avoid her at all costs. Or just go off the textbook and skip class, lectures are not worth it.",0
Makes the concepts easy to understand.  Has clear expectations of what desired learning objectives.  Very knowledgable.,1
"He really shows he cares about the students especially since online school during a pandemic is TOUGH. All assignments were case studies, same formatting for all so it was a bit redundant by the end. Follow his criteria and you'll do fine in this course!",1
"As others have said, Justin is excellent at delivering complex material, like Hegel. The format of the class is always student-based, so it's essential to do the readings and come in with questions to make the most of it all. Meeting with him outside of class is always very helpful as well. VERY understanding and helpful. VERY.",1
"This prof is very vague when it comes to explaining things to her students. She will also spend too much time covering basics (things such as periods going at the end of sentences). Work load is not bad, but she does not round grades. Understandable if you have an 89.45%, but unreasonable when you finish with an 89.99% (I speak from experience).",0
"He is one of the best English teachers I have had. He is the only professor I can stand right now, and he is so funny and optimistic about everything! He is a great guy! And he helps you to write your best. :)",1
"Always be prepared with homework because she will randomly collect assignments. Homework can be pretty time consuming, but it is beneficial. My listening/speaking skills improved drastically this year. She loves participation so always try to participate. Quizzes and exams aren't too bad if you study and understand the material.",1
"Overall the class was not terrible. However, the notes and lecture she gave did not follow any of the examples in the textbook which made it very hard to go back and study. She also found herself correcting a lot of her own math mistakes when giving students notes. I personally would not take her class again.",0
He is a tough grader but is clear of what is expected. He tends to go off topic a lot and talks really fast so it makes it hard to understand. If you are not able to reach him during his office hours then he will find time to meet and discuss assignments.,1
A lot of material needed to remember for tests. Quite specific and a lot of weird names of sites and types of people and time periods you have to remember. Was a difficult course for me.,0
She tries to be caring and upfront but her teaching style is not the best. I've learned more from google and youtube videos than from her own lecture videos/discussions. She may make students feel as if they are not trying hard enough even when they may be putting all their time and effort into her class. Quizzes/exams for lab are never returned.,0
In order to pass the class you just have to show up and study the learning objectives and you should be good to go. She makes the material really easy to understand,1
Professor Aizura's class structure is pointless and makes it so that you can get a really bad grade by missing classes where he has an in class assignment (20%) and discussion posts (also 20%). It's counterintuitive and he will ignore your emails when you need his answer the most. Class content is interested but the readings are soooo long.,0
Avoid unless you want the most fluff-filled and hardest online ENG 102 class.,0
"She is a great teacher,very sweet and very easy,she accepts ALL late work at anytime.",1
"If she says shes doing the flipped approach get out now, this class was horrible. She did not teach us anything we had to read the chapters and it was like reading spanish. Gave us a quiz BEFORE we had time to ask any queations. All around terrible class",0
"Take his class and you will wish you dead several times throughout the semester. His lectures are boring, his voice is monotone, his tests are stupid hard for no reason, the power points are not even close to what is on the test. I had him for a summer semester online and he shows the class averages on Canvas. Most of the class did not pass. warned",0
"He will mostly teach his own tool - JDeodrant. The mid-term is 50% of the total grade with no clear instructions at all. Just handed a project which we have to refactor within 3 hours, in addition to explaining reasons on GitHub. The main issue, no guidelines on number of refactoring. He deducted marks for issues his tool itself didn't detect.",0
"This is a prime example of a professor meant to only teach to math majors. He has the pace and brisk attitude of a prof bored of teaching lower level math. To a savant, he would probably be well suited, but to an average- or even slightly better than average- learner, he's too fast, too intimidating, and too brief.",0
"She is a very good teacher!! She is very detailed with her lectures and labs which helps, but is also stressful when it comes to test taking. But she is a very good teacher, would highly recommend taking her class, you will definitely learn from her!!",1
"Very educated teacher who expects his students to be on the same wavelength. That being said i learned a lot about the preternatural, so many other fields of science, and even some Latin. Pay attention, do the hw and don't skip.",1
"He is a very nice guy. Very clear, and has an interest in the subject. Quizzes can be a little confusing, but he is very fair and always willing to help. I'd take him again.",1
"tends to rant about random topics in class. He'll pick out really obscure historical events and focus on them for days. Not too bad, but definitely not fun. One time we actually talked about the rap group fu-schnickens for an entire class period. other than that though it kinda sucks. research papers are the only grades. avoid him.",0
I have never been so frustrated with a class. The quizzes she gives isn't over stuff that you have recently gone over. Doesn't do examples to completion. Treats you like you are stupid. Grades super heavy. She deducted points for something that wasn't in my final answer. Doesn't give partial credit. expects you to spend every waking hour studying.,0
I suggest switching out of his class ASAP if you're not a quick learner. Mr. Bannow will expect you to know things he vaguely goes over (like the math portions of chapters). Be ready to teach yourself or hire a semester long tutor or you WILL be lost. He will get angry/frustrated if you have any questions. Most impatient teacher I've ever met.,0
"A pathetic excuse for a teacher. Pompous, arrogant, and flaky. Class was pointless- showed up late, lectures were unfocused, and test were difficult because most of the material were not in lectures. I got a lot of other homework done from other classes  though :).",0
"HORRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Acts like you have your degree, gets mad at questions, arrogant, rude and makes you feel dumb. Dont let your gpa suffer. She explains nothing clearly and goes super quick in power points. Chem is about memorizing but she gave us a whole chart to memorize 2 days before an exam. Absolutely the worst",0
"Ok so here's the thing about Arevalo:She can't speak English well but the class is so easy you can teach yourself. Show up for class because she knows when you're not there. She is a relatively nice person, and funny on some occasions. She will NOT repeat herself so you're better off getting the information from someone else. Overall she's not bad",0
Best instructor I've had at RRC. His lectures are interesting and you engage in what hes teaching you. He'll help you with anything you need. Easy to contact. Useful content. I would take his class again in a heartbeat. ,1
Prof. Shine is really a sweetheart! He really cares about his students and how they are doing rather than just pushing work on you. His work expectations were clear and grading is fair. The only downside of his class was that his voice is so soothing it is easy to doze off while he is reading.,1
"Although Conrad does give a lot of hw (online and in textbook), the material she assigns actually helps understanding the concepts and prepare you for her exams. She is very organized with her lesson plan; does both PPT and notes style lecture. All prelim exams have a 10pt EC opportunity and 20pt EC for the final. Very generous grading for labs.",1
"Pretty easy class. Few, but simple assignments and a final project at the end which is also fairly simple. He goes over and does part of the homeworks. Tests are open laptop/notes and consist of 3-4 questions similar to the homework but slightly more difficult. If you found CS151 easy, then you'll probably feel the same about this class.",1
I took this class in 2020 and I don't know if it was just the circumstances but this class was lacking structure and presence. Lectures were hard to sit through sometimes but it was an easy pass. If you are looking for surface level insight into the field consider this class.,0
she was great.  if you show her your working hard and actually care about the class she will help you out a lot!  id love to take from her again,1
"Here's the thing about Pederson. He's extremely attractive and he is constantly trying to get students to discuss in class. But if you don't talk you lose participation points. And his tests are really in depth and difficult, so if you don't know everything you will fail. His class is really freaking difficult.",0
"I learned a lot and worked hard, but my grade did not reflect my efforts. The highest grade on assignments/exams is usually a B. Average grade is barely passing. You will learn a lot in her class, but at the cost of your GPA; no matter how hard you work.",0
"You have to come to class and do homework to pass. She posts everything on moodle,  is very organized, and willing to help if you just ask! Grades tough, but explains to you what she expects out of you. I am definitely taking her for Statistics next semester.",1
"WOW. i literally met with her everyday after class, went to the writing center- and spent atleast 5 hours weekly studying for her class, Still got a C. She is ridiculous- and expects you to answer exactly the way she wants- or no points. Deflates grades- highest grade in the class was a b-. this is NOT ok",0
"Traditional style lecture with ppt slides that she skips thru(states wont be tested on but sometimes are), very few examples considering its a science course. No hmwk to better understand material. Xcredit assignment after, 1st exam that helped comprehend material. Make sure you read all chapter & review all ppt slides before class.",0
Professor Dunham assigns weekly homework on MyMathLab that tend to go beyond his lectures in class. 5 tests make or break your grade and if you miss one you must rely on your final test score to make it up. HW is over 150 (5pt) Mastery quizzes you must get 66% or above to get credit. Started with almost a full Class and only seven or eight remain.,0
"Close to retirement & she could care less, skips steps when teaching, Hates 2 show how 2 work problem fully, 2 HW assignments & quizzes online wkly, Shell never know how well u do individually because all work is done & graded online, Test are in class & must show work & thats the only time shell know if u know how 2 do prob & still wont care",0
"I took 27 and 20 from Thana. He picks good texts from top universities. His lectures are detailed. Best CIS lecturer in Peralta. He assigns homework that is too hard and there really aren't resources available to help the students. I teaches at a university level but we skip lab and don't have discussion, GSI's or tutors. He knows the material.",1
"A great all around person/professor. She's amazing, easy to work with, understanding, attentive, passionate about her subject, etc. The material was great (3 essays throughout the semester). She never ever made the class boring. I seriously love her and worked my schedule around so I could take her again, she's just that great. Please take her!!",1
This class was very boring. Not to hard you just had to turn in the required papers,1
"Tough, learned a lot.",1
He doesn't teach. Make sure you get your book and read it. Friends with programming experience always help too. Don't rely on Hoagland for any help at all. In fact if your really need a professor to talk to go see Randy Riness.,0
"More than half of the class got D's or F's and Dr. Stone confirmed it in an unprofessional letter to the students. There is no mathematical curve in this class. So if everybody gets below a 60% as their final grade, they are all getting D's or F's. And he said doing the homework and easy quizzes are count as a curve. Avoid this guy at all costs!!!",0
She kinda became the permanent sub for Murphy's ENC1101 in 2017 so I didn't really get a look into the way she would organize the class. She wants you to succeed and gives you many resources to do so but is a tough grader. If you enjoy English than you could thrive under her expectations but if you're looking to just get by take Eileen Murphy.,1
"Dr. Zhao is so nice! He is very good at explaining difficult concepts and doesn't assume you remember concepts from classes you probably took years ago. He is very nice outside of class and offers extra credit! His lectures are usually at 8am, but you get used to it through the semester, and he gives random extra credit for showing up.",1
"Passionate about his subject, but lectures can be hard to follow. He tells stories with no relevance to the curriculum. What you read and what he lectures does not always equate to the same. To do well on his test, take notes on what he says in class and write that as your answer.",0
"If you're reading this I hope it's not too late. This professor had no idea what she wanted in an essay, didn't show up to half the classes and didn't grade papers until the very end. Prob could've gotten a B if I worked a little harder but AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"She is very nice and grades fairly. There are a lot of papers, but nothing too difficult.",1
"Please, Don't take her class. Even if shes the last option because of registration deadline, just wait until next semester She's truly not interested in teaching or helping you to understand the material. Unless you have a gift in the sciences or can teach yourself, you will be wasting your time and money. Please study with a professor that cares.",0
"At first she seems like a hard teacher, but she is so knowledgeable about the topics.  I absolutely loved her class and she made me fall in love with a political science major! I definitely recommend her if you are willing to work and go to class.  her class is totally manageable and she really pushes you to your fullest potential!",1
"He teaches from PowerPoint slides, extremely monotone. Gives homework but its not mandatory. If you struggle with math, I wouldn't suggest this professor his style of teaching isn't a very effective one. Unfortunately if you go to Armstrong campus he's the only professor who teaches Survey of Calc.",0
Instruction in clear. Weekly homework is required in order to learn subject. Instructor shows enthusiam for the subject and makes accounting come to life. She is open to questions and encourages class participation. The class moves quickly and there is a lot of information presented.,1
"Horrible, I regret taking this class. He very opinionated, waste time talking about random things, get angry when you call him out for not doing his job properly, not encouraging towards his Students rather put them down for asking a question or giving their opinions, he not welcoming and he's very rude I just couldn't for it to be over!!",0
"Lisa was such a comprehensive teacher. She asks for your own input on the assignments given, extra time, etc. She is not such a harsh grader either and her comments are always helpful. However, her class drags. It can seem like forever until it is time to leave. Have to constantly keep waking yourself up.",1
"Ron seems like a genuinely kind man. He sends positive canvas announcements out telling students to enjoy their weekends. He has some funny stories, but on the whole I just don't feel that he's a skilled instructor. His class feels dry and insubstantial. I am obsessed with criminology and the criminal justice system, but he lost me. Sorry, Ron.",0
"At first, I was dreading this 5:30pm class, but Dr. Heske made the course exciting and bearable. He is a great professor and is always available to give feedback and help with topics. His tests are fair and only cover the written notes. If you work hard and seek help when needed, you can get an A or B in the course. PCHEM is not that bad!",1
"Dr. Holtan is an excellent teacher! She's caring and makes lecture very fun and interesting.  There isn't a ton of homework, and I didn't open the book once so don't get it. As long as you take decent notes in class, and put in work on the projects you'll do great. The final project is really difficult though, but she helps you through it.",1
"Excellent cours et excellent prof sur le plan académique, un peu plus discutable sur le plan humain (dommage pour un prof de sciences humaines)",1
Just avoid him.  Take the other professors who understand students and how they learn.,0
She is a great professor. She will take her time explaining to make sure you understand. Her final exam is long: 30 long multiple choice questions and one essay. She prepares you well. She offered three reviews and was willing to answer every question.,1
Class was very focused on hands-on learning which was difficult but fun - 95% labs and 5% lecture. LCDR expects you to do your best to figure it out on your own but is very knowledgeable and will answer questions if you genuinely can't figure it out. Quizzes and tests are not easy but are straightforward.,1
"Posted a file that got corrupted and didn't repost till the day of the quiz on it, never answers emails outside of her 1:30 hour office hours. You will hate this class if you expect it to be easy or interesting. If i could give her a zero i would.",0
He's new at teaching and is still learning which means he's awful at the moment. His study guides have typos and his answers aren't even right. He takes away points if you want to check your online connect homework to see if its correct. His classes are slow and he often goes on tangents about Greek philosophy.,0
"Dr. Bailey is very direct. I had him for lab and he wasn't exactly thrilled to help his students. One day he kicked us all out of the lab because he didn't want to wait any longer. However, he is a good professor if you pay attention.",0
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
"Never showed up to class on time. Don't expect papers back for a long time. She's a complete mess. Super nice woman, but avoid at all costs.",0
Class isnt that hard but it was very boring to the point where many students just stopped coming to class including myself. I think the homework was also pretty difficult for a beginner.,1
"LA does an amazing job lecturing so paying attention is no problem. If you attend class regularly there is no way you can fail. She lays all the material out in a way that is easy to follow, she is very approchable and kind. If you have the chance to take her class do it.",1
She is a terrible teacher and spends most of the class talking about her problems. Her attendance is mandatory so you have no choice but to spend hours listing to her talk about her mother-in-law for hours. She gives no clear guidelines for projects and just expects you to figure it out on your own.,0
Shes a VERY HARD teacher shes horrible she never helps you when you need the help she expects you to know how to do the work take someone else who will help you.,0
"Harvey is the best professor for chemistry within the LACCD system. She clearly tells you what you need to study for her exams, gives you countless examples of every type of problem that you will encounter on the exams and makes the lab time very constructive and focused. You literally just have to listen to what she says and you can get an A",1
Alisa is a wonderful professor. She is extremely helpful and goes out of her way to make sure that her students succeed. I was afraid of Math until I got into her class!,1
I DO NOT recommend this professor.,0
Easy class but tends to be rude and demanding when it is unnecessary. Just do the work and u pass easy A,1
Professor Butler genuinely cares about her students and tries to make chemistry as interesting as possible. She works hard to interact with students during lecture and has fair tests that apply the material from the homework/lecture.,1
"I took Chem 102 with Prof. Organian a few years back and really learned a lot from her. Sadly, she has passed. RIP professor and thanks for the A grade.",1
"Summer social problem online class, so much assignments, 2 big papers, 4 tests, and lots of activities and discussion board",0
"Dr. Townsend has high expectations.  She wants you to learn in her class.  The class time goes fast and hw is limited.  Watch out for her tests.  Make sure to talk to her with questions and interests.  I recieved a 4.0, so she is possible.",1
Does not explain anything. Lazy does not reply to email or mymathlab questions. Poor communication skills if you can stay far away from this teacher. ,0
"I was a little skeptical to take an online communications course, but I was pleasantly surprised. Every week there is a chapter reading and quiz on pearson revel, and either a journal prompt or a discussion board to respond to. There are also several extra credit opportunities. As long as you read the chapters and do the work, you'll do fine.",1
"This professor was great! Do not take Spanish with anyone else! She believes that this is a class that should not drop your GPA. She makes the material very easy to remember and helps you learn a lot. She prepares you well for the tests, so you know exactly what you need to work on going into it. Highly recommend!",1
Professor Palma is probably my favorite professor. The classroom was merged with Professor Ferrigno so it was in an auditorium. They each will teach every other chapter and the other one will be giving extra help during the class in the back of the room if you do not get it. *ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY MISS 2 CLASSES AND YOU'RE OUT!* got an easy A,1
"Cassells is tough, a hard grader, assigns a lot of readings, has a strong accent, snaps if you asks questions, & singles out students.  The class was FULL, then 2 weeks later, there were about 15 students left.  Everyone in class hated her & felt that she was of pure evil.  If you take her class you will end up leaving a comment like this.  BEWARE.",0
She is so sweet and really knows what she's talking about! Not many professors can lecture and make sense without a power point or notes! She made me really like psychology!,1
"Honestly Dr. Monroe was the best professor I've ever had! If you want to take an interesting class and an awesome teacher, take any of Dr. Monroe's courses, I guarentee if you show up for class, you won't be disappointed! Do the work and study for the exams and you'll get an A. His lectures are amazing too, they keep you interested and entertained.",1
"Impossible to understand, manages to pinpoint the most boring piece/artist possible and talks about it/them for 40 minutes. (not that you can understand her anyway.) She is not a friendly or understanding person and the instructions she gives on assignments are somehow both unreasonably rigid and unclear. avoid if possible.",0
"Took his CS 220 class, and Intro to Algorithms class.  Worst teacher I've ever had.  He threw me out of his office hours once, because he didn't like that I missed class that day.  Doesn't speak English well at all.  You won't learn a thing in his class.  Drop, immediately.",0
"I enjoyed this class with Trevor. I wouldn't say ""speech"" is my favorite class but he made it fun. Chill dude. Take him if you can. Graded on what you would expect. Various speeches, critiques, and participation.",1
"I have taken multiple classes with Dr. Mavica! She is the best and truly inspires me. She is so sweet and knows her stuff. Her lectures are amazing and keep you engaged, I always enjoy going to class. She gives some extra credit for attending class but it is not much but could help if you have a borderline grade. Her happy attitude is contagious!",1
"What a wonder class, he became a Purdue faculty scholar and outstanding engineering teacher in 2019.",1
"This professor rambles, he is boring and thinks he's funny but he's not. On top of that he discriminated against me both to me and to the student conflict resolution center. I have accommodations granted me by the DRC and he is denying me those and also misgendering me to faculty who reach out to him. Absolutely awful.",0
"Professor Thomas is hands down the best English teacher I've ever had. If you're taking English 103, you HAVE to try your hardest to take it with her. She's absolutely awesome, gives great feedback, and has a very relaxed atmosphere to her class that I felt helped me learn and feel comfortable.",1
SHE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU WILL GET. I had her for both a design fundamentals class and art history. She was extremely helpful. You can definitely tell that she cares for her students so much. If you ever have to take any art class and shes a professor that I would definitely recommend taking her.,1
"Professor Drake clearly knows what he is talking about and conveys most of his ideas clearly, I have a few complaints. He spends far too much time referencing things from other courses and works not pertaining to the course, it is easy to get confused if you haven't taken his other courses. He assigns more reading than every class I took combined.",1
"She never responded to any of my course messages/emails. I never got any feedback on any of my assignments, which is shocking because I usually get a lot of feedback on my assignments from professors at UNT. She also grades in chunks so you have no idea the status of your grade unless it's midway or at the very end when grades are due.",0
"Class was hard, but Tiwari was really helpful.",1
Can't recommend Prof Washburn enough! She is amazing! Lovely lady! ,1
"She's very unclear, her lectures are beyond boring, helpful I'm sure but also at times I'm questioning relevancy. The entire class is one long group project which she can be very unclear about, she lets you know when things are due the day before and then when no one turns it she questions why. Pretty easy and fast grader,that is the only plus side",0
"He is simply one of the kindest people you will ever meet. He is so open about everything and really makes everyone in class feel comfortable about sharing personal experiences. He has a huge background of schooling and knowledge. He really knows a lot and teaches you in a fun, easy way.",1
REALL GRAT TEACHER WITH PRACTICAL WORK ECPERIENCE RATHER THAT BOOK ORIENTED,1
Didn't do much but still took something away from her class.  Never minded going to class because it was always really laid back and comfortable. A few writing assignments but nothing tedious.  Easy grader. No harsh deductions for late work or missing class.  Very interesting and kind woman.  Will talk to you for hours if you let her. Def recommend,1
"Prof. O'Gorman was more than helpful during the entire class.  I travel for leisure and missed a few classes and he understood that life happens and ensured that I did the work but I was able to understand the work and stay up with the information.  I would definitely take this professor again.  He is not tough, he expects you to do the work. Fact.",1
"One of the worst profs I've ever had. She doesn't look at the students when she lectures or acknowledge your existence. Seems like she's reading off her slides but all she says about the artworks is that they are ""important"" because they ""changed things."" Pointless. The TA marked everything and I did really well in the course but she was awful.",0
Nice Prof. Simulation sucks!!!! Test were easy. Don't take notes they are online. Have to do a Presentation of Wall Street Journal Article.,0
"Best professor in the English department. He obviously cares about his students and made the course fun, interesting, and important. I would argue this class was the most informative American Lit course I have ever taken. His hair is fantastic and he's hilarious. Take him if you can!!",1
"If you show up and do the requirements, you will get a good grade.",1
Though he is a nice person I hate his teaching style. I prefer teachers to teach us the material in class and then go home and read over what we learned about in the book. He expects us to read first and then he skips around the chapter without really talking about any topic. He grades hard and doesn't give very good feedback either.,0
"Linda is a reasonable professor. She tries to make lectures interesting, but the content can get rather dull after a while. It is therefore difficult to pay attention during the lecture. If you add discussion to the class, it helps. The interview assignment required a ten page paper.. toughest thing of the semester, but an interesting assignment.",1
"Professor O'Quinn is an extremely knowledgeable professor who knows what he is talking about. However, I found his lectures very hard to follow & did not know what points he was trying to get across a lot of the time. His assignments are ambitious & unclear but he is very approachable and brilliant. Take a class with him if you want a challenge.",0
"I hate the lab from his TA, seems like they are going to fail all students",0
The professor really knows his stuff,1
"I have heard goo things about this professor, but please DO NOT TAKE if you are taking him online. He has no clue how to run and online class and we never meet. We doesn't add any assignment to the D2L calendar, so its a fun game of guess when the next assignment is due, at to top it off he take of 50 POINTS for one day late.",0
"Prof. Nelson is a great instructor. She's passionate about anthro. and it shows in her lectures. She will talk about her research from Africa to help contextualize concepts from class, which I found helpful. Her readings and class projects are interesting and sometimes can be challenging. I reccomend taking her, stay caught up!",1
Terrible prof. Shouldn't even be teaching anymore.,0
"UH, well Thrasher is a all right teacher.  The problems that she has is she gets to class late and keeps you late.  She also tries to put TO MUCH on tests. For real, there is only so much a human being can retain if they study 2 days ahead of time. ALSO, buying the book is a waist of money. We DON'T USE IT!",1
He is the best professor ever!,1
"She does not care how well you adapt to the class or not. She does not care how busy you are with your life. Her grading is horrible. In the last week, she decided to drop ""points"" from my weekly quizzes which brought my letter grade down from B to C. She could care less that I tried hard to study and to pass her 20 question quiz in 20 mins. Avoid!",0
"Dr. Khadka is a great professor, he is very smart, and it can be seen from his teaching style. his lecture were great and his structure of teaching was excellent and helped me thrive in this class.  Everything was organized and was easy to follow for the most part!",1
She doesn't know how to teach. She is a tough grader. She doesn't know anything about cybercrime except anything from the book. She claims she is a lawyer but doesn't know anything about cyber laws and such. Her exams are very heavy and tough grader. She expect a group presentation and final paper,0
Comes off as a cool professor but expects us to just understand the material from the get go. He doesn't clarify when we have questions and gets mad when we don't understand. The course itself was very difficult to understand.,0
"Terrible professor. Wants students to communicate with him, when you do, if you are incorrect or reflecting a difference of opinion, you are berated in front of the class. Goes off on irrelevant tangents for lengths at a time and then complains that the class is so far behind. His study guide is in his own verbiage so it is difficult to research",0
He doesn't explain anything well and the entire grade was just based of the midterm and the final. Homework wasn't collected and quizzes don't affect grades. The tests ask for a lot of definitions and proofs and had way too many parts to finish in 1 hr. He doesn't communicate with his TAs properly so they don't know what is going on either.,0
"After having several emotional breaks due to her, I changed majors.",0
This class is all group work literally ever single assignment and she grades so so hard my group got a 50 on just questions for an interview project and she offered no extra credit dont take this class,0
"To sum it up, Vannozzi was the absolute worst professor or teacher that I have ever had. He expects you to pass everything in on time, or you will lose 50% of the grade, but it takes him more than a month to pass back homework. He is impossible to make meetings with, he is unclear in his lectures and just does not know how to teach. DO NOT TAKE",0
Supportive of his students and responds promptly to emails.,1
"Boring and stiffly well-mannered (not friendly). A teach-yourself class; lectures consisted of the captions of the pictures in the text, verbatim, nothing more. Lecture exams didn't always follow the text, so you couldn't fully prepare yourself since the only way to teach yourself was from the text. No help given during labs.",0
"Professor Gonzalez is a good English Teacher. I will admit he is a bit strict on attendance and he doesn't like to repeat lecture. So if you miss a day in class, hopefully someone can help you out. Other than that, he is extremely helpful and easy to talk to as well. I do recommend him, but just make sure to show up to class and do the work.",1
"Dr. Ward had a tendency for arrogance that I did not enjoy. Our class would often become lost when she led discussions and have to repeatedly ask her to rephrase her prompts. To do well in her class you must come prepared, but the readings are fairly painless and tests fair. To do really well play to her political leanings, which will be obvious.",0
"This was my least favorite class at UMBC- Shady Grove. I don't like her lectures because she goes off on tangents that aren't related to the lecture. I found that attending her lectures made me more confused. Some of her quizzes contain errors that might lead to someone answer incorrectly. When students point this out, she becomes quite flippant.",0
"See the tags included? This course is the complete opposite of that. On a serious note, Hilke is very clearly passionate and wants to see you succeed, but struggles to explain even the most basic concepts. The course is not difficult if you follow along in the textbook and do assignments but his lectures and demos will leave you very frustrated.",0
"this made me reconsider if i truly liked music or not. fascinating teaching style, his lectures remind me of slow cinema. went through an existential crisis but i'm still doing the 1 point quiz every week",0
"Her class consists of 1-2 quizzes a week they' re kinda difficult. Her lecture videos for the quizzes are from off YouTube, there is usually 3-4 of them that are 15 min long. Study question assignments: 3-4 reading assignments with questions to answer. Always one discussion due every week and to do that you usually have to watch a video or movie.",0
"I had him for MATH 1500, he made the most informative easy to understand videos, his tests were fair, his live lectures were great , everything about him is amazing. Best prof ever!",1
"I'm not a history person and this class was easy, tests are only on vocabulary words that she gives you- lectures help but not a lot. Attendance only on Fridays.",1
"What a disappointment in this on site class.This professor can not communicate clearly, lacks people skills, and can not verbalize her clear expections,and appears to be gender biased. You may revise your essays, but the revisions lack clarity and direction from her review.Assignmts not rtnd on time.Short fuse needs to remain online essay grader",0
"Great teacher, super interesting. If you like economics or if you are majoring in it definitely take him, you will learn a lot. If you are looking for an easy professor, there are easier professors than him. He only gives you 4 tests which you have two classes to finish in, basically if you dont finish the test you can just go study and come back ",1
"one assignment one week but assignments are really difficult after midterm. one TA told us the average grades are 30%-40%. if you want to take this course, be careful.",0
I love him. erm uhh his class. XD Great teacher. Great Clarity. Great to look at... erm great notes to look at.  He makes me feel smarter. I work harder just to impress him.   ,1
"This class is supposed to be an introduction to linear algebra, but Falk teaches it like a graduate course.  His schedule was far different, and much harder than other sections of this class.  Tests were only partially related to homework problems, and often required a huge leap in understanding from what was covered in lecture.",0
"easy online class, just one discussion board a week and you reply to one student. no tests or quizzes. the final is a one pg reflection of the course. we had really interesting topics and readings, easy class and you actually learn a lot. solid professor for online. take him!",1
"Mr. Person is a very nice and respected gentleman. He was a police officer for many years as well as a dispatcher. He is now a security officer at Enloe Hospital in Chico. He does not lecture on the stuff that will be on test, but when he does it is brief. He will go through the book and tell you each word you need to know for the test. Easy A!",1
Easy class. I hate public speaking but she doesn't critique you too hard. If you do the assignments you will get an A. 1 midterm and 1 final. Very easy A,1
"MS is a really phenomenal chemistry teacher. He understands that not everyone will need to know Orgo for the rest of their life, so he teaches the essentials, and really avoids trivial things. He's an engaging lecturer, and made it easy for everyone to do well. The tests are tough but overall fair.",1
"If you try your best, you can get an A. He is fair. Slacking off/not doing your readings will hurt your grade. Follow the instructions he gives rather than thinking you know better. I love him. He is cute when he gets passionate and he is funny. One of my favorite professors. I have taken him twice. Sadly I cant take him again bc Im graduating.",1
Professor Hines means well but doesn't come across clear. Took her class for Diversity in the Workplace.  She talks in circles and is confusing.  If the readings say one thing she says another. Be prepared to take notes and fast. She does not post slides and she only leaves them up for a moment in class. She makes each student repeat what they read,0
"Her micro class was the most frustrating college experience I've had so far. Her teaching style was just reading off of a power point, I didn't learn a thing during lectures, or in lab. The only way to survive this class is to memorize the textbook word for word. The tests were ridiculous as well. ",0
"Literally do not take this professor. I took this as a mandatory credit and will be receiving my first C ever in college. He grades as if everyone in his class will be professional writers. Not clear in feedback, nor does he ever talk about how he wants papers to be written. I do admit that the class discussions are interesting but not worth it.",0
"Mrs. Peters is a well organized teacher and is always prepared for class but her teaching methods are horrible. She teaches everything the long way. Alot of our class had issues with her method of teaching. Not very helpful when a question is asked, always gives general answers. Very sarcastic attitude. Not very helpful. Would not recommend her!",0
"Had a bit of a problem with this professor,  I am slated to walk across the stage and get my diploma in 5 days, and the man still has not graded any of our assignments....  I will give credit where it is due, he is very knowledgeable, and intelligent.  But a poor teacher, he slacks very hard and just curves the final exam and passes people.",0
"Prof. Koehlinger was great. A decent amount of reading, but not an overwhelming amount. Quizzes were exclusively on the readings. She is a fair grader and very responsive. The only thing I didn't like was for weekly discussions the responses to other students had to be done on different days, but other than that it was a good class.",1
"Should not be a professor. He does not ramble on for 2 12 hours, he RANTS. Is not a fair grader at all when it comes to the case study that barely are a part of your grade. Have to do a ridiculous case study on Nucor that you need to site your sources for. Easy midterm. the BSG game isn't simple but doable. Would not recommend, take someone else.",0
run...,0
LOVED this Prof I wish I could take her again for more classes but she is moving,1
"My lab with Marylene was great, she creates a nice relaxed atmosphere and is known to crack a joke or two. I look forward to future classes with her.",1
"Too much reading, I do not learn my reading 30 pages of information and then taking 4 different tests on it. I will NEVER take this class again. I just had a mental breakdown over this class and I'm over it.",0
Terrible lecture class. Seemed like she was just putting a check in the box. Rushed through power points with no interest to go slow enough for note taking.,0
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
"Dr. Lorton is a great teacher. He does each problem step by step and explains things really well. He is a little monotone, but he does give study guides for his test which are REALLY helpful. Solid choice!",1
Worst professor i have EVERRRR had . She does not help you whatsoever. Expects you to know every single thing. On blackboard her power points have atleast 105 slides. EXTREMELY tough grader. Takes of points for the smallest things such as adding a 0 or removing one. Test are weighed ridiculously high. do yourself a favor DONT TAKE HER AT ALLLLLL.,0
"Smart but tough. I'm not a bad/lazy student but I do struggle in this class. Midterm & final assignment are worth a huge chunk of your grade. If you don't do well on one or both, it is unlikely you will be able to pass. He can seem arrogant but will sometimes clarify. Very tough. Take notes/pay attn. Not super awful but I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Paula makes the class interesting and I enjoy going to class - that's hard for a prof to do, especially when the class is 4 days a week. She gives really good feedback and gently corrects mistakes when speaking - it is a comfortable environment to speak spanish in because she does not judge or make you feel judged. She wants her students to do well",1
Severely annoying. Treats her GE level History 146 class like it's an important upper level course. Whines when no one participates or take notes on what she's rambling on about.,0
Really fun and enjoyable class. I enjoyed how we walked through the instructions as a class so that no one would get lost.,1
"BEST PROFESSOR AT SUNY OW. VERY EASY ON GRADING AND LABS ARE A BREEZE! such a little cutie very respectful and cares about her students.... I LEARNED MORE FROM HER LAB CLASS THAN I DID IN LECTURE THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING!!!!! Amazing professor take her for an easy A just make sure to do all the pre lab, post lab, and lab reports.",1
"Stevenson is one of my favorite professors. A&P is hard but she makes it the easiest she can. She knows what she is talking about and is very helpful during and also outside of class. Just like any other class, you do have to actually learn the material but she makes it enjoyable. I 100% recommend taking her for A&P both semesters if you can!",1
very interesting even when he is off topic. Very nice guy. Grades hard on papers,1
"Dr. Venus is a nice guy. E-mail him if you have any questions because he is very helpful! He can be kind of harsh at grading, just listen in class, because if he mentioned it, he's going to expect you to have it done well on your paper. Very helpful professor!",1
"This class was extremely confusing to me. I asked for help couple of times but only gained more confusion. Bases your grade on the class avg. so grading is not too bad. However, I wish I did not take this class. Just be alert if you are going to take it!",0
good class,1
He is by all means an easy A. He loves to joke around during class and not gonna lie I don't remember anything pertaining to Poli. econ. but I do remember that he was funny. Attendance is not mandatory. If this class doesn't directly relate to your major it can be a little boring. There's only a few assignments and the essays are finnesable.,1
"To be honest, I have no idea why people are saying he's interesting.  I find him so dull, I've never seen people fall asleep in a class before, but kids pass out all the time, it's absurd. I love history, but Pierce does not cut it for me. I would definitely NOT recommend him.",0
I took Bushey for lecture online and it was by far my hardest class. I would study for the quizzes so much and take a lot of notes while watching his lecture videos and still fail most of the quizzes. Theres a quiz every thurs worth a lot of points and he gives u barely any time. Dont take him unless your super confident and dont mind stress.,0
"so boring... the only teacher I ever had who made us buy a book he wrote.  prof really comes off as a hack... many students slept in class, and he let 1-2 kids dominate discussions (pushing their agendas).  Really not worth taking",0
"He is a respectable professor, and his lectures are very meticulous. If you have any questions, he will answer them patiently. In short, he is a great professor.",1
"Federal govt Pros: Free txbook, hw& exams (2attempts each) are easy, found on quizlet. Cons: Not enough time given on quizzes & exams even if u use quizlet, hw takes hours to complete. 4 writing assignments 500 word each, & graded harshly Going to class is pretty useless, login in daily. No extra cred or makeups. 3 pts from a B. Avoid her class.",0
"This professor does not give you a clear understanding of the assignments and she does not take the time to answer students questions, she is just worried about getting though the slides. You will end up figuring out each assignment on your own.",0
"He will doubtless stimulate you to engage and fuel more thought/ideas into your own work. He also inspires you to imagine yourself as an academic. Beyond this, he is incredibly helpful, intelligent --all the qualities that are really valuable.",1
"I took MAT 099 and MAT 121 with Miss Dashley. She is an amazing teacher and I wish I could take more of my future math classes with her. She was always enthusiastic, presented her ideas clearly, and took the time to answer any questions we had.  She clearly loves math and wants to share that with her students. ",1
The quizzes are really hard. This class was very stressful. Quizzes were 15 questions each and they'd take at least half a day to do finish. If youre in nursing i do NOT recommend her. If you have no choice then get a study group together help each other on the quizzes.,0
"This Professor has a clear grading criteria. There  are 4 tests. Each test is 30% take home and 70% in class. His tests are very clear. Just go to the mathlab if you do not understand his explanations. His explanations are not the best, but you can easily get an A if you do the homework and prepare for the tests.",1
"If Tim is teaching a class you are interested in taking...you MUST take his class. He is extremely adept at conveying the fundamentals of accounting clearly and with real life examples to boot (he is from the industry, not just teaching from academia). I have had other teachers who do not explain concepts well at all making it difficult to learn.",1
"I have never rated any professor before but because this class was SO bad and because he was the most boring teacher I have ever had, I want to warn anyone who thinks about taking this class or this teacher in general...DON'T DO IT.",0
"Dr. B is a great professor, very inspiring. His grading may be confusing but it's very hard to fail his class, she give extra credit for EVERY EXAM .",1
"4 short message drafts 1 research paper 1,500 -2000words group project revising a brochure 2 in class presentation one with group and one with the research report on a Fortune 500 company",1
"I'm telling you now, never write about abortion and race. Dr. Kelly is very opinionated. You know how most teacher are paid to grade you on content, well she doesn't do that. If you write about something she doesn't like, don't be surprised if she argues with you in a conference and gives you a C because you dont feel the same way. DONT TAKE HER",0
Honestly she is my favorite teacher! It's lecture heavy but she tries to make it fun and she has small quizzes (that she gives answers to) to keep you engage. There's a lot of info to remember but nothing insane. If you show up and study you'll make an A. Plus she gives a lot of extra credit.,1
"He only used powerpoints, and there were no tests, only three essays.  The final was an essay question that he gave you ahead of time.  He was a nice guy with a British accent.",1
I'm not a public health major but was interested in taking the class due to my major being Health sciences. I was hesitant on taking it due to the heavy course work from my other class but i'm glad I did. Her lectures are very interesting and talks about how the topics connects to the real world.,1
"Started on Ch. 9 on the first day in a difficult subject for first-level math (complicated statistics). No intro, nothing. Horrible, said on first day she didn't care if we ever got sick and to not ""bother"" her with emails. Withdrew within the second week. Waste of time",0
"She doesn't care about her students & is a VERY hard grader. She doesn't give enough time to complete exams & we had to be on zoom AND respondus during them. There's A LOT of knewton hw. Her lectures are confusing, taught like you should already know the material, & she expects you to have everything memorized from algebra, precalculus, & calc 1.",0
"She would try to engage the class, but I don't think teaching is her strong point. The online Cengage program is ridiculous, the textbook reads like it's catered towards high schoolers, but the material in the exams online is nothing like what we learned. I barely passed them, despite having a strong interest and background in abnormal psychology.",0
Nice guy but hardest class I have ever had to take. DO NOT take this class. Exams are impossible to study for (over 21 chapters) and he is not clear on what he expects from students.,0
"I had Prof Berry during the semester that we switched online due to COVID-19. Although it was a huge change for all of us, she really went above & beyond in her efforts to show up for us. Excel is not an easy class, but she made videos and held Zooms for all the tough concepts, responded quickly to emails, was a fair grader, etc. I 10/10 recommend.",1
"He is not a bad teacher but, he goes quickly and will sometimes poke at you in front of the class for asking questions frequently. To do well in the class be sure to read the book before lectures and take notes. You can google how to do the homework for help. My class had 10/11 tests because chem dept. was trying a new thing, not too bad.",1
"Stay away from any of her classes as much as you can! I used to wish that I could get hit by a car before going to her class. I cannot urge you enough to stay away from this professor. I may have gotten a decent grade but I had to fight tooth and nail for that. Please, stay away.",0
"Cute little French Canadian lady. She gets rather impatient with students at times, but is an overall good teacher.",1
Do not take IE 332 with Wachs. Period. He's better in IE 474,0
Horrible teacher...never returns any grades so you have NO idea how you are doing in the self-paced class! Talks low and very creepy,0
"Best prof ever! He makes a difficult subject understandable, and his lectures are funny and entertaining. No penalty for missing class, but you won't want to!",1
"The best aspect of this class was the professor himself. His lectures are clear and concise , as well as he engages the students in a fun way. I would recommend this class. The professor makes himself available to effectively communicate with his students and genuinely wants them to succeed in his class. Professor Buck Is wonderful!!",1
He teaches by telling stories but know one in my class knew the points of the stories. You have to make friends with your classmate and need to know where they are if they don't come to class. It's your responsibility to keep track of your classmates. I would never take from him again. If you want a amazing communication teacher take from Tracy,0
"Great teacher, and she uses a ton of examples. The reports are a pain but they actually do make sense in the long run.",1
Participate weekly and you will succeed. Follow her feed back verbatum and you will not have a problem passing the class. Really helpful.,1
"This class was ABSOLUTELY awful. If you like not having curves, extra credit, or even being considered for partial credit, take this class.",0
"Worst teacher in St.peters history...dont get her she will give you an ""F' on every paper",0
"Truly one of the best teachers I've ever had. She has a wonderful ability to challenge you intellectually without beating you over the head with busy-work. Show up, pay attention, and do the aassigned reading and you will be fine. She's also quite adorable, but that's beside the point.",1
One of the best foreign language teachers I've ever had. Makes everything really clear and doesn't make you feel pressured to know everything right away. Learned so much in her class.,1
horrible.,0
"Louis is one of the best lecturers I've had at UVa and SO. HOT.  He is incredibly charismatic but people with less of a background/interest in history might find his lectures difficult to keep up with.  I greatly enjoyed this class, and would recommend it to anyone interested in Southern history/art",1
Hard Tests. Rambling Lectures. READ THE BOOK.,0
Very helpful always has a positive attitude!!!,1
"Dr. Brooks expects his students to mainly teach themselves the material, and come to him with any questions. Don't be afraid of his fear tactics day 1.  You have to work hard in this class, but you will know more about the derivatives markets than any undergraduate you encounter outside of those in your class. Book is mandatory if you plan to pass.",1
Very unclear and confusing professor. If you really want to learn about acoustics choose another professor because this one can't teach.  Taking this professor may put you in jeopardy and make your chances of getting in Lehman's Graduate Program for Speech Pathology very slim.,0
"She doesn't explain concepts clearly. A lot of class time is directed towards explanations for simple concepts. It is best to try read a textbook to supplement bad classes. She assigned a group design project the week before finals, due on the last lecture. Her tests are memorization heavy, and focus on specific details from the lectures.",0
"Will is really approachable and seems genuinely interested in helping his students succeed. This is a really hard course though. If you are not a good writer, you should set aside time before taking this course to improve, or you will definitely not do well as 90% of your grade is based on writing assignments (blog posts, research paper etc.)",1
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
"Very unpleasant prof. His lectures are rambling and incoherent. Keeps asking for participation, but rips whatever you say to shreds for no apparent reason. Seems indifferent to students. The exam really was fine, though. I mainly learned from the cases and textbook, since his lectures have little to do with the exam.",0
"Took her for Western Civilization, although she might seem somewhat odd in the first couple classes if you can deal with that, you'll see that she's actually a great teacher. She grades super easily, and the exams are really simple. You might need to memorize a bit of history, but other than that, super simple. Just don't be on your phone she flips",1
"Reviews that I read were so misleading. Grading is very inconsistent. He gives pop quizzes over 30 page chapters pretty often. Lectures the whole time, but not about anything in the book. Gives a take home midterm and final, but he grades them so tough that it doesn't matter. Also have 2 book reviews which aren't good either. Would not take him",0
"Before I signed up for Boydston I looked at the reviews, they were low but I kept an open mind that I had to work for my grades regardless who the professor was. But this professor designs everything so you can fail, she goes beyond measures to make sure her exams difficult. Either than that I see no effort from her in anything else. DON'T TAKE",0
"His class is alot of work.  I took many classes with him (100A, 100B, Eng 1A, Eng 4 and Eng 12) but he still acted as if he don't know me outside of class.  All this years spent with him and he won't even say hi when he saw me.  That's sad.",0
"She's a great professor, make sure that you are attentive to the different assignments that she is handing out and their due dates. Great class and Great professor.",1
"I did take his class his class online during the whole COVID19 situation. Despite that, it wasn't enjoyable at all. He's hard to understand in both speaking and writing. Don't expect him to respond to emails at all. Makes too many mistakes in class. Tests are way too hard with little time to finish. You're better off looking for someone else.",0
"This was a very challenging course for me. Graded on few things and the final is worth 60% of the grade (cumulative exam). Very caring professor though, pretty hilarious, and easy to get ahold of which is key for difficult concepts. Cool guy. Podcasts his lectures so I never had to come to class, but WATCH. Also, OPEN TEXTBOOK EXAMS, BUT NO E-BOOKS",1
"Taking one of his classes will definitely improve your writing. His lectures are never dry but its unclear as to whether his theories on the lit are brilliant or bull... great if your prepared for a challenge, but otherwise I would take Kuzmanovich for American lit and take Nelson for a class in his field - short fiction",1
"This is probably the worst teacher in the whole Peralta district, at least for CIS. Lectures are ridiculously long, usually at least 2 to 3 hours long with no breaks. Doesn't respond to emails, doesn't have a clear grading rubric, no feedback on homework assignments. Literally forgot we had a midterm. Take anybody else but him.",0
"Dr. Maher is nice, his class however, is the most unorganized, frustrating, and annoying course I have taken in all of my undergraduate career. His exams were all essay-based, taken in a lockdown browser with the only material to prepare about 100 pages of reading a week. He was not equipped for online learning. I paid three dollars for the final.",0
Girgis's teaching style has completely in changed likely due to how easy the class used to be. I didn't learn anything in the class but struggled to get my grade back up to an A at the end of the semester because she takes off points for no apparent reason. Disregard any comments about the course being an easy A. Only 15/98 students got an A or A+.,0
This Professor was probably one of the most confusing and hard to read professors I have endured. She teaches a four hour class that can easily be taught in an hour and fifteen minutes. Only use her if there is no other open class.,0
Couldn't really understand him.,0
"This class is not for those looking for an easy A, you have to work hard in this class. The professor can be critical in his grading, but that is how he shows that he wants to make his students better. If you are having trouble in his class he is more than willing to set up an appointment and go over the material.",1
Excellent professor and a great person. He teaches beyond engineering. He teaches you life skills. Mr. Blake has been a mentor and a great friend.,1
Bring a pillow to class....,0
"I absolutely loved having Professor Turkovic for my AMH2010 class. He is lecture heavy, but the lectures are in-depth and require you to think. He gives a clear study guide which are the verbatim questions on his exams. He is a funny and caring professor and I would recommend him to anyone, so long as they are a diligent student.",1
laid back. his lectures are hysterical.,0
Would never take again. Grammar Nazi. Avoid if can.,0
He creates a very unwelcoming environment. There's two professors who teach this class and both do a terrible job explaining the material. Hough doesn't even teach the class yet he's considered a professor. During office hours he comes off as very rude and makes you feel dumb for asking certain questions. He does not care about his students,0
"Show up and do your homework and you'll pass. Daily in class assignments are part of the grade. In class assig. & reviews applied to tests/quizzes. He puts in the extra time to answer all questions and give 1 on 1 time as needed. Showed work for in class practice problems, give clear step by step instructions, and set us up to be successful.",1
"great teacher and guy, engages the students well... pretty easy and hilarious personality. I would definitely take his class again",1
"Dr. Hollis is very enthusiastic about Biology, which makes his lectures engaging. His class is a lot of work with 3 assignments per week, but that helps to cushion your grade. His class requires you to be on top of your work, but he is very helpful  and seems to genuinely care about students and his class. DON'T SKIP CLASS. You will miss quizzes.",1
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
Best professor Ive had at texas state so far. Super nice and goofy. Loves math and loves answering questions. Kind of a lot of homework but I know lots of other classes here that had way more. She is always willing to help and make things more clear. 100% recommend.,1
Very tough prof.. make sure to attend every class or else you will pay the price.,0
"Professor McDermott's class is perfect for someone who is motivated and truly wants to learn about the subject. Naturally, if you dislike history this may not be the class for you, however assignments are very clear and you will get a great grade so long as you pay attention to the things she purposefully emphasizes in her weekly study tips.",1
Class is very long! Very often was not able to get through lecture material and a lot of writing. Class was very interesting but just not a class I'd recommend to take with a full course load.,0
"She is an amazing professor. I was intimidated when I first started because I knew nothing, but she is so helpful and super nice. There are quite a few projects but if you work hard you will have plenty of time to get them done. If you apply yourself and come to class this class should be easy but you will learn a lot and enjoy it!",1
"Keep up with the homework and ask questions when you need help and you will be fine. Give her respect and you get it back, if you slack off and ask for help at the last second, then your a bad student and don't deserve help. Gives great feedback on assignments but may take time to get back. A lot of reading but perfect if your interested in COMM",1
"If you need to take LIT3115, take it with Soh. She is very organized. Get to do the work that really matters. You get to teach using lesson plans that you do for her assignments. Her feedback is helpful.",1
"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations. Boring, hard to listen to sometimes, somewhat opinionated. She is a good person at heart though, and you will see that very quickly in the class. Does give help if asked. Do not call after 10. ",0
"Jayne has a great knowledge base when it comes to nursing. If you have her for lecture, you will have no problem. If you have her for clinical, however, she is very intimdating, belittling, and angry. Many students have literally felt emotionally traumatized after having her. She will make you feel like you are incompetent and worthless.",1
Every class was spent going over the previous class homework which took away time from the lesson.  No work sheets giving which I would have liked.  Overall she worked with you if you had problems.,0
Not very good,0
"This class is not bad at all. If you already have practice in health science or basic bio, a lot of it is just review until you get into the nervous tissue section, which was the only section I had stuff I've never seen before on it. Its 4 exams and a final, and everything on her exams is from her ppts so if you study em you'll pass. Ended w/ a 95",1
"Easy class and you learn about how to solve real life problems. There is a research project at the end, but he helps you on how to do it and you get to work with other people.",1
It's really easy to get an A in his class and the exams are not difficult.,0
Would not recommend at ALL! HE DOES NOT DO POWERPOINTS HARD TO TAKE NOTES HOMEWORKS ARE VERY HARD AND HE  MAKES YOU WORK FOR EXTRA CREDIT AN WILL NOT  GIVE YOU LOTS OF POINTS!  I ALSO STUDIED  VERY HARD AND ENDED UP  FAILING CLASS,0
"If you want to be an Econ Major, take EC11 with him. His lectures are extremely organized, and his slides for the class are extremely clear. Honestly, I'm still using his slides to review for EC16. The tests are definitely hard, and you need to put lots of effort in, but it will worth it. If you just want an easy class, then don't take it with him",1
He is a really great professor. Funny when it matters which makes lectures easy to understand and fun to attend. Doesn't make going to class feel like chore. The marital is interesting and not for those who don't already have an interest in deep film analysis.,1
"Really knows how to communicate with students of all types, and has admirable patience in a subject that is challenging to some and simple to others. Liszka has brilliant metaphors for hard concepts, and both academic and industry experience, which is wonderful. Fair, extremely helpful. Plus, she prefers C to Java, therefore she is awesome.",1
Extremely good teacher for Calculus. Very standard,1
Avoid Dr. Kim. She is INTENSE. She doesn't understand that not everyone wants to get their masters in chemistry. She rushes through complex subjects because they are easy to her. She said that other professors make her life hard because they dont teach what she teaches. She was rude to me when I went to her office. She is a VERY tough grader.,0
"Leats favorite lecturer of the WOC crew but they are all very good. This is a very interesting course but beware, no0t as easy at it looks. Buy the NTCs and re-read them and you should be fine.",1
"She does not care about students. This old hag only cares about picking up her  salary. She is very offensive if ask for question. She deserves a big ""F"".",0
He is interesting is a good way of describing him. He is super nice but he is the kind of professor that your high school teachers warned you about. You at times will end up reading two or three chapters a week after listening to super dry lectures. Also when you have to write essay questions for him you will lose points if you only answer.,0
McGee is the best professor you can take at VISTA for any type of biology course. She is the most caring person and truly wants you to succeed. Yes of course her class can be difficult but what science course isn't???? You want an A? you must work it. By far the best professor i've had.,1
"Keeps things interesting, cares about students learning. Classwork isn't too hard at all. Attendance is optional, but you get 10 points participation for showing up. Tests are easy. Provides powerpoints, don't have to buy the book if you don't want to. I opened mine once.",1
"Metzl is the man, and his class is both interesting and easy. His powerpoints were awesome, and there were two brief papers to write, on top of a semester long project and easy final exam. He's got a great sense of humor and really seemed like he cared. Highly recommend to MHS majors",1
"The worst teacher I have ever had from elementary school to college. I took his astronomy course as a visiting student a few summers ago. I go to a college that is ranked top 30 in the country and was expecting to do well in this course. Not only was he an awful teacher, he made you feel stupid for asking questions and if you dont understand.",0
He is a phenomenal human being. I took this class at Stockton University in this semester. His Teaching technique is very  effective. He goes to the point and repeats many times till we fully understand the content. Take his class without any hesitation.,1
"Professor Zein is ridiculously picky about what she looks for when she grades, and it's very difficult to get a feel for what she's really asking.  Her lectures are fairly disorganized and somewhat dull, as are many of the readings.  She expects close reading, deep thinking, and hard work, but that's probably not enough.  Avoid her if possible.",0
"The worst professor I've had at NDSU.  Granted, incredibly intelligent and holds SEVEN graduate degrees.  But he humiliates students openly in class, is highly ambiguous about his expectations and just seems a little off.  I cannot stand his classes, his approach is very de-motivating and frustrating.",0
"Have her for Psy 271. she is flipping the classroom this semester so we play games every time. not helpful at all. refuses to answer questions in class. tests are hard and very confusing. 50 question hw assignment every week, same thing every week.",0
Cares about the understanding level of students and how they're doing academically. Anyone who has him as a professor is in fantastic hands.,1
"I've taken quite a few of his classes and even gone out of my way to take his classes. He barely gives out work, the work is super easy, and sometimes he'll do ""pop quizzes"" which are really just you writing down your name and getting 10 points for being in class that day. Great professor!",1
"This lady is the BOMB! The first day of class she said that she does not believe in homework, that our time was our time. I learned a ton in this class via her passion , empathy, and teaching style. She is a Jedi mind trick teacher; I learned a ton and did not even know it because it was so fun and easy. Open note quizzes and tests. great lady.",1
"slow and boring. reads directly from slides. concepts are reeeaaally easy its like learning about enzymes in high school again, but makes you memorize a large list of drugs and all their specific receptors in the body. tells you what kind of questions we'll see on exam but it doesn't matter if you don't have that list memorized.",0
"I have a good basic understanding of Spanish so I didn't have a hard time with the class. But, she is not good at explaining things and is very very confusing with what it's expected from you in the class. The textbook is required because of the access code for the homework, but also so you can teach yourself because you won't learn much from her.",0
"Seems really uptight but actually a super easygoing guy, lots of freedom in essay topic choices and a lot of the info overlaps with 207. Super long lectures so be prepared to take notes! Truly loves art history and sharing it with people, he also has an amazing fashion sense. Definitely recommend him!",1
"Do the homework and youll be fine, tests are basically reworked questions outta the book",1
Typical example of a lecturer who does not care about his students.,0
"Ryan has great intentions, but is very unorganized and seems like he's still getting used to teaching at Carlson. He is very knowledgeable on class topics, but almost to a fault, as he goes on tangents and side comments that take away from the true topic at hand. Ryan has great potential and should try being more intentional and organized.",0
"good teacher, easy to talk with, fast and fair marker.",1
"She's sweet, but I cannot understand her for the life of me. I've tried attending the lectures and she has online lecture recordings but her English is terrible. She's not good at explaining. To do well on the exams you HAVE to KNOW the book front and back and do the online modules and hw. No one did well on her exams, the test averages were awful",0
I loved taking Spanish 3 with this teacher. She explains everything well and does tons of practice exercises in class. For tests there is a study guide provided. I highly reccomend this teacher!,1
Stats is hard regardless if you take it online or in class depends on the students. I took my class online so there wasn't much communication unless I had an issue or question. just do the hw and make tutoring appt for help. ,1
"Very specific grader, very strict about citations and academic integrity. Not lenient with deadlines. Very opinionated and will debate with you until the end of class if he disagrees with your standpoint. If you're up for a challenge, take him. If you're not, I wouldn't.",0
"Terrible at teaching, you will not learn in his class. Very specific grader for hw and exams but once you realize all the ridiculous little things that he wants it is an easy A, even without fully understanding the subject. Even other professors complain about Jalalvand, take him only as a last resort for required credit/prerequisites.",0
"He calls it passion, I call it narcissism. Most of the lecture comprised of his personal life and work relating it to the class; lacking the true teaching aspect. He didn't give real notes either. The book was mandatory and even with the book for the take home test, I still failed. It's more about his expectations than the course itself.",0
Does not teach to the level of the test. Teaches students how to do a level 3 problem and tests are level 9 problems. Has vague review guides that are pretty pointless. Quizzes you on new material right after you learn it in class. Never lets class out early.,0
she is such an awesome professor! what you see is what you get. she is extremely fair and very intelligent. i wish she taught more classes because she is so engaging and honestly can relate to students,1
"Lopez is an amazing prof. He is passionate about what he teaches (I took his Shakespeare course) and has great focus and challenges your writing style and essay structure. Also, he makes entire lectures about sex. He's hilarious, clear cut, interesting, but BRUTAL about deadlines. If it's late, it's a ZERO. Tutorials are a MUST.",1
dont be fooled by Elementary Spanish this class is tough and if you are not comfortable with the language do take it. im fluent in Spanish and there were some questions that I struggled to answer. the professor seems nice but completely disappeared throughout the 10 week course. she DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. avoid at all cost. no support at all,0
Professor Meehan's class is pretty boring but the material you get from the class is more than what she provides on the outlines.  Her tests are straight forward but only study what she talked about in class.  Wouldn't even recommend getting the textbook because she narrows down what you need to know.,0
"Absolutely the worst course I have had. She makes the course and the material unnecessarily complicated. If it wasn't for the TA, I would have failed the class. Attending her lectures were the worst hours I spent on campus. She writes on a blackboard and her handwriting is just way too difficult to read and goes too fast. Take ECON3110 instead.",0
HE SUCKS!!!i don't know why this guy decided to be a professor.How are other people gonna say that he is helpful. I recall that i asked him what i should study for the test and he tells me o just read chapters 1-4..WOW and he is sarcastic..HORRIBLE TEACHER,0
"He really is a nice guy, he's just not the best teacher. He always gets a befuddled expression when a student asks a question- and half the time he doesn't know what the answer is. There's no rhythm or flow to the progression of material he teaches and nothing is bolded on his slides so it's really difficult to know what he's wanting us to learn.",0
"Coop was a cool guy, but he was an awful teacher.  I often left class confused and didn't understand and went to office hours but his tests were 2600still hard,  but gives generous curves because of the low averages.  I did very well in calc in high school but his class was terribly hard & doesn't prep you for the final at all.",0
"Hey John Carroll, don't make a sociology professor teach a psychology class unless you want all the students to fail. Horrible teacher. Would not recommend. Tests are hard and so are the worksheets. Attendance not mandatory. Grade based on 4 tests. ",0
"energetic, organized, demanding but helps you reach standards",1
Tough grader. Not many assignments to base your grade off of,1
"He's not a bad professor but I find his test difficult. I feel as if he should give worksheets for us to study and at least give a study guide for the final exam, not just review in class with us. This class will be difficult for students who isn't majoring in the scientific field or care too much for science.",0
"Her lectures are a bit scattered, but she's really passionate and engaged with the material, which makes up for it. She gives pop quizzes based off of the readings of that week and there are 3 papers you have to write for this course. She's clear in what she wants from them, but if you need the extra help, she's always there, as well as her TAs.",1
"Just took his CHE seminar last semester and wanted to let anyone know taking it, he will try and scare you but don't fall for it. First day of class, he gave ridiculously hard ""quizzes"" and 17 people dropped that day. More dropped along the way. In the end, EVERYBODY got an A or a B. Bs for the ones who barely showed up. Just stick with it. Easy A.",0
"Professor Arnold does not try to be difficult.  She is not a difficult grader, but she is about as clear as mud when it comes to explaining her expectations of an assignment...and although I don't like to be negative, I must say she is rather unhelpful in nearly every area of the classroom.",0
Dr. Cogan is funny and passionate about what he teaches but gives a lot more work than I imagined. I've had a paper/presentation/quiz each week of his class. If you put effort in you will do well.,1
Class is enjoyable and pretty easy as long as you show up every day. I loved her as a professor.,1
Absolutely loathsome.  Boring. Self important.  Uber-conservative.  Hateful hateful man.,0
"She brought life into the classroom. The transition to online was hard for me, most professors went silent for weeks and then slammed us with tons of assignments. I don't think anyone appreciated how much work she put into our class. She was the only professor who held Zoom classes where we could talk and learn. That kind of dedication is rare.",1
"While Dr. Turkovic gives interesting lectures, the only thing his class is made up of are 4 tests, all in essay form and participating in class discussion. If you don't do well on those tests, you're pretty much screwed. I would not recommend taking this class if you are not a good test taker.",0
I took Math 1000 during the summer 2020 and Dr Dyer was extremely helpful for getting through the course. The textbook he used was free online for us and was okay but the videos he provided as well as the extra help really made the course easier.,1
I survived it.,0
"I had Dr. Trammell for Liberated Learning and he was easily my favorite professor this past semester. A non-traditional grading style that actually works in favor of the student. Each class provided awesome content with real life value you simply cannot receive from another course. I never once dreaded coming to class, rather enthused and engaged.",1
"Amazing professor. Really cares about his students and will go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. The material is not easy, but the exams are extremely fair if you do the homework.",1
Take this prof if you want Michael Scott as your design prof. very personal and terrible with people while also being very sensitive. Is all about manners but when he thinks you mess up resorts to calling you things like dude and questions your intelligence over not understanding his often STRANGE assignments. Also judges you outside of arch.,0
"While Sam is a nice guy and pretty funny sometimes, I really didn't like this class/his lecturing style. Don't take this class if you don't like Linguistics, and especially don't take it if you learn better with visual aids because there were no powerpoints at all! Overall, don't take this class if it's just for your distribution",0
"Really nice professor makes the class interesting ,she tells you alot of her own stories its nice bc you get to know a little bit about her . If you listen in class and study from her guide you will pass",1
"She is very manipulative and plays the good intention card very well, but when it comes down to it, she is mainly concerned with getting people in honors college to meet her quota.  She puts her own personal goals before those of her students.  She also has the tendency to go to students professors with issues instead of the students themselves.",0
"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID !!!!! He is like a nightmare! Terrible lectures. And he is really mean to you. He is a Monster. The homework is hard. You spent so much time on it, and you still couldnt get a good grade. Worst Professor Forever. If you dont want to torture yourself, be wise and don't choose his class.",0
"He's a great professor! His classes are super easy if you do the work, plus he's fun to talk to. He knows what his teaching and gives a lot of good tips. Super nice man.  If you like to watch movies you definitely want to take his class. You'll be watching movies and doing cool presentations.",1
"Uses old lectures, talks to much about his personal life that no one cares about and less time on the course material needed to succeed in weekly quizzes. Lecture videos are not very helpful to succeeding in class.",0
Worst professor in the world!!!! Do not take her or you will fail!,0
"TLS 356 was a very informative class. I really enjoyed the content of the course. There a lot of little papers, but they're no longer than 400 words which isn't bad. He does daily participation, so I suggest going to class. There are also quizzes almost every week, but most of the articles can be found online, so you don't really need to read it..",1
"Her class is very straightforward. Put some effort into your assignments, do the work and you'll get an 'A' for sure. Dr. Kelley is great and you'll learn a lot with her method of teaching!",1
"Great teacher, explains material clearly and has very do-able expectations for course work.",1
"Way too much work, especially during a pandemic. She's a nice person, though. We were doing 2 projects at once which was stressful, both due at the end of the semester. There were DQs due for one of the projects and for the class in general. I don't think she graded too harshly.",1
"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected. Ridiculous time limits on exams/quizzes, NO feedback, and turn around time for grades (semester is over and I still haven't received grades for 2 papers- be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks). DON'T. DO. IT.",0
"Good lecturer. Class was a bit slow, but that wasn't he professor's fault.",1
Great Instructor-  cares teaches and gives a little humor.  Real life experiences used to teach the class- probably can out cook some of the other prof/chefs,1
"Awful teacher! Rude, unprofessional, & completely uninterested in teaching this class. No wonder people don't enter the field of sp. ed! Dresses in tacky attire. Does not teach, prefers to read from ppts. Makes Ben Stein sound like an awesome public speaker. Yes, her voice is THAT bad! Not clear in assignment expectations. HCC should be ashamed!!!",0
"Amazing professor.  He is super laid back and funny.  If you need to take BCS 102 or BCS 160, definitely take it with him. Very easy.  He's very understanding and will let you make up work if needed.   As long as you do the work and show up to class, it's an easy A.",1
"This instructor said at the semester start that ""the book is wrong and confusing"" but then often recants that statement and says read ""the book it will help you"" he seems to flip-flop between these statements on a daily basis. He often says ""go to the Marc for help"" but then the next day if it is not the work he taught you than you're out of luck.",0
Very difficult. you will pass if you memorize the book. Quizes are online and can be taken open book. She talks very fast but if you record her lectures and listen to them it will help a lot. I got a B in her class because of my recordings and trying to memorize the book. her assignments are super duper easy except the research paper. Hard Course.,0
"Ms. Myers is the best math teacher I have ever had. She wants her students to succeed. She reviews for tests so there are no surprises. Just go to class and ask questions because she will make time for you if you need it. EC on tests helps, also she allows students to go back and improve their homework grades. She is the epitome of a good teacher.",1
"Dr. McCartneys civic engagement class is by far the toughest class I've taken- but it was worth every second of work. She causes her students to strive to be engaged, I wanted to work even harder because of the possibility of putting it on my resume! definitely recommended.",1
"Don't really like the way he teaches -- in fact I don't think I would call it teaching.  He's not clear and he doesn't teach you the stuff he tests you on; he expects you to learn it by reading it on the web.  If I wanted to do distance learning, I wouldn't be going to class every week.",0
He is by far the best accounting teacher I have ever had. Very clear and helpful. I highly recommend.,1
"He treats you like a child. Most things he says don't make sense. I feel he was very degrading and rude to students. I dreaded going to class. If you do your homework he picks on you and makes you feel dumb. It's his way or the highway. You better always be in class, have a textbook, be prepared to listen to him talk nonstop. Wouldn't recomend.",0
Very easy class with very straightforward professor. Tests very simillar to practice tests. Open notes. HW and projects easy.,1
"While the class may have been hard, he did a great job teaching it. He tried to get the class involved in discussions all the time.",1
"Three papers, but he is unhelpful when you ask for advice. He will grade lower on papers written on subjects he doesn't like, so write about the assigned books if you want to get an A. He is unclear with his instructions and he mumbles a lot during class. His lectures are irrelevant and unhelpful in class. Hard class/grader, not recommended.",0
"I would avoid taking this professor. She treats this class like a graduate class. Her tests are focused on if you know the in depth info, not just definitions. If you do have to take her, then I would definitely be proactive and read and take notes on before you talk about the chapters in lecture.",0
I took Professor McGregor hybrid  course for Chemistry 101 and 102. I got an A in 102 and  B in 101. Since this is a online course you basically have to teach yourself the material however if you have questions the professor answers them and show many examples. The labs and review sessions are on campus. You can skip one on campus lab. Great Prof.,1
I loved Dr. Smith for ED280! Her lectures were mainly relating to the book with her own connections in them. She is very homework heavy so plan accordingly. The environment for her class was very helpful because it made me want to come to class. You do have to come for class because she hands out exit slips. She is very passionate and I loved her!,1
"I did awful in his class. He doesn't believe in extra credit and expects ppl to know everything he's talking about. He FREAKS if you're 30 seconds late for class. He literally turns into the Incredible ""RED"" Hulk......If you're gonna take him, you better leave the house early.",0
"Nice lady, but DO NOT take the class. Even if its the only finance class left open don't take it. It's not worth it, half the class fails her tests and theres only 3 tests with no curve, only two homework's so theres no way to get your grade up. She also made sure to remind the class about the withdrawal date...",0
"Very unclear with instructions, has an attitude, gives mean facial expressions, lots of work, not specific, tough grader , boring class , would not take again",0
"The discussion posts are impossible. He has instructions that you can use ANY Source; Text, Videos, OR Outside source. But when he comments back he says that if you use an outside source you have to use the textbook too which makes no sense. Directions are super unclear. He makes the work more difficult then it needs to be. DO NOT RECOMMEND",0
Professor Licato is probably one of the best professors I have taken here at Farmingdale. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that needs to take any computer classes. I had to take a computer class for my major and he was so helpful every step of the way. He even helped me do extra credit to get my grade from a B+ to a A- Great professor!!!,1
Awful. Took him a whole semester to grade one paper. Tests are confusing because his lectures contain no actual information and his study guides are also pointless. Also very long winded so sitting in class is wildly boring.,0
"Difficult to understand the lectures, frustrating to work on tedious projects that aren't graded for content (why bother?) A good suggestion would be to use the Blackboard site more, the calender and grade features especially would be helpful.",0
I found this Prof ro be very helpful.  I enjoyed her classes.  She seems to care about the students but holds a high standard- I learned my stuff,1
glen is awesome! he makes his classes entertaining not dull,1
"Worst Professor I've ever had. Might be a smart guy, but he is a horrible professor. Doesn't explain ANYTHING in great detail. Just says you should know it ""intuitively"". It'll be a disgrace if he is allowed to teach at SMU again next year.",0
"Very low voice, soft-spoken. Gets embarrassed when things aren't clear. Went over individual example programs in class. Let us write our own with guidelines for added practice, without grading. Not really able to clearly explain in simple terms. Fairly attractive.",0
He is a very nice guy. The class is relatively easy. They expect you to learn it on the essential calculus application though. The material is not really taught in any of the math classes. They more just expect you to learn it yourself. Nice guy though and is definitely willing to help if you ask.,1
"Nice professor but the class is boring, alot of the stuff is repetitive. Dont really need the book, maybe just for the essay. To get an A you must know her powerpoints very well, better off memorizing them.",1
"Took Intermediate Algebra from him this fall. He is hands down awesome. Very clear explanation of problems, does everything on the board and welcomes questions. Super chill guy. He grades promptly. We are using ConnectMath and get LOTS of homework, though none of it is for credit, only practice. Quizzes every Mon. Easy A if you give the effort.",1
"Hamed is such a genius professor, he wants you to learn, therefore, his exams and homework assignments are very clear. There is no better than Hamed to teach DS412. take him you won't regret it. 3 midterms in total plus HW. that's it folks",1
"Let me start by saying that this woman is ex-military and she shows it. She shows respect and cares for her students in person, but email is a different story. She constantly belittled the entire class over the last 15 weeks. It was very discouraging. Not clear on assignments until they were due the next day.",0
He's an awesome teacher. The homework is pretty easy as long as you do it. The tests are straight foward. He keeps the class interesting all semester long. Plus all the notes are online.,1
"Hands down the worst professor at ISU. He makes you feel beyond stupid and isn't afraid to tell you how bad you are at writing. He thinks that he is better than his students just because he has been teaching for so long. He will tell you that he ""believe in you"" when in reality he could care less if you do well in the class or not. AVOID HIM!!!!",0
Professor F-M is very caring and wants all his students succeed. I took two courses with him and will take him again in a heart beat. He provides very good feedback on all the assignments which helps you improve. Take him for Composition and Literature if you can.,1
"This dude is a jerk. I DID NOT want to take him bc everyone told me I shouldn't, but he was the only one teaching this req course. I've passed all my 4000 level courses with A or A+ but this guy graded me down insanely at every turn. Unreasonably hard reader, is mean about opinions he disagrees with. Only passed how I did by acing the final 110%",0
"Her lectures can be very confusing, and her extremely poor handwriting doesn't help at all. Because of that, quizzes were pretty hard. But if you study on your own and pay attention in the lecture class, it makes the class a little easier. Brittney is super nice and fun to talk to though. Cool person. Mediocre teacher.",0
"If you are taking SOWK4650 to fill a requirement for the social work program, I would suggest picking another class. This professor was condescending and very unclear about what they wanted to see for assignments. I do not feel that I learned much of anything in this class.",0
"Really tough, not super helpful in office hours. Takes off unnecessary points",0
"This guy, wow, He is an utter failure of a teacher. My three 4000 lvl courses were easier than his 1000 lvl course. His opinions are the only ones that matter and your grade reflects. He will tell you that you are in the wrong major and just utterly decimate your grade if he doesn't like you. Grades based on his opinion, not on skill. Absolute jerk",0
"A very big disappointment as someone who was suppose to ""educate me"". After receiving a 0 on a exam essay, I had put a lot of research and preparation into, I went to his office hours. He ""re-read"" my paper, told me it was well written and on topic and changed my grade to an 85. Leading me to believe he never actually read it while grading.",0
One of the best profs in here,1
"A vaguely interesting guy and exposed the class to new ideas. But he is an intellectual lightweight, so don't go to class expecting analytic rigour.",1
"Poorly organized, graded by few things for a semester long grade. Very book heavy. Most students are confused with what is going on in this class so everyone just does their best. Other profs are worse so just take this for your gen ed and get through it. Cool, funny guy but isn't the best teacher. I could see him being a good upper division prof",0
I had Professor Bemisdarfer this past semester for CRE101. It was a great informative class. The material is good and I learned a lot. Professor Bemisdarfer was actively involved in the class and was a great experience. I would definitely recommend.,1
"This is an easy class, and you don't really need the book.  Online tests are simple and you can take them like 8 times, so you're guaranteed to pass.  It's moderately interesting, but sometimes Nelson can be spacey.  He's sometimes entertaining though.  All in all, it's a class worth taking, but bring something to do.",1
"She grades weirdly and words her questions/directions weirdly because she doesn't proof read. Also, she wants us to cite our sources but will give us a 0 on the assignments/discussion posts if we quote from them like what??? She expects you to do your own research in addition to the chapter reading for the test so you'll see q's you wont understand",0
Tests are really hard and there are quizzes every class,1
"The worst professor I ever had. I was excited most about this class, but it teaches NOTHING about being a realistic teacher. She gives MULTIPLE large assignments, discussions, and weekly assignments. This is not a class to take if youre full time student. She also isnt approachable.",0
The best professor in the Business School.,1
"Lovelace was an awesome teacher, too bad he's gone! One of the best writing profs I've had so far, his classes are uber-easy and fun too...just wait until he gets off subject. Lots of interesting assaignments which really helped my writing. We need Lovelace back.",1
"Costanza is a truly nice and genuine guy. We used our textbook once a week to complete a study question in class with a buddy. I took the class with a friend and shared the book. I made a B+ but only because I missed notes prior to one of the 3 tests we had. Good teacher, good guy. Reminded me of Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, in a good way!",1
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Hutton didn't respect any students in the class, as well as she responded to 1 out of 9 emails I send throughout the semester. Also, hutton believes all of her students should ""look up to her"" and become just like her. She accused me of cheating twice and argued with my class the entire semester.",0
Finished winter semester. The class was easy to navigate. Ended up being not too hard.,1
"Dennis is a fun, hilarious professor who takes his work seriously. Taking his class was just such a delight!",1
"I had a hard time learning from Logan b/c he sped through the lectures. He gave out practice tests before each test which was a lot easier than the actual test. The final was super easy which helped push my B up to an A. He is super quiet and boring, was very hard to sit through his class.",0
I took the online 101 course and Prof. POPOVICH was great. He was clear with what he wanted and how he wanted the work done.  I wish he would teach HIS 102 also.,1
"Worst professor I have ever taken. Contradicts most of what he says which makes writing any essay hard when you don't know exactly what he wants you to do. Always finds something to nitpick on, downgrades just because he doesn't like the way you worded something, even though your way isn't wrong.",0
"Dr. Simms is very knowledgeable of the subject, but he is not good at explaining things to people who do not understand the subject. He's hard of hearing, asking questions during class is kinda hard unless you literally yell. There was a paper to write, and there was no clear idea of what he wanted, AKA no outline.",0
"She's a good teacher. However, sometimes she will tell you to change something on your paper and then take off points when grading because that part didn't fit. Also, not very clear grading criteria.",0
"He IS helpful and nice, although he doesn't look like!",1
Vannier is a hilarious professor. He puts up powerpoint slides on BB and you just have to fill in some blanks during lecture. The tests are hard but he gives a ton of extra credit so do it and you'll get an A. Labs are really easy and you almost always get out early. Lab practical is hard but extra credit makes up for it. Take him if you can.,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN. She is super nice but when it comes to teaching, she is no help at all. Not a very hard grader on the lab reports because she does not teach anything. Lab protocols are a mess and have a lot of typos and she leaves you to deal with that by yourself. No point in asking her a question because she does not answer.",0
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
"Every class was a complete mess. We spent about an hour talking about pure nonsense. She was almost always late. Every paper we did made absolute no sense and her notes were completely illegible, she can't even read it. The only thing I appreciated is the comprehensive steps each paper had, made it easy to write. She's really rude and judgmental.",0
"She's really nice and the class was interesting but seemed as though she didn't know what she was talking about, considering that the majority of lectures she read off of a script. No midterm or final, but there was a final paper that was 8 pages, and she's a very easy grader. Easy to get a good grade",0
"She grades my papers and everything on here is needing more explanation. I swear its like ""what does a door knob open?"" She won't budge if you try to talk to her about it, pretty frustrating indeed. Don't take her class. Although I wouldn't blame her for this, her books are boring beyond measure. Odds are you can find better then her.",0
"Well, where to start with this boy? This boy is the type to look at your paper and overall give it a grade on the basis of what he thinks (poor, good, fair, excellent). He expects everything to be perfect and yells at you in front of the whole class if you say something ""dumb"". Prepare to get bored out of your mind when he speaks, also he's unfair.",0
"I was excited to take geology and now I dread it. She's not the worst teacher; she has a few good moments but don't take her if you can avoid her. The homework takes me two hours and no matter how long I study, I can't pass the tests. There is also wayyy to much work for a gen ed class.",0
"Love, Love, Love him!  His class was my favorite.  He tells you what to study and that will be on the test. Very awesome guy, cares about all his students.  I wished he taught more than this class!",1
"Dr. Xing was so helpful and patient in teaching us in Orgo 2. When everything had to be quickly switched to online, she did an amazing job. You can tell how passionate she is about organic chemistry. Also, she really cares about her students and wants them to do well. I was so lucky to have her.",1
Not a good grader. Office hours do not help.,0
"Dr. Anderson is one of the best professors I have taken at VSU. He is very understanding if you have any issues. He makes a point to get to know everyone on a personal level. Although the class material is difficult, he makes sure everyone has an understanding. Make sure you go to lab, it really helps your grade.",1
"The most arbitrary grade I have ever received. Most of the grade is his opinion on your ""participation"". I learned NOTHING in this class. The material was basically pop psychology. To hammer the point home again, Meyer and his class was useless in every sense of the word.",0
She is difficult. Only give 10 minutes only per quizzes and it's given every week for sure. She takes off points for the tiny things like if you don't put a degree symbol its like 2 points off. So ridiculous! She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :(,0
"Dr. Tulsian is by far the worst professor I have had in my entire life. Not only does he openly insult students, but he also is extremely rude and vulgar during lecture. This professor has ruined physics for many in the class, including myself.  I would suggest to take Physics with Calculus elsewhere AT ALL COSTS",0
"Great professor, his lectures are content heavy but in no way are they boring. I missed a couple of classes and he was more than happy to help and very understanding about making up work you might have missed. He gives an extension for one writing assignment on a monograph of your choice! 10/10 would take again!",1
"Brian is awesome. He is very knowledgeable and really helpful. You have to see 4 plays which can be pricey depending on the ones you choose, but other than that I have no complaints! I highly recommend taking his class. He's a great guy.",1
"Dr. Hill can be tough, especially about grading questions. Just read them properly and do EXACTLY what they say. I lost points because I understood his question to be asking something else. Overall great professor as long as you stay awake.",1
"Take Physiological Mechanisms- its the ideal class for any pre-med trying to actually learn more about medicine. The entire class revolves around studying case studies and determining a presented patient's diagnosis given their symptoms. Everyone does one of their own case study presentations. No exams, just participate and ace your presentation.",1
"Too easy. If you are someone who is wanting to improve on grammar andor their writing skills, do not take him. He plays too many movies in classes, which I find to be a waste of my money I am putting towards the class to earn the credit. He could be rude at times to some. I would not recommend him.",0
There's a test on every chapter. The tests are extremely long and doesn't come from the book. I spent a lot of time reading and still almost failed every test. Tests don't accurately reflect the textbook readings. There's no discussion boards at all and there's no interaction whatsoever with the professor. She was out of the country a LOT!,0
1. He does not understand a thing about what he's teaching;    2. He does not understand your codes either;    3. Constantly asks for help from the student next to him and 'his old friend'--google;    4. Takes points off for no reason he could explain;    5. Read directly from class notes he posts;    6. Can't prepare you ready for anything.,0
"I enjoy music and everything about it, but it's difficult to be enthusiastic about music when Prof. Keister is lackluster and dull. Class was easy and so are the tests! Review lectures given and you should be golden.",0
Shelome is very nice and very approachable.  LOVED this class when I took it.  Not too much homework.  Tests are kinda hard though.  She's very into the subject matter. It's fun to hear her speak....love the accent!  Go for it if she's teaching it.,1
Would not recommend taking him. Very difficult grader and does not help very much unless you completely understand the book. I attended every class and participated in almost every lecture and attended office hours and he would not round my 79 to an 80. He will call you out in class and ask you to speak randomly. Don't take this class.,0
"I really enjoyed this class. He is extremely knowledgeable about philosophy. Your grade is 50% midterm/50% final. Homework is optional, but help lectures make more sense, and he goes over the answers everyday. Both exams are a majority homework questions. I did the homework, participated everyday, got A's on the exams. Easiest class I took.",1
"Claims he teaches you to think independently. Dont believe it! He only cares about what he thinks. If you treat him like a guru and agree with his politics, he loves you. If not he blows you off. Very disillusioning to have a philosophy professor who is so close-minded.",0
"Super strict about guidelines, but yet confusing. The exams are headache inducing. The material itself was really interesting but she did not seem to care about the students, even if it was an online class. And the final paper had nothing to do with the material covered in class.",0
I took Perez for Race and Ethnicity and it was good. It was a 500 person lecture hall but I was lucky enough to get an awesome TA (Frank Perez). Going to lecture was long but still really cool to listen to Perez lecture. There is also a couple quizzes and they're all spread out. Your main grade is in the discussion class. I definielty recommond!,1
"The only prof I've encountered who has done world-class research and still approaches teaching as though it is a top priority. If you have to take 101, make sure it's with her! Don't miss her office hours-she is a gem! Her occasional errors were encouraging as a girl who was told that girls can't do math! She patiently helped me prove them wrong!",1
Aren is really helpful and always makes lectures interesting. The topic changes each week which keeps the class moving and prevents you from being bored,1
"Prof Hasheminia is simply amazing. Because of him and DS 412, I switched to DS major.",1
"Loved Mr. Martin's class! He is such an approachable professor, and he tries to make class interesting. He makes sure to learn your name and help you get to know your other classmates. He's adorable. I think of him as my ISU grandpa. :)",1
"Tests are a few long answer questions, but VERY broad. She expects you to be an absolute expert in the subject matter, even though her notes are useless. The question may seem straightforward but it's not. In lecture she normally just rants about her experiences with plants and how amazing plants are to her. Go to the review sessions! Good luck lol",0
She is a very informative and wonderful professor. she is very clear and has great lectures and teaching techniques. I learned alot about History in a comfortable environment.She explains everything very well so that when it comes time for the test you are completely ready with no surprises. THe class was very engaging and exciting. Must take!!!,1
"Passionate about teaching. If all professors were as dedicated as Asbell, we would all succeed. Made learning fun and inspiring. They broke the mold!!!! Thank you!",1
Eh,1
Very nice professor. If you are looking for a class to play in this is not it. Professor Schaller pushes you to do your work. Once you leave her class you can say I got my moneys worth. She's always available to help with whatever issue you're having.,1
"It seems like a lot of work but its really not. There is an online quiz for every chapter which makes up a lot of points for the class. One presentation, and one group book. Gives amazing feedback that will help you succeed and pass the class. I wish I could take more classes with Heather!",1
"The best of the best. She has high expectations but will do everything she can to help you meet them. If you communicate with her,  she will be your best resource. Very funny and witty,  and knows the material extremely well. Would give her an A++ on being a fantastic advisor.",1
"Arts and crafts for babies was the most difficult course I have taken at MacEwan university. I took Gerard's class becasue I heard he was inspirational and it would be a GPA boost, but instead I just found myself up at 2am gluing googly eyes into a scrapbook in order to explain my life story to my classmates in picture format the next day.",0
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
"If you're taking it because you're interested in the subject, PICK A DIFFERENT PROF. if you're taking it for the credit, he's your man. he hands out extra credit like it's candy. super boring guy though.",1
"Really despised this class. The textbook was awful, had a lot of useless information that you HAD to read through to do well on the quizzes. You basically need a LOT of time to do well in this course. The final exam had 80 MCQ and one hour and a half to complete which was not enough at all. One of the worst grades on my record.",0
"If you want an easy class with not much work, do not take this professor. She has high standards and does not ""dummy down"" her grading because you are at a community college. You will learn a lot if you are willing to work hard, but her standards are high. Other teachers are much easier, but you won't learn as much.",1
A great professor that is flexible with grading and wants students to do well. Definitely recommend him.,1
"Opie as he likes to be called is readily available to help his students, who he wants to succeed. He gives his cell phone number so students can call him anytime they have a question, and he will spend hours explaining something until you understand it. He is personable, a great teacher, and a wonderful motivator. One of the best teachers ever.",1
"I personally hate this class. The layout of the class makes no sense. The countries are scattered and the order is not related. He constantly talks about the ""Universal Pattern of Culture"" which is in no other academic source online or otherwise. The only source I have found that has anything similar contrasts his definitions completely.",0
"Often tardy and ill-prepared for her own lectures. Exam questions were sometimes vague or ambiguous (which is particularly vexing when the exam is proctored by someone else). Seems like a nice enough person, but come on, this is college, not the Adult Learning Program down at the Glen Burnie Community Center.",0
He's horrible. I hated him with every fiber in my being. ,0
"Terrible, rushes through each section. It's like he's talking to himself when he's teaching, he does stop to ask questions. On top of it all he has a thick accent and can be difficult to understand.",0
Dr. Richmond is a great professor. The midterm and final consist of questions that you might have already answered in the previous quizzes so study those quizzes. Dr. Richmond also gives out study guides which are extremely helpful. He cares about you grasping important material and passing the class. Good luck!,1
"I don't understand how people think this class is easy, I went to every class, studied notes and took his advice on how to study and still had a very hard time in this class.  The exams are strange, the multiple choice and true and false are very difficult and confusing but the math is pretty simple.  He's very nice but the exams are just brutal.",1
This class has more assignments and harsher grading than any programming class. I would rather retake programming classes than deal with this class ever again.,0
Love this teacher,1
I loved her class very good information to learn from. Everything was exactly from the book so if you read the chapters you will do very good but if you don't read then I don't know what to say. It was a very easy class if you read and she does offer extra credit just in case you need a boost in grade.,1
"Easiest ochem 1 prof at CSU, but teach yourself. Unresponsive to emails &  reads slides to you. Exams are fairly straightforward w. lots of bonus chances &  curves. Knows kids cheat & didnt care. Final is repeats Qs from quizzes & tests so GO SEE UR TESTS. Some Qs from test banks others from Depoali's hw assignments. If u need an A shes your chance",0
"Took this course summer 17'. All we had to worry about was reading our required chapters for the pop quizzes she would hand in class. For tests, she would let us use notes. The final paper was 6 case briefings, which were really easy to do. Her lectures were interesting. She was an awesome professor. Do what you have to do and you will pass.",1
"The class itself was very boring and not enjoyable in very many aspects.  I learned more by reading the material than I did by discussing the ideas with both the professor and the class.  For English majors, a class with her is inevitable.  She may not be the most personable person around, but if you focus on academics, you should be fine.",0
Good information. Great communicator. Wouldn't let us have a copy of the powerpoints that he whizzed through. I feel like I missed a lot of good info. Nice guy. Clear on what he wants. Fair grader. Took time with me to help me understand the material,1
What did she even say? With her accent an fast talking I wasn't able to understand much of what she said. Her way of answering questions is by avoiding them. The online Labs Plus was more help than she was. ,0
"Exams are dumb, and unrelated to his study guide. All exams are scenarios based questions. You have to answer exactly what he wants and difference and you lose credit. Save time and dont take this professor",0
I took characteristics: mild/moderate and there is a module due once a week. There are lots of things in this module so I recommend not procrastinating it.,1
"This professor, and the TA, both choose which parts of the readings they consider fact. Multiple quizzes I had correct answers and quizzes from both the reading and lecture but missed the points because, in their opinion (never shared with class) they were not the most important. Would not take again.",0
I would highly recommend taking a different professor for Spanish. She's highly unhelpful if you didn't take a Spanish class the semester prior to taking her class. ,0
"This class was challenging but well worth it. Definitely an upper-level anthro course I would recommend to anyone, especially with Dr. Prussing teaching it. Quite a bit of reading but nothing is busywork. ",1
"He made a 3 hour class very fun and interesting by splitting time between lectures and activities. Test are multiple choice, matching, and essay, not cumulative. No textbook, but he assigns articles to read that can get lengthy. 4-5 short essays & 1 group project throughout the semester. Overall, great teacher with lots of experience in the field.",1
"She has a passion for the art field, and she wants you to pass the class. There are 2-3 papers which are pretty simple, and a group project on whoever is relevant to the class. The book is only required for the papers, however there are some minor group discussions.",1
****er droped me from his class becasue he had a retarted senior who needed it,0
"Creed is very smart, but don't take this class if you want to be an unbiased, thoughtful political scientist. As was mentioned, the readings are very heavy, but they are all aligned with his political beliefs, and he will berate anyone who does not agree... And he quite literally made up midterm grades (I have written 10 papers, 3 have been read).",0
"Loved this class. Brad was super helpful when it came to writing papers. Participation really does matter, speak up in group discussions and you will do fine. He's very nice and is passionate about what he teachers. Assigns 3 papers. No tests. Overall great class, and I learned to love and appreciate poetry. My favorite teacher at FSU.",1
"He is a very good professor. He is very polite and he likes to give his opinion and advice. He will try to help you out as much as he can and he will reward teams for their hardwork.   The course itself is not easy, because you will need to have a good team in order to deliver a good product.",1
"she seems a little spaced out sometimes, or shes very forgetful about things.  shes a nice person but that wont help you learn anything!",0
"Best professor at this horrible AA program. He is a very smart person, take him won't regret it :)))) !!",1
This was an excellent class and I recommend it to anyone interested in algae or even just plants in general. Vinebrooke made it extremly interesting and class was never boring. There was a lot of work in the class so bewarned but he is a fiar marker and gives extenstions. Overal great prof!,1
Don't walk..run away!  He reads straight from a powerpoint and makes things very confusing. The tests are extremely difficult...he really enjoys the essay questions.  Way too much info given for the amount of time he teaches (aka-read straight from the powerpoint). I would never take another class taught by this professor again.,0
Dr. Baddar does an amazing job as a teacher. She helped me tremendously to see my potential as a writer. She will not give you an easy A but if put forth the effort the class is not difficult. Attendance and participation do matter but mainly because Dr. Baddar truly wants you to understand what she is teaching. I would take again most definitely.,1
"Took Prof. Osoba two semesters back-to-back and not only did he remember past students, but he would also genuinely take the time to ask how you've been, what you've been up to, and will reference past class information. He's quite old-fashioned and is a very paper and pencil type of guy, but he's a fair grader, and the syllabus is easy to follow.",1
Vague explanation of how he grades the journal which is a major part of your grade. The class seemed more for students to fail than succeed.  Would not recommend taking this class unless you have to.,0
"He is very confusing and talks way too fast. When you ask him a question about the material, he laughs at you and won't explain it. His tests were pretty easy if you understand the material. He's not very friendly either, I felt like I couldn't go talk to him during his office hours. ",0
I love doug!!! He is amazing. Take his class. You'll love it.,1
"Every single one of her exam questions is a trick question. Just beware of that. On all three exams of hers, I studied very hard a day prior, felt great on the exam, and still only got 70% or sometimes less as my final result.",1
Margarita is the best!!!,1
"Very good professor. She knows what she's talking about and explains everything very clearly. The class was definitely harder than I thought it would be. She assigns a fairly heavy work load. You also need to go to class, pay attention, and read the book to do well. Her test questions are very clear and a study guide is provided before the test.",1
"Osoba is a really nice teacher, but I would personally never take this class again. I would only recommend taking this class if you are an economics major or you have a love for it. The test are really hard and you have to memorize everything. You won't understand any of the study guides unless you go to him for help. Take it online if you can!",1
"yes, very disorganized and very boring but her class is quite easy. i found that her tests are pretty easy but there is alot of reading within the class. tests are spread out and there is alot of info on the test. overall, very compassionate lady and down to earth. attendence no big issue",1
Absolute worst. Tests are easy if you understand the basic concept of each problem. He is by far the hardest grader in the world. Takes off points even if the answer is correct. If he sees one thing not there that is a point off. Too old. Born in the BC era,0
"He rarely lectured, if he did he rushed thru the material and most likely, his lecture had NOTHING to do with exams. You are expected to read and teach yourself-- however, good luck trying to decide what obscure questions he will ask on exams. Worst prof.",0
"She goes over so much in a short period of time. It's hard to take everything in. She also jumps back and forth on what she is teaching. All in all, I don't like her.",0
"Tons of reading, but Haldane is a fair grader. She's nice and seems to really care about her students.",1
Jackie is by far my favorite professor I've ever taken at WCU. She makes the class as easy as possible and is so clear with what she expects from students. I took her twice and wish I could take her again. She really is the best professor on this campus,1
"Professor Perez is a wonderful instructor. He is easy, good grader and takes his class seriously. Very helpful and you won't regret taking his class. Easy, great and fun assignments in his class.",1
She will put you to sleep. AWFUL.,0
"I actually learned something in her class, very organized and on top of things",1
"Dr. Banks has a passion for nursing and it shows through lecture. Sometimes she can be a little dry, but her caring attitude and pun jokes make up for that. She has an amazing heart and wants her students to succeed. Provides interesting guest lectures.",1
"Sanda was amazing! She is one of the directors on the VCD Board so she knows her stuff and will be very helpful and attentive to you. She is a hard grader (only gives one A) but it is worth it, she pushes you and constantly brings in examples.",1
"I LOVE Professor Powell.  If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have been able to transfer to UC Irvine's dance department.  She pushed me and believed in me.  She's more than a teacher.  She's hard but she knows her stuff & she has done it all.  Take a look at her bio.  She's no joke!  Her choreography rocks for all the shows. Never seen a boring piece",1
"this class was oddly difficult for an elementary ed math class. we constantly had pop quizzes and worksheets for homework, which is doable. but on the tests, the problems were so much more complex than anything we had practiced. the point of this class was to learn how to teach elementary students and i don't feel like i learned how to do that.",1
"NEVER take ecology with her unless you can get the tests from previous years. She'll talk about something in class for maybe 5 seconds and put an entire page of questions on the test. She literally can't teach and makes the class based off of group quizzes. Really difficult time passing this class and I'm usually an A student, good luck w yang.",0
"She was an easy grader, class was about 30-45 minutes tops. Watched videos, answered discussion questions and did a big project towards the end. Overall, easy A, she is very nice and responds to emails within a day",1
Easily the worst professor I have EVER had here in my time at Temple. Completely arrogant in many regards. Sees the world in his perspective and if you do not agree with him your wrong.  Worst books I have ever had to read for a class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!,0
Miss Errico is amazing!! I'm taking her again next semester for Acct. 2. go to class pay attention and you should pass. a lot of extra credit  and help is given. she is extremely reachable too. ,1
"There wasn't much clarity for when things were due. She did not follow her syllabus at all. Moody most days, she would often bring stress with her to the classroom. At times she seemed very sarcastic, & condescending. She was often scrambled, and forgetful so DOCUMENT EVERYTHING U DO. Would I choose again; NO. Perk? No final if you had 90% or more.",0
"Very unprofessional.  Berated and humiliated me in front of the entire class after misreading one of my written answers (he mistook an ""A"" for  ""4"").   Even after he realized that he was mistaken and my answer was correct, continued to berate me on this and subsequent occasions.  Really seemed to have it in for me.  Avoid if at all possible!",0
"So. Much. Homework. Each module had an insane amount of reading required to answer the THREE discussion posts per week. It was annoying because it wasn't worth the amount of work required, but also worth too much to skip it. On top of that, so many little assignments and huge papers. Doesn't give you a HW break on weeks of papers. No exams.",1
Mr Dr Luna is an amazing professor.,1
"Prof. Zbeida was one of my all time favorite college professors. I always got amazing feedback that was critical but never rude. She helped me improve my writing skills greatly. 10/10 would reccomend her course. There are many reserach papers and lots of quizzes, but every topic is interesting and the quizzes are very helpful.",1
"A very good teacher; somewhat boring class. Tests can be a bit difficult, but not too bad if you study (he gives a summary sheet with all material covered at the end of each class, and takes test questions directly from those). No textbook and very few homework assignments. A perfect teacher for this course, as he really knows the material!",1
really boring.... no will to come to class,0
"I took her remote class in the pandemic and it was rough. She graded nothing of mine until after the semester was over and she assigned multiple 100-400 point essays that were not only graded late, but also harshly. I also drowned in weekly assignments. She was laid back on due dates, so much so that it only became damaging to everyone in the end.",0
This guy and the class were horriable.  He only had one midterm that was all essay and one huge final project.  He did not give clear directions on anything.  This class has been a headache. Avoid taking him if you can.,0
"Enjoyed him, great man and one of the best teachers ever.  Always took time out of his schedule to communicate and help.  Not only that, knew like everyone's name in a lecture hall the size of a movie theater.  Plus, his lectures are interesting",1
"Lectures are entertaining, but you don't learn much. He's a nice, funny guy, and he's enthusiastic about the material he teaches, but you learn most of the material from reading the textbook and trying to do the homework. Exams are exactly like the practice exams.",1
"Awful class, there goes my gpa",0
"Professor's reading assignments mostly consist of his own writings that summarize thinkers like Hegel, Locke, etc. in a few short paragraphs -- so this course doesn't really teach you about sociology or how to critically analyze texts, just parrot back his own ideas of who these people are. Seems very self-indulgent.",0
Took summer course for PHIL 1304. Very clear outline in the syllabus. As long as you participated in discussion boards and did the web assignments on time you should do fine. All quizes and the final were open note. I honestly phoned it in a lot because I was starting a new job during this semester and still made an A+.,1
Take his class! Tony is an awesome professor. He makes the class fun. Most test are on lectures so take notes!Easy assignments and test. There is a research paper on a gang (not to bad.)Too bad he only teaches one class.,1
"Really nice person and teacher! Goes off topic quite a bit but it does relate to what she is teaching (most of the time.) Be sure to attend class and it is recommended to have a textbook for her class just to make your life easier, her online notes are very generalized and don't cover much of what she actually talks about in class.",1
"Not a horrible teacher.  She is really nice and tries to make the horrid subject of accounting interesting.  She makes it seem easy and just when you think you get it, the test is totally different and harder.. the homework is all online and is super easier (sometimes time-consuming).  Got a C+, take it online to save some $.",1
"Wike overall was very good, but an extremely tough grader. It is next to impossible to get perfects, or near perfect scores on anything. I am not at all interested in the healthcare field (history major). I learned a lot, but be prepared to not get a A, and to work your ass off.",1
"i was an econ major, now i'm not. the man makes up formulae and has nonsensical graphs. he's boring, and the class is even worse. what you do in class (which is redundant at best) has little to do with the exams. he will make you despise macro without even really teaching it to you.",0
"I have never left a rating, but this dude is something else. Anything that isn't auto-graded in mindtap is graded like sh*t. Group projects are a nightmare, attendance is a grade and I was marked absent for a no-class holiday and wasn't given credit. Emails take years to be responded to. Basically do not take unless there is no other option. BIG NO",0
"I took this professor for english comp 1 and 2 a couple of years ago. I hated her so much that I occasionally come back here to warn people how unprofessional and bipolar she is. I would get B's on her papers with NO explanation as to why??!? If you're a cute boy you'll probably do well in her class, the rest of us have to work a little harder.",0
 I took the Hybrid class. Attending classes is recommended but not required. Usually she records her classes and posts them on You Tube. The class can be challenging however Ms. Errico is there to answer your questions whether in class or through email. She is quick to respond and is extremely helpful. I would recommend her and take her class again,1
She is very helpful! If you go to class and use her help she is willing to give you will do great. She wants everyone to pass! You are very independent in this class..if you need a babysitter don't go to college.,1
"This class was really hard .They are  4 exams with 65% of the grade  , drops the lowest grade .He reads straight from the power points ,give study guide just the questions  ,  with no answers . Students were sleeping on the class I would not take him again .",0
I took this as a general art class. let me just say that if you are not an art/ history major do not bother taking this course. Her lectures are a bit dry. The exams are challenging(unless you love writing papers). Again unless your an art major do not bother taking this class. it will just add to your stress,0
She is great I would take her again,1
Exams are so easy since its just like the practise exam: yes i said just like,1
"Sweet man. Records all his lectures, so you dont have to attend. Tends to go on and on about a topic, so sometimes loses sense of time. Otherwise gives good examples and is pretty clear in lectures. 4 multiple choice tests, absolutely no assignments.",1
"Professor Mason is honestly the best. Hilarious, well-educated, respected, fun to listen to. You will never fall asleep in his lectures. He works hard, grades fairly quickly, gives extra credit and makeup opportunities, and learns everyone's names. I have had him twice now and I love him. He is everything good about the English department.",1
I've taken professor Hanley several times and he's one of the easier professors to take. Discussion board postings are due one week then responses are due the next week which is pretty easy to me. There was a group project but it was not hard. Everyone pitched in and there was only an 8 slide requirement.,1
"She is not easy at all.  Do not take her online if you work or have family because she send a lot of homework.  She also is very hard for this class level.  I admit I learned a lot but It cost me too much.  She is also very responsible posting the grades, every organize person and willing to try help you.  But becareful she is not easy!!",1
"I love Dr. Oakley as a person, but this class is very hard for non geology majors. There are SO many opportunities to bring your grade up from the tests throughout the semester, but if you don't get As on those it can stop you from doing well in the class.",1
This was a great class and Im so happy I took it. This professor teaches well while still letting his students pursue the type of art they want to do. Hes very nice and easy to talk to and his lectures are great and always relevant to business outside of the classroom.,1
"Still uses moodle when we as students pay for D2L. Talks about himself like he is the the ""best."" The lectures are all over the place. He starts talking about one topic bounces around to another topic. Be prepared to be confused with his teaching methods very unorthodox.",0
Loved her class!! She's a great professor cares about her students and makes sure that they understand everything before she starts the new lesson wish she was teaching other courses. If you need to take this class she's the teacher! Easy A,1
"I took this class during winter intersession. She explained that each day was ""two weeks worth of information"". Attendance matters, grades 5/6 responses, 2 5pg papers, 3 (essay answer) OPEN NOTE exams all within 10 days! It's nonstop work but seems to be slightly lenient on page length if you explain thoroughly. Intimidating but doable :)",1
Took the online course. VERY unclear with directions and assignments. Grade is based on 3 online exams and participations in weekly discussions. Never answers e-mail questions. If you read and teach yourself from the textbook it is an easy course but if you are not self-disciplined do not take his online course.,0
Julie is nice but a bit unorganized. Maybe she is well organized but overwhelmed with responsibility. This class is pretty basic. It's pretty easy to get an A in it.,1
i took this class for winter session and she was a good teacher. i learned alot in her class and her test are easy if you study the material.,1
Her lectures are terrible. She is willing to meet outside of class but why she teaches in class is totally different from the tests and homework. Doesn't make senes. makes students feel stupid.,0
One of my favorite classes at iup! He very interesting lectures and debates on moral issues. Sometimes will have a few questioned pop quizes to see if you did the reading. You have to write a few post stating your stance on issues on d2l and take a lot of notes but i really enjoyed this class.,1
"Don't bother coming to the lectures; test questions will rely heavily on the bullet points she sends through Canvas. Lets you bring one paper as a 'cheat sheet'. Want to pass? Use her handouts. Want to understand Pharmacology? Read the book, but risk not passing. But she is fair with her grading.",0
Professor Imam is a wonderful person. He is willing to challenge his students and help you succeed if you are patient with him.,1
Talks too quietly and has a really thick accent. I asked him THREE TIMES for the answer key to the midterm and still haven't had it. The class isn't too bad but hes just not much of a teacher. If you want a good result study his assignments - his exams are almost exactly the same in format and questions!,0
"Professor Henderson did a great job relating topics to what was going on in the world. Even though the class was online, it felt like a real classroom environment. She provided us with tons of resources to help complete assignments and walked us through things if we needed more help, which was great!",1
"Professor Cirilo is an amazing professor. She's very caring and easy-going on. You do have to read in order to pass this course. The exams are not too tough, as long as you read. The final was a little tougher than the exams. Discussions are fairly easy, but it does require to think some. She does offer extra credit. Very easy A, if you read!",1
Extensive amount of homework for a mandatory class for all students. Take any other teacher if you're given the chance. 3 papers throughout the semester which count for most of the grade so put the effort in to those. If you miss more than two classes without a legitimate excuse you fail.,0
Dr. Ghosh is a really terrific teacher. She makes it easy to follow the course material online and has a easy to follow timeline for everything in the semester. She answers emails back quickly and usually with a good deal of explanation. She is very fair.,1
"This teacher is really hard to understand, the way he teaches makes the subject matter harder to explain than necessary.  He adds steps that go beyond the basics of this class and goes more into higher end math like calculus",0
good prof. very clear instruction.,1
He's seriously one of the best professors I have ever had he genuinely cares ! He's the best and so nice ! He expects common courtesy like don't be on your phone don't talk when someone is doing their speech little things like that he really is the best I loved this class ! (:,1
Boring and loves to ramble about nothing. If you tell him the tests are too hard he WILL make the next one easier.,1
"mr bohuslav is a genious, extremely passionate about architecture and the program, he really really cares about each and one of his students and their success, very tough but understanding. very demanding but caring. he pushes us so much because he knows thats the only way to get the best of us. If you truly want to learn, take him, otherwise no.",1
"Dr. Gentry is a kind and casual guy. Each lecture he talks a little about the subject at hand, but then creates a discussion amongst the class. This is an unusual style, but a nice refresher from intense lectures. Random pop quizzes will come, but he drops your lowest quiz grade. Overall, his class isnt hard as long as you show up and participate.",1
"Professor Gartland can get side-tracked easily, but when she does, those are the extra credit questions that she puts on the exams. She is a very sweet lady, and the tests are common sense. There is no homework for this course.",1
"This professor assigns massive loads of work, is extremely vague, and pretends to know more than she does. I learned nothing of value from taking this class.",0
"He always seemed bored with what he did at NOVA. If a couple people didn't show up to class (even though attendance wasn't mandatory), he'd regularly go on rants about attendance to everyone who was already there, ready to learn. Books weren't needed and he gave lots of EC.",0
The man will type code on a screen and not explain anything in a way that someone at beginner level could ever understand. DO NOT take his class if you want to learn anything of substance.,0
"Si vous pouvez, CHANGER de PROF, dans le top 3 des pires prof que j'ai eu de ma vie!",0
Do not take her.  Very disorganized and takes weeks to grade assignments.,0
very strict with turning things in and grades hard...,0
"off topic. He will play 7 videos a class and none of them will be relevant to the course material. this class has so many assignments where you will be left thinking ""when did I learn this"" and it's probably because you never did. most disorganized course I've been in.",0
"I have always received an A in every math class I have ever taken. I love math but this professor nearly ruined it for me. Every class is a lecture with note taking but ALL OF THE NOTES ARE WORDS, NO MATH PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. He made something simple seem extremely confusing and he YELLED LOUDLY at us because of it. I didn't go back. Disrespectful!",0
"Fantastic prof. He is so helpful. The classes can be boring at times, but if you're confused about something, he is VERY helpful and explains concepts very well. His speech is a good tone too. His enunciation is very clear, which makes it much easier to understand him.",1
"Pynn can be a bit intimidating. He expects students to have a philosophical perspective on everything, which makes discussions difficult. I can tell that he's a nice guy, but the work load and policies are a bit much. 3 absences are allowed, anything after that results in deduction of 1/2 letter grade. four 5-pg long papers, and 3 other papers.",0
"Honestly, this class was one of the most enjoyable, easy classes I have taken. I am so glad I found this ""Social Media"" class. It only lasts half a semester and def an easy  A if you do the work. Don't get lazy as it's not much work! Easiest A if you do the work. Also, very nice person in general.  I would take him again if I could!",1
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
"Absolutely useless online course.  Most of the online resource links don't work, the assignments are posted late but still expected to be on time, and there is no organization.  We went from saying ""Hello, my name is..."" in Week 3 to being expected to introduce ourselves and someone else in a paragraph of French with no lead-in.  Just terrible.",0
Makes you do unnecessary work and is super extra. This class will make your life harder than it should be. Also dont bother asking for extra time because hell ask you for evidence on why you need it.,0
Impossible to get good grades with how he has his TAs grade our work. He does not make clear how papers are graded. I also never understood the logic behind TAs grading student essays cuz they are not even an expert in the field yet.,0
"Tests are difficult. Labs are graded leniently. The material is tough regardless of professor. 4 exams in total one gets dropped. 10 labs in total two get dropped. He wants students to succeed but expects effort. Comes off as gruff initially due to his 20 years of military service, but makes up for it with his sense of humor.",1
Great teacher very easy!!,1
"Dr. Leamon Bazil was by far one of the worst professors I have ever taken. It took weeks to get a response via email. He was often late to post assignments. He duplicated feedback on papers for several students, which leads me to believe he failed to dedicate the appropriate attention to his student's writings required. Would never recommend him.",0
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
"Garrigans class was heavily a lecture class. There are only 3 exams (that are each worth 25% of your grade) and 3 writing assignment (each 5%). So basically if you dont do well on one of the exams youre screwed. I find his grading system to be unfair, considering not all students test well. Bottom line, I wouldnt recommend taking his class.",0
"Professor Vallejo is a great professor. Attendance was somewhat optional and he started class 15 minutes late for the latecomers. Participation is mandatory otherwise he will demand the class do an in class assignment. He does have hearing aids so sometimes he misunderstands what you're saying, especially if you're not in close proximity to him.",1
"He is a really fun teacher to have. Also one of the smartest teachers at the school, and in his field of teaching  ",1
"Sometimes politically incorrectmisinformed and was condescending and one-sided towards some cultures, despite this being a class about ethnicity- you'll see what I mean. The tests and notes were so scattered, making it hard to study. Shows movies that I felt had little relevance to the larger topics.",0
"Must attend classes, but lectures don't help much as he reads off a Powerpoint. Ignore him and read the textbook. Overall not a good teacher; he gets angry when you ask questions and his attempt to answer math- related questions only causes more confusion. Avoid if you can",0
"Tons of reading and about two hours worth of lectures to watch before class. Overall hes a good professor and pretty easy if you can manage all his readings. He will ask questions about them and his midterm/final are a combination of the reading and lectures. If you pay attention, youll do well.",1
Lover her. Best Professor EVERRRRRRRR. And she's totes easy on the eyes (;,1
Avoid at all cost for Biodiversity unless you absolutely love ecology/geography. Will overwhelm you with information. To summarize this class... ecology trivia and mindless memorization of random facts he decided would make a good excuse for a class. EXTREMELY thick accent and gets mad if you ask about exam content. Rude to students overall. Avoid!,0
nice lady and helpful but gives WAY TOO MUCH HOMEWORK!!!!,1
Acts intimidating to the point where some students droped his class. At the first class he made everyone question their decision to go to UFV. Extremely condescending to the point of being rude. If the english is your second language I definitely do not recommend him.,0
"I wish that Prof. Liu taught Calc 2. I took calculus in high school and mostly already understood the course, but she made the concepts so much clearer than I remember learning them. Her accent isn't that hard to understand and she will do everything to make sure you pass the class. Homework is completion, tests are short and the class isn't long.",1
"Easy class and he managed to make something boring, fun. Our class got a ""Christmas Present"" which was not having to do the final exam. As long as you do the listenings and read the textbook (maybe 30 minutes of homework after each class at most) it's an easy A.",1
"If you are not fluent in Spanish, you will struggle a lot. He depends on you to ask, and when you ask he might not explain it well. ",0
"If I could have taken this class with another professor I would have. In every encounter I had with him he was rude and disinterested in what I had to say. His answers to e-mails were vague and never in full sentences. Weird because he seems nice while lecturing, it's just one-on-one he is like this. Grading ends up fair though.",0
"Lessons are clearly explained as are the due dates. She is a firm grader, but this is to be expected in COLLEGE! Asking questions in class was the only thing i found difficult but when the lesson is finished, she is happy to help. She answers phone calls, emails and any questions ASAP. I recommend this class to real students who want to learn alot.",1
Dr. Brown is an excellent teacher. I plan to take him for all the math courses I will need! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
"He's an excellent professor. This class is easy, but there is A LOT of work per assignment. If you just do what you're supposed to, you'll make a B easy. It is group heavy, so make sure you address any issues early.",1
"Really easy to get in contact with, which is important for online. I had an exam time out and submit prior to finishing and she was able to reopen it for me when I texted her. In this class, you get out of it what you put into it. You can read the chapters and learn, or you can find the answers for the assignment that week quickly if you're rushed.",1
Jill is an excellent professor! She is very helpful and explains difficult materials in a very understandable way.  It was her first year teaching at Concordia but she honestly seems to have years of teaching experience. Absolutely loved her class!!!,1
"Horrible,rude,demeaning, unorganized, snotty, mandatory fields trips but doesn't provide transportation. Annoyed easily. Teaches like students are all geology majors. Study guides arent helpful. She was rude to the special needs student. Makes you stay after exams. Doesnt teach from the book. Ask for another instructor if you can.",0
"Professor Graff is not a good professor. For her, a student will understand if she/he has analytical skills, otherwise the student won't because she/he ""just doesn't get it"" . It's seriously terrible. For that, she doesn't take too much time explaining the class content. Even when she explains something, those 15min are sometimes incomprehensible.",0
Good professor. Make sure to show up. Not to tough. A good class to take to complete MACRAO. I would recommend this prof. She knows her stuff and is helpful. The class is also easy. It teaches a lot about how humans communicate.,1
This man is very sweet but very out of touch. Online teaching is definitely not his format of choice. He rambles a lot and I found myself doing better by not attending lectures.,0
"Her work is beautiful, but her work is clearly her focus.",0
"Very vague with grading criteria. Not clear whatsoever with grading and assignments. As a person who has never enrolled in a geography course prior, I would not recommend this instructor. Sobie grades hard and does not hold himself to the same standard. What a joke! This school should look into just how terrible their online instructors truly are.",0
"Very tough grader and hard class. Would not recommend. He did answer emails fast and was helpful, but papers were very hard to even receive a decent grade",0
I had Dr. Sam for lab and he is a decent teacher. He has a heavy accent and his lectures are boring but he he knows his stuff and lets you know what is important for the practical. If you study the textbook and the photos online attendance isn't really mandatory.,1
She is a horrible professor. She doesn't write out any problems on the board and reads off a google doc the whole class. Then when the class doesn't do good on an exam she blames it on the students for not studying enough. She is very rude.,0
"Somewhat funny. However, he changed the project criteria throughout the class and was always unclear about the requirements. You could skip class, and just read from the book or slides. Do problems somehow. He said from now on he wants make the project weigh more and use the book less. Overall he's quite inexperienced and unclear. Curves at the end",0
"Do not take her, take another professor f possible. she does not even teach correctly, it is more of a self learning class",0
"I hate chemistry, but professor Mu made it fun to learn. I actually debated about changing majors just because of his class. He is a great teacher, i still struggled, but the struggle became a challenge i enjoyed. Thank you.",1
"By far the worst teacher Ive ever encountered. Doesnt really answer questions instead he ask you a question ��. Additionally, He grades mercilessly. Make sure you read the syllabus and take his words as a grain of salt. Seems like his main objective is to make sure the class is as difficult as possible. Good luck trying to get an A. Take heed",0
I hate math but I love Mrs. V! I had to take MTE 1-4 and I kept her the whole way through. It is fast paced class because MTE is only 4 weeks long. You get homework everyday and everyday you learn a new unit. She's very helpful though and will make sure you understand. She also has a sense of humor that is gold and cool to hear at 8am.,1
be careful!!he deducts points on your exams even though you do them the right way.,0
I have tooken Norton for another english class and he is very sweet and understanding. He will accept late work even if he says he will not!!!!,1
He is my favorite professor! He is very intelligent and knows how to catch everyone's attention in class. His way of teaching is the best. You won't regret taking him.,1
"Worst professor I've ever taken. Please, spare yourself from this course. I didn't learn one thing and he uses the same exams each semester so everyone cheats. Not about that type of laziness.",0
I've had this instructor for 1301 and 1302. He's always willing to answer my questions seriously even answered one in the middle of the night. The test are pretty easy. The essays can be a challenge. But he's always around to help.,1
Bunch of busy work so much effort required for basic grades. Way too cheerful. Definitely has favorites.,0
" The class material was extremely boring.  I tried to follow and learn from the critiques she gave me but I did not see any improvement in my grade. Her critiques are vague, this was one of the most frustrating class I ever took. I do not like her teaching style and I do not recommend her to anyone. Boring , frustrating & prof not interactive.",0
"Disorganized instructor. Her French sounds bizarre, with a strong English accent. Relies too much on the Internet. She shows up late to class way too many times. She does not seem to remember to return marked papers. I can't figured out what or if  we learned anything in this course. Never again with this instructor, not recommended!",0
"He is such a bad prof, please avoid him if you can.",0
My tailoring class with Ronda has transformed my sewing hobby into a total obsession! The techniques she teaches ranges from practical to total couture. Ronda provides excellent drawings and written material to assist you outside of class (and in the long term when you've forgotten how to use a certain technique). I look forward to every class!,1
Absolutely loved her. Learned a lot in her class and felt at ease. Truly a gem of a person.,1
responded to all my questions.,1
shes ... interesting ... you better know your chem. go to class do your work participate. get on her good side ( dont talk back be loud etc ) tests vary depending on her mood and boy is she moody. you have a better chance reading the book but since theyre changing the book now i have no idea what will be better. she only teaches at night. good luck,0
"He's a very passionate professor, you can tell he really loves Marketing, and get's everyone engaged. Here's my complaints, he is very unclear with the GRADING!! He grades assignments very late. I got 10 assignments back all at once so I was in the blue about what my grade was. The final exam was very rushed! Every absence past 2 is 1% your grade.",1
Absoulte space shot! I had her class at 3:30pm and was still falling asleep. She will give a paper s low grade but give hardly any feedback as to how to do better. Do not take this woman's class!!!,0
I severely dislike this teacher for his lack of effort and bad attitude. Also doesn't respond to any emails even though I emailed him over and over,0
"She knows her info, but it's a confusing topic to begin with so you just get more confused. Typewrite everything she says! Ppts are kinda disorganized. Txtbk is not mandatory but good reference. She's the only one who teaches this class (only winter qtrs). Quizzes, midterms, final are multiple choice and short answer (need to be specific)! ",0
WAY to picky!!!!!!!!,0
Nadeau is a very caring professor. She tells you what is on the quizzes. Unfortunately you have a quiz about every 2 class days but that is the district's rules not hers. She is compassionate and has a cute personality. Do your work and study for a good grade.,1
"Dr. Schulhoff is nice, and seems to be knowledgeable about the field. Her teaching did not reflect that, however. I feel like she didn't teach the class anything. I am all for student-led learning, but this was something different. Powerpoints straight from book, and she reads straight off the slides. Tests and quizzes come straight offline. Avoid.",0
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
"Easy A if you show up, and even if you dont, he sends out ALL the info you need for the final. Your grade depends only on the final so you can never come to class, study the guide he sends out and pass- but I suggest actually going its FASCINATING if youre interested in Philo.",1
I took the class online but it is no longer offered. Any time i had issues i could contact  her via text bu t that was pretty much the only way. I had to get help from the mathlab because my teacher didn't have an office. She gave me an A (94-100) even though the pearson weighted grade was 92.7.,1
"Dude is a legend at PSU. He is super caring and lays everything out for you in Canvas. It takes work to get an A in the class, but it's super easy to pass as long as you do what he tells you. He makes some really funny offhanded comments in class, so watch out for those.",1
"She's a really good teacher, but she makes you work for test grades. She wants in depth essays. One or more field trip and summary of the trip is required. There's several group presentations, nothing on your own. Conservation biology is pretty depressing, but it's very educational, transfers as a 300 or 400 level course to a lot of SUNY schools.",1
"I have never left feedback for a professor before but I decided to for this professor because she is a TOUGH grader. I mean she will comment and deduct points for everything!! Although she is quite helpful, and will reply quickly when you need her to, I wish I took the class with a different professor.",1
"Celia is very passionate about ASL. However, she does not provide much constructive criticism. There was weekly homework and tests worth tiny amounts overall. Has obvious favourites and is not super approachable. You may feel like your efforts are not recognized or you don't gain as much as you put in to the course. Be prepared for tough feedback.",1
"Awesome teacher with a nerdy sense of humor. Very knowledgeable in his field with well organized lectures. He cares about his students and the grades they get, but is a fair (not ""easy"") grader, which is respectable. Written assignments aren't hard, but require effort. Notes on blackboard are perfect to go refer to when he gives you the study guide.",1
"The professor doesn't respond in a timely manner. She doesn't check the answers on her exams, there were 5 wrong answers on our midterm (unable to determine if there were any wrong answers on the final). She is laid back in class but a tough grader. You must read the book and come to class if you want to pass. Shows up late often",0
Takes forever to grade.,0
Only took the online finance course; but my experience was a bad one. This is one of the poorest quality professors I have had a the university level. Outdated lectures/ practice problems will not help you prepare for the quizzes and tests. Quizzes and tests are given with a strict time limits and can be hard to complete. Lucky to get a C.,0
poor poor poor,0
"Beyond some very dry humor, Professor Davis is great in providing valuable feedback and keeping lectures very straightforward. Exams are based on practice problems, not looking to trick students. Group Projects are assigned throughout the semester. A paper as a final project giving you the freedom to pick your favorite topic.",1
"lectures are 3 hours and most of the lecture is examples of examples without examples lecture are an hour He is a harsh grader he does make a study guide for quizzes He makes his test straight from the N+ textbook He has ridiculous turn in times, sometimes 2 weeks others 3 days He doesn't give you any lab time, you have to go to the lab on your own",0
great teacher makes history more relevant to today.,1
By far the worst class Ive ever taken. Never knew someone could make such an interesting class so INCREDIBLY boring. DONT TAKE!!!! The test are insanely hard and contain to broad of questions. Hes way too smart to bring it down to the level of his INTRO students. Awful experience. Had to grind hard! Hopefully I get a B! Smh,0
Be prepared to teach yourself.  He only lectures on problmes he has previously done and copies them from his own notes to the board(and still messes up the problem); he will NOT help with any other problems.,0
"The worst. Unclear on expectations and grading criteria, but grades extremely harshly. Also never grades anything on time, I turned in one of 2 assignments (for the entire class) in JANUARY and he didn't grade it until MARCH 4 days before grades were due. btw i am a 4.0 student, do my work diligently, and still would NEVER recommend",0
"Grade your papers based on criteria she never mentioned before, or only telling you  after you submitted your paper. Often doesn't care about sound arguments as long as you criticize every thing. Worst professor in four years at the university. ",0
He is the best Math professor iv known so far.,1
"Overall she a good teacher, but she typical college professor. very boring and dull. she very nice, but the way she teach is confusing.",0
"I feel as if she leaves out information, does not have anything organized. Majority of the class dropped due to the lack of information presented. Take if you want to stress over tests that she created to purposely fail you. You get three exams and a final. You do get test cheat sheets but be aware as she does not specify, Its a lot, she's petty.",0
"Although this is the toughest class I've ever taken, MA really cares about her students. She shows it in an odd way because she can be rude or mean at times, but it's only because she wants you to do your best and want to succeed. Be prepared to do lots of homework problems. Read the book, and never get behind. It's impossible to catch up.",0
"Great prof because he always respect students' opinion and be able to make quizzes and exams according to students' learning progres. Clear explaining of concepts,  not much homework, and doable exams.",1
Mrs.Gordon is awesome...she is willing to help in anyway she can...she does give you 15 extra mins..to get to class than she will lock you out..lol..she makes class fun with her jokes..i would Highly recommend taking her class,1
"Ms. Long was the best college professor I've ever had. Her class was the only one I ever looked forward to! She loves teaching and she really just loves people! her favorite is people who are willing to think outside the box. To make an A in her class, show up every day, prove that you're trying and just act like you care! She's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
MA comes off crazy at first but she ended up being one of my favorite professors. She cares about her students. She's really entertaining too. I definitely recommend her for BUS1010 but I'm not sure how she is as an accounting teacher.,1
"Got over my fear of public speaking with Mr. Bassow. He gives constructive criticism and helps to me to understand why I need to do this vs. that for stronger presence, speech, and presentations. Very well organized class with lots of laughs. Had fun in class and left with more self esteem. Best professor I've ever had.",1
"Please avoid this professor. You will not learn anything if you take him, especially those who are starting out to code. He is picks on students to do the work for him, specifically girls. There are 5 homework assignments and 2 exams. His homework and exams are very confusing, and some of them are copied from other textbooks. Would not recommend.",0
WOW!! If you want a heavy load of pointless busy work here ya go!! Endless assignments with little knowledge if any to gain from the piles of essays we have to do! There is'nt much to learn from Pro. Thornley so he overcompensates by swamping you with tons of busy work!,0
Dr Feige is the best. He provides us with many assignments in lecture and lab to improve our grade. I really liked the exams posted on blackboard and the lecture videos.,1
"She actually breaks down economics and makes it easy. I've never taken econ before. Not in high school, not during undergrad. She is organized with her deadlines and as long as you study, do your work, you can get an A. I got an A- mainly because of the quizzes since there's not enough time to learn the material by the end of the lecture.",1
"He is absolutely brilliant and expects such brilliance in return. His assignments are challenging and though his marking is difficult, it is fair considering what you are able to take away from his lectures. The effort he asks of you as a student will benefit you in all other English classes. You will walk away from his class feeling accomplished.",1
Worst professor I've had for a statistics course. Makes it extremely difficult to understand and the course is very theorem-based when exams are not. Her notes are also very hard to decipher and the grades take forever to be posted.,0
Professor Ross isn't great. When I ask more than one question he tells me to stop talking to let others talk which leads to awkward silence since nobody else wants to speak up in Zoom classes. He doesn't assign much HW but instead wastes class time by doing HW in class. We spent the entirety of week 3 watching a youtube. WASTE OF TIME. Don't enroll,0
"Dr. Strait is a good professor. The class itself bored me to death, but it's an easy A. He is really passionate about what he does and is really understanding if something comes up and you need more time for the tests & quizzes. All of them are online, and he drops 3 of the 6 quizzes and 1 of the 3 tests, which makes it nearly impossible to fail.",1
"You need VERY strong Java programming skills for this class. Don't take this class, if you feel you lack Java programming skills. This class is easy up until you hit MVC models of design. There are no study guides for the midterm, or final. Couple this with the way he teaches, & class is really hard. Book doesn't help, lectures barely help. I pass",1
"Very good teacher. never thought I would enjoy her classes as much as I have! Make sure you show up to class on time, every time, put in effort and you will be rewarded for your time spent. I would take another of her classes",1
If you do all the discussion posts and actually try you will do just fine in this class literally. Lisa is great and makes everything really clear with grades and deadlines. She keeps up with grading and posting new assignments.,1
"Russell certainly cares about her students, but doesn't know much and lets her political bias seep into her classes. She called all Republicans ""Confederates,"" for instance, and when asked question about Shinzo Abe admitted she had never heard of him. She often got distracted in lectures, showing more Game of Thrones videos than actual material.",0
Missing grades until the day final grades were due. Unclear grading scales. Required an expensive McGraw Connect when she did not use the software. Unclear deadlines. Stacked assignments. Dropped a student without notice. Doesn't answer emails in any resemblance of a timely matter. Her class was a full time job.,0
"He is a good professor, He just has to organize better the examples before going to the blackboard.",1
He was not a good professor. He assigns things last minute and does not give a lot of time to complete assignments. He does not explain things well and expects all of his students to already know how to do everything. He moves very fast and never answers questions. He is very unorganized and does not seem to care.,0
"Professor Trombley lays her class out clearly. She consistently took the content from that week and related it to real life through discussion topics (which have several options to choose from). The weekly quizzes are easy IF you do the readings, practice tests, and read modules. This class is relatively low stress & I learned a lot.",1
"Melvin Hall makes you read TONS of redundant material;  over 200 boring pages a week!  His tests have obscure questions that are hard to  answer.  The reading makes you fall asleep while slogging through it.  Avoid this teacher and EPS 550, Marisa Crowley (she uses his tons of reading  material ).  This class is NOT about learning.",0
For humanities she never ever lectured. The whole class was reading and then taking notes to present in a group discussion. We also watched documentaries that she herself had never even seen. When grading she was kind of unfair about it. I had an A in the class the whole time then with the last essay on the final she screwed me over with a B.,0
NOPE. Don't do it.,0
"You will have to buy 9 books for this class, and she might add more if she feels like it. Very unclear about most things she says. Syllabus has been rewritten 3 times and NONE of them have any grading criteria on it. Some papers are 7-8pgs for an INTRO class. SHE DOES NOT USE CANVAS. You won't know ur grade and she probably doesn't know it either",0
"Jen is my favorite teacher in FC! She truly cares about her students and strives for the most for us! For this class just buy the online version of the book, DID NOT NEED physical book AT ALL! She gives you everything organized and straight forward, if you have any questions she is MORE than willing to help. She makes going to class fun! TAKE HER!!",1
Nice guy but didn't understand a thing in his class,0
"Would HIGHLY advice that you take someone else. lectures were long, boring, repetitive,  and did not show some techniques to work on our writing. the grading on papers where heavily graded. he did let you rewrite the papers but it was only for ten ten extra points. if you need more English classes  for your major would suggest you go look elsewhere",0
"He is extremely rude, and does not show any intent of having the students best interests. He does not answer questions in any helpful manor. He even snapped at students during the semester, raised his voice multiple times, and is generally an unwelcoming professor. He was the only one available so I had no choice unfortunately.",0
Awful. Just plain awful. She actually believes learning Genetics just comes from learning by reading outdated papers about cystic fibrosis. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Hands down worst professor I ever had, talks down when people speak up in class ""The class room is a place to learn, not a place to ask questions"". Very unclear as to what is being taught during class, 1/2 of the content she lectures is about china and nothing to do with the course outline. Highly recommend to NOT take a course she lectures.",0
"I took this class online and it was a breeze. There are clear deadlines on everything and most of the material is easy to understand. You get one notecard for the midterm and two for the final, and the reviews are basically the test.",1
LOVED this class! I was worried about taking this class because I struggle with math. Mr West makes it very easy to understand how Logic works. You must attend every class though or it will be challenging to pass. We hardly even looked at text book. Learned everything from classroom exercises and discussions. ,1
"Professor Hahn is the best person to take Math 202 with! She's known for her hard tests, but her classes always understand the material the best out of all the sections. She offers extra office hours outside class just so we can come and ask questions, and she explains concepts many ways to help us understand it better. The textbook is horrible.",1
"DRAGS DRAGS DRAGS the class! If you have people in your class that come to class to just listen or to sit there and be present, you'll get no where. She'll wait for them to participate and look away from those who constantly raise their hand. Sgro will wait on to the very last minute of class to dismiss. ",0
"I took class with him .... the you really need to be regular in math classes especially with Martin.. His quizes and exams are really easy but his teaching method is terrible cus he only understands for himself.. pay more attention when he teaches row reduction, span,bases, eigen value etc...",0
"This professor used class time for unneeded things. She was not helpful at all when students asked questions and graded unfairly. I would not recommend taking her, at all.",0
"This prof did not use blackboard at all, which made it so hard to gauge how you were doing in the class.  McCord is a really good lecturer, I was never bored listening to him, but his assignments change dates a lot (and without electronic communication this makes things confusing) and his rubrics are unclear, making assignments tough.",0
Don't take his online class. He takes forever to put in grades. The only grades you have are journals and exams which are both worth 5o points each. He grades really hard and he gives no feedback about how you can do better the next time.,0
"His classes are interesting & he's very helpful & clear about the law, BUT what he wants on his exams is NOT clear b/c everyone practically failed his class or found themselves on AP. He needs to be more clear about how he wants his exams.",1
"I'm lucky if I'll even pass with a C+ as I have yet to complete the last few assignments and final exam. He has a very clear grading criterion, but it's extremely nitty-gritty, almost petty, with even the smallest of assignments. His feedback in the comments of discussion posts and other assignments is more often than not in a condescending tone.",0
Took Cell Bio as a nursing pre-requisite. It's been a while since I've been in school so I was surprised by the amount of studying required outside of class. Alison is intelligent and cares about teaching. She wants you to succeed and expects just as much from her students as she is will to give in return. STUDY STUDY STUDY! And don't miss class!,1
"No major issues, easy to understand, would recommend.",1
"Gives you access to his Power Point  presentations for his lectures. During each lecture, he will tell you what study focus on for the tests.",1
Only needed the mymathlab code. Don't buy the book!!,1
Literally the worst teacher I have ever had. Only grades exams. Doesn't speak the best English and you'll need a translator to understand him. I would not recommend him to anyone.,0
Mr. Battaglia is the best professor at SUNY Fredonia. He will teach you to be a professional bowler in no time.,1
Dont take him.Very boring and waste of time and money.. Will not learn anything..Dont please DO A FAVOR ON URSELF...............,0
Amazing!! take her if you have the chance you will not regret it. Took her 3 times have received an A every time.,1
"There were weekly readings/homework assignments, 1 MC midterm, 1 8-10 page paper, and 1 essay question for the final. This course requires lots of reading. All his exams/essays required pulling quotes from the readings. Lecture was a waste of time. Do the readings, go to your TA for the essay questions, and you'll be set for an A.",0
"Worst professor yet. Hw and exam is a 400 word personal essay (informal). He reads everything directly out of the book with not explanation. He rambling a lot and gives unclear on essay assignment. He incapable of help you improve ur writing skill. he will noted when you received help even if you went to a tutor, he'll tell you not to do that again",0
SHE RESPONDS QUICKLY TO MESSAGES BUT TOUGH GRADER AND DISSCUSION BOARDS ARE LONG AND REPETATIVE .,1
"When you ask him a ""?""  you have to elaborate on it. He doesn't give a direct answer most of the time, so be prepared to research the ""?"" yourself. He spends the majority of the time lecturing on the topic's background rather than going straight to whats necessary for the exams. His exams are much more confusing than the hw (lots of trick ""?"").",0
Do NOT take this Professor!!! He is passionless and does NOT teach well. You will sit for literally 2 hours in a ZOOM class and listen to the MOST boring lectures... on top of that he does NOT follow logic and is a VERY tough grader... he approaches religious teaching in a bizarre scientific or philosophical way and not how it actually is...,0
"I ended up having to drop this class. During the lectures he would continually get off topic and when I would ask a question, it wouldn't get answered properly. He would assign us 200-400 problems a week of online homework, which I was never able to complete, even after spending five days a week in the learning lab. I would not recommend taking him",0
"She's not very clear, sometimes she runs off tangent many times and forgets what she's talking about.",0
"Hard to follow.  Really nice person, but jumps around a lot.  Not great at explaining things.",0
"There isnt much hw, you get 1 or 2 double sided cheat sheets for the test you can put whatever you want on it, gives extra credit for attendance. He is so nice and gives lots of examples in class to help you understand. he also has no class the class before a test to go to him for extra help.",1
"Miller can be hard to please because he expects you to be real and talented in a way you might never have known existed before, but he is a professor who makes you feel you are in college and not high school, which is what this school feels like in most classes besides those of Miller.",1
"I have taken her class for both pre-modern and post-modern Japanese history. Though her lectures can tend to be disorganized she is truly passionate about Japanese history and culture, and offers fascinating perspectives. There is a lot of reading, yet it is fascinating material. Would recommend to anyone truly passionate about Japan studies.",1
Not only in college but my entire life hes the worst teacher Ive ever had by far. He sets the class up like a videogame so no one knew what was going on most of the semester. You have to teach yourself through videos. He requires you to get an 80% or better to pass a test or its a 0 and you retake it. If you don't play his games you get nowhere.,0
"Very easy professor. Almost too easy. Very plain powerpoint lectures, followed by videos. Short online homework assignments. Some miscellaneous projects thrown in. This class kind of scrapes the surface of different personal finance activities. Very low-stress class.",1
"If I'd known of this site before registering & reviews, wouldn't have taken his class & have the regret. Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles & he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach.",0
She wouldn't cut me some slack and bump my D+ to a C- just so I could pass during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall she's a good professor but I just wish she was a little more understanding.,0
"Dr. Maillart is an unfriendly person, treating teaching as a chore. The class was set up asynchronous, with a zoom lecture once a week. The zoom lecture became useless quickly, but the incentive was tophat extra credit for going. After the second exam the department changed the policy so that a D- is needed to move onto 1071...",0
thinks hes the smartest person in the world and perhaps he is. he just isnt that great of a teacher and doesnt seem so interested in students opinions. grading very arbitrary,0
Mr prey does not give feedback. He is not availble to answer questions concerning assignments.,0
"Terrible course structure, so disorganized, still shaping the course so prepare for challenges. Nice guy but poor lecturer, EXTREMELY UNCLEAR, treats students like we're writing our PhD thesis, tons of work for small 2-5% grades, 5 blog posts/3 papers/2 presentations/2 reports, the list goes on.... lectures are a waste of time'",0
"Dr. Raja's class isn't that hard, but be prepared to be talked down to a lot...I just kept my head down and surfed the back row.  Not a lot of busy work outside of class at least.  You can pull off a B in her class relatively easily if you just study a bit and show up, but I found her sense of humor and attitude toward students really irritating.",0
Best professor ever,1
I loved her!! best math teacher i ever had!,1
Take this prof,1
"Professor is very knowledgeable about the history of Mexico and his lectures are engaging and informative. Class films were very interesting and easy to write about. He is such a great professor, easy/fair grader and overall such a sweetheart that cares about all students.",1
"Read the text on your own easier to understand. Nice person, boring teacher. Could have been a great subject if it was more interesting and engaging. Assignments not clearly explained, expectations and course content could be explained better. Lost interest in subject.",0
"Oh Sheryl, where do I begin? If you've had her, you're ready for what this class entails. However, if you haven't, get ready to be open to criticism. Papers turned into her will come back with tons of ink marks and suggestions. However, her suggestions often reflect old AP style teachings. She changes her mind and criteria a lot as well so listen.",0
HARD!! Dont do it. So hard. Thats honestly all. Hard.,0
"I've taken 3 classes with DeNunzio - he's a great prof and is excited to teach. All his classes have a pretty similar structure, he grades fairly, and presents straightforward exams.",1
"Ignore the rating beforehand. Deadlines are all on math lab, why would you ""expect"" extended deadlines? She provides you with power points, my mathlab, and is literally always there to help. Open notes on everything, in exchange for hw you can legit complete in class. I got an A and it was the best class I've ever taken, she cares.",1
Hard but interesting,1
He's one of the best teacher i ever had. i wish he teach other subjects. Also he's very cute. Any one thinking on taken him should!!!,1
"I don't know why anyone would dislike Prof. Earp's class. If you got a bad score, it's because you didn't do the work. He's great and his class is easy. Just do the work, pay attention, and behave yourself.",1
Terrible teacher. She puts you down.,0
I was warned not to take Smith but I decided to do it anyway and it was a mistake! His lectures are so long and dry and makes the material more confusing. The final is 70% of your grade and sometimes it's unclear what type of answers he's looking for. Avoid and take this class with a different prof if you can !,0
"This instructor was the best one ever in my life. Instead of the title as an instructor, the educator would be more suitable for her as she really hopes for the students success and makes ongoing efforts to prepare her class with many fun activities. Her communication skills are phenomenal.",1
"When they said the best, i almost laughed. She was, at first, the nicest person ever. I started off stong, and she made me believed that i was doing excellent even at the end. Then when i received a NP i was shocked nun the least. The books were interesting and easy to follow. As a person, she is awesome... as a teacher,Never Again!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Dr. Fujita speaks in such an awkward tone that it it difficult to understand.  I learned everything in my workshop in which the leader did not have anything good to say about her either.  She makes multiple mistakes on her tests. I have had three and there have been at least 2 MAJOR mistakes on each,0
Schubert's Math 5A class was difficult. He expects you to know everything that he's teaching already. He works on problems on the board and basically solves it & talks to himself and asks the class if what he was doing was right and that's basically the whole lecture. He doesn't teach you how to solve the problem or say why he's solving it that way,0
DO NOT PLAGIARIZE. Careful how you reply to the discussions. I would not take any of his classes.,0
She doesnt give you too many explanations.I had so hard time and she likes to keep you very busy.,0
"I took characteristics online. TOUGH. There's a lot due every week including a quiz. YOU HAVE TO READ THE TEXTBOOK TO PASS THE QUIZZES. The quiz questions aren't easy. I wouldn't say it's a super hard class, but it's not an easy A like a lot of Kent's online classes.",1
"Every project we done , no matter how well you did it , you never get an A grade from her class . She wouldn't give you the grade higher than B+. Be sure you drop all the notes and listen all what she said , she always ask some tricky questions on the exam.",0
One of the best professor's I've had so far in college. He's a hoot and will keep you paying attention during lectures even if they are over an hour long.,1
Those who say he just wants to challenge you need to realize theyre paying thousands to willfully get their lives ruined by this sad excuse for a teacher while learning nothing in the process. You might as well print out his projects in your free time if you want to feel challenged because youll get the same amount of teaching and guidance,0
The class is sorta boring and you really need to pay attention to grasp whats going on. Tests are almost identical to practice but the final was pretty tough.,0
"Taking Prof Walker's Physical Science class is rough.. She gets side tracked, or teaches us material that won't be on our quizzes. Her lessons and the study/homework material don't match up. Before our exit exam she crammed Geologic Time into one lesson, and the rest we had to ""master on our own over the weekend"". I don't pay to teach myself.",0
Great Teacher! She is always willing to help. Her method of teaching is perfect. I had her for intermediate and college algebra and wish she was teaching trig.,1
"I don't think it matters how hard you study- in taking her tests I used information from her slides, the textbook, and information from other class textbooks and still received below a B on all exams. She doesn't tell you what you did wrong, just takes marks off. She can't use technology and trails off in the middle of her sentences.",0
"I took him for Discrete Math. His emphasis was on proofs during lecture, which works since this is a very proof-based class. However, on exams, he does want you to show a deeper level of understanding rather than simply regurgitating the answer; for those not used to it, the grading seems harsh. However, he is very accessible during office hours.",1
"She is a great person & tries her hardest, but she doesn't seem to know what she is talking about. She gives handouts & study guides but doesn't really teach/explain them well (test come from these). If you like to teach yourself she is the teacher for you. Her tests are fairly simple if you take her handouts & learn that information out the book.",0
"She told us in her exact words to suck it up and buy Microsoft Word, even though many students (including me) dont have the money. She literally laughs at us struggling and makes everything extra challenging so we fail and learn. Terrible strategy. I will be avoiding her for the rest of my time at HSU if possible. Hardest class Ive ever taken",0
"Lots of essays and essay quizzes. Instructor did not provide clear instructions on essay topics & her critiques were vague. The books that were required for reading were very 1 sided & I felt that the she was trying to push her beliefs onto us. We read a book about feminism, immigration, & police brutality. For an entry level class it was hard.",0
Knows his stuff...could use some ESL classes but other than that...Hi5 as a prof. and individual,1
"She's very nice, and extremely helpful. Just do your work, show up to class, and talk to her about your paper, and you'll do well.",1
"Worst class I've ever taken. She was not a good teacher, and had a horrible TA who she let control almost all of our grade. When we complained that the TA was giving us horrible grades with no explination she just said ""you will have to take that up with him."" Horrible teacher, horrible class. I'm a straight A student and withdrew. WAST OF TIME.",0
"Reisinger is simply an incredible teacher. There's a decent amount of work in the class but it's not difficult. She's a really fair grader and is extremely helpful if you have any questions - she wants you to do well in the class, which is important. This class made me want to continue with French.",1
Handed out way too many unrelatable assignments,0
I took Dr. Makover's Calc I class a long time ago. Years have passed and I still see reviews that mirror the horror of my Calculus class. Avoid him at all costs. I dropped his class and retook it with another professor... took that professor for most of my other math courses.. Got A's in all of them.,0
"Great professor. Lectures are easily understandable. Just expect to do lots of work. He worked at WD at the same time which was impressive, and has recently moved on towards Google. Good luck fam",1
"Clear instructions, simple weekly discussion posts, easy assignments, and three online exams. There is a lot of material given as a resource and the book is definitely handy (most of the discussions/assignments come from the book). Overall, clearcut online course that gets you an easy A. She is also helpful with email questions and grades fair.",1
"Love love love this class, makes me think about who I want to be as an artist and Jeri is just so great at helping you achieve that goal! Can't wait to have her for future classes. Love her! ",1
"Be prepared to teach yourself the majority of the material. The tests are ridiculous and you are put on a very tight time schedule. The class does not relate to the real world. In my experience, your boss will not tell you to complete 3-4 complicated math problems within 1 hour. Unfortunately, this is a mandatory class to take.",0
"Everyone told me this class would be hard before I took it, but I liked this class. Its not an easy A, but if you do your work and do better then the majority of the class then you can get a B or an A. My biggest advice is to study daily. Otherwise he is very helpful when you need him.",1
"Ben gives a lot of complex reading but pares it down to the essential (and tested on) concepts in class. The lectures are alright, usually interesting, but can be dry. If you come to class, take notes, and do the review guides (make friends & split work), the exams are very easy. Otherwise, good luck trying to understand the readings on your own.",1
"Worst teacher I've had (out of 90+ credit hours). Terrible at explaining things. Jumps around during his lectures. Very unorganized. He claims that you have to understand and learn the material, but really you're just memorizing reactions the whole time. He doesn't give many examples and misleads you about what will be on the test. Read the book.",0
"This is a University Professor, If you want to do it you do it yourself. No kindergarten time. If you are a grown up adult you will love and enjoy the class a lot.",1
"Sharma is an excellent professor who effectively describes very abstract concepts in simplified, concise terms. His tests are NOT hard - just do the HW/take notes in class. He is easy to talk to and will always try to help you succeed. Very responsive via email. No idea why he has a low rating here on RMP but it is unwarranted. Take his class!",1
She skims over explaining how to actually do things and just expects you to understand. Assigns lots of online homework in bulk but you have a week usually to do the 15-40 problems. Test vary in difficulty and the final is under 30 questions but adds up to 200 points and 20% of your grade and she takes points away for every little mistake...,0
"Excellent professor. His lectures are interesting. He likes to get the class involved with those who voluntarily answer questions. Very professional. His study guides are how study guides should be! If you study them well, you will do good. I found the textbook to be very clear and understandable. I would definitely take this professor again. ",1
"prof. Hartman is one of the best professor I've ever met. He's really inspirational, gives a great feedback and always help you. Take a class with him: you will learn a lot, especially on how to think.",1
"He is really nice but there are just so many readings with quizzes (one every week) and the lectures are so long. Don't even get me started on the assignments, they are just too complicated, more complicated than they should be. The first one is ok, the ones after that get harder. The group project is really confusing, so look out for that.",0
"This rating is for Dr. Luisa Ferreira, her first name is spelled incorrectly, but anyway, you must take her! She is the best! Super nice woman and gives amazing feedback. If it wasnt for her, I would have struggled, and I was never good at writing. She helped build my confidence, and for that Im so grateful. Take her and you wont regret it!",1
"He does have an accent, but it's not that hard to understand him. Almost your entire grade is made up of tests and quizzes, but that's the way the course is set up. He grades tests fairly and gives partial credits. He posts practice problems and Powerpoints to Blackboard. He does example problems in class sometimes. I wish he also taught Chem 132.",1
"I have taken Berger-Hill for two classes in one semester and I would take her a thousand times again. Because this is a online course, expect work due every week but her class is very easy, if you received a bad grade, you just didn't care. She give feedback very well and responds quick. TAKE HER! she's amazing!",1
He is the toughest grader I have ever taken. He gives a lot of homework and is really tough on the specific details required in your answer. He is the hardest teacher I have taken. There is a lot of drawings and answering questions.,0
"great teacher, keeps it interesting, VERY nice and helpful, will work with you if you need help, would take any of his class!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Professor McCullough is a great teacher and she really does a wonderful job of making sure you understand and are prepared for the exams. Just a daily quick hw, makes the lectures really short which is great. I'd recommend her to anyone, and I'd retake her in a heart beat. Real gem of a teacher, take her you will do great!",1
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"jUST when you think you have gotten a grip of the class structure She changes the syllabus and expects you to know whats coming next without informing you. WORST Prof EVER. She's not even a prof. She rushes through the material, assigns never ending readings & homework's, gives pop up quizzes, 3 presentations, in class debate, online hw, finals :((",0
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
"The only person who could make corporate accounting relatively interested.  He really cares about his students, and I loved taking his class.",1
"WORST TEACHER EVERY!! He is horrible. He talks down to students, makes fun of them if they ask questions that he thinks are dumb and only cares about himself. He is unorganized and does not help you one bit. I can't believe SVSU employees someone like him. He is horrible and should be fired! Disappointed in SVSU for keeping someone like that.",0
"Interesting class and knowledgable professor. Dr. Browning was good with communication and showed flexibility for my special situation when requested in advance of deadlines. Classwork includes weekly forums, weekly quizzes, and 2 case studies. Quizzes are straight-forward but I felt the case studies could have used some more clarification.",1
"Brace seems nice at first look, but she's not as cute as she appears. Her lectures are VERY boring, and she never comes to class prepared. She wings half the things she says most of the time. Grading wise, it's confusing. One paper she could be an easy marker, the next it seems like she didn't even read it.",0
"she is such an angel. trust me you'll do good in her class, she really wants the best for everyone. shes super approachable and i wish i could give her a thank you hug",1
Terrible. Heavy accent. Unorganized. ,0
"Very Very Very, I mean EXTREMELY picky. Nitpicks through anything and everything. The feedback given is good but very petty. She does not know how to use Word to format anything properly but gets mad when you reformat her poorly formatted outline templates.",0
"He was not clear on what he wanted done, therefore the majority of the class including myself kept getting bad grades. Then when you would try to get a hold of him he would not respond in a timely manner nor answer our phone calls. Do not take this class with this professor unless you want to fail.",0
Did not learn anything throughout the whole semester.,0
Prof. Mangone truly cares about his students. His test are fair and has a good way of conveying the info. Genetics is just a TOUGH subject. 80% of entire grade comes from test which is terrifying if this is not your ideal subject. 5 test each 20% and the lowest one gets dropped,1
"He is VERY unclear on how to access files to upload to complete assignments. It is now over a month into class and only 1 grade has been added to the grade book. He does not respond to emails in a timely manner. You can hardly tell if the assignment you submitted was received online. He utilizes over 3 different websites to view, complete, assign.",0
"Definite GPA booster for me, can get 100% on online labs (MC Q's) if you compare answers with ppl. 3% survey bonus marks. Lots of recommended readings, but I barely did any of it (~5-6 pages altogether) and got 95%. Focus on online notes, learning obj, and video questions. Use textbook for reference, or when smthing is explicitly mentioned to know.",1
She does not give feedback on what is missed on homework or tests to be able to study as well as doesn't even release grades unless begged for by students. Extremely unorganized for class and in general. If you have a question don't bother emailing her as she doesn't respond for days at a time. In short don't waste your time w/ her for any class.,0
Take a class from her at your own risk.  She is very confusing and hard to learn from.  You will be learning everything on your own.  She is unwilling to help students.  Also her test are written in a very confusing style.  I would say try and find another instructor if you can.,0
"This class is sorta funky because it's centered around your midterm and final with a presentation additionally. Form a study group, and do the readings. Finding online summaries and analyses helps because it makes the readings easier to understand and that helps you with the in-class discussion. Be prepared to talk. But Osborne's understanding",1
Great Professor!!!,1
"Took this class online as a deceivingly easy Gen Ed and that was not the case. He didn't include any of his own teachings - we were entirely dependent on the book and the powerpoints, which came from the book company. For anyone who isn't ecstatic about economics and wants a helpful teacher, this is not the guy for you.",0
one of the worst teachers at cape fear. hard to understand and is basically a self taught class. cannot teach a lick. unclear of assignments and embarrasses you if you ask a question,0
"She's Amazing. THE Greatest professor I've ever had.  Like everyone else said, her priority is for you to understand/care about the material taught which is exactly why we're taking this class.  It's like she's preparing us to become model citizens of the world.",1
"Br. Daniel must be protected at all costs. He's very easy to listen to during lectures, is endearing, and explains things well. It's a pretty easy class as well. 10/10 would recommend for CMP.",1
"not the best teacher in the world. its a good class but the teacher has her own expectations. my previous teachers have made english pretty interesting which motivated me to actually read, she made the class very bland. if you don't like english much, this is not the class for you",0
"Unrealistic expectations for intermediate German. Does not teach, just assigns an obscene amount of weekly homework that does not help on tests (or learning for that matter). Class focuses on diagramming sentences instead of learning to speak and read German. She is out to get everyone. Hated it. Withdrew. Choose a different language.",0
"reads straight from textbook for lectures, very monotonous",0
Walling is THE absolute worst professor Ive ever had. She Has a bad attitude and is forever in a bad mood. She likes to make smart remarks if asked a question and she is constantly giving attitude or rolling her eyes if you say anything to her at all. BC should really get another professor to teach A&P because nobody should have to deal with her.,0
"Reading isn't necessary, so you really don't have to put much work into this class for the first half of the semester. However, after that, you have two big research assignments. Requirements are excessive for an elective course and while she is clear about her expectations, they are very high and she will take off points. Follow rubrics closely",0
She grades like it is a 400 level course and she never answers her email so don't bother trying to ask her for help through an email. Avoid getting her at all costs,0
"Needs to get a grip, he can deride his students when they don't understand a subject immediately. Goes off on irrelevant tangents, wasting our time. Needs to use better short forms for words he writes on the board.",0
"Textbook was mad expensive, homework assignments were a time suck but not difficult in the least. The amount of studying for the exam does not correlate at all with your grade. Final exam is killer, which requires way too much memorization. This class is no longer an Easy A, do not take it if you have heard that it was.",0
"Everything taught in the class is common sense. The virtual section was a joke. There's always going to be someone who doesn't participate and someone who does all the work, yet everyone receives the same grade. The lecture instructor also likes to make fun of minorities. Not a lot of chance to get points as tests are only about 40 Qs worth 120% ea",0
He is absolutely horrible. I have learned nothing from this professor. He sits in class every day and just reads off the power points and plays YouTube videos of people teaching the concepts. The only reason I go to class is to sign the attendance sheet. He does all of the online quizzes in class. That's the only good thing about him.,0
"Really caring professor, lectures can be dull but if you take notes you'll definitely be fine for the exams. Textbook is very easy to read and great for reviewing for exams. There is a decent amount of homework, but they are spaced out every 2 weeks so if you start early you'll be fine.",1
Easy A! recommend this online class for anyone looking to fulfill a GE. He's a lenient grader and no book is required.,1
"A very entertaining, engaging professor who made you want to come to class just to watch her dance around and go on short, hilarious rants. There wasn't a lot of verbal practice in the course but I think there might not have been enough time for this given how much material we had to cover. Overall a fun, fair course with only one short paper.",1
"Professor Fischer is a good professor. This is my second time having him as a professor. I had him for PHIL001 and the format was exactly the same apart from not having quizzes. Two midterms (20pts each), Attendance (20pts) and Final (40 pts). Exams are short answer questions. As long as you do the readings and take notes, it should be easy B.",1
"Great Professor, very passionate about economics. I took his blended class and it was great. If you've never taken any type of econ class before, you need to study. He explains everything well and simplifies it. His tests are a good mix of definitions and applying the material to graphs and situations. I would take him again for sure.",1
"Prof. handled the virus really well. Two short papers (2 pg reflection paper and 3 pg essay), open book online quizzes with the questions ahead of time. Zoom classes were fun. One easy group project. She was always available for us. Wish I took both history classes with her! My other professor made us write essays every week and didn't teach us.",1
"Mr. Koehler is a very respectful teacher. I took this class online and it was a breeze. I recommend taking it online, overall do take this professor. You will not regret taking him.",1
Lectures can be hard to follow. Really nice and will always help you.,0
"Best Chem professors Ive had here at WPU! Dr Xing expects a lot from her students. Lecture is fast and she gives lots hw, but it's there to help you, so DO IT! Exams are tough if you dont know material so be prepared to study & practice. Unlike most professor and you'll actually learn from her! If you need Organic TAKE HER for 1&2, you'll thank me!",1
"You will learn more about colonization from reading Bartolome de las Casas' ""Brief Account of the Devastation of the Indies,"" than you will from this entire class. He spends about 90% of the time justifying the European colonizers and how it wasn't that bad. Only refers to native/aboriginal/indigenous people as ""Indians."" Calls slaves ""workers.""",0
"Previous commentor missed out. While Prof. Murphy's  lectures may have been easy to skip, they were also very interesting. Fun class and learned a lot.",1
"I really wanted to enjoy this class because of the subject, but Professor Sewell makes it hard to. I've taken more academically rigorous classes, yet this professor has the harshest standards of grading I've witnessed so far. She does give instructions, but even when you try to adhere to her standards, it's not good enough. Regret signing up.",0
"Wendy was a clear cut, direct prof who engaged students for examples and emphasized important concepts in the class. Was scared for this class but it went well if you put in the effort to read the textbook, do practice questions and go to the lab.",1
Powerpoint slides are crap.  He messes up a lot and doesnt help you at all.  Tests are deathly hard.,0
Super easy A+ as long as you study the main points she posted before tests,1
"Professor Peterson is an amazing professor. She truly cares about your writing development. Don't get me wrong she is a tough grader, but it's only to help you write better. I mean that is her job. She is extremely honest and helpful. Don't take her class if you're lazy and not willing to put in the effort. Go to her office hours to get help!!!",1
Super nice professor and such an easy class. Shes a very easy grader so its not hard for you not to earn an A. And I love that she always gives great feedback after every essay!,1
"Honestly, I really expected more from this Professor given that he has really good reviews but Im really disappointed. His lectures were clear for the most part but the hw/tests werent always representative to the lectures. He throws curve balls. He doesnt really reply to emails either. This class was not really enjoyable whatsoever:(",0
"She is horrible. I would not take this professor even if it means waiting a quarter or two for the right professor. She is rude, unhelpful, answers students in a pretentious manner, and seems like she could care less for the students. I genuinely do not like her. ",0
"Programming assignments are hard. Tests are harder. Boring and unclear during lecture. Online notes are also very unclear. If you want to pass, you'll have to teach yourself the material",0
Lisa is amazing. She's a great life coach. She legitimately wants students to learn and be successful.,1
Daigle's microeconomics class was very difficult for me. He's not a good lecturer. He mumbles a lot and doesn't want to explain things to you when you ask him about them. He is quite sexist also. His tests are very hard and even with a curve applied. I got a's and b's in every class but his.,0
awful.,0
"Nice person, not a good teacher. Forgetful, unorganized & hard to follow. Textbook is useless. Study guides are just a bunch of vocab words. I dont even have enough space to tell everything thats wrong. Just avoid if you can. This should be an EASY A but i settled for a B+ with WAYYY more effort than need be for a friggin history class.",0
Erickson might be the best bio professor I've had. His lectures make a lot of sense and I actually feel like I understand the core concepts of molecular biology now. The material is hard but the final is easy and you should easily do well if you study. Make sure you take advantage of his lectures and actually learn the stuff. Great professor!,1
"Dr Rumenik is a great lady and very understanding but I struggled taking her class and was frustrated a lot as she rambles a lot, is unclear in what she wants, and NONE of her review sheets ever really match up to your test. Be prepared to actually read the textbook as you will be doing a lot of teaching yourself.",1
"She's great, I just have a hard time grasping languages. I took Spanish fo 7 years and still suck at it, that's why I decided to give Italian a try. She's a great, enthusiastic, young professor. I'd recommend her to anyone.",1
Takes weeks to go over one chapter then when its time from an exam he crams things and tells your read the textbook. dont take his class,0
"If you know how to write a paper then you will do very well in this course because its not college level material. A month into the course we learned what a topic sentence and what a thesis statement were for a whole week. She also says ""pacific"" instead of ""specific"" which makes me not take her opinion on how to use the English language seriously.",0
"It's unfortunate that Paul is the instructor for two required courses for the minor. The amount of work he gives is ridiculously unreflective of how much is actually required to make the course effective. 2 midterms, 9 graded responses, 3 essays, 1 term paper, 1 cumulative final exam. That's like 2 courses in one. Please learn how to balance Paul. ",1
"Dr. Mike is the best! Everything was clear, his exam reviews are very comprehensive, and he's actually pretty funny. The class is five days a week instead of four but so worth the exam review days. Dr. Mike spends tons of hours in the help room during exam week and is willing to move around office hours to help. Highly recommend him for physics!",1
"If you are a woman and you are seriously considering being in the Criminal Justice field, I strongly recommend you take this class with this professor not only will she make an impact on you but she will also open your eyes to a lot that goes on. She is a great professor and makes learning a touchy subject fun and interesting",1
"Fully Online Pros: You go at your own pace & don't need to attend recitation. Cons: You go at your own pace (you need to have good time management & be strict with yourself). Advice: Don't freak out, just get things done ASAP. Do all your HW & go to tutoring center at least 1x per chapter. Get tutored 2x before each test. Don't need to read hw.",0
teaching is pretty fair. It is anatomy so be ready to study and repeat. A lot to memorize so don't get frustrated on her or the class. Put in a lot of time and energy to study it will surely pay off. She will help you if you have questions. She is friendly and approachable. Extra credit definitely helps. Go over lab models few days before lab.,1
"I love Ronda! She is a great teacher and she really pushes you (in a good way) so that you keep up. If you do the homework you will get a good grade, but you will have to do the work. She obviously loves her work and really wants you to succeed. She aspires to make the material understandable and interesting.",1
I took this class online and she was there if you needed her. Just make sure that you stay on top of all assignments or you will get behind very quickly. She doesn't always grade things within 48 hours like she says she will. It is a self paced class with three folders of work to complete by the end of the semester. She gives clear direction.,1
"Very knowledgeable on what she teaches, but pretty poor at delivering it. Most lectures lacked anything engaging for students and leaved little room for effective note taking outside of jumbled analysis. On top of that, she and the TA are pretty harsh markers that don't like seeing anything but regurgitated, null information from lectures.",0
In my opinion Jon is truly a great teacher and a good communicator.  My biggest criticism of Jon would be that he needs to keep his political view point to himself.  I don't believe it is right to use his position of authority to push his political point class after class.  ,1
"For the 1st time I feel like I am in real College.No cheat-sheets and or games here. If my previous classes were like this, perhaps I would do better rt now. I realize how little I have learned before and that's scary. So I will retake all my math classes in fall, and wish they were with him or alike. Well, him really, He's adorably cute and sweet.",1
"Shes caring and all but if you're not good at math don't take her class. She teaches differently and is more advanced she told me to basically withdraw from the course since I wasn't understanding her way of teaching. She expects you to already know everything and move on to the next lesson after a week, also too much homework.",0
"This was a required class for my degree and I was so excited for it  and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Tricky tests, tough grader and very confusing lectures. A LOT of reading of articles so get ready for that. If not required, don't take it is all I can say. ",0
This instructor is very vague in her assignments and will turn around and tell you you didnt read the assignment if you didnt do it to her standards. Everyone in the class gets confused and while she seems like a nice person she is not a great teacher.,0
"This man made coming to W&L worth every penny. I wish I could have taken more than two classes with him. He is nice, reasonable, and wants students to come talk to him. Professors like him are the reason W&L is such a great place.",1
"Took online sociology marriage and families. Avoid this professor for online classes, his syllabus is in broken English, he is not responsive to messages, and he does not have anywhere regarding the assignments throughout the semester, just sends weekly messages of what is due. Maybe a good professor in person, but awwful for online material.",0
I would highly advise you NOT to take this class if you are doing online right now. This class is incredibly discouraging and took a lot of the enjoyment I usually have for writing out of me. It was exhausting how much work I would put into it just to get told it wasnt good enough.,0
Had him for multiple classes. Does not care about his students. Does not care about his course material. More focussed on his own career at the expense of others. He taught one class (Malware) completely from a power point without actually doing any labs like we are supposed to. His test questions are pulled directly textbooks. WASTE OF TIME/MONEY.,0
"I made a huge mistake taking Prf. Smith. She is nasty, sarcastic, doesn't give good feedback on papers, and is very unorganized. I should've stuck with my professor from last semester. Prf. Smith runs her class in an ""my way or no way"" kind of fashion. Do not take her, ever.",0
"This class is tough.  Homework is no cakewalk either.  SHOW ALL WORK ON TESTS, I didn't and paid the price.  Seems like many students did very poor on the first exam, below 50%.  You just got to work hard and ignor him if he is talking down to you.",0
"Lectures are terrible, and to make them worse, she quiz at the beginning or end of the lecture. Not organized and I felt genuinely did not care about teaching.",0
"Very hard class!! Unorganized. Erin looks nice ,but not willing to help. I dont recommend her  if English is not your first language,she lectures too fast. Her tests are tricky and hard. Shouldn't teach Bio160.",0
"I am a MVCC alumni & wanted to learn about IT. I have emailed her several times & she does not respond for over 24 hrs. I had a question about the final project, emailed her at 12:30 the day it was due & never heard back. Her responses are very short and rude. I do have to give her a little credit, she did zoom & acted like I was wasting her time.",0
"Wouldn't recommend taking this professor. If you do, use your own note taking system...his is very unclear and repetitive.  Also, he is very condescending...he treats you like junior high students. I've never written a review for a professor before, but this guy made me feel like I had to.  I enjoy history, but I do NOT enjoy his class.",0
Dr. Guerrio is such a sweet Lady! Our class was combined so most days were online and some were in class. She provided real world examples and gave very clear lectures above what I was expected online and in person. Very easy and gives extra credit! Do the work and you'll do great!,1
Dr. D. is the best professor. I love all the courses she teaches. I only wish she could teach more.,1
"Clear definition of course objective,  Tests are OK",1
"Mr. Johnson is a wonderful Professor. He cares about his students success, is very flexible, and gives lots of feedback. He gives clear instructions and gives students enough time to complete assignments. I highly recommend his class.",1
Had a great transition to online. Great guy. I learned a lot.,1
Radhika is great. Her lectures move really fast so you will want to print out the slides and take notes on those instead of trying to keep up writing on a blank paper. You will want to come to class. What she tests on is clearly what is learned in class. You will know what to study in more depth (in the book) based on her slides.,1
"I'm really dumbfounded by some of these poor reviews, Miles is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. I would highly recommend taking one of his classes. He's a great professor and I always found his classes interesting and thought provoking.",1
"I really did not like this class, Dr. Barnes was disrespectful, always went off task, never specified details for assignments and was a tough grader. You won't learn anything in this class and she doesn't give any help when asked. Probably the worst teacher I've had in college so far.",0
"just stay at home, read the book, u will be fine",0
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
"Professor Ou Yang is great professor with in-depth knowledge in Accounting. The class projects will give you a clear understanding of how an analyst will do in real world. However, the final is a little bit challenging if you are not an Accounting major. Over all, he is a nice professor and you will be inspired by some of his thoughts and ideas. ",1
"This guy will challenge you in every way you can be academically challenged.  I worked harder in this one class than I did my entire sophomore year.Make sure you know your calculus,derivative and integrals.He expects that you remember EVERYTHING you have been taught.The homework is damn near impossible, and his exams probably took years off my life",0
"I took his class on How Surfing Colonized California and the World. It was so so interesting, I genuinely enjoyed this class and going to lectures, very cool prof! Every day we studied a new surf break geographically and its cultural nuances as well. I didn't know much about Hawaii and its rich history, this class is a great opportunity to do so!",1
Awesome prof,1
"Adam Gerritsen is hands down the best teacher at SUNY Cortland. If you ever have the chance to take a lab with him or just meet him in general, take the opportunity! He goes out of his way to help students learn material and fully understand EVERYTHING. He is always available for help whether its in office hours or an email. Highly recommend.",1
This class is horrible and should not be taken by anyone other than insanely intelligent Science students --not Arts/Social Science friendly!,0
"I took speech with her over 10 years ago. I'm back to warn those of you who are nervous about speaking in front of others. I suggest you find another professor. She never offered any kind support, in fact, she actually created more anxiety causing situations. It almost seemed, to me, as though she enjoys watching people suffer.",0
"It's the exact same course as GOV 2301. This guy has a really awful voice and likes to yell at his captive audience. You will be forced to hear about his neighbor's noisy pool pump, Ugg the Thug, and how stupid Sarah Palin/Charlie Sheen/Tea Party/anyone who disagrees with prof. is. Quizzes are easy, answers are online.",0
"He is the sweetest professor everrr!  the class is a joke, if you get As on the first two essays he won't even read the rest and will give you As for the rest. No tests, only 1 research paper (5pgs including outline, coversheet, and works cited) 1 book report that you will have to share to the class and 3 essays. Easy A would take again!",1
"I don't know why so many people have Dr. McCartney so highly rated. If you have her for Tsem drop it, hardest class I've taken ever. 5 mandatory novels to read and she assigns so much work that she can't get it graded and returned. Aweful class all around",0
"He does aplia so he doesnt have to work. So be prepared to do HW on holidays and breaks. Aplia made the class really stressful for me. When i asked him for extra help he did NOTHING. I really hated this class and Im so glad it's over with, however he's a nice guy.",0
"Lots of work to do for the class, but she's very intelligent and explains the content well.  Go to class, give yourself time to do the work, and it's not too difficult.  She also gives lots of opportunities to revise your work before final submissions.",1
Overall not a good class. Basically you have to teach your self as there is no class and everything is online. I would not recommend her online class.,0
"A dope professor and is really understanding. Gives good reviews that reflects the test perfectly. She gives out extra credit and extensions if you need it. 10/10, cant complain.",1
"Nate doesn't focus on lectures and expects you to read the chapters. If you do read them and complete the labs, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. He wants you to learn from doing and won't just give you answers, but he'll help guide you in the right direction and is nearby to handle issues that aren't clearly covered in the book.",1
"I've never had a professor more unwilling to help students than Tisha. In lab when we call her in for help, she refuses to help us find the correct answer and makes us feel dumb for not knowing the answer right away. When you struggle with a problem, it's better to search the internet than ask for her help. I wish she would listen to her students.",0
"She spends the entire class talking about herself and doesn't actually teach the material, yet when it comes time for the tests she expects you to know anything. Avoid this teacher at all costs!",0
"I took 1 a and 1b with him, he was one of my favorites. He was so kind and the work was fair for 10 and 1b. He works on a newspaper now.  Glad I had him for a professor for a year with my neighbor.",1
"Lectures are very boring so I wouldn't suggest taking this class early in the morning unless you HAVE to. He does in class activities, you either get a 100 or a 0 depending on your attendance that day. You can go to class, pay attention, and still have a bad grade. He moves a little fast for my taste.",0
"I've never cried over a class in all the years I've been here, until I took policy with Rombo. Probably the worst experience ever. Gives little to no help, and makes you feel stupid when you ask for help. If you go to class or skip, you'll be 5 years behind, no matter what. Worst class and professor I've ever had at Oneonta",0
"Do not take PHIL1001 with Dr. Plecnik. He makes this class extremely difficult to do well in and grades very harshly (as seen in his free response sections on tests). Intense reading is required as homework everyday and then a quiz on it. His personality is decent, but he is far from a good professor. Strongly do not recommend.",0
I swear everytime i go into his class it's story time (boring stories). he expects one to know where one's group member is if they are not in class during attendance & if you don't know he wont start class (pretty much like baby sitting).quizzes are given every single week. have ur cell OFF & don't forget ur nametag or he WILL kick you out of class,0
"Not so clear (Russian accent), not very helpful in general or understanding of student needs.",0
"An extremely straightforward professor. He lectures about what you read and tests on what he lectures on. You will never get trick questions on tests. One paper, less than 10 pages, not hard at all. No outside research, just pull support from readings.",1
Great professor! He thinks like a student and gives tips on how to study for his exams. Goes over many many examples and provides test practice!,1
"Don't recommend his class what so ever unless you have time. If you have a busy schedule DO NOT take his class but if you think you are capable go right on ahead. Just know he doesn't give direct answers to your question and he advises that you memorize his syllabus. In class he has really long lectures, pretty big reading and writing assignments.",0
"An insightful class which changes your view of the world. Reading expected before class, amazing lectures with heavy note taking. Study guides for each exam, but get ready to study, exams have a lot of material that require lots of explaining. If you follow his guidelines to success in his class then you'll have no problem succeeding.",1
"As a person he seems nice, but as a teacher it is quite the opposite, he almost always has a problem with a student, and is strict about tardies, be very careful to not get on his bad side which is very easy. If you ask him any questions he will not answer them, and if you answer A question wrong he will make you feel bad, even if you dont know it",0
"She's the reason I decided to become a Psychology major, I want to be  like her some day.  She's great! I Highly recommend her class",1
"Very helpful...tells you exactly what will be on exams by giving homework assignments. You don't turn them in, but it's whats on the exam. Made a B, and I'm horrible in math!!",1
Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.,0
"Nice and semi entertaining. BUT, she is very difficult and gives hard quizzes and exams. She always says she will never do an easy quiz. If all you're taking few hours, you'll be fine. But I would not recommend taking her class unless you can put time into it. If I could do it over, I would have picked someone else. If you take her, study a lot.",0
"If you ever get a chance to take academic success with Caitlyn, do it. She's extremely caring, inspirational, and funny. She truly wants you to succeed in academia and in life. She's extremely approachable and walks you through everything. Small groups were fun. Definitely an instructor who has impacted my UofM experience. Highly recommend!!",1
"Class was relatively easy, but the professor was vocal about his opinion on things which often had nothing to do with the class and that he was not an expert in.",0
"Long study guides, multiple-choice portions of exams are easy if you study but the essays are graded harder. Talks fast during lectures, but provides note-taking guides for extra credit. Kinda rude to some students. Attendance and participation are worth points. Weekly quizzes and discussion boards. My e-book doesn't work so I haven't used it.",0
"Take WRA 125 from LeBeau if you can!  He allows you to earn all points back after revising your paper!  The worst part is all the busy work... from the Reading Writing American History workbook!  Class discussions are pretty interesting!   I will be honest, I'm not the best writer but I should  end up with a 3.5 GPA.  Mid-term and final is easy!",1
"Great, numerous guy",1
"I took his online class and it was the best thing I could have done for my GPA.The assignments are weekly and the questions are right from the book.Only downside,he took a little long posting grades. For me,it was one class I didn't have to stress about.",1
Had him for First Year Seminar. Really nice guy and tries to help you as much as he can. Would take for another class if I could.,1
Not supportive at all. goes over one problem and expects you to pick it up. she is terrible.,0
"Provided online lectures during the pandemic, but they were extremely long and forced you to remember a lot. Only get one attempt for homework. Gives you a study guide, but pulls the ""not everything will be on the test"" card. Unrealistic student expectations and difficulty, especially for a low 300 level class.",0
"the worst professor I have ever taken at Quincy college, four and half hours of class time then tons of material to read which is hard to read and to long to remember followed by lots of computer work. honestly should be an online course. Extremely sarcastic when asked questions. Worst course and professor ever!",0
J'ai eu le professeur... Il a essayé le mode: Je ne donne pas de cours.... On a eu 0 cours de sa part... Il commençait le cours à parler d'écologie... Il répétait la même actualité d'un cours à l'autre. Professeur à ne pas prendre.,0
His grading is the worst.  He does not answer quistions.  He explains for himself.  Always make mistakes and then says you can fix it at home.  Too long exams where you cant do them on time.,0
Having studied under Dr. O'Gorman I can guarantee that he is an expert in his craft. I can personally say that he is someone more than worthy of your time and I hope that I can cross paths with him once again. If you sat in one of his classes you would understand. He has a wealth of knowledge despite being callous but because he's that smart.,1
"He has a lot of knowledge but absolutely no structure to his lectures. Trying to take notes on his various tangents and hypotheticals is excruciating. (And you will absolutely be tested on it.) He seems open to helping students who ask and all the readings are provided. But overall, I would not take him again. I can't handle his style. ",0
"She's insanely hard! I had to work extremely hard in her class to pull a C. When she lectures, she talks too fast and in a way that no one understands. I like her as a person she's very nice. Would I ever take a class with her again? Absolutely not.",0
"We are currently a month into class and I don't think the class as a whole is keeping up. We had a journal entry due today and when she asked who *didn't* turn it in, 80% of the class raised their hand. This is not a class problem, but a failure on the part of the professor to properly communicate what is due. already dreading the rest of the year",0
"Moves through material too quickly and will not pause for questions. If you have the courage to ask a question, be ready to be ridiculed for not understanding the concept. By far the worst teacher I've ever had. I made sure to take an onsite class so I would get the most bang for my buck, but I would go home and teach myself online anyway :(",0
"She is definitely one of the worst teachers. Shes super rude and does not have that teacher compassion aspect. She does not care about fixing her own mistakes. When asking about correctness on assignments/grades, she totally dismisses what you are telling her when its HER fault that an assignment/grade is incorrect.",0
"Worst class i have ever taken! tests were something else than the course material, tutorial was like being back in grade 6, the essay was out to trick students. Take her tenure away!",0
"Great Teacher! he explains everything as clear as day. everything he discusses can be found in the book which makes the tests easy to write. he tells you what he expects from everyone at the beginning of the semester and it doesn't change. just do the work, pay attention, and take advantage of every free concert opportunity you can.",1
"Hes a very pleasant person and seems super kind, but he does not teach the language. He follows the typical college class formula of ""you teach yourself, then come to class to just practice what you taught yourself"" and trust me, that formula doesn't work for language classes, especially 101 classes. If I manage to pass, it'll be a miracle.",0
"Lacking of  example, the assignment is nothing about the notes. He talked a lot about the definition. the definition is useless. He thought he is a good teacher, you know....",0
Such a good English class. Was my first class English class of college and was a breeze. 4 essays over the semester along with a well defined Syllabus. She explains things clearly and her tests are easy as long as you pay attention. Make sure to read for the book for reading quizzes. Loved her and would take again.,1
"Terrible teacher. He can not hear so class is just him asking for people to repeat themselves. One midterm one final pretty easy since the ta's held review sessions, but I never knew what I got on the final. 4 crucial projects, a lot of work, but doable. Finished the last 100 point assignment in one day. Barely went to class. No feedback.",0
"Easiest class I've ever taken. Didn't read one of the books he assigned. Can google everything and get by. A lot of writing but hes a lenient grader, very open minded",1
Please do not take this class.  She is the worst!!! The information in the text book was slightly used in class!,0
"The only thing she talked about was the trump impeachment and if you arent a democrat, she will treat you like you arent even a human. Also, get ready to do 2 speeches in 2 weeks. And she never responds back to emails.",0
"Dr. Hwang is not the greatest professor. He speaks very broken English and is condescending towards many students because their beliefs differ from his. He spends most of the time lecturing about material that is not even on his tests. I would show up though, he sometimes gives extra credit to those who show up.",0
"Great teacher for an already tough class. Gentry is very upfront and doesn't baby his students or under-emphasize the  of the course. Students were expected to read the book (RENT DO NOT BUY), do the homework, and come to class with questions. Not an easy A (or B) but if you learn well by self-teaching and peer-teaching you'll do fine-ish",1
"An amazing human being. Empathetic, caring, knowledgeable, and unbelievably nice. Ask any psych student how great he is - Matt is beloved by all. He's one of the most supportive teachers you'll ever meet and is always there for you if you need help understanding content. Just a gem. A conversation with him boosts my mood and brightens my day.",1
"Michael Elliot is an awesome professor. Not only does he nail down on information that you need, but he also has plenty of useful advice to go with it. His group projects may seem scary at first but he's there to offer guidance towards achieving your project's goal. All of the effort he puts into the class is for your benefit, so take advantage!",1
I took her one semester and got a 69 in the class and would not round up one point to let me pass. So I had to retake her and shes still so rude and literally wants you to fail she will never help you out. If you email her and she doesnt want to answer the question you send she will just ignore you. She seems nice but shes fake! Dont take her!,0
"Loved her and she really does make you work for it, but in a great way. Astronomy is my favorite subject and it should be a requirement to take this class. She made me feel so special by reminding me of how lucky I am to be on Earth. I didn't need this class for a requirement, I took it for my own love of our universe. Thanks, professor Walker! ",1
"Tabea cares so much about her student's success. There is a lot of group work involved in this class and if you don't participate, you will lose a ton of marks. She is a very well respected lady and anyone who takes a class with her is extremely lucky. She always dresses and acts professionally and is able to build one-on-one connections.",1
GREAT LADY,1
1 word- BORING! It was honestly the worst class i've had so far.,0
"Took for kickboxing.  She's great, upbeat, positive, and pushes you.  Lost 20 lbs in her class.  I'm a male, I have a black belt, and she still made me sweat and sore.  She always has more tricks to workouts to work u harder. Games are great, she kicks butt, very strong and competent.",1
she takes her 1 credit class too serious and never replies back too emails :/,0
"Not a professor i would want to take for Math 201. Very out of it and always did things that wouldn't help someone out as a teacher. She made a lot of problems harder then what they were. She would teach you different ways and you had to use those ways! Study Study Study if you haver her, tests are killer!",0
Shes a really nice lady with good intentions but she goes way to fast through material and is confusing at times.  Definetly do your homework and all worksheets! If your not great at math i wouldnt take this course with her...,0
"Brad is a good teacher. If you listen to what he says and follow along during the lectures and exercises theres almost no reason why you shouldn't get over a 90. He literally walks you through every task you need to do and provides great pre-exam exercises. The exams are straight forward too, he's not trying to trick you.",1
Second time taking him and I am now a sophomore class of 2017 and plan on taking him for the rest of my years here at Kean! He gives lots of opportunities to make sure you pass his class.,1
HORRIBLE! Do not take her class. Did everything she expected on papers and still get horrible grades. This class ruined my GPA. Tests are very difficult and when you meet with her for help she just basically tells you that she cant help you.,0
His jokes are hilarious. Makes good use of his time. You will learn a lot when you attend class.,1
Record lectures. Never miss a class. Find a good study group,1
"AMAZING. Prof is extremely knowledgeable, patient, helpful, interesting, and has a great sense of humour. Take this class!",1
Mrs. Fritz Is an amazing teacher! I've learned so much about the field of education.   She is very knowledgeable when it comes to topics in education.  I highly recommend taking her.,1
"Dr. Chalk is an AMAZING professor, one of the best. She is so caring about her students, she truly makes an effort to get to know each one. Her class is engaging and she makes literature interesting even if you find it difficult. Dr. Chalk is a very fair grader and gives great feedback on essays and assignments. The grading criteria is super clear.",1
"As someone who struggles with science, I dreaded taking it. Prof Cox has made it as enjoyable as possible by providing relevant connections, great readings and videos. She is an extremely charismatic lecturer even on video, and great at explaining complex concepts in understandable ways. The amount of work is reasonable. Take her class!",1
"If you're someone who isn't strong in math, I definitely wouldn't recommend taking her class. She didn't explain things in ways that were all that helpful to me. Gives a lot of homework/quizzes - these also left me confused majority of the time.",0
"He is a really nice guy, but wouldn't recommend him as a professor. Very tough class, could teach better online, 85% of grade is in exams with little time. I scraped through at the end with a B. Wish he gave more practice exams/material. Lots of people did very, very poorly. His microphone is bad so listening to lectures hurts your ears.",0
"The class was a total JOKE, respectfully. Seems hard at first because you get HW, 1 Midterm, 2 Quizzes, 1 Final & Extra Credit project. Midterm problems are identical to HW (which is online) & the final was online (answers on Chegg). Copies from solution manuals during lectures, cancels class & arrives late all the time & posts grades 2 weeks late.",0
I am not one to complain about a professor but this guy is AWFUL. Not only did I teach myself everything he is a nasty disrespectful guy. He would choose certain students and pick on them. During the year all the hours of packets and chapters in Lab Manual don't even count towards your grade. Your end grade it strictly tests. Try to avoid this man.,0
"Susan knows her stuff, and gives respect to everybody in the class which is important. sum of her lectures can be boring but hey its not always gonna be fun.do the work and youll pass regardless.",1
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
"Professor Ramamoorthy can be a bit tough to understand at times, due to his accent. However, if you make an effort to communicate and truly understand what he wants from an assignment, it can be much easier. He grades very leniently and is very nice, and understanding. The key is to make sure you communicate with him continuously.",1
"Prof. Engelman's lectures are boring and cover mostly common sense information. The readings are long, but only contain a few important details, so learn to skim. Overall, the class is an extremely easy A.",0
Not a very good lecturer.,0
"She's a super nice professor and the content is somewhat interesting. The only problem I had was that she treats an intro class like it is the only class you have and gives you a crazy amount of work. If you like philosophy and want a lot of readings and assignments, then this is the class for you.",0
"Professor Weinstock knows a ton about marketing, but he makes it so difficult for students to do well. If you're looking to get into marketing whether that be a major or minor, don't start your first class off with him. You'll find yourself discouraged and frustrated by the end. Stay away unless you absolutely have to take him. It's not worth it.",0
"Doesn't really tolerate excuses, even if they're beyond student control, like internet connectivity. Quizzes are okay if you do the readings but lectures are long and boring. During online lecture, a student's mic accidentally turned on and the professor became irrationally angry and waited for the student to explain themselves. Just avoid.",0
"He's super helpful and wants everyone to pass. If you take Gen Psych you have one paper; you critique 4 peer reviewed articles through out the semester and at the end use those for your paper. 2 tests, 1 final (not cumulative). Take notes in class and you'll pass the tests. Didn't even open the book. Takes attendance by in class refelction",1
"Really nice lady! She is super helpful! As long as you do the work, you will pass!",1
He has a very funny humor but class is ridiculously hard. Is test are almost impossible to pass if you don't already have a clue about history and your grade is straight test. maybe 1 extra assignment. Also takes forever to reply back to you. I looked at his ratings and noticed they were high so that's why I took him and regret it,0
"Started off interesting, but my attention span waned. He's a very likeable prof who makes some funny jokes during his lectures but I wish the class had more variety. It's just an hour and fifteen of him talking at you. Overall it was a good class, but sometimes it's tedious to just sit and listen and scribble notes down for so long.",1
"Everyone loves Deb. She's an amazing professor. Put in the work, do the readings, and participate, and you will do very well. I learned a ton and my French definitely improved. She is a fair grader and is really out there to help you. You would be a fool not to take a class with her. Makes a fifty minute class seem like thirty.",1
There is quite a bit of homework to complete out of the books. Keep up on it and you will get a good grade. She is fair and nice. I did recommend her for a class.,1
"One of my favorite classes, even though I'm not a Cox major. Prof. Nuchereno is so sweet and really understands what she's teaching. She's always available for help and wants everyone to succeed. Doing the homework thoroughly and memorizing the online practice tests will help you a lot on the tests. Taking her again for macro!",1
He is horrible; one of the worst in NJIT if not the worst.Complete disaster!!,0
"Hans is the worst professor I have ever had at IUP. Regardless of the work you do, he just picks the grade he wants to give you. He tends to do in class activities when a large portion of the class isn't there. His lectures are extremely boring and he reads right off of slides. Lots of awkward pauses during lectures and he doesn't communicate well.",0
"Takes points off for the wrong hue of yellow. If creative choices do not align with her own, points are lost. Spent most of class on non-class topics. Breaks lasted upwards of 45 min., covering new topics with 5 min. left of class, running over. Welcomed outside students into her class to interrupt lectures. Take with someone else.",0
Not helpful at all! She expects the students to know everything! Don't take her class!,0
"This teacher doesn't help at all. I don't recommend her. When taking a test she goes for harder stuff that you don't cover as much. You never use the book. Doesn't explain math well, goes off topic.I forgot to put () but I circled my answer. I was taught that circling counts. She knocked off points when the answer was correct. DONT SIGN UP WITH HER",0
"Confused because all the reviews on Dr. Khoury are extremely positive but his course literally makes me regret being born. The first thing he says is that ""I expect at least 20 hours of work a week in this course"", and he is not kidding. Even with 20 hours I find this course confusing, and struggle in it.",0
"You will lose points if you skip his class. But you dont have any choice but to take his class because he is the only graphic design professor, which is infuriating because his sense of design is so off, he thinks textbooks from the 80s are ideal and has no idea about current trends. he still hasnt let me turn in my 1st project!",0
"doesn't answer emails and her rubrics are very vague, pointless, and don't make sense",0
"A lot of fun. Quirky, and very amusing. She's very helpful with work and goes at a relatively slow pace so that everyone can keep up. There are problems that can be done much simpler ways, but the way she teaches sometimes take 1 or 2 pages just to solve one problem! Otherwise very enjoyable teacher!",1
"Dr. Park was the worst professor I have ever had. If youve taken this class you should be entitled to free therapy. I have a near perfect GPA and I had a 40 in this class. If I wanted to struggle this much, I would have packed a bag and tried to climb Mount Everest. Her tests are impossible. Not sure why she has such a good rating on here.",0
"She is very helpful. Her directions for assignments and projects are simple, but you should always ask her for help when you need it. She was always happy to help me improve in the class, I'm sure she will be happy to help you improve as well. Remember to always practice every day for your speeches, and dress nicely for them. Have fun! I got a B.",1
I would totally take Hinton for every Biology course if I could! She was amazing! I loved her! She is so caring and hilarious! She goes off of topic a lot but make sure you show up to the reviews! Make sure you study the reviews because they are JUST like the tests (like word for word). Answer questions and she will give you bonus points :-),1
"I thought that this was a good class. Helps if you have some interest in child development. No extra assignments or papers, just three exams. Fantastic if you don't want to have to do much work throughout the semester, bad if you don't take tests well. Essays count for a lot on the test so if you can write clearly, you'll probably do well.",1
"No sympathy on grading during the fire, despite the fact that no work was supposed to be assigned. Told me to my face, I wasn't ""affected enough"" by the fire to get any extensions or help even though I was displaced. His lectures were off topic and not related to the course work. EVERYDAY he'd literally pull up news sites and say ""talk about this"".",0
Worst class I have ever taken. I would not take another class from him in my life. ,0
She only replies to simple email request; she does not reply to in-depth email inquiries.,0
"First of all, this was a hard class, second, Dr. Lau didn't do a good job teaching it! We would ask a question and he'd say ""we don't have time for that, we're to far behind."" I, as well as most of the class, had to teach ourselves!!! He does give partial credit and is really understanding if you need to turn in something late.",0
Super nice! Take him if you want an easy pass. Homework is there for practice but not mandatory. Offers extra credit on almost every quiz. PRINT OUT THE CHEAT SHEETS ASAP!,1
One of those unfortunate instructors that doesn't care whether you pass or not.  She is very critical and strict/excepts no excuses.  Depending on her mood at times she was funny but she clearly has an issue with equality and brought it up over and over and over!!! I got an A but had to cross my fingers til the very end!,0
His ITV course was fast-pace and a lot of work but it was easy. Like the others have wrote...He is very generous on his grading.Buy or rent both the textbook and study guide and just keep up with the videos.,1
"You learn more than you wanted!  She's tough, but the assignments are all good for future teachers.",1
"Very nice teacher. class'll get hard but he explains everything crystal clear. he always took time to explain an extra problem after class to make sure I understood the material. Taking notes is mandatory in order to pass but all problems he writes in class are literally the tools to you'll need for HW, quizzes & exams! would take again w/o a doubt",1
"If you're not a morning person, I definitely wouldn't recommend taking his class then because you would fall asleep. I'm not saying he is the worst but it is kind of hard to focus if you can't stay woke.",0
"We use DataDesk, a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program",0
"I enjoy taking her class. She can always make the class interesting and funny by using her experience of being a psychological therapist. The amount of her homework is a lot but doesn't require too much time to finish; just do it on time or you'll end up with tons of them! But if you always turn in the homework, you won't need to take the final.",1
Doesn't know how to park at Tim Horton's TOTAL FAUX-PAS!!!,0
Your not going to have a good time.,0
"He is an amazing teacher and really tries to connect with the students in the class. He helps you whenever you need, and is very understanding. His class helped me realize what I want to do with my life.",1
"she is one of my favorite professors. I've taken several courses with her. You need to study for her exams, but if you go to class and do the readings, you're pretty much garenteed a B",1
AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!!!,0
Professor Bonner is a great teacher who guides students to understand all of the material. He would not leave anyone behind and would answer any questions people had. He is easily the best teacher i have had. I highly recommend you take him if you get a chance!,1
Not good,0
"Professor Luallen knows his content well, but tends to go through the material very quickly so some post-lesson reading may be required. His tests tend to be really hard (much harder than the other professors teaching the same course), but he curves very generous and most people end up doing well because the tests will become easier over time.",1
She is really funny and entertaining. Her test are hard but if you look over your notes you will be fine. She is reasonable and is willing to work with you. She makes a big class feel like a small one because she engages students and opens up the floor to here other peoples thoughts and opinions. i recommend her! :),1
"Not a very good professor, lectures would go off topic and could spend the entire lecture talking about something else. expects you to read the stuff on your own and be prepared for quizzes. took attendance almost every class.",0
"She is such a caring professor. I didn't have any confidence in my ability to write until I took her class. She not only took the time to work with me and help me with my writing, she made me truly believe I was a good writer! Great person, great class 10/10!!!",1
Mr. Seals was the first professor I took for algebra that actually broke it down to my understanding. He gives a lot of short cuts. No long equations just straight to the point. There are many extra credit opportunities. Hes understanding and kind. He taught me something I thought I could never grasps. Great teacher!,1
Did not seem to care much about students and even made a joke regarding ones disability,0
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
"Honestly learned absolutely nothing, and she was one of the worst teachers I've ever had. I am not very good at math, so I was hoping I could utilize her office hours, but whenever I went she would do nothing but complain about her life, and told me to ""work harder"". I would NOT recommend this class to anyone.",0
Dr. Piland was the worst teacher I've ever had. He made things more difficult than they should have been. He changed his grading point scale multiple times and nobody could keep track of their actual grade. He doesn't answer questions clearly; he just tells you to look it up yourself. Avoid this teacher if you can!!!!,0
"This prof may know her stuff, but she's better suited for a research position. Classes are incredibly long and boring, tests are semi-relevant and the majority of her examples are out-dated or don't appeal to the class.",0
Will read ninety percent of poets and one or two outside novels for any given period and tested on all of it.,0
"So. I've been in Ryerson for 2 years and she is the only prof that I despise as a Lecturer. She starts off with the phrase the establishes her bias and privilege as a 'white-privileged, cis-gendered, left-leaning' PhD person and keeps going. Lectures are the worst stereotype of University lectures; I spend too long not knowing what she teaches us.",0
"Awful! Wouldnt recommend to anyone. No help outside of class. Has an agenda and wont slow down to help students. Knows her content but isnt there to teach, just there to collect a pay check.",0
"Professor Perez was one of my favorite professors yet. He is very passionate about teaching and does a good job at teaching. Only gives 1 midterm which is an essay, but he allows one notecard. The final is also an essay but does not allow a notecard. However, he gives prompts ahead of time. If you have a chance to take his Native American class!",1
Very nice guy though a bit on the quiet side. Easy A.,1
He says it like it is. He provides interesting lectures. All you have to do is raise your hand at least once a class and you will get an A.,1
Nicest professor I've ever had and wants his students to succeed. Willing to explain everything again until you understand what's being discussed. Somewhat strict grader that doesn't curve tests. I believe the class was too rushed (I took a 6 week summer class for Spanish 2) but that's not the teacher's fault. Overall highly recommend him!,1
"Very difficult class, expectations were unclear, syllabus was unclear, tests are hard, labs are confusing, lectures are boring and often confusing. She is available to students outside of class but does not help much. I would not take another class with her.",0
"Nice lady, very helpful, and very easy to work with. Course consists of a midterm letter, a presentation, and a 20 page final(double spaced with pics and sources). She really likes to see ALOT of research, but doesnt expect you to write a novel(writing for engineers). Id definately take her again.",1
She's super nice and helpful. The only thing is the test and quiz questions are kind of hard for an entry level class!,1
Take him for calc 1. He gives you all year to turn in homework and his study guides are almost exactly like his tests. Very helpful. I definitely recommend him.,1
"If you can't draw, you'll have to compromise. Luckily I could draw very well when I took this class, so it was easy for me to grasp the concepts and execute them well. Skipping class won't get you a failing grade, but you should go to at least listen to his lectures about animation principles and techniques. He's very laid back and easy going.",1
"She is a great professor. I've had her for many classes. She is very organized and you know exactly what you're doing each class. I loved her ethics in health care class. She will also help with academic guiding and responds to e-mail very quickly. Highly, highly recommend her for any class.",1
THE BEST! Very easy to talk to and is very great at explaining the lectures and assignments. Just read the chapters and do the hw so you can pass,1
"Very enthusiastic professor who knows his material, but he flies thru information very quickly. The best things u can do for urself in this class is take notes via computer &RECORD THE LECTURES so u can go back to them if u can't keep up with notetaking. + he gives hints on what's on tests AND explains what he wants to see. Don't wanna miss that.",1
"Is way too personal in lectures, treats us as if shes at the psychologist. Gives extra credit but you have to pay $15 for the app. 3 exams are 75% of grade and homework (that she says helps pay her bills) is 25%. Would not take again but it is an easy class if you prefer a teacher who gives out way too much personal information.",0
"He always picks the hardest things to do a paper on. Can we ever get a topic that does not deal with plato. PLEASE grade easier on the papers, and exams, have some mercy on the grades. And try to rethink a grade sometimes. That would be very, very nice to do for a person.",1
"This professor isn't really a professor. His involvement in the class is close to nothing, aside from posting bizarre due dates that don't have any pattern to them. I taught myself the coursework online.. why does he get paid for doing nothing? Don't take the course if you need help or your hand to be held.. he's a slow responder. Just tedious.",0
"Best professor, I've ever had by far, the best class I've taken in college so far. He's incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and explains everything very distinctly. He tells you just what to expect and never tries to trick you on tests. The lectures are super interesting and he's very funny and charismatic, so you're captivated the entire time.",1
"Bad teacher, unorganized, lost one of my tests so now I'm getting a C in the class, literally nothing good about this teacher to speak of. Take her at your own risk.",0
"Her discussions make no sense and she has a rude way about her. When commenting on your discussion, Hardgrove makes it seem as if you know nothing.",0
"Prof London is a passionate, intelligent woman who leaves room for discussion while also managing to teach new material at the same time. she is by far the best english teacher I'ver ever had.",1
"Incredibly slow lectures.  Group work is also frustrating because he never wants your group to work ahead or he chastises you.  Also, office hours aren't ""open"" like any normal professor.  You have to email him the exact questions you want help with and that's all he will answer.   Very upset that I registered for his section.",0
DONT TAKE IT WITH FOWLE..SHE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM BEING AN ENGLISH MAJOR!,0
"I did not like this professor at all. Her lectures make you fall asleep. she does not put  a lot of work though, and most of the time she usually came late to class. She teaches you like if you know already about history music. She will put a lot of opera videos. Her final exam will give you a nightmare. That final is really hard and confusing",0
"I love her! She is so helpful and so nice. The online program Aleks is annoying, so she is very helpful during her office hours and she gives extensions if needed. She is very good at explaining the course material and she is extremely nice and helpful. Attendance is mandatory, but it is worth it",1
"Dr. Wang has a very confusing way of teaching, then when students ask her to explain an example she makes it even more difficult to understand. She only uses examples to teach rather than teaching the entire concept which makes it hard to apply the learning to different problems. The textbook helps some but not much. Avoid this prof if possible.",0
Shes very nice and very helpful and understanding.,1
Sasha is easily the best professor I've had at USC. She is so sweet to talk to and makes her class as fun as possible. I still can't believe a class can be this fun and easy at the same time. We love you Sasha!!!,1
Gail was amazing! She is very helpful and wants to see you succeed. Make sure to ask questions because she loves to demonstrate and show you how to effectively do a skill. She is very caring and wants to see EVERYONE move on from NURS 110. She loves honesty. If you make a mistake own it and tell her and she will respect you as a nurse.,1
Prof. Lockett makes class fun and relates the theory to real life events. Her exams are tricky but overall her assignments are cool.,1
"I hated his teaching. Hate is a strong word, but that's why I used it. He once spent a whole class (1hr45min) talking about his office, ways to get to his office, and mistakes students make while navigating to his office. No powerpoint. No weight to his words. NEEDS improvement.",0
Professor McCracken is an amazing teacher. She is respectful to every student and wants to see everyone pass. The class has a lot of material and the end of the semester is rushed but she does a great job at explaining the lectures. Homework is a must as she gives homework quizzes which are graded.,1
Very Good,1
"Phenomenal professor. Take his as much as you can, as often as you can. While the readings are complex, his explanations in class make them simple to understand and extrapolate from. He is, self-admittedly, atrocious at email, but is readily available in office hours and to meet by appointment. A fascinating person inside and out of class. Take.",1
Name is Irma BEVERLY now. Useless as a human being. No instructions for much of the work. The Powerpoints are from the textbook author and appear to be intended for discussion on the topics. She has explained nothing & when I asked her for more examples of statements I got a smart ass reply. Agree w/others-most answers cannot be found in the book,0
The man is out there!!! He is great and funny. In several ofmy classes with him we watched the Sopranos!! He is brilliant but out there.,1
"It is a research class. Must know how to write in active voice with Chicago style to do excel. I got a B, maybe an A- when he posts. Wonderful person who I would take again. Class made me better. Will write a good bit. No tests or quizzes. They say this is the hardest history class in the social studies program. Just apply yourself.",1
"This was a great class. So much info in a short time. Dr. Dewart is a great teacher who has worked in the field. There is a lot of reading, do not miss the lectures (you will learn a lot)watch the videos, and get the study guide. You have a possible 40pts. of EC. I loved this class. I will take other classes from him.",1
"If you are a favorite then you will be allowed to make your own rules, if you are not, then you better get it right! If you are not experianced in art...DO NOT TAKE HIM! b/c you are teaching yourself and then getting in trouble for what you did wrong",0
There is a ton of work every week.  Took this class hoping to have an easy online class and this was not it.  Makes videos of herself talking with puppets and then you have to do an assignment on what the underlying meanings of it were.  Very strange assingments. Quizzes extremely specific once a week. Many discussion posts and responses to others.,0
Take her if you have the opportunity. She is amazing and I would take her again in a heart beat. She understands this is not everyone's favorite topic and gives you examples to involve everyone in the class. Tests are not bad at all and she provides a study guide and extra credit. Show up and pay attention and you will pass with an easy A.,1
"The class itself is hard mainly because of the material, it is all memorizing but  doable and more than possible to make an A in the class. You will learn. Sieber is very caring and understanding when it comes to helping her students. Just focus and ask questions. Oh and she gives extra credit on her exams which is a plus.",1
"Dr. Meehan is a nice lady and knows her stuff. However, if you miss one class, you miss so much! She's isn't very willing to help you catch up. She drops your lowest test, but doesn't allow you to make them up even when you have an excused absence. She does want the best for her students though and will like you if you put in the effort and show up",1
"Dr. MS is awesome, but he gives exams in pdf format so that all of his students are taking the same version of the test. Because of cheating, the averages are very high. Despite this, he hasn't changed the exam format, he has just made his exams harder. Unfortunately, it is more difficult for honest students to do well in his class this semester.",1
Mike does not like his students. He acts as though students are idiotic unless they know what he is thinking and he is incredibly disorganized. He has no idea what he wants from his papers and gives grades seemingly randomly. He has ruined my love for literature this class. Discussions are bland and boring and he gets annoyed easily.,0
"very passionate instructor, however she gets distracted very easily and talk openly about her political and religious views.",0
"Dr. Rivas is very approachable and friendly. He lends the authority of the classroom to the students, which of course has its positives and negatives. Take the class if you are looking for an easy ride through pointless theory. Honestly, Rivas would be more effective behind the scenes of the English department than teaching.",0
I have had Mrs. Wedemeyer for two classes and have done well in both. She does talk a lot off topic but is very caring and helpful. Her class is easy but be prepared to read a little. My greatest dislike is that she is inconsistent about picking up the homework. I feel like if she assigns it then she should grade it.,1
Gives clear explanations and responds to questions well. Gives great study guides and cheat sheets for tests as well as an optional final. Very nice professor.,1
"Rob is great!!! I have learned so many things from this class. If you take BUS 164 at Tacoma CC, then choose rob as an instructor. You will NOT regret it!!!",1
"When he speaks of Spirituality he is  without peer, when he dives into other arenas he rambles.  There is hubris beneath his façade, just a little bit, he manages it well. ",0
"Dr. Jaja is the most unaproachable person I have ever met, She would test us on things that we never learned, accused me of cheating when I asked her to fix my grades. Overall, rude and not nice.",0
I have professor Tewari for Electricity and Magnetism and I love her teaching style. She explains concepts very well and performs many interesting experiments. My friends have also told me that she is very helpful in office hours. ,1
"What a joke. it's like we are back in elementary school. She moves seats, makes you work with partners, and has every single person in the class repeat the same thing over and over again. Terrible teacher. Boring. She's so annoying. Tons of HW (Writing words 5x each) You never get out early even after taking a test. She's terrible. Worst teacher",0
Easy A in all of his classes group quizzes and tests on canvas and its easy.,1
"This is a great class, easy to get a good grade in. Participation matters, he doesn't say anything about people being on their phone but he notices and mark you down on your participation grade. Lots of reading in the beginning, only had to write 2 papers and there were a lot f group discussions. Hes an awesome guy, and great teacher. Recommend.",1
"very interesting, very factual and funny",1
"If you like comparative lit, you'll love Avital.. She's inspiring, but she tends to talk in circles and goes off on tangents a lot. She doesn't allow computers in her lectures, though, so be warned.",1
"I liked Dr. Perez so much that I'm taking another one of his classes even though I don't need the credit. He is extremely objective/honest. He might seem tough at first but he is super nice and is worth talking to outside of class. He assigns a good amount of reading but it's all relevant and helpful to you, no busy work. I highly recommend him.",1
"He's a G. First day of class he played the Pixies, I've never met anybody with a more impressive name than Ignacio Infante, his accent is infinitely dope,  he's just a funny and laid back guy. And he definitely knows his shtuff. Essays aren't too bad, I liked the books but you didn't have to read carefully at all if you pay attention in class",1
Dr. Batman is usually confused and unable to write out the answer to his own problem because he forgets steps or starts over three or four times. He really needs a wake-up call because he is failing to get students engaged because they do not understand the material.,0
Great professor. He is funny and knows what he is talking about. This class was very helpfull...,1
"Don't take her. Anatomy is a hard class already. You don't need to be burdened by a teacher who doesn't know anything about what she is teaching. If you ask her questions about the material, she will tell you to ""Google it"" (Even if it is on material she just went over). Also watch your grades as she won't give you all of yours.",0
He is EXTREMELY INTELLECTUAL and helpful!!!! BEST PSYCH TEACHER YET!!!!,1
"She has been by far my favorite professor since I've been in college. She made learning enjoyable and fun. Her exams were straight forward and came right from the notes. You have to attend class to be able to fill in the notes, however, she does not take attendance. Overall she's a wonderful professor!!",1
"This teacher needs to get a clue. I don't know if anybody passed this class with higher than a C.  I don't if she is trying to prove herself, but I seriously didn't learn anything because of her lack of teaching skills.  Essays questions don't make students learn, good teachers make them learn and this teacher doesn't make that mark. DON'T TAKE HER",0
"This is a really good professor. I took him in MATH 125 and managed to get a ""B"" and I truly suck in math. He does have an accent but he will repeat as much as he needs to.  He is a professor that is FOR THE STUDENT. He reviews for finals and offers extra credit. I never struggled in his class, believe me you will love the class!!!",1
"Shes a wonderful and the kindest professor ever. Always optimist, bubbly and fun and smiles a lot. Classes can be awkward at times, but it is very relaxing and somewhat fun. No tests, just a single research paper for the semester. The bubbliest professor ever!",1
"She yelled at students when asked any questions, and always had mistakes in her quizzes and practice problems she went over in class. She was not clear in lecture, would rarely respond to email. She only let us see some quizzes and because she always made mistakes it left us wondering if our grades were correct. only take if ready to teach yourself",0
"I disagree with anyone recommending tonks, ok maybe compared to other professors he is ok, but seriously this class is brutal",0
"There is not much teaching in this course in fact he is quite inconsiderate,  won't provide preparation material and doesn't help you in anyway. Likes to be authoritative but ends up looking silly. I pay too much money to hqve my time and effort wasted by such.  Bye",0
Had him for lower plants. Feild trips were a blast! I've retained so much from his class for almost 20 years. I've taught my kids all the things I learned from his class. Really freaked out my kids by getting diatoms from goose poo. And I never go hungry when day lillies are about to bloom.,1
Dr. Sankara is an excellent teacher. He has very high expectations and is not an easy grader but he does grade fairly. He is always willing to answer questions or provide any necessary help. ,1
"Thick accent, he reads off the power points, gets frustrated when students ask for help, he tries to squeeze in chapters together regardless of the time he has, test are over 125 questions long EACH! Overly obsessed with attendance, if he makes a mistake with your grade he will not change it even on McGraw hill connect. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!",0
This is a easy fun class. Lots of games. Hes a good instructor too. I'd recommend taking him.,1
I took Hadavas for Survey of Calculus and he is by far the worst professor I have had. He is completely useless and honestly just has bad teaching skills. Make sure you are decently good at math because most of the course you have to look up youtube videos because his lectures are powerpoints and the HW program is terrible and does not help you.,0
"He is a really nice guy and always willing to help if one has any questions during office hours or in class. BUT he is a horrible professor by nature.Poor guy was just born that way, not his fault. He does set 250pt at C but given his super hard exams its hard to do",0
"Midterm and exam were 10X harder than they needed to be with hypothetical type questions and things that have no real answer, just his opinion. Vague instructions yet expects a very specific response. Weekly D2L posts were graded hard and impossible to get a good mark. Avoid like the plague.",0
"She goes through art periods too quickly, there are too many images, and she speaks too fast. The lectures require you to take a ton of notes, your hands will ache by the end. There are quizzes almost every week, so studying the pictures constantly are a must! Too much work required for a 3 credit class. She's not a great professor either.",0
This teacher is amazing. Her tests are hard but the material and the way she teaches it makes it all worth it. I would definitely recommend her for abnormal Psych,1
"Sullivan is a great professor to learn from. He has had first hand experience in the field, and can provide great insight on his lectures. ",1
... he's great!,1
Do not take this professor unless you are a fulltime student and enjoy spending over 20 hours EACH WEEK doing homework. Expect work to be assigned every single day. That is not an over exaggeration. She has a firm belief in quantity over quality. I learned very little and her interactions with students are cringe-worthy and combative.,0
"She is really into the topics and If you're not into it (most probably aren't) do not take her. She is a touch grader and has quizzes every class, a map quiz, midterm, in class writing essay, and a final. She is not approachable and a lil rude. The worst part of class is when she asks difficult questions and calls out people at the end of lectures.",0
Take this class. You will learn! Not your typical WST class.,1
I never write these reviews but this instructor was just purely AWFUL. He literally makes a mistake every time he tries to teach us and he is very soft spoken in class. If you ever get him as an instructor DROP IMMEDIATELY. You'll thank me later. ,0
Monschientastic!!! Great teacher. Helped me a lot and I would recommend him to anyone.,1
"I liked her, realtime experience and genuine.",1
"Dr. Curry is one of the best professors in the HCOM department. Funny, knowledgable, approachable, and extremely enthusiastic, she genuinely cares about her students. She is an extremely tough grader (though fair) and definitely makes you work for your grade. Essays are worth 60% of the final grade, so don't slack off when it comes to those. ",1
Dr. B is a very effective professor and will take time to make sure you understand a topic. He shows great interest in the work and has many years of experience to help. A field activity is required in 101 and it is a great help.,1
"unclear lecture notes, not well explained, too much data less information and knowledge",0
"I LOVE Kathleen. She is an amazing effects animator who is still very active in the field. Type in her name in IMDB if you're curious. She has a tendency to talk quite a bit, but her lectures and advice are really helpful in the long run. Her figure drawing class is also INCREDIBLE. My favorite class at CSUCI so far.",1
"Hannah is a great teacher! She's a hard grader, but you will learn so much from her. She has high expectations of students, but that is because she really believes you can do it. Take a class from her if you can!",1
Overall great prof was very clear and used interesting examples to explain difficult concepts. Take advantage of her office hours she is really helpful.,1
crazy... too strict on attendance.. too much work...,0
"I had her for two courses and the difficulty level was the same for both of them; almost non existent. There is so much extra credit that you can miss a few quizzes and still get an A. She lectures almost all the time with a couple speakers, but it can get boring. Seemed like she wasn't prepared for class periods and read off of online articles.",1
"Don't take her.  Waste of time class that ignores the entire ethics component in favor of the law component.  Takes forever to grade your final paper, and gives everyone a B regardless.  Ruined my 4.0.",0
"Very intriguing lectures, and always brings in personal stories.  She does not lecture for the exams, but rather broad ideas. You teach yourself from the book. Easy to approach, and seems to care deeply for her students.",1
"As I finished this course, I leave the way I came, no knowledge in the field. Every class felt like a waste of time as he would blabber on things no one knew what he was talking about. After every class, the classmates would meet up and complain about how we were left with no skills, abilities or knowledge in the field he was supposed to teach.",0
"He occasionally tells a funny story but is usually boring, but the class is easy. Don't buy the book you'll never use it",0
"Professor Jackson does give a good amount of work but hes very on top of everything. He posted our assignments for basically the whole semester right away, and every week is the same assignment for different chapters so you catch on pretty quick. For exams ALWAYS WATCH THE LECTURES!!! MOST OF HIS QUESTIONS COME FROM THERE!",1
Ask a little bit to much but he's definitely the king.,1
"Map quizzes every wed and regular quizzes every fri. She's an awesome teacher she gives you the quizzes you just have to find the answers in the book, map quizzes if your good at remembering things really well then your do fine if your not might be a little bit difficult.",1
"The best professor I have ever seen. If you want to get a high score, do the quizzes, never skip the class.",1
"Best Professor ever! her lectures were awesome and helped you understand the grading criteria and the information needed to write the essays. Only needed to write 3 essays on super easy subjects. She lets you pick what you want to write about based on the topic. Also, watched the movie, The Greenbook.",1
"I wasn't sure how I felt about his class at first, but Prof. Mason might be the professor who has taught me most in any of the classes I have taken at BYU.  He's hilarious and his lectures are engaging (if you have done the reading). He has daily reading points (which you can make up), and  gives a study guide for his exams, which are reasonable.",1
Staples is a nice guy be expects way too much. Multiple assignments will often be due the same day making it a heavy workload. Lectures are incredibly lengthy and would be a lot shorter and more bearable if he didn't talk about himself so much. The midterms are actually pretty hard; they consist of one essay question and a multiple choice section.,0
Some homework is confusing because of all the explanations but quickly replies to help you understand it. Cares about students and wants you to succeed in class and after. I highly recommend taking him for this class. Going to a city council meeting was pointless though since there was no networking and should be business related in my opinion.,1
Good.,1
"He is very good at explaining and will repeat explanations if not understood. Although Anatomy and Physiology is tough, he tries to make it easier for the students by clear explanations. I enjoyed his class and will recommend him to students",1
"Dr. Braun is the best professor that I had in my time at UA. Her class is work, don't get me wrong, but it is so enjoyable that you won't care. She is passionate about everything that she teaches, and it compels you to feel the same. She cares about her students. I took 3 classes with her in 3 consecutive semesters. I just wish I could take more.",1
"I'm a good student and her test are hard. If u know how to take a test then take her, cause she does not test if you know the material or not. You have in class group assignments every day and you have to go to her class. She also has a thing about being tardy.",0
"If your not interested in the Bible, don't take this class. If you interested in it, definitely take it. Professor Zank was engaging, interesting, compassionate towards outside opinion, and very interested in student's comprehension. One of the best classes I've had at BU. But remember... you should be interested in the subject first!",1
"Professor Cassidy is hands down one of my least favorite professors. I had her for PHIL321 and I hated the class. She gives out so much homework and is a very strict grader. Its a Gen Ed class and Ive never had so much homework in my life. She takes this class way too seriously. But besides that, shes a nice ish person.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had in a class period. I cannot believe the work load she believes us to carry for a gen-ed when we have multiple other classes and tons of other homework. I thought I would take an easy class for gen-ed credits and it would be a breeze but she gives you 60+ pages of reading before every class. Worst teacher I've ever had.,0
The Best Professor I have Ever Had!,1
awesome teacher. She is great at explaining and making sure you understand the concept. Do not give her attitude she will not tolerate it. We had hw listed for us it's a lot she doesn't look at it you'll get a check mark if it's done. My class convinced her for all test to be taken home it worked. Do your work study the content&youll pass,1
Andrea is literally amazing!!! I've taken Crim1208 with her and she knows how to make everyone in her class succeed! She is super kind and is very helpful. She emails students as soon as possible with answers to their questions. Her exams consist of M/C and 3 assignments which are a breeze to complete as long as you pay attention and have the text,1
"you have to put in the effort to do well in your class, but as long as she sees you are taking risks with your acting and trying, you can do well.  if you are the type who doesn't like uncertainty in grades you shouldn't take the class, because you won't find out your grades on the acting assnmts (only the written ones).  fun class.",1
"OK professor. This class was very easy, but his attempt to teach/help was never sufficient enough. My classmates always seemed frustrated to follow and he'll mock you if you didn't understand. I didn't need to attend his class to pass his tests b/c I felt like the textbook was much more helpful! I'd say it's only mandatory to turn in hw/for tests.",0
"Nice guy. However, if you take no other warning take this one. When he says that ""if you are able to do the homework, you will do fine on the test."" -- Just know that is a complete and utter lie. The tests are 50x harder than anything he gives for homework or does in class. If you have not had calc before I would recomend another prof.",0
"Mr. Harvey was awesome! The class was very easy, show up to class and participate. He makes learning fun. I would absolutely recommend this class.",1
If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
"Not clear on anything, such as her criteria for what she wants on the paper. Basically are just reading her friends poetry, bizarre. You will have no clue what she is talking about, because she just goes on rants, but is super quiet. Also, she has remade the syllabus 5 times, and each time she hands out the knew one, they are still unclear.",0
Quizzes every week so be sure to study for them. There is a written portion and a multiple choice portion for tests. I recommend writing your notes out in order to help with the written portion. Pay attention in class and write down what he says. He does give partial credit on exams/quizzes. If you get something wrong hell write out the answer,1
She is awesome,1
"Meh. U can hardly hear her (unless u sit close),&she's pretty hard to understand if u try. gives study guides for all tests, and note taking, while helpful (if u can hear her), is not completely req. because of the comprehensive guide. Also, doesn't make u memorize specific dates for each piece (for slide IDpart of test), just the blanket era dates",0
"Professor Makover is probably one of the worst professor I have ever come in contact with, barely explains stuff in class and runs over it very quickly with no examples. He refers to our knowledge and compares it to 4th and 5th graders, even though I have heard him say multiple times that ""Our knowledge is probably better than his.""",0
"Honestly a really smart guy and tries to share his knowledge through teaching. His class isn't hard at all just pay attention do the HWs (very few) maybe you'll get a nice take home test/quiz if you convince him that's what we did, and his tests aren't hard as all he'll tell you random ass stories through the test and class all day long.",1
She start confusing me after a few classes.,0
"I've had one professor with a similar energy and charisma to DJB in my time at UT but with nowhere near the intellectual challenge. DJB is open, honest, and connects with her students. Can't recommend her enough.",1
"Reads directly from the slides, few relevant examples, too many assignments",0
"expects you to know a lot of material. should expect to do even more research outside of what him and the textbook give you if you hope to do well. his exam questions are worded like puzzles that make it difficult to accurately answer the question. going to the lectures isn't required, but if you hope to do well in the class, you should go. ",0
"Dr. Mike has clear lectures and is very humorous. He is always ready to help in the Physics Help Room. He can get frustrated if you don't understand the material right away, but overall he is a good teacher. EXAMS ARE HARD.",1
"Boring professor. He lectures really slowly and never finishes them. Also, his homework and tests are worded very weirdly and are hard to understand. The homework is graded based on accuracy and he takes points off for very minor mistakes.",0
"Gives assignments on coding, but all grading is done through an online grader; to pass, you need to go to class and record every minor detail he might drop on how to format your code, because the assignments are written rather vaguely.  Office hours were a must, otherwise the chances of getting every formatting detail correct are minimal.",0
"Dr. Wingender is very fun! He is like everyone's grandfather. He has the best intentions, and teaches you things for the real world! He does call on you at random, so you must be focused. The tests are like the practice tests and come from information in the lectures, so you have to go to class. You will learn a lot for outside of college!",1
He assigns ridiculous amounts of reading (with worksheets to fill out) every class and all his tests are in essay form. He doesn't seem to understand that his class is an LAC. I spent more time preparing for his class than my major classes. His lectures drag on and he doesn't manage class time well. Reminiscent of the work required for AP courses.,0
He is really nice!,1
Horrible experience for the online summer class. Webcam is requires for tests and is extremely uncomfortable. You have to buy and expensive online program that requires you to log on multiple times a day. Tough grader on projects. Hard tests even for a 4000 level class. Would NOT recommend at all. Dropping this course.,0
Exams were very difficult. Quizzes and exams are much different than the examples that are worked out during lecture.,0
"She seems nice enough, but her classes are amongst the most boring I've attended. I never leave with the feeling of having learned anything. She spends most of her lectures asking students to talk between themselves before she writes their answers on the board and her voice can be distracting as it sometimes cracks and comes out squeaky.",0
Best teacher I have ever had. He believes in us as students; takes our art seriously. He makes me want to put 1000% into my work and actually exhibit it. Also a great sense of humour.,1
"Dr. Wolff is a very nice lady! She is very laid back and easy to talk to. Lectures usually take the entire class time. There is a movie assignment, and an off campus assignment. I really enjoyed the class. Some of the test questions were a little tricky. Reading the text is a must. The powerpoint do not have much info on them.",1
"Good, a little disorganized but very enthusiastic.",1
"I go to ODU in Norfolk and had Professor Shapero her first year here. She was terrific; I had to retake 211 after not getting a C the previous go-round and she was great. She made it easy to talk in class and she helped me improve tremendously as a writer. Class is easy and stress-free. Papers aren't hard, little hw. Take her.",1
"Seems a bit cynical in the beginning but as the semester went on he was an amazing teacher! Didn't quite understand something? Ask. Always there to help! Tests are a bit hard, requires studying.  Lots of notes, trust me, you will need them!",1
Do not take this class. His lecture are boring and his exam extremely difficult. He doesn't know how to teach a class. RUNNNNNNNNNNNNN from this class and from this professor. If you want to fail a class take this one!,0
"If you are looking to get out of your comfort zone and work for your grades, take her class. She sets high standards for her students and will call names out if nobody is participating. Follow her guidelines I would suggest going above and beyond to meet with her. She is never on time with anything, but her classes are genuinely interesting.",0
"I think he has good intentions, but I thought he was too animated throughout the entire course. His lectures were long and, at times, stressful.",0
"Online HIS-132 had a lot of reading, of course, but Prof. Hipp. made it enjoyable. The tests were easy - out of the book. The papers were lengthy, but doable. He genuinely loves what he does and his course introduction is hilarious. I learned more than I expected to in his class.",1
"Very good guy but it's difficult since CMPE-160 is just by nature a tough class. He really cares about his students doing well, and clearly knows what he is talking about. Very tough grader though, seemingly minor things will noticeably cost you on quizzes and tests (i.e. not labeling the select pins on a multiplexer). Great professor overall.",1
DO NOT TAKE MEADE. I thought Meade was a pretty nice guy at the beginning and he is obviously very knowledgable about the material but he expects everyone else to be just as smart. He is incredibly passive-aggressive and will assign a 65 source pathfinder project literally two days before it is due. Then he will complain about giving extensions.,0
"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before.",0
"Dan Pierce is hands down the worst professor I have ever had. He is disrespectful, childish, and horrible at teaching. He does not cover any real material, he just sort of meanders over topics and wastes people's time. He is rude to students, says things to belittle his students, and acts untouchable. I wish I could give him a ZERO, he is AWFUL.",0
"Raquel is nice, but she makes this class way harder than it has to be. I don't hate going to class, or dislike her, but she really makes our quizzes/exams MUCH harder than they have to be, I understand she wants us to know the material but she makes it too hard. She is nice, but if you have better options take them over Raquel. Speeches aren't bad.",1
When I took him last semester he changed some stuff around and now you have to write more papers. They are not difficult but still time consuming. The class is still easy but a lot more work. I would not retake it though if i could,1
"Professor Infante is great! World Lit is a really interesting class and he clearly is very passionate about it. He chose some really great texts and always gave insightful lectures. He is very laid back and approachable, enthusiastic about what he teaches, and is a pretty easy grader. Overall it is a very casual atmosphere and highly enjoyable.",1
Dynamics was rough for me. Dustin is the reason I survived. He is able to explain things in a way that make sense to almost anyone. His course layout is the same no matter what class you take. He tells you up front what it takes to pass the class and provides a straightforward way to do it.,1
"He shows up to every class looking like it is the very last place on earth he would rather be. Also, his classes consist of him just scribbling down problems that he does in his head and does not stop to explain how he came to his conclusions. He is very intimidating to talk to and makes every question he has to answer seem like a chore.",0
"great guy, but very poor at communicating when assignments are due and poor at giving details about the assignments. I'd rate him a 5, 5 out of 10.",0
Class time is used really poorly. It's a self taught class--she doesn't teach anything in class and expects you to preform well on tests without any proper instruction. She's sweet and laid back but not a good professor. Don't take her if you actually want to learn anything/get anything from the class. Also lots of homework.,0
"Have taken 2 other classes with Mooney. If you study the slides and take notes during them, as well as read through the textbook and add to your own notes, you're golden for the exams. Have a good topic in mind for the paper, and KNOW it. She grades them hard, but is always there to help. Detail in your discussions are a chore, but are key for 5s.",1
Her powerpoints are fill in the blank and diagram labeling which is pretty much what her tests are as well. If you've taken other biology courses at JCU youll know that the kind of clear cut straight to the point answers she gives on her powerpoints is heaven-sent compared to other bio courses' material. Lots of extra credit. Highly recommend. ,1
"While this class was difficult, you WILL be quite prepared to teach in an urban setting. Professor Manski is an excellent gauge on a student's readiness to go inside an actual classroom. Although there is room for growth and I have my entire teaching career ahead of me, I am much more confident in my ability to be successful in the classroom.",1
Colleen was AWESOME! .... I still remember the Philosphy discussions.,1
"Her class is pretty straight forward.  However, she gave me a B in the class when I had a B+ average...didn't that was right.",1
"To add- We got to choose any religion in history to write about for our final paper. I chose Scientology and others chose ones like Satanism, Wicca, ancient Greece, Nordic, and Quakerism. Interesting!",1
"Not a hard class, do the readings and discussion boards. He gives positive feedback, only thing is his comments on your writing are not extensive just say ""interesting"".lol",1
"Tatyana is amazing. She is clear and does a good job explaining accounting. The class itself is difficult, but she makes it easier and even offers extra credit. I recommend showing up every day even though attendance doesn't matter because it will help with the homework and exams. She is very nice & helpful and cares. One of the better profs at FS",1
"Funny and knowledgeable, grades very leniently. Cares about the material and wants you to learn!",1
he's a nice guy but he disarms you with his kindness then half way though the quarter you realize your doing way too much unnecessary work to justify for an English 101 class. Attendance is graded and you will be test on his lectures on the finals. You will turn everything on canvas & online quizzes are taken in class. he's very loud speaker,0
"This class was definitely enjoyable. Lectures end up being pretty pointless because lecture exams are based off the practice test that he provides the answers for. Labs are fairly easy, but you must attend all of them if you want to pass the lab exams. No homework ever. The presentation is easy and easily graded. Overall great professor. ",1
"I learned a lot in his class. He is very smart and you can ask him about anything. He goes off topic a lot but you sure do learn a lot from it! Overall, I enjoyed his class. Worth taking.",1
"He's very new to teaching & it shows. He's VERY difficult to understand & has an extremely hard time with being wrong & being called out on it. He's absolutely brilliant, but clearly not meant for teaching. I'm majoring in chem, so I didn't have a hard time w/ the class, but I read the entire book & ignored his lectures. Thats the only way to pass.",0
"I took this class online and I have never regretted anything more. The material we were told to study was nowhere near what was on the tests/quizzes. Instead of understanding and being accommodating, she was accusatory, rude, and dismissive! Every week, something went wrong. If this class had been taught by anyone else, it would have been great.",0
"Worst teacher ever. Not clear on grading, online homework and tests are way harder than taught. Hes extremely rude, not just to students, but to older adult students. Will not listen or work with you. Changes grading rubric the last day of class. Im proficient in Spanish and I nearly got a C bc he cannot teach and expects you to know it on y own",0
"Madhu has a very specific expectation for the work done, there is no space for differing opinions or varying learning styles. She seems highly sensitive of Indias stereotypes and uses this to share her own of Americas, and the recognition of a broad gender spectrum is lost. Patience for full time workers getting tired at the end is nonexistent.",0
Tuition worthy,1
Avoid and take someone else. Was nit-picky about testing on irrelevant details that didn't aid in learning.  Top-down sort of teaching. Ruined clinical for many students I talked to. She may be a good researcher but teaching is another story. 23 of students stopped showing up to lectures because they said they weren't usefuljust read the book.,0
Overall very sweet lady but this class was a literal nightmare. Lots of work with little to no instruction but that definitely was not the worst part. The exams absolutely destroyed my grade and she did not teach at all beforehand just provided links with vague explanations meant to help. Pretty draining experience that left me stressed constantly.,0
"DO: show up to class, take good notes, WileyPlus online hw, study for tests DON'T: be late, use phone/technology, ask questions b/c she won't answer them well Tests are all based on her notes and are relatively hard b/c it covers a lot of material. She's awful with technology, kind of scary yet kind of nice, but overall good teacher.",1
Take him if you want an easy A!! He is pretty understanding + nice and not a stickler for due dates. If you are late you still have a chance to get a good grade. I had been late with a couple of assignments yet I still got full credit for them despite turning them in a few days past the due date. The book/Pearson lab part is expensive though.,1
"Dr. Brown , and Jason Marion is the best professor  EHS department ever have. I wish only them two will teach all the EHS classes especially the "" Vector"" class. I would definitely will pass if I take it with Dr. Brown Or Jason Marion because they will teach you clearly and they expect the result back. ",1
"Multiple choice tests,no partial credit, 20, 8-16 problem hw. Studying midterm for final is futile. doesn't matter how much material you can shove into a both sided cheat sheet You are screwed. Got tutored, did all the extra credit, showed up every class ON TIME, took notes still failed, Pass is possible if taking teacher twice.",0
"Omg dont take comp with her. I learned more from the writing center than I did from her and nobody in my class made a good grade. She doesnt mark your papers, telling you where you messed up and doesnt explain anything. Honestly could have taken the class without her and just using the writing center and still wouldve got the same grade.",0
Professor Khajavipour is very caring towards his students but at times he can be slightly scatterbrained. Many people in my class complained about not having their grades up to date in a timely manner and as of now I still haven't received a final grade in the course. Reading questions are VERY tedious and most weeks they aren't worth 15 points.,0
"Mr. Lloyd is quite outdated in his lengthy stories to be teaching this particular class. Never correct him when he gives incorrect information. He expects you to know where your classmates are, if they will be absent, or late. He won't start class until everyone is accounted for.  (This is our job as students?) Run, do not take him.",0
"Were halfway into the semester and the only thing I have in the grade book is attendance. She always cancels class, sometimes at the last minute too.",0
"Mrs. Chaney is fun to talk to and nice but man oh man, don't expect to understand anything that she tries to teach at all. She's all over the place with her lectures and will expect you to understand a term after she has mentioned it once. Overall I come out of class knowing less than when I went in. 10/10 wouldn't take again",0
"He literally gives you every answer to the tests. Grading is just 6 tests and go to 2 orchestra concerts. He's very... eccentric. Talks about political issues a lot, which I think is more interesting than music anyway. I recommend him. Do not get the book, it's a waste. Just buy the online access code.",1
Van Horn does not teach at all. The class was done entirely over Gmail??? He claimed grades would be given over Brightspace but its mid November and I have yet to receive a single grade which absolutely ridiculous. The assignments were sent out on a Monday as well as whatever extra readings and due Wednesday at 5 pm so you had little time to finish,0
"Okay, despite my various low gradings on Jonas, he is not so bad.  He is vague, and can neglect the basics of art (which I believe are essential--such as basic techniques of shading, etc), BUT you just have to GO with him.  If you go with him, and work hard or THINK hard, you'll like the class.",0
"Prof Allen is an amazing lecturer, EPSC20 is perfect for people who aren't very good at science, he was very understanding and accommodated coursework multiple times during the pandemic. Work is very easy, just stay on top of it and you'll be fine. I didn't do the readings and still passed. Just make sure you understand concepts and history.",1
Terrible! He is truly all over the place with his ideas and thoughts. His exams do not relate to the lecture or the readings. And why does he make us watch a movie about CORN?!(great nap time though),0
"I was scared to take her class because of the reviews. There are lots of papers but you can pick most any topic. If you go to the writing center they can help you with grammar. I was going through a very rough time. I talked to her privately she gave me very good feedback on papers and listened to me. I would take her again, made me love english.",1
Don't take this class! He doesn't teach a thing in the lectures but once a week he'll have one where he acts like he taught everything and no one has any clue whats going on! His tests and lectures are like two completely different classes. The first midterm the class average was 44%!!!,0
"This class was awful. I hoped to learn more about forensics, since I'm in the field, but all he did was make us read stuff about the 'corrupt' forensic scientists. I learned nothing about forensics at all, just how some scientists have done poor work. Do not recommend AT ALL.",0
Professor Pittman is awesome! She is enthusiastic and really knows the material she is teaching. She is also super personable and helpful if you ask. I would take any class taught by her; I think she could make any topic fascinating because of her own enthusiasm. ,1
His tests are online and okay. Take notes and read the articles. His lectures are extrememly boring but he takes attendance so you have to go.,1
This guy is the worst. If you take his class you won't learn anything at all. All he talks about is flying planes. I wish he would go back to flying planes instead of teaching because he really has no clue. He also gives horrible grades and is hard to understand.,0
"unbeleivable, english is defietly not my stong subjectand managed to get an A. pretty straight foward class if your the kind of student that just wants to show up and play angry birds. she shows alot of videos.",1
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. ,0
"Ms. Gadsby is the coolest. She's not super organized with her syllabus (for this class at least, which is new) but she never leaves you hanging when it comes to assignments. Her lectures are always engaging and funny, and she doesn't care about attendance so people tend to float in and out. She tells awesome stories and is super knowledgable.",1
"Part time  professor and he has own business during daytime. he just graduated from school only few years, it is almost impossible to reach him outside of the class. doesn't reply email until last minute, text message either. his project and assignments are unclear sometimes. if you take his class, ask him questions right after class.",0
"As I was in my first semester of graduate school, this was definitely a difficult class. Dr. Lorton took time to answer each question without making you feel as though you were an idiot for asking. Be sure to do your homework! Test questions are similar to notes and homework problems. Often, homework is harder than the test. Best of luck!",1
"Tax II is a hard course as it is. When you have someone who degrades the class and unwilling to answer questions, the course becomes next to impossible to get through. Daria goes through few problems in class SLOWLY. Practice the problems weekly - the only way you will pass. Stay on top of course work. Take AFA 817 with another prof if possible.",0
"Condescending, stammering, not interested in discussion or alternative viewpoints...kind of a jerk sometimes. Says the word ""uh"" about five times in every sentence, making him difficult to listen to for more than a few minutes. I will avoid taking any other class with him.",0
"wastes a lot of time letting students rewrite the syllabus until there's one week left before a test & he has 8 different topics to cover. Tests often include random & generally useless facts from articles he assigns. You don't do much in class which a is nice break, but come project time it sucks. Vote against the business game if given the choice",0
Hes very dry but funny. actually enjoyed class. If you show up you will pass,0
"I found Joy's class very difficult. The readings were super challenging, the material was generally boring. She would give us long assignments that are worth 2-5%. She doesn't seem to care about the student's time. Also, she is a very tough grader with minimal feedback. I cried during the midterm and almost dropped out twice. Avoid if you can!",0
Amazing professor.,1
"Great teacher! His lectures are like stories-interesting.You will write the entire class period,so be prepared for your hands to hurt. Make sure you write down everything he says. His tests consist of a little bit of everything in the notes, so study all of it. As long as you attend class, pay attention, and take notes you will definetly pass.",1
Her enthusiam for history is contagious. She makes a normally boring subject very interesting. She basically lays everything out for you and if you follow her plan and read the text you will get a good grade.,1
Shes not helpful when you go into her office or ask for help during work time during class. The beginning of the semester seemed like a lot of busy work which didn't help at all. I don't recommend taking her because she's not helpful and her lecture days are just her rambling on about useless information. Only good thing is she split up the project,0
"Lectures were a bit boring, and the readings covered basically the entirety of lecture so I found there wasn't much need to attend except to learn the answers to extra credit questions on the test. Discussion covers anything that they reading may not have had in regards to the lecture anyways.",1
Her attitude changes every class. She would always find something negative to say for every presentation. I would not recommend her!!,0
"It can be a little difficult to follow her at times because shes very smart, and struggles with putting things in terms everyone can understand. She just wants you to work, and to use some common sense. If youre having trouble, see her during office hours.",1
Most intelligent being around amongst EAC's faculty.,1
I thought she was weird at first coz she gets loud  but you get used to her. She has amazing subject knowledge she is the reason i'm taking poli sci now great prof,1
"Michele is wonderful. Her demeanor in the classroom is one of respect. She is brilliant, but never makes you feel like your opinion matters less than hers. She grades tough at times, but is always very clear about criterion, and gives you ample opportunity to succeed as long as you put the time in. I respect and admire her greatly.",1
This class is a ton of work. But it's not hard. He is very clear on what he expects right up front. Basically participation is 50% of your grade. As long as you turn in things on time you get 50%. Then the rest is your final portfolio of works and a final exam. Be prepared to write a lot but also learn a lot! Can be an easy A. Took it online.,1
"Tough class. Must got, must read. She expects you to memorize the entire book. You'll learn a lot of good information and be grateful in the future but while you're in the class it's painful. She has so much information, talk to her outside of class she's a completely different person and can really help you change your life through finance.",0
This teacher is absolutely horrible. She thinks you are supposed to know everything.  When you ask her to re explain something she does it worse than the first time she explained the concept. Don't take her!!!!!,0
test R open book but u do need to study they R not really that easy! but hw counts 150pts so that helps----- & he is supper hot & has great HAIR! but he is married got married spring break 2005 so that sucks,1
"His exams are tricky. There are only 22 multiple choice questions per exam. You need to study the slides carefully, read the chapters thoroughly and take your own notes to get an A. During your presentation, he will ask you questions out of no where so be prepared and know your companies well. He's not very helpful outside or inside the classroom.",0
"Wolters is the nicest and most passionate woman. BUT DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU ARE ON ZOOM. Theres multiple lecture videos every week and she takes points off if you havent gotten around to doing them yet. On top of that, the quizzes are so hard. They just bring down your average. To do well, you have to neglect all of your other classes. Dont do it.",0
This class has been the worst class that Ive ever taken Prof tests on the concepts he barely spends time explaining throughly you are essentially on your own when it comes to tests. The labs are also bad he expects you to know all the lab material and literally comes into lab just to ask you questions and if you dont get them he roasts you.,0
set the bar so low with your spanish that she won't expect anything from you then just bust out with fluent spanish and you'll do well in the class. she gives a lot of pointless homework but she tries to make the class as interesting as possible. i just like her as a prof cause we always joke around with her also she's never absent so rip,1
"Nice guy but good luck learning anything from him. I've done well in Calc I and II so general physics should be nothing, right? Almost too simple if you're a science major and his explanations and ways of doing things are so convoluted and hard to follow it makes getting anything out of it difficult.",0
"He's a talker so take lot's of notes. He gives about 1 quiz a week and sometimes it's a pop quiz so make sure you know what's going on. No tests other than the final and for that you just need to review your quizes so make sure you have the right answers. He gives some easy assignments, but doesn't grade them just for class use so do them for credt",1
"The only professor you won't mind having during her 8am section. She's so lively and funny that it keeps you awake. Put the effort in, and you will without a doubt get an A if not a high B. She is the best out of all the freshman psych professors. She is able to give real-world examples behind concepts due to her being a real clinical psychologist.",1
"Hey Jason, if you are reading this like you always do, I just wanted to let you know that you are one of the worst English teacher's ever. Gain some humility too.",0
dr. Randy waterman opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits. thank you very much dr. randy waterman,1
"He expects you to read multiple books throughout the semester and write 4 essays, 3-5 pages long.  If you have other classes as well and kids, it's very hard to accomplish.  He also likes to grade tough by mechanics.  If you like to read and write then it's all yours.",0
Lisa cares deeply about what she teaches and it shows! You will care about it too after taking her class. She is very engaging and an easy grader. Be prepared for group work/discussions.,1
"Nice enough lady, but it's useless disagreeing with her. Super easy class if you've taken management principles or marketing, or psych,. All the same stuff.  Class is a waste of time. She's helpful if you need it, but her lectures are basically her reading the powerpoint. Just read the bold stuff in  the textbook and you'll be fine.",0
"Mrs. Bowlin does not teach at all. she just sits there and reads the ""questions"" that will be on the test. i have not really learned anything in the class. and we don't have any type of disscussion. any time that there is an attempt at disscussion from one of the students she shoots it down.",0
Great teacher :),1
I took dr. Brown for 0700 math and I am taking him again this fall for finite. He is a great teacher . He takes his time explaining and makes sure you grasp concepts the way your supposed to. He is very sweet and easy to talk to if you're having some problems or difficulties.,1
LOVE LOVE LOVE him!! He is a great teacher and will help in whatever way possible!! I don't get algebra but he works with me lots in class till I get it! You will have a quiz everyday and you better NOT be late!! oh and don't talk in class to anyone but him!!But trust me if math's not your thing take him and you will learn lots!!,0
Mrs. Fernandez is a great teacher! I do not understand how many of you think shes such a bad teacher! She gives great feed back in all your work! She makes the class fun and is willing to help when needed! I had a Two B in her classes so Im not brown nosing but the true is that shes great,1
"One of my favorite professors at Duke and definitely the best class I have taken so far (Business in the Francophone World). Deb puts a lot of work into her lesson plans and it shows, as we're constantly learning and doing different activities that aid in us learning more about the topics we're studying. I was actually sad to have the class end.",1
"This guy is probably a good engineering and knows what he is talking about. However his English comprehension SUCKS! He cannot communicate clearly with the class, mumbles his words, mis-spells on the board, and when a question is asked he doesn't really understand what is being asked. Although he is a nice guy, he isn't a good teacher period. ",0
He doesn't give you a review for any test or the final. If you ask questions he makes you feel silly for asking them. He uses the old book and not the one the you are told to buy. Even if you take good notes from the book you could be studying something not on the quizzes/test. and still fail them. He is a nice guy and can be funny at times.,1
"I couldnt get a worst introduction into NYU, like I still think im bad at math because of this class. like actually ruined my GPA, spent so much time trying to figure out the notes for this class I did bad on other classes too. She seems like a smart person but she just CAN NOT teach. If any freshman see this, please do yourself a favor and SWITCH!",0
"Gives back hw months later and its all 50% bc he wants a specific way and never tells you or shows you. Exams are open book but you can get points taken off every little thing (lines, misspelling, conversion). Very old school and hard to get to because he has a hour long wait in his office because he cant communicate with students. miserable exp",0
This class was online due to COVID and did not have any zoom meetings. Very few assignments besides unit quizzes and tests. I personally did not enjoy this class as it was all self-teaching and I did not receive much feedback. Had a 'B' the entire semester. Honestly felt lost and like I didn't learn anything the entire semester.,0
"Sra. Logue is one of the best teachers I've ever had. While I wouldn't consider the work particularly difficult (unless you want it to be), it was always enjoyable. I elected to commute an hour each way simply to enjoy HER class, and on top of that, to enjoy time with her out-of-class. Fulfilling req or for enjoyment,  she is the way to go. muchluv",1
"Her teaching style is for you to learn the material yourself, on your own. She is very disorganized. She drops tons of paperwork on you at the last minute. This semester, over half her class is failing the department wide tests. A ticket to her class is a ticket to failure. Go with another prof; don't waste your time with her.",0
This class experience is what your group is! Exams aren't as hard as EGR106 so nail the exams if you can. Stevens is a understanding prof the key is if you have a problem let him know immediately. DON'T WAIT FOR IT TO GET BETTER! it doesn't! If your real with him he'll be real with you. Keys: Get passed his dry sense of humor & go in with a humble.,1
"Loved this class because he kept me engaged with his stories and the topics discussed. He also brought guest speakers, who are his journalism partners from all over South Florida media, talking about their experiences of journalism ethics. Granted, there were quizzes every week based on book readings but as he said, ""Nobody really fails at FAU"" ;)",1
"She is an amazing prof, her lectures were amazing and despite being a T and R class, the classes felt very short. She does mark quite hard on her exams and essays.  You can't skip class, she won't post the notes. And study the book like the crazy.",1
Great teacher!!! She has a willingness to help all her students and she wants us to succeed. She is the best teacher I have ever taken. Wish more teachers were like Ms. Berger-Hill. ,1
"Rick is a really great teacher, easy marker, but everything is due at the very end of the semester, overall...highly reccomended",1
Cant follow along during lectures at all. Stay home and read ur textbook,0
"Dr. A is a great guy. He is very smart, but his lectures are HARD. Spatial Analysis is impossible. BUT there is a HUGE curve if you actually try hard. Taking notes in class makes no difference. Just don't get behind on studying. Takes attendance 10x at random so go to class. DO problem sets and go on extra credit labs.",0
Its a difficult class no matter who you take it with. But Don is fantastic and really engaging,1
"I took field ecology and intro-ecology with Eric. If you want to do get a good grade in his courses you need to do your work the right way. If you do half-arsed work it will show in your grades. Follow his directions, ask questions, and you can get an A.",1
Great teacher. Interesting. Very nice person. Made class easy to attend because it was not boring.,1
"Math is not my strong suit, but she made me want to change my major to Stats. Her class was so organized and reasonable. I would 100% take her again, if you are taking this class because it's required for your major, take hers. She gives you cheat sheets on every test, but you need to go to class to know what to put on your sheet.",1
"I lost interest in the online writing class when the professor didn't show up for classroom  chat sessions. The weekly lessons would get released on different days of the week, so you couldn't get into the flow of the class. I would not take another class with professor Keating if I had other options.",0
"This professor was one of the best. She was very understanding and actually helped you when you had questions and would explain everything well, unlike other professors. Her lectures were not even that bad, I don't know why there are so many complaints on her. She's actually a great professor.",1
"Monica is an alright prof. She doesn't post anything online, so going to class would be smart. Reading the textbook is almost mandatory for this class I find. My biggest complaint is that she takes forever to mark tests and assignments.",1
"She's a great teacher! She will go over something and ""iron it out"" until you get it. She encourages questions so shy people speak up because she can move fast and you will get left behind. Homework is easy and you get several chances to get it right so there's no reason not to get a 100. She's try's to use examples that will make it easier for us.",1
"She is passionate about Academic Dishonesty! In other words do your own work! It was a horror show for this class specifically. The class is easy, pay attention, write down the clicker questions - they are in the exam. Learn the content. Her test are average as long as you study the review questions. NO LAPTOPS! Or phones she will call you out!",1
I was miserable waking up to this class. He taught from the textbook and still didn't explain things well. I had to learn everything myself and barely get the points to get an A. His HW and class work never resembled the test. He yelled at many students including me numerous times just for asking a simple question or being courteous. He is rude af.,0
actually a hindrance to grad students trying to do research,0
"Tom is a great person. As a teacher, you need to be ready to read and discuss, read and discuss. You might as well write down every word he says. Don't be afraid to ask questions--if you've read the material. If you're an idiot, he'll let you know it. Overall, I liked his class and the topics, though. But this isn't your average course.",1
"I Totaly agree with other comments below. Great guy, BUT can't teach. Make you look like stupid when you ask question. Wont grade HomwWorks.",0
"Speaks loudly and clearly, and is decent at conveying the material. However, he is unorganized, so the lab time tended to be done ad-hoc. But, this gives you tons of time to ask him questions if you're unsure of something. Also, despite assigning homework frequently, he only collected it as a large bundle twice, so you didn't get timely feedback.",1
"This teacher incredibly evil. I took this guy based upon what I read from the other comments and it led me to a lot of pain. Hard tests, and doesn't know how to teach well. HUGE EGO PROBLEM!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. I HAVE TO RETAKE CALC B/C OF HIM!!!",0
"SHE IS THE WORST TEACHER EVER. SOOOOO much stress that she has caused me in just one month and i'm not even halfway done with the course yet. Her assignments are like life or death, i feel like i'm dying until i finish them. She doesn't direct you at all and the little directions she gives are so confusing that only she understands. don't do it!",0
"Professor Wheeler makes lecture enjoyable and interesting. I believe the class is way too hard for a 100 level so if you are looking for an easy GenEd, this isn't the one for you. A ton of reading outside of class. Befriend your TA for sure.",0
"Probably not my favorite class but it was an easy A if you do your work on time & cite your sources properly. If you like to read and write, then take this class. However, if you don't like reading about art and history, its not your best option. I wouldn't take this class again because its too much work for an easy subject. Test are from the book.",0
"203 is a difficult class, dr engelkes kaltura system is genius so I didnt have to read the text book. It really is what you make of it. The program is tough you have to put in work. She has helped me even after I graduated her class.",1
"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",0
"Although he doesn't use lecture slides, you remember everything he says - still take notes. He is a story teller in nature, and very brilliant. Although he may seem scary, if you go to his office hours, you can learn to appreciate his humor. He is one of the best professors at Guelph. As long as you go to class, you'll get an excellent mark.",1
"Professor Maynard is a pretty dry as a professor. She is not very flexible with assignments, projects etc. She knows what shes talking about but cannot easily relate to students. Lots of reading. No textbook since its online.",0
"Lectures are always BORING. Learned almost nothing from her specifically, but other professors teaching the class were helpful. She speaks slow but it doesn't help at all. There's just too much information. Definitely read the book and all the suggested readings and you should be fine. I would try to avoid taking any of her classes though.",0
"While he can be very stern, he is fair. He gives students the opportunity to earn majority of the credit through showing work (even if incorrect answer). Earn his respect through your grades and/or effort and you'll be fine. Long tests but questions are just variations of previous quiz questions(that you can take home) so no reason not to pass.",1
"Man, his class was disappointing. He engaged the class pretty well at the beginning but lost it half way through. After the midterm, lectured continued but there wasn't a final exam... so his lectures were quite pointless. On the bright side, the work load was EASY for a 3rd year class, fewf.. He's not on blackboard, didn't like that. I would avoid",1
she's the worse,0
"Absolutely incredible professor. She is so well-versed in psych and neuro, and offers her class a wealth of freedom. On labs, we don't get points off for the ""wrong"" data if the lab is done properly and we explain the data/why it is wrong. She also tells exactly what to study for exams, and the questions are straightforward.",1
Wingender doesn't mess around. He will be direct and to the point. He will clearly tell you what is on the test throughout his lectures. He even gives out a practice test which is helpful. I would highly recommend taking his class. Very interesting and applicable.,1
"Bruh, dark souls but no bonfires. Doesn't try to change the direction of the class to help the students but rather just to get on and get paid. Try to avoid at all cost.",0
TAKE THIS CLASS. Accounting can be a very hard subject but he makes it easy. Go to class and do the study guide he gives you before the test and you will make an A.,1
Mary is an amazing instuctor. She is very helpful and has fun and unique learning games. I highly recommend Mary.,1
"Lectures were super boring. In the beginning of the semester, I went to every class, but once we started going over the parts of a computer, I didn't bother. Definitely show up to the lectures about Excel and Access though. The homework and exams are all open-notes. Just search up the questions and you'll find the answers.",0
Dr. Meehan is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. I took History and Systems with her and she makes it extremely easy to do well as long as you carry your weight. She is understanding and if you are having a problem you just need to talk to her and she will help you. She makes it easy to pay attention and provides everything you need.,1
"he sucks attendance wise, he marks you absent if youre a few mins late and he makes you get some textbooks & you NEED to bring it to class bc if not hes considers it as an unprepared & literally says youre basically useless so he marks you absent for that too. i dont recommend him drop the class or change teacher if you can!!!!",0
"Criminal justice professor that lectures more about politics. Very irritating. Guy rambles about how bad trump is, which whatever thats fine, but don't do it in class when I pay large amount of money to attend school here.",0
"He's a nice guy. Seems like he has seen his fair share of the world. Rambles a lot about random things, like pink armadillos and manatees mating.  Good professor? Not really. Easy A. Bring something to do. Will go over time every class period and will not care.",0
I'll honestly never take a class with this professor again. She is rude and if you ever correct her so other students don't get behind from the mistake... she gets super hateful. And if you opt out of training sessions (even when she says that's ok) she will ridicule you because you didn't go if you get one thing wrong. The work load wasn't bad tho,0
"The class mainly consisted of short quizzes and our end of semester project. She is a very hard grader and she takes points off for small mistakes. There wasn't a lot of teaching that was done. Mainly just PowerPoint notes that you do on your own. However, if you do your work and study you should get an A.",0
"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Makes you buy his textbook that he wrote, cash only, and it's FULL of errors . Always late to class, disorganized, and wastes most lectures. He can't solve many of his own examples during class--totally incompetent! Doesn't know what he's doing and utterly atrocious at teaching. Gets angry/yells in class if you ask questions.",0
"Do NOT take any class with him! He may know his stuff, but he does NOT prepare students well enough for his exams. His exams do not at all reflect what he teaches, and he tries to be extra hard and trick you it seems. He will answer questions, but can be rude if you don't understand. I've had to teach myself everything from this class. -10/10!",0
"Sñr. Newall is nice and takes time to go over grammar in class. He's really straightforward about what to expect on exams. His class was my first Spanish class in college- I feel like I got more out of a high school class than I did this past semester, but he's new to USC and he did what he could with the SPAN 210 curriculum. I'd take him again.",1
This professor wants you to know how to do each writing assignment that she gives to you. I thought we are suppose to learn not come into the class having a background in writing. Even though I am a wonderful writer she still found ways to be very critical of everything I turned in.I would not recommend her class please do not take her.,0
"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading. The study guide that is provided is no help. Whoever is a history major please avoid taking this class. This isnt high school where you can't use the bathroom either during lectures. NO",0
Really enjoyable class. He always makes jokes and keeps you engaged. The class itself was a bit dry but he does a really good job making the best of it . 10/10 recommend,1
"He is an extremely tough grader (looking for specific wording in exams). He also talks about being available for help anytime outside of class, but when you ask him questions or try to reach out he is either dismissive/passive aggressive or never replies (email). I am currently teaching myself with the textbook. Take this class with someone else!",0
a,0
Stay away! She is useless!,0
"Professor Fleshman is not necessarily ""hard"". But he can make it hard in some ways. He is soft spoken and hard to understand at times. Will mess up while giving notes to the class and have to correct himself, throwing the whole class off. Consistently late grading the tests which make it hard to monitor your grade. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Straight forward guy. Tells you what you need to do to do well in the class. Pretty much just graded on the lab work. The labs are pretty simple but still tedious, I'd suggest to make a groupchat for this class to help with labs. Definitely recommend to freshman.",1
One of the best professor ever.  Very knowledgeable about various topics and enthusatic about what he teaches.  What a hottie!,1
"Mary is the best teacher! math also isnt my strongest subject, but she made it so easy and enjoyable. i would definitely take another class with her again!",1
Good guy. Not a good GenEd teacher. Most of our meetings are 20 minutes of him ranting about unclear directions and hammering on the same points and the remaining 30 is a lecture that gets cut short and is filled with conjecture. The workload is unreal for a gened and the projects have strict guidelines/prompts yet are impossible to find on canvas.,0
"Professor Donato gives great lectures and knows how to make politics and functions of government more interesting by being controversial in a good way. However, there are about 6-7 major assignments/assessments for the whole semester and they are very difficult. I spent over 10 hours on both of his take-home exams and every paper was excruciating.",1
One of the best profs you will ever have! She is very very good at explaining the lectures. So organized and helpful!,1
I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR :) HE IS THE BEST && FUNNY !! TAKE HIM !,1
WORSTTTTTTTTTTTTT              DO NOT TAKE HIMMMMMMM,0
"Her test are HARD!  I made 100 on ALL of her assignments, which are a breeze, but the test are crazy hard!  And if you take the online class be prepared to have to come in for EVERY test...kinda misses the point of online classes!",0
I am in utter shock and dismay after the horrific events that occurred from January-March 2019. This class was absolutely horrendous. Where do I even start? She gives TONS of homework every single week. She even assigns it right after TESTS! Her tests are always the MAXIMUM level of difficulty. Please please please avoid this class if youwanttoLIVE,0
Mr.K was great! I truly enjoyed his classes and stories..,1
"Charles Waugh thinks extremely highly of himself, and if you dont meet his specific idea of what good writing is, you wont do well in the class. I dont mind harsh gradersits part of school. What I DO mind is being graded on whether the story matches his idea of good or not. 10/10 do not recommend",0
"One of the finest professors Ive had in my academic career. Teaches real world work, inspires students to learn, help student to understand whats out there in IT world when you eventually leave college. Never missed a class even though the attendance was optional but he made the fun so great with great lectures and his knowledge!",1
"This class was a struggle for me. Be prepared for a lot of homework (20 hours a week) and lot's of quizzes. Professor Flahaven knows a lot about what's she's talking about but it can be hard to get help or her to share her knowledge. While I think she is a good person, I would never want to take a class from her again.",0
"I would not recommend Char to any BIO 120 student. She does not explain the labs well and you are left to figure it out amongst yourselves. Not approachable. SUPER tough grader on graphs and reports. She does not respond to emails, if she does, they are confusing and/or one-worded. Search for another lab professor!",0
"He is a very nice guy, and as long as you make an effort to participate in class and try on the tests, he is a pretty liberal grader. However, he is not necessarily the best teacher. Honestly, the only reason I have an A is because of the SI sessions. So if you take him, I highly recommend making time for the SI. Also, he does have a heavy accent.",1
"Dr. Almaguer has been one of the hardest professors to work with. She does not sympathize with students AT ALL, and is extremely strict with assignments. Her assignments deadlines, class requirements are definitely not an advocate for student success. This class doesn't give you enough time to learn and enjoy the subject. I recommended another prof",0
"Took this class online from out of state.  EXCELLENT communication; emails promptly answered; heavy use of multimedia-  GREAT COURSE.  I thought it was going to be another plug-and-chug online course: boy, was I wrong!!!",1
"She is definitely one of my favorite english teachers. If you do the work, you are guaranteed to pass, and if you put in some effort, you'll end up with an amazing grade. She is always available to help and truly cares about your success.",1
"I believe he's working on something about Joseph Smith and/or Mormons. Lectures are interesting, more you contribute to book discussions, more you get out of the class",1
Mrs.Pittman is overall awesome! The content of her classes in hard but she makes it interesting with out of class events like church visits and such. She always works with students as far as completing missed work and for the midterm and final you will have all the answers!,1
"LW I is required for the first semester of 1L. This might suggest that LWI is a difficult course because we are not used to legal writing before coming to law school. This prof. is a nice person and is willing to help. But, if you want to earn a passing grade, you should use some supplements.",0
He is not very nice very insulting and makes rude comments,0
"talks extremely fast, and won't slow down. Lab quizzes every lab day, based on previous lab. 5 exams on top of the final. Best advice if you get her- study everything, read her lectures and slides before class. Take notes off those and not her verbal lecture. She plagiarizes all her tests so Google helps. Not an easy class by any means.",0
This professor was not helpful at all. Students would have questions but she would never fully answer them. She would not give me the grade I deserved after writing good feedback on my papers. Class time was a complete waste of time. I did not learn anything. I would not recommend for anyone.,0
"Ok so as a person, Kelli is great. As a teacher, she sucks. Meandering lectures, literally NO feedback till the last possible second, and she grades everything at the end of the semester when it's too late to change or help your grade. She's also not super reachable, often if you message her on Slack she'll ignore it till you @ her.",0
"She is one of the worst professors I've had. First of all you have to listen closely to what she is saying because of her accent, and she HATES when you ask questions. Has a very dry personality and can be very rude and not understanding. She gives extremely hard and confusing tests or quizzes. If you aren't good at this subject don't get her!!",0
"Great teacher. I recommend you take her if you don't take politics too seriously. Unfortunately for me, she was a little to obviously leftward leaning in her personal bias. Preference isn't usually an issue as many are liberal at BBC, but the class was critical thinking and she did little to incite any critical thinking to a mostly lib class.",1
"He is such a nice guy honestly really is, but his tests are difficult. Very difficult. I don't know if it is because it is in the split format but we only have 50 minutes to take the test and i feel so rushed.",1
"Do not take her ONLINE class. I was expecting her to be teaching the class. It turns out she uses lecture videos from Prof. Crandall, so in reality Prof. Crandall is teach you the class not her! Furthermore she uses the Lockdown Browser for the main exams for integrity. Give credit where credit is due!",0
One of the best professors you can ever imagine of.,1
Professor Shine is the best professor I have ever taken. He is what every professor should model themselves after. He is an exceptional human being who strives for nothing but growth in his students.,1
"Not a bad professor, grade comes from 4 tests. Attendance is not mandatory but it will help you pass the class to listen to his lectures. There was a textbook to read, and the tests had a few questions from the textbook",1
"Super easy to understand whats going on in lecture. Literally just skim the readings, go to lecture and you will do fine",1
"As a teacher he will get an F. He does not motivate students to learn more, he does not how to teach, and he uses an obsolete system. Not a great teacher.",0
"I am usually pretty decent at math, but this class was really difficult for me to do well in because she does not cover a lot of material during lectures, she talks a lot about the theorems rather than the actual lesson. My TA was not very helpful either, I had to get an outside tutor. ",0
"Very laid-back professor with so much knowledge to offer to the class. His level of experience is impressing and helps keep the class interesting. Take him, he's very generous with extra credit and his tests and quizzes are easy! PLEASE teach Research Methods and Senior Sem!!",1
"If you do not like writing papers do not take this class. His finals consists of hand written essays on multiple topics, as well as a case study and a large practical. I personally did not enjoy his class but I know others who did. He makes his lectures fun and keeps them lively but this class was very tough learn so much in a short period of time",0
"One of the easiest classes of the 2017 spring semester. I did not even touch my textbook, do not buy one. pretty easy going guy, he does all the assignments for you in class and you just have copy what he does. The only hard thing you do all year is code a website but there are plenty of sources to help you and that became very easy.",1
"I really love Prof Reisinger. This class (Voices in Global Health) was not great, but Prof Reisinger did her best to make it better. I strongly recommend open communication with her, because she is willing to meet outside of class and give clear feedback, but you have to seek it out.",1
Don't take this class online with this professor. The Prof doesn't teach! She simple assigns chapter homework and discussion board postings without any lecture to explain concepts. You basically learn on your own and pay to have someone grade assignments. Worse professor I've ever had!!!!!,0
"By far the worst teacher I've ever had. His accent is hard to understand, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. He doesn't answer questions clearly and most of his lectures are just rambling nonsense. Tests are terribly written and he doesn't prepare you for them at all.  DO NOT TAKE!!!",0
"very rude teacher, i would never taker again. He was rude and mean to students if they didn't understand the material. There is A LOT of math work involved so be prepared.  There quizzes and the study guides he makes do not at all help one bit.",0
"He does not go over prelab, he leaves the stuff on the counter tells you to read the manual with no direction. We weren't provided with the materials the lab manual states to use. When asked for help he just says ""read it"" repeatedly. Lectures are insufficient and criteria for what he wants is unclear. He had to curve his class very hard. Be warned",0
"she,s rude and loves a conflict, stay away",0
"I found this class so interesting. It's definitely not for everybody, but the information discussed was stuff I had never even thought about, before. It's a lot of reading, but interesting reading. Professor Aizura is funny and definitely does his best to make his lectures interesting. 1 paper, 6 reflections, a group project, and a final exam.",1
"Professor Kaur is by far the worst professor I have had at William Paterson. All of my peers this past semester had a great English professor but I got stuck with Kaur. I got a B for the semester but I got all A's in the essays. All assignments are essays and her grading is horrible. Not an easy class or an easy person to deal with, trust me.",0
"Great prof. He's very clear and fun, so class goes by very quickly. He also helps foster good classroom dynamic. ",1
"I dont know why she has a high rating but please avoid taking her. She gives 5-6 lecture videos a week, with a quiz and discussion post + current events. Her grading scale is weird and she grades WAY too hard for an intro class.",0
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
"I just finished my final for her class, and despite the whole moving to online classes due to COVID-19, she was seamless in her teaching. She always posted videos and provided feedback for our discussion posts. She really simplified the class during quarantine, so it took a lot of stress off. I really recommend her. For both online and on campus.",1
"He's funny.. that's about all the positives I can give. He goes on and on about a subject and then says ""But that won't be on the test"", so basically he wastes like 20 minutes on a single subject that won't even be on the test. His lectures are sloppy and unorganized, and if you ask a question he probably won't understand what you're asking.",0
"Dr. Veve is a good professor, he truly wants all his students to succeed in his class. Reading the textbook does help, but I made an A without ever reading. The powerpoints and homework are a huge help and a lot of his test questions are pulled from the two. He only grades you on 3 exams, homework/attendance, and the final.",1
"She is a very nice lady, but I do not enjoy her as a teacher. Sometimes it feels like the students asking her for more is a chore for her. She also feels somewhat judgmental over our abilities, even though everyone is struggling meaning that we need more help. She is a nice person but her teaching style isnt very universal for all learning styles.",0
Mr. Blake is a very caring and helpful professor. He is more than willing to take the time to help you with school work and is also good to talk to if you have trouble with any life problem. Mr. Blake is awesome!,1
Professor Grenache is amazing! She really cares about her students and their success! As long as you do the work and actually care about succeeding you will pass her class.,1
"He's very nice but his class is lecture heavy. His interest is in entomology, and this was a beginner biology class. His exams are pretty easy as long as you study and use the study guides that he posts. He assigns readings for lectures, but I never actually read, but I'm sure it would help your grade if you did.",1
"My biggest mistake was not doing the homework, and Ito be honest, I did not really pay attention to the class.  Here's what you wanna know - She gives homework and it isn't online. - She is a tough grader. You might end up with having 89% - Extra credit affects maybe 1-2% of your grade - She does not drop your lowest grade.",1
"I can't speak on her other classes as this is the only one I've taken from her, but she provided a fun and fair experience for CMST 102. I really enjoyed her class for the most part; the in-class writings were a little annoying but pretty doable. You can get by not reading that much. Last class I took before going to UW and it was well worth it.",1
"Mr. Ortiz is a decent guy, his corny jokes will eventually start to grow on you but avoid at all cost! He expects you to know the information and goes very fast.  He doesn't explain this information in a helpful way. No curved grades and no answer sheet for the review. I wish I would've listened to these reviews.",0
"Ms. Pate is AWESOME!! She is a tough grader, by she gave vets great feedback! Show up to class, her class is fun! She is very understanding and she is a very visual teacher. I love her!!",1
Very nice!! Was funny and quirky! Didnt have to go to class which rocked but it was still fun to go to it !,1
A lot of reading but worth it the material is very thoughtfully chosen and thoroughly discussed in class. The professor is very sweet and funny.,1
"I took CHDEV 10 over the summer with Connie Hunt, and it was the best decision I could of made. She is funny and caring teacher, and knows what she is talking about. Just make sure you do the homework/projects and come to class.",1
"Danielle Miller is really passionate about her class. I learned a lot and my writing has definitely improved. If you want to learn and not just pay for a class, but actually get your money's worth, then this is a great class. However, this class is not easy.",1
Due to the online only format he was thoughtful in allowing multiple attempts at quizzes and homework. It was a great option some sections were harder than others.,1
Racist towards asians. Ruining people's dream.,0
"She made computer hacking boring.  She has no idea how to teach, nor does she herself understand the course material.  She made this so awful I have decided to change direction and avoid the reset of the LAN classes",0
"I am shocked that this individual has a PhD.  She is completely unprofessional, lacks people skills, and struggles with basic grammar and spelling.  Her emails are riddled with errors.  The word I should always be capitalized, elementary 101.  I would not recommend her.  She would benefit greatly from individual counseling.",0
She goes out of her way to prevent you from reaching your full potential. She is arrogant and laughs at students who are trying their best but may just need some guidance. She expects you to be a professional researcher like her. Avoid her if possible.,0
"Super fun and engaging class. Discussions and participation count toward the grade, but they are casual chats/thoughts. Funny, caring, and engaging teacher, but specific when it comes to listening and participating. Take notes based on the material he talks about because it is needed for the two-three tests given. Easy A kind of class.",1
One of the worst teachers I've ever taken. Too many assignments for an online class. Too many small things you had to complete in order to get your real work done. Too many things due at once. Too many things due back to back. She was really rude when you did reach out to her. She just didn't care.,0
"An excellent prof who truly cares about his students. ""Abdu"" has clear grading criteria. I would DEFINITELY recommend this amazing prof.",1
"This class was absolutely the most tedious class I have ever taken.  Everything had to be perfect, and he was not very helpful. He answers questions with a question. (student)""Dr. Walsh, is this the right chemical formula to use?""...(Dr. Walsh)""I don't know, is it?""  If would highly advise a different professor if you possibly could.",0
"She was like a guide introducing us to this brand new world that you can tell she was passionate about. Was the class hard? Yes! However, its better to learn from someone with her knowledge about the ocean than just out of a textbook. Do not miss the field trips. Theyre incredible!",1
Hard Class like reallllly hard. Mrs. Sharon is a respectable teacher. yes you have to work for it but she will help you along the way. ,1
"He's a very nice guy, but I like him better as a person than a professor. He jokes around a lot, sometimes way too much. Isn't really helpful, because he's very opinionated. He'll tell you how he feels,so be prepared for his criticism. Barely any work in class, no work out of class. I would take him again just because it was an easy A.",0
Ok she is a tough teacher but unless you are one of her favorites and she does have favorites you will not get any positive feedback from her. She will knit pick you to the point that you can get a note out of you. She'll make you so mad that you'll want to punch her. She can be extremely disrepctful to you infront of everyone!Take someone else.,0
"Great professor! Lectures were very clear and she even records them too. Her exams were very difficult but if you study the textbook well and attend lectures you should be fine. You get what you worked for. Overall, amazing course !",1
I agree with the few previous responses. There is absolutely no learning of Nutrition in this class. It's actually Advanced Biochemistry. A is possible with memorization word for word of his little book.,0
"This professor is by far the worst human I have come across in my 19 years on this planet. She has no teaching ability and I am fairly certain I learn more in my sleep than I do in her lectures. She docks marks for memorizing the information because she wants you to ""think deeper."" Justifies giving marks like 5.332. Please UBC, find a new professor",0
"Offered upwards of 6% Ex Cr. 7 Homeworks 23%. 4 Exams (65%) Most curved. Easy class as far as getting the points, he gives you huge study guides for the tests. The bad part is even if you're interested in Astronomy he's so monotone and non-interactive with the class that most people are falling asleep. Really unfortunate if you like this stuff.",1
"Very rude professor. Her notes were confusing and did not go along with lab. She would roll her eyes and give attitude if asked a question. Slapped the back of my chair because I asked someone for a pencil. She wasnt even lecturing, she was just walking around while we were getting supplies. I recommend not taking her ever.",0
"Pete is awesome. This class is a lot of fun and extremely interesting. I think it is rare you would ever be able to discuss and study such explicit material in a classroom setting. This material, nonetheless, is so fascinating and very engaging. A must take class here at Duke!",1
"For the most part I really enjoyed this class. I felt that it was eye opening, challenging, and intriguing. Cox is very educated about her field and wont let you forget it. A bit critical but kind most of the time.",1
Honestly I think I would rather watch paint dry then listen to this profs lectures. Workload heavy even though it is a required course and half the students do not want to be there.,0
"Dr. Lim is a very nice guy, but a very mediocre professor. He never derived a problem from scratch for us and instead just scrolled through his notes which looked like alphabet soup. We all had to teach ourselves by doing the homework and reading the notes. Many grades were saved because he leaked the final while we took it, invalidating it.",0
"At first he replied to the emails fast, then the last time I sent him an email, he didn't reply, which cost me a grade. I don't know what to say about him, but I would never take him again.",0
"Leonard is wilin' at all times. Beware of the first essay exam. He's a tough grader with that. Seriously, though, just show up to class and do the homework. Raise your hand. He might cop a 'tude with you, just ignore it. He's a sassy little guy. He will say no wrong answers, but let me tell you, there are for him. Take the class, though.",1
"Mandatory reading every week - approx. 100 pages. Multiple choice midterm, 8-10 page near the end of the quarter, and a relatively difficult in-class essay final. During lecture, Prof. Perez stated that his class was NOT going to be an easy class at all. Thank god I ""S/NC"" this class.. If you're looking for an easy ""A"", look elsewhere",0
SHe was great and helpful. I have a career now!,1
"Dr. Hahn is a lovely person, but a difficult professor. She is very enthusiastic, but she moves fast and often doesn't explain things thoroughly. You will have to put in a LOT of work and energy outside of class if you want to do well.",1
ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST.  KNOWS THE WORLD OF ARCH VERY WELL.  KNOWS DESIGN.  NICEST GUY EVER.  WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO HELP THE STUDENT LEARN.  PROBABLY THE BEST AT CAP.  CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF HOW THIS GUY HELPS YOU IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM...,1
I liked his lectures and that's about it.  Jeans were too tight.  :(,0
"Don't take this guy. He doesn't care about teaching and he'll basically blow through class with his powerpoint. He asks hard questions in class and doesn't give you time to read the question. He does the problems correctly so write everything down and learn it later, at least that's how I did. midterms aren't bad, but try to not take this guy",0
She seems to grade our weekly study guides purely based on how well we cite our sources directly related to her grading rubric that exists only in her head and has no rhyme or reason,0
"Ms. Battista is not a fair grader. The online quizzes constitute a large portion of your grade; however, they are on material that is not covered or provided. Essentially, you are walking into the dark with no preparation or access to information, while being graded. The only way to do well on these quizzes is through luck.",0
My entire class LOVES Janey. She will make you very interested in the language as well as the country. You need to attend class daily or you will fall behind very easily.,1
Completely does not teach. Unless you have teaching assistant you must teach yourself. head in the clouds. Makes things more complicated that needs to be. Very nice though.,0
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
"The class is made of quizzes, forums, assignments, a paper, exams, and a group project. It may seem like a lot, but its very manageable. Theres usually only two assignments a week, and he gives a lot of time to start projects before the due date. A lot of the information is online and dont even need to read. Easy A imo",1
"Professor Kavanaugh is a good prof. She is very willing to answer questions, even if they don't exactly pertain to what the lesson is about. She is very knowledgeable and happy to talk to us about externships and other opportunities. She also educated us about continuing education which was a good thing to know, even as a soon to be new grad nurse.",1
Dont be fooled by the fake charm. Mean in her core.,0
Micro eco is an easy class overall. But Baruch likes to take an easy class and inject it full of algebra and equations. How many times do I have to calculate the area of a triangle? They shouldn't even teach the concepts just do the math. I feel like I got no applicable knowledge from this class. Idk how students avg 55 on exams.,1
"She does not give any feedback after homework and tests. This is an online class and without feedbacks, you cannot easily do corrections and prepare for exams. She does not care about what situation you are in (COVID) and she will gladly give you an F and when you ask for corrections she wouldn't give them to you because she is too lazy to do them.",0
"About 45% of a math final made up of impossible T or F. Comes to class with no preparation. Most of the time students finish the problem for him. Never explains any terminology, yet expects us to know it for the exams. Likes to put on tricky problems. Won't take the time to answer questions. Kinda cocky in the British way. I def wouldn't recommend.",0
"Never replied emails!! The feedback he gave me in the extended outline is ""plz insert page number"" and then gave me a 65%. excuse me?? Then another feedback said, ""your final results are different with the results in previous work you submitted, plz explain."" Why? because I found I was wrong in the previous one and now I wanna correct it! Can't I?",0
"Very easy class. By far the easiest multiple-choice I've ever had in college and all of the essay questions are given well in advance. Questions come straight from his notes, but reading the book is nice for a better understanding of material. He get's off topic rather often, but has some interesting stories to tell once in a while. ",1
"I'm in Dr. Thomas med surgepharm class. It seems like she would rather teach her students how to fail, then about nursing. I feel like her whole teaching method is based on telling you how much she knows, and how little you know. If you want to know what it feels like to put all you have into a class, and barely pass take one of her courses!",0
"Daigle grades on a very high curve, probably because everyone would fail the tests if he didn't. Tests are really long, especially for a 50 minute class period. He is SO boring and I can't even stand to take notes. Hard to study for tests, and there are only 3. Very unclear and hard to follow his lectures. Good luck if you take him...",0
"Not concise- takes several different tries to get one thought across. Talks way too much. Be afraid getting caught in a conversation, it'll go on for way too long. Cares a lot but not a good teacher.",0
As long as you show up to class you will pass. When you are given study guides complete the because 9 times out of 10 it is going to be the same exact questions as the ones on the test. ,1
"This semester has been rough, it is all online and he has not been good at teaching or helping students. There are lectures he puts up, but if you do not understand it, he will not help you. Also, the final is FORTY PERCENT of your grade. Definitely would not take him again.",0
She is one of the most inappropriate and careless professors I have ever met. She is careless and doesnt care about her students. Take take her classes,0
"she is one of the worst professors ever!! she explains well but her class is boring and the exams are hard and she likes to write essays on her exams questions to give you points She didnt post any grades, and we couldnt figure ourselves. you going to waste your time on artificials without know what is your grads DO NOT TAKE HER",0
"Extremely hard. Very Little help. He is just so smart on his own, I think he has trouble bring himself down on a undergrad level. Nice guy,just hard prof",0
Very opinionated and this has a major impact on your grades for each assignment/pop quiz.,0
"I wouldn't recommend his class to students who like to ask questions. You can tell he cares about minute details which is irritating when you are completely lost. He cracks jokes and sure, they help time go by but it doesn't help you learn. If you have the option choose a different professor",0
"I had a rough experience in 101 and 105 during my freshman year, so I wasn't looking forward to taking this class.  It turns out that this class was my favorite this semester!  Mr. Martin, is knowledgeable and cares about his students.  His classes are fun, and he is a great guy.  I recommend him to everyone!",1
75% of the semester was her having us get in groups and Google the answers to topics ourselves. She doesn't use PowerPoint and talks way to fast and quietly. Hard to follow her and shows up late a lot but takes attendance.,0
"Mrs v cares if you understand the material. If you ask a question, she will make sure you understand by coming back to you to ask you questions. Gives lots of extra credit opportunities. Bottom line, go to class, take notes, do the homework, partipate in class and you will pass. As long as you do your part",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Do the work, and you'll be rewarded.  Use your brain, you'll be rewarded further.  He doesn't have time for those who slack off, and will tell you so. Great preparation for actual employment as a legal researcher.  Wish I had more classes I could take from him.",1
"Literally worst professor I've ever had. She is rude to students, doesn't helped when needed and her tests are ridiculously hard. Especially for a class that is required for a lot of majors. Never take her.",0
Nice guy.  Extremely helpful.,1
"This dude is amazing. Honestly, get ready to learn, get ready to participate, but get ready for it to be interesting. This dude talks about real world issues and relates them to the material. He makes sure his class doesn't stress you out, and he does a good job of it.",1
"She treats the class like elementary schoolers. If anyone says two words, she stops and says ""is my teaching interrupting your conversation?""  Doesn't give a lot of guidelines for the paper.It's just ""Write a critique about whatever you want:a book,a movie,a magazine,a restaurant,a video game, etc."" She is aslo nit-picky about punctuation on papers",0
This teacher is AWESOME. Easy speeches that are only like 3 minutes long. He is very passionate about his classes. I only had him for half of the semester but he is a great teacher from my experience.,1
Sondra Ricar in my opinion is not an excellent instructor because she has negative opinions about students and quite frankly she doesn't try to help students succeed in the course and if you do something wrong when you know you didn't she accuses you rightaway and is a terrible judge of character.,0
"Attendance is not graded but he only posts the slide from lecture, most of which have a few words on them. If you don't go to lecture you will never know what is going on. He does include pictures on all of his exams that you have to identify from the lecture slides as well.",1
"Only covers the surface level of topics while lecturing so youre going to be doing a lot of learning on your own. Also grades the study guide as a test, but doesnt grade it until after the test which defeats the purpose of the study guide.",0
"Professor Lipson is obviously a very knowledgeable person, but his soothing voice and his tangential lecture style makes it hard for me to stay engaged in the class. Ive learnt a lot from this professor from the first half of the semester, but as the semester progressed I felt he was pushing many claims without a strong base of evidence.",0
I believe Mr. Walters wants his students to understand the subject however I found myself trying to understand the expectation of an assignment taxing and never enjoyed learning the material. It was frustrating to spend a considerable amount of time to follow assignment guidelines only to be docked points based on an unwritten/unspoken expectation.,0
"Heavy workload. I've always loved my Spanish Professors, but she was something else. Very difficult to communicate with, very harsh grader, very abrasive. I didn't feel like language learning was the priority; pure academics was. New languages are difficult and unless you have an excellent knowledge of the Spanish Language, be cautious.",0
Excellent teacher. Well organized. Great literary selections. Fun projects. Just show up and act interested in class and you will do great. He provides lots of time during class to work on assignments. He loves English and wants student to do well. Great teacher.,1
"Don't recommend. Since it is a one credit class, it contains too much reading and there is a Final. Besides, the Lecture is too long that it lasts  for about 3 hours, and on SUNDAY!",0
He's literally the best professor I've had. Lectures are super informative and going to class is a must because he has a very specific teaching style. You definitely have to work for your grade but he really wants to see people succeed and has a lot of practice problems and review you can do before your exams.,1
Travis is an easy going guy. He loves to teach and it shows. Attendance is mandatory but homework can be turned in all the way up to the last day of class. He gives a study guide that is almost identical to the test. (Ex: y4x on sample and y6x on actual test). Definitely take if you can. LOVE HIM.,1
"Professor never lectured, just posted videos. His exams were nothing like the homework, it was as if the professor was trying to trick the students rather than test their knowledge. Worst professor I've had at OU so far, he just didn't seem to care about his students at all.",0
If you care about your GPA and your mental health do not take his class. he is very rude and random with his attendance by asking a random question to a random person out of the blue. Only grade is midterm and final. Speaks in a low monotone voice and just rambles for three hours  & doesn't cover the material he expects you to know to test over.,0
she is the worst teacher I have ever had I hated her class and dreaded going to it. she is boring and is just ughhhh. DO NOT TAKE HER. avoid her at all costs,0
"Fun Professor. Has lots of knowledge in the energy area. Use the clicker to check attendance only i.e. doesn't matter if you answer the question right. 80% gives full attendance credit. Tests are easy, just put his PPT on your cheatsheet. Unlimited attempts for homework. A no-brainer for Natural Science credit!",1
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
"Luallen is great. Like the other comments say, he is really tough.  Probably the hardest micro section at Tufts. That said, I have also learned more in his class than I have anywhere else. If you are a serious major, take it with him. If you are a minor/just thinking about econ, take it with someone else. (This is coming from someone who did well).",1
"I took archaeology out of a general interest for the field and prof. brown didnt disappoint, he does alot of full class lectures but keeps them interesting using physical as well as digital examples and honestly I never fell asleep in his class so they must've been interesting lectures. I would definitely take another ANT class again and recommend.",1
Amazing professor! Makes it clear that he doesn't want his students worrying about grades and that this school focuses too much on them. He just wants you to understand and do the readings which are very interesting. TAKE HIM!,1
"Excellent professor! Dedicated to your education, wants you to LEARN & understand, not just memorize concepts. Very basic econ. Minimal book use. Flashcards highly recommended.",1
"Hard to believe she is still at UBC and teaching! I have nothing good to say about this instructor. She is late all the time, confused with work expectations, disorganized, never hands back assignments. I know that she is not a native French speaker, but sometimes it's really hard to understand her French. Never ever!",0
"Great professor! You need to attend every class if you intend on making an A and do his assigned readings. All test information will come from lecture so you need to make sure you take good notes and keep up with him. Not the easiest class, but one of professors you will ever get.",1
"Lectures disorganized, grades subjective, material not presented clearly. Tends to interrupt whenever someone is asking a question and doesn't wait to hear the whole question before answering. Way too many chapters assigned (10+ per test) for an exam with only 8 short answer questions.  Extremely nice guy, just not my kind of lecture style.",0
"This guy is freaking brilliant! He knows so much about just anything. We did poetry and short stories and he seemed like he knew all of them by heart. However, his grading is kind of iffy...he takes soooo long to grade and you cant even read his feedback of the papers. He gives about 5 papers throughout the semester and both a midterm and final.",1
"Really great professor, and is straight forward when it comes to tests and assignments. Must come to class or will miss out on assignments, when tests are due or test review days. If you pay attention to her lectures than will get a passing grade in class.",1
Keeps class interesting and remains unbiased. Easily my favorite class and professor that I have experienced. 10/10 would recommend,1
Worst professor for this class. Love the class material but she assigned way too much work for a gen ed class. Not to mention she basically completely ignored her students when classes became online.,0
"Maria is one of the better econ professors there is. She is good at teaching, explain and relating. He grading is also relatively easy. She is always ready to help. Also rmr that she is Greek and not Mexican/latino or indian. I recommend this teacher!",1
The professor is very good at explaining the concepts of Java and helps us understand the logic behind every code!,1
"Easy A as long as you show up or at least know what hes lecturing about. Sometimes hard to follow, he loves to talk- most of the time not about subject material",1
Outstanding intro to homeland security.  Comprehensive course material supported by a top professor who valued student input while providing outstanding feedback.  Good course but a brisk workload throughout the semester.  Professor was very flexible on due dates--he's very familiar with the real world.,1
"If you can help it, don't take her for an online course. She is very hard to get in touch with, especially via email. Grades were posted timely the first few weeks of class, then she just stopped giving feedback, posting grades, and responding to emails until the last day of class. It's hard to improve if you don't know how you're doing in class.",0
"Dr. Lee's class was an insane amount of work. Pre case quizzes, post case quizzes, case studies, reading quizzes, discussion posts, replies, and exams EVERY week. Meanwhile, my friends with other biochem profs barely had any work and got A's. Please avoid Dr. Lee's section--it's too much work when compared to other professors. Take someone else!",0
"b/c a 400 level seminar, material was hard but he knew that class was not experts and did not expext us to be interested in medieval lit and culture.  very fair grader, a little out there but if you just do the VERY FEW assignments and hand in last paper.  he's very laid back and understanding",1
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
"Disgustingly horrible professor that knows the class struggles. Didn't teach me a single thing about calculus; learned everything from self textbook use. You WILL struggle on exams which in theory ""reflect what you learn"", but will be so un-ordinary from class and webassign, that you'll spend alot of times in exams figuring out whats going on.",0
Loved it!  Some stuff was related to my field. Thinking of minoring in geology now!,1
He is so boring and will talk for the whole class time. Everyone falls asleep in his class.,0
"I took this online. His instructions in is syllabus were very clear. Weekly discussions, quizzes, essays, and gives extra credit. I was upset b/c I was 4 points away from an A!",1
"She is a wonderful teacher and spirit. It is SDV so most of it is common sense or just simple things to remember. Her class is def. not necessary to take any longer than 8 weeks. Overall I recommend her, she was very easy and simple. Also if class was an hour, she would be done way before the hour ended which I liked because she didn't waste time.",1
"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",0
Avoid at all costs...,0
"great humanities credits. she's a little scatter-brained, but always good for a laugh. the topic is really interesting, and she loves what she's teaching. you never use the book and tests are outlined on review sheets that you get during discussion. if you study and give even a little effort, you should do well.",1
"She gives you everything you need to be successful, it's up to you to take advantage of it. It's not a hard class at all as long as you put in the work. She posts example videos, has her lectures posted and has the schedule very well laid out. She's very organized which helped me immensely. Jump ahead of the coursework! You'll be glad you did.",1
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
"DO NOT RECOMMEND. She is an extremely tough grader. And is very nit-picky w/answers. Her powerpoints for the lectures are very confusing and didn't have a good flow throughout, they were very hard to follow and study. she gives quizzes every Thursday (worth 15 pt). she made us buy a mobile chem app (used only 12-15 times) and a HW website. AVOID.",0
"It would be a great class if she stuck to subjects like, I dont know, German. I dont pay my hard earned money to hear a language professor give her inane comments about the patriarchy and gender discrimination. Other than that the pedagogy is good. This being said, the other GERM instructors are also great so I recommend them to new students.",0
she makes differential equations harder than it needs to be. her grading is very strict with not a ton of partial credit. the tests are very difficult to finish in the 50 minutes she gives. when you ask her questions that arent in her notes she gets confused so it seems she doesnt fully understand the material,0
"I loved him! What we wrote about was fun and he was just hilarious! However, little things like not turning in papers, being late, and talking in class can sometimes set him off. Just be a good student and he will love you!",1
Dr. Strauch is great. Scary smart and super interesting. She taught the class from a Native American and African American perspective as well. She made great connections to larger social and political issues. Easy grader. Make sure you keep up with reading and participate in class- -that's really all she expects. 10/10 would recommend.,1
DO NOT TAKE. The PowerPoints she uses arent hers. Doesnt give you time to write down what is on the slide. Tells you you wont havent to memorize something for the test but then it will appear on the test. Has a thick accent so hard to understand if she does try to explain something,0
he was the worst. he would not bump me up 1 point to pass the class,0
"The material is interesting, but I would have taken it with someone else. His lectures and his notes are unclear and not very helpful. You won't understand anything unless you read the book before class. He thinks he's funny.",0
His exams are really hard no matter how much you study you still fail. Dreaded going to his class. He is nice but hard.,0
"I loved Mr. Marsh, these classes were very hard, a lot of studying and an amazing amount of homework, but these classes are hard in general. Marsh has been my favorite teacher so far in my 2 years at Clark, he is understanding, flexible and will help anyone. I had fun during labs, lectures are a bit tough, but it was very worth it in the end. ",1
Professor Walling was an amazing professor. He cares very deeply about his students and is willing to help them out when needed. Just be prepared for plenty of reading and a whole class lecture.,1
"Honestly I'm already taking my major classes and I just had to retake precal because I withdraw from the course my first time taking it. So in my opinion it was so hard to stay awake, I found it boring and useless but that mostly because I know I won't be utilizing what he's teaching.  He teaches the the very last second!",1
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken. He is a great guy, but the exams are borderline impossible no matter how much work you put into studying. The work he has us do and the exams are made so much harder than they have to be. This class is about to destroy my gpa because I didn't listen to the other reviews on here...",0
"She's super sweet. Her class is easy, just show up and memorize for the tests. She helps you and tells you exactly what to study for. She really loves art.",1
By farrrr my favorite Professor at FAU. She is extremely sweet and caring for her students. She actually checks and answers her canvas messages hella quick too . Attendance is not mandatory but for all three classes I've taken she gives extra credit quizzes that basically are the questions on the exam so if you want the best chance at an A show up!,1
"Everyone's goal in class was simply to survive, and you can, if you take a lot of practice tests, find a good TA (Esther Taxon was a God send) and don't worry about the readings. He gets into random, complicated details in class that are confusing and not on the exam. He's condescending in office hours so I would got to my TA's office hours instead",0
"By far the worst professor I ever had. HE is not organized, rude when a question is asked, hard tests.. you won't learn in his class, there are many other great professor teaching this course,",0
"Exams are very tough but his curve is awesome! Notes help you understand where formulas come from. However, for exams, make sure you write down the final form of the formulas in your cheat sheet. Knowing trig really helps especially for the first 2 exams. Overall, possible to do well if genuine effort is applied.",1
"Honestly disappointed since I thought this class would be greatI'm interested in the topic. However, for the vagueness of her teaching, her tests are extremely specific and trickily worded. I felt like she was trying to trick us the whole time I was taking her tests and it was really frustrating to know you studied your hardest but won't get an A.",0
"Prof. Drumond is crystal clear in his expectations, organized & made learning Spanish fun. Good for NON Span speakers to take. You WILL talk to others and do group work often in cls. Provides review sessions for his quizzes. Attendance IS taken. Avail after class for ?'s.  1 Oral presentation. Online hw. Book includes book for Span2. Excellent prof",1
Does anyone happen to know if Professor Abrams is still teaching here at Hofstra??? Did he retire or move to another school?,1
I absolutly love her. She is the easiest professor ever. It was an honor to be in her class.,1
Great Calc 2 professor!,1
"I took her class in Winter. She is a very good lecturer. Her note is very clear and easy to understand. I am in a pharmacy school now, and I remember what she taught us! Her class prepares me for pharmacy school!! I cannot thank you her enough. She is one of the best professor in CSULA. MUST TAKE and DO THE WORK and enjoy it!",1
"Ryan is incredibly unorganized during lectures and his quizzes/exams do not reflect his teachings or readings in class. Many mundane examples are used in class that blurs together; furthermore, he fails to identify and properly explain core class concepts. I highly recommend dropping any class with this man as the professor.",0
"She has made so may people i know cry and try to ruin their careers because she has a horrible habit of choosing who she likes and hates. She hates most girls. She has always been great to me, but when she treats my peers so poorly its hard to think she's genuine.",0
Not very nice to all students. Will disregard what your saying if she doesn't think it's important to finish what you're saying. Rushes through lectures with information overload. Doesn't allow laptops in discussion classes. Not flexible or lenient.,0
"Ms. Benton is a great professor. She is passionate about what what she does and is great at capturing your attention. The information she gave my class about public speaking is something that is very applicable to life. My only complaint is that she would be late to class on many occasions, but this did not hurt the flow of class.",1
She shouldn't be teaching. Has no patience at all. Extremely condecending and treats her students like middle schoolers. She gets upset when you ask a simple question. Does not work well with her students. Strict grader; takes points off stupid things. DONT TAKE HER!,0
"Absolutely wonderful professor.   Great listener, funny and really truly cares.  It does suck that this is his last semester at CMU though.",1
Bit of a grumpy man when interacting with students. Usually shows up a few minutes late and holds class over several minutes. Average at actually conveying information. Grade determined by 4 exams and a few quizzes.,0
"I am not sure why so many students like this teacher. Calling her nice is like calling a rabid dog friendly. She grades at a post graduate level, and is not very approachable. If you take her in conduct, you will have a different professor for the first semester than the second.  Maybe she changes over the holidays. Study 8 hours a week or take a C",0
Terrible - unless you like liberal socialists.  Blames America for Holocaust - the usual garbage.,1
"After every stupid quiz you take of hers, you hate her even more. I don't think she wants you to do well. She also talks too much. We have to go over an entire chapter by ourselves because we didn't get to it in class for a test. Avoid taking any of her classes",0
"It is very difficult to learn just from lectures. Does not allow electronics in class meaning , no laptop to take notes. Goes over slides too quickly and cannot finish taking notes. Uploads unit notes on the class before exams. If you're stuck with her class isn't mandatory. You will learn more from the book.",0
I loved her grad classes. She is very understanding with her students.,1
"Take this instructor! Worth the drive to whichever campus she's teaching at. Does not skip steps in the problem, explains everything, gives points for attendance, tests come straight from reviews. I love this instructor.",1
"What a happy dude, literally always has a smile on his face. This class isn't really a class. It's a workshop with some easy online work that can be done at your own pace. If you wanted to you could finish it all in a few weeks and never have to come to class again. Tests are also online and open book. Literally impossible not to pass.",1
"Professor was perfect for teaching this course during an election year. Very informative, knowledgeable and clear in what he wants. Exams and papers were posted on Blackboard and easy to upload. Made things simple.",1
She was a good professor. Definitely want to pay attention and take notes. Missed two classes and bombed one of my exams. Simple math with moderate concepts.,1
"Professor Kinkel is very passionate about Child Development . I enjoyed her classes, her lectures were very interesting. There is a couple of interview papers which can be lengthy but not difficult if you put the work in. There is a final that is cumulative but not too difficult. She is caring and I would 100% take her class again and recommend!",1
"A&P is a difficult class, given the large amount of information. Dr. R is not hard. If you pay attention to her powerpoints and focus on her study guides then you should be fine. You have to study consistently to retain the information. She has a great voice that keeps you focused and gives great ways to remember the material. She is the best!",1
This class was so war...it really do get u ready for the industry...chef lacastra that man is so cold...tha dude made rice pilaf in 5min....,1
By far the worse professor that I have ever had! His classes are extremely boring. Attendance a must! Gives way too much material to read & expects you to have it all memorized. Gives weekly pop quizzes! He raises his voice & talks down to the class. He's unclear on his assignments & grades very tough. Gives last a ton of last minute assignments!,0
Does not respond to emails. You have no idea what you are making in class because she does not posts grades in a timely manner.,0
Its a tough course but if you work you'll get through.,1
"Get ready to speak in French at all times! But she makes sure she's always understood by her students and she's a fair grader. And there's daily homework, but it's easy and adds up to a substantial portion of the grade. She genuinely wants her students to do well and love French like she does and that makes her a fun teacher.",1
His instructions are confusing.,0
"My GPA was a 4.0 until this class. This woman is ridiculous! I received a F for my milestone 3 for my final project. She said I needed to use parenthetical references which I used 8! One solution for bullying I used for the anti-bullying campaign and she said it doesn't tie in! Um, what?! If you are unlucky enough to get her, change that course!!!",0
"There are only 2 O-chem instructors at WSU. However, it terms of difficulty, Dr. Burns' exam is more tolerable than Dr. Groutus'. Professor Burns is very knowledgeable in the subject. He uses examples on the board but does not explain the process of the reactions step-by-step. Instead, you see him keep on writing the reaction with no demonstration.",0
Solid Prof. Lots of reading and decent amount of writing/discussion. Is able to make dry topics engaging. Great class if you have a decent amount of B.G. info about the bible.,1
"She jumps from Power Point slide to slide so quickly you can't take notes, and she runs on and on with anecdotes that don't really help. She's interesting to listen to as a person, but not a great teacher. She has a spiel that she runs through and if you don't understand it, she can't explain it in a different way. Study guides weren't much help.",0
Best professor I've ever had.,1
"Nice dude, but you dont learn anything in his classes!",0
easy online class. 5-6 discussion boards where you have to reply and also reply to 2 others. four quizzes 25 pts each. 1 midterm I final both non cumulative. you do need the book bc it is online. easy to pass quizzes if u have all the online notes he has open. not timed so can take how long you want. I would recommend bc its not that much work,1
Professor Wood is such a nice lady and Im so happy I took her class. She explains everything very well and makes class a nice discussion about everything. Do your work and try and she will reward you.,1
"I really did not like this prof as she was such a hard marker but was not clear on what she was wanting from us. I am an English major and really struggled with this course as did all my friends in the course. She told us ""everyone interprets books differently so we will all have different opinions"" yet wanted one answer for essays. Exam worth 30%",0
Important to read the book in order to understand the class. book is very helpful but her slides are even better. wasn't understanding her class but made all efforts and was able to take 1st exam and ace it. She knows the subject too good. gives in class assignments which help a lot on the exam.,1
"Humber is one of the nicest profs I've met, but I hated taking MATH 213 with him. He wasn't prepared to teach for two hours straight. I found his lectures very difficult to engage with, which was unfortunate because the textbook was not helpful either. His homework was really difficult, but tests and quizzes were easy.",0
"Professor Noland is absolutely AMAZING. I was super worried about taking this class but she made it so simple! The assignments can be tough & a little scary, but Noland is HILARIOUS and super passionate about all of her students. She wants everyone to succeed in her class, and she makes that obvious. DEFINITELY recommend. :)",1
"boring you want to kill yourself. I had Chaucer in high school and couldn't wait to take a course in college. HS was better, we learned something about the middle ages. The one good thing is that  its an easy A.",0
"Not sure why so many students here love this professor. I find her teaching style to be entirely unhelpful. Lots of outside work because class itself is useless. Little guidance on what she expects on assignments, and then she grades soooo hard. Bad prof. Bad class. Hang on for dear life.",0
Dr. Henton is not a very understanding professor. She knows her stuff but she doesn't really know her students. I definitely don't recommend her as a prof.,0
"She is extremely nice and understanding to the fact that students have a lot going on. She definitely LOVES students who go to her office hours. That being said, the class is HARD. I'm not a theology major, but I had some knowledge prior to the course. I struggled to get a B. She has very precise expectations and does not articulate them well.",1
"She gives pop quizzes to prepare you. She does not play. She works hard and expects you to be there, on time, and prepared. She scared me at first but then became my favorite professor. She does not spoon-feed you but gets you ready for the bar. I have huge respect for her and her teaching method. She keeps it real and sets a high bar.",1
I do not appreciate the cursing and belittling that I experienced in this class.  Scanlon was completely improfessional with questionable ethics.  Even going to the dean did little to change his behavior.,1
"Worst professor I have ever taken in both my undergrad and graduate career. Lectures are unorganized and incoherent. Showed up 30 minutes late to the final. Changed the midterm rules 5 hours before the midterm. Sloppy handwriting. Never returned homeworks, or midterm. Doesn't explain concepts or equations in lecture; learned nothing from him.",0
I hate her teaching style. She uses MyMathLab.com and she expects everyone to know what they're doing. The homework is pretty hard. If you take this class you might as well sign your life over to math homework because it takes HOURS..,0
He is a great professor. Loves the subjects that he teaches. Be on time. You are going to have to read and write a lot. don't play on your cellphone. Participate. Other than that you should be fine. Would totally recommend. ,1
Very good teacher. He is a genius and I wish I could take every class with him. He knows exactly what he's talking about all of the time and has made zero mistakes and students haven't corrected him once. I would definitely suggest him to anyone.,1
"She is all over the place during lectures, never answers emails and ignores questions in the zoom chat. She is condescending and overall not my favorite professor.",0
"She is smart, kind, and caring. However, the workload is insane and completely unreasonable. The material is boring and you are expected to treat this class as a full time job... double shifted with overtime. Also, Dr. Weston puts mor emphasis on APA formatting than actual content. As stated she's a nice lady but I will definitely not take again",1
"Highly recommended professor. Makes an effort to have you connect to the class and material. He's very knowledgeable on the material and interested. Not one of these robot professors who just reads off powerpoints. Key to succeed: Review the class material prior to class, go to class and participate, show up for reviews and ask away.",1
"the best lab teacher i have had, she cares and is helpful and very clear. This was a great teacher!",1
hate this class! test are hard. studying is a MUST with lots of outside help. doesnt give out OLD powerpoints. Rambles.,0
The lectures were disorganized. 200+ pages reading a night before the class not discussed. Very tough grader. DONT TAKE HER CLASS.,0
"She is a great professor who has a passion to teach Economics. And she is always welcome to answer questions. Actually, I couldn't take good scores on each test then I got 79% for a grade after final finish. However, when I asked to give me a chance, she gave me 80%. I have no words for her. Don't give up and try to talk to her. She will help you",1
"He is totally useless. Plain and simple. I never solves the examples, just gives you the formula then the answer and says solve it after class. Completely useless, worst professor I've had in all my three years.",0
Awful. Grading is way too tough. He thinks hes teaching at Harvord. Didnt care when someone called him out for being unfair. Accused me of plagerism when I only used my own words in a paper. Never posts online. Expects you to have Einsteins memory skills with his pop quizzes. This professor is the worst ive ever had.,0
"I like Crewes, he's been really helpful with things that have come up with internet connection. I've had him in the past and catching on to his pace and way of grading has been pretty easy every time.",1
the worst professor ever,0
Do not take her! Avoid at all cost!,0
A great capstone class with a good level of engagement by the Professor. Clear expectations. No textbook. Cases and readings assigned. Biweekly message board postings required. Write 2 short papers covering cases. Semester long Capsim simulation that you perform solo. CompXM sim (solo) at end of class. Quick grader and would take prof again.,1
"Stay away!!! Took her for two online courses and she is a very tough grader. Assigns discussions+comments every week, (not terrible) but she barely ever gives full credit for them. You NEED textbook for her or else she'll give low grades. 3 to 4 tests, makes you work for them. Don't miss assignments or turn in late ones. She WILL flag you.",0
"Patrick is a fantastic teacher. He is extremely helpful, his lectures are interesting, and you will learn! You do need to work hard to get an A but he will help you every step of the way. Definitely take his courses!",1
"Do the reading and come to class prepared. He explains the concepts very well so don't worry if you haven't taken a philosophy yet or you aren't a science major. The major grades are all essay exams and a paper. There is a lot of reading and writing, but don't let that turn you away from taking the course. I definitely don't regret it.",1
"I say this with sadness because I expected the department of Chemistry in William Paterson University to have somewhat decent instructors, but they do not. Yalan Xing by far puts the cherry on top of the cake. She does not care, to say the least and will fail you regardless of her inabilities of explaining the materials for orgo, DO NOT RECOMMEND!",0
Wish there was another professor to teach this course at Fresno state. She doesn't offer plenty of extra credit which seems reasonable considering her test are extremely hard. You need to study so much for this class. She's tough on her students and expect you to know everything.,0
Good teaching style. He really cares for his students unlike most professors there.,1
You are completely on your own in this class. She does not explain anything and takes a whole week to grade your work. I had to navigate the entire course on my own.,0
"She doesn't email back, the tests don't make sense most of the time, and the whole ""flip the classroom"" thing is super confusing and doesn't help with actually learning.",0
"HIS LECTURES ARE BORING, AND HE'S NOT THE BEST AT EXPLAINING PHYSICS. HE LIKES TO CRAM THE TEST REVIEW THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM.BATMAN POSTS HOMEWORK EVERY 2 DAYS. YOU ALSO HAVE A QUIZ OR A TEST EVERY FRIDAY. FINALLY HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES, WHICH MEANS HE DOESN'T REPLACE THE FINAL TEST GRADE WITH THE LOWEST TEST.NO GRADES DROPED.",1
"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all. I had a difficult time getting in contact with her, calculating my class grade was literally impossible until the end of the semester, and she definitely graded quite harshly for a freshman level class. I would not take another of her classes again.",0
"Would NOT recommend at all. The pace was extremely quick and the lessons were vague and unclear, little examples. His mood changed frequently throughout the class and if he thinks your not trying he becomes upset.  Various people taking the course had Arabic knowledge, it seemed to prof catered to their speed instead of a 101. Overall a bad prof",0
"This is my second course with him, and it's essentially the same thing - name-drops of famous poets that he knows/knew and long, dry lectures that last the whole class period. He'll ask your opinion on something and then lecture over you anyway. Worth standing because he knows a lot of things, but definitely dull. I was dreading class by the end.",0
"BA 340 was very enjoyable with  David. He's very funny and makes marketing interesting. The class is primarily group discussion, but he does not force you to speak in class; so don't let that sway you from taking his class. There are two/three Moodle assignments online every week. No tests, and the final project is a group presentation.",1
"Avoid! Class is extremely boring and he teaches half the course based on his own bias and beliefs, homework heavy, but he gives you the answers. Content is extremely specific and useless. Not friendly or caring, very loud, often wrong about things he teaches as facts (google fact check him). Says ""out there"" and ""makes sense"" so much I kept a tally",0
"I know nothing about the prof himself. But his class is good. The videos provided are my saviors. textbook provided. There is a project-type thing due every Monday. Strict-ish on guidelines. Updates grades regular. The tests are the worst part, just because they are timed, and you have to show 100% of your work, so thats hard. id take again tho.",1
Really nice guy and good teacher. The class is about excel and access. He really knows what he's talking about and shows you how to apply what he's teaching to the real world.,1
So hard to understand her. Lecture's don't make sense. She attempts to be humorous but fails. Half the people in the class could care less of what is going on. During a class discussion she wouldn't let us talk about our views and would always try to correct us.,0
Just DONT!,0
love RIT and this teacher,1
"Not that it matters, because this was her last semester, but I found her to be very friendly. She expects certain things, but lets be honest, we are college students! If you attend her classes and turn work in on time, you will get an A",1
You can tell that she really cares for her students. She spends some time going over the material in class much not as much as she showed. The tests are kind of hard especially if you don't study.,1
"very enthusiastic, but tests were very hard. she criticizes all questions",0
"One of the best philosophy professors at Colgate. He really knows what he's talking about, and makes it easy to understand. Great corny jokes! Participate, do the reading and take decent notes, and you're set.",1
"The lack of empathy and understanding of learning styles really makes her teaching detrimental to others. There was a lot of lack of communication on what she wanted one to get out of the information and even the work itself. Nothing sticks out more than her saying in one lecture to ""suck it up and buy microsoft word."" ignoring others circumstance",0
"I loved his class! He's really nice and is there for students with whatever they need help with! There are only two exams - midterm and final. They are mostly based on his lectures, so take copious notes and attend all the classes. Also, the weekly online assignments and quizzes were very helpful in understanding the lessons. I learn so much!",1
"He's a great Music teacher, very helpful..turns the excersizes into games. Helps you understand scales, and notes...great bass player...Highly recommended!",1
"Professor Wolverton is really good, not boring as a lecturer either.  She's helpful outside of class and the requirements for this class aren't hard, 3 very short essays.  Here study guides for the exams were straightforward and if you do the readings this class isn't hard.",1
He is a nice person but he is a harsh grader and the majority of his classes is a waste of time. He goes completely off topic with different stories that have nothing to do with what he is teaching and by the time he is done the class is already over. Don't take him if you actually want to learn something during class.,0
"Fiona puts a lot of effort into making the course material engaging, and clearly cares about the success of her students. Pretty lenient with deadlines as long as you communicate with her. Easy grader if you follow the assignment criteria, but very relaxed about page requirements. Would LOVE to have her again if I wasn't at the end of my diploma!!",1
One of the best professors Ive ever had. You can tell he enjoys his work. Knowledgeable and entertaining. Willing to help outside of class.,1
"Very nice guy, and appropriately funny. My GOD does this guy give harder exams. Just like Horstmann grading structure. Class average on first exam was 21/50 but half the class did ereally well and other half did not. Too much assignment u wouldnt finish unless only taking 2 classes that semester. After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard",0
"Dr. Costanza varies his lecture material and explanation based on his interests, but expects the student to write in-depth papers on each topic every week. Tough quizzes that are weighted to info or details NOT discussed in class. Costanza's rigid ultra-conservative Christianity can be uncomfortable. On plus side, class is repetitive tasks and easy",0
"One of the most boring classes I have ever taken, I was really excited for this class just to catch myself falling asleep every single day. Attendance is super lenient but he makes it very hard to go to class. Zero group activities or any engaging in the classroom, I don't even know a single persons name in my class. Exam study guides are 10 pages.",0
This online class was horrible.  He was not helpful and you have to do rediculous amounts of work and still can barley pass the class,0
"She offers you extra to retry for quizzes but she not helpful if you don't understand, your midterm and final is what will make the difference in whether you pass or fail her class.  If you don't pass either midterm or final, you're more like to not pass the class.",0
"Although you learn some cool technology uses, the environment in the classroom was awful. He'll constantly go off topic on things unrelated to class making the class feel longer than it already is. He constantly yells, get frustrated and impatient to any student wanting to ask questions or clarification and overall an unpleasant person. STAY AWAY!",0
"She really tried hard to help us but had trouble with a lot of things.  Test were really hard, and she is hard to understand during her lectures! Her point scales were messed up, but get your work in on time and you will do fine!  I pretty much got C's on the test and still passed with an A.  So do your work and stay on her good side!",0
"Professor Caldwell is a brilliant guy but a really poor teacher. Does not give prompts for essays (briefly describes them in class) then proceeds to dock you despite never giving you any direction. He also interrupts students all the time, so there is no reason to participate in class. Avoid this guy if you want an A.",0
Gives Excellent notes on overhead. Was able to refer back to them. Stayed on a schedule. Combined with the Hawkes program and Diane Stralka I really enjoyed the math class. I feel very accomplished after leaving her class. I wish she could follow me through the rest of my math classes. Highly recommend.,1
"He obviously knows what he is taking about but is not a very effective teacher. He is a hard grader and participation and attendance matter. You have to read before every class and there are random pop quizzes. Also, his interpretations of the texts we read were way off from what I thought. I would not recommend.",0
"Get ready to read. Pretty tough grader, and not very approachable outside class so it was difficult to get feedback on assignments. This course was also very philosophy/theory based, and was rather dry - and often difficult - because of that. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.",0
"A very tough grader, Very strict always speeds through things. In this course you mostly have to teach yourself to understand what he's talking about, wants you to read the chapter before coming to class.",0
"Doc Lamkin is an excellent professor. She made me love all the material. I've got an A in her class by  working hard through the whole semester. A lot of memorization!! My advice is to print the lab manual and practice with it, also take notes during class, and practice with the chapter tests in the book. ",1
"She was rude, you had to teach a lot of the content yourself, not very helpful in general.",0
"Brilliant. Extremely helpful. The class is ""difficult"" in that you can't just skim the readings to understand, but, if you read through them carefully and ask good questions in class Dr. A will definitely help you out. Expect to work, but expect to learn.",1
She is a wonderful teacher! Tells interesting stories and really wants to help you succeed in the class. She answers any questions you have and gives you powerpoint presentations and study guides to help with tests! I would definitely recommend her!,1
"In adjusting to the online format, Prof Wiebe has continued to go with 1h 20 min lectures, which he uses to go off on side tangents frequently. Be prepared to work hard in his class, as most phil 140 classes I've heard to be among the easier side of classes, but unfortunately not this one.",0
"Do NOT take this professor if you do not like harsh/uncalled for feedback, lots of assignments, very little time to do each assignment, and a bad attitude towards students. She does NOT care that you have other courses she treats you like graduate students. She is so anal about APA and every detail it'll drive you insane. BEWARE OF HER AT ALL COSTS",0
"Great prof, great class. I don't get what other people are talking about. ",1
"I liked this class. Dr. Ayers has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which I enjoyed. He does a good job of explaining the material and will answer questions until everyone understands it. Tests are not hard but you need to study your notes and, to a lesser degree, the book.",1
"This guy is awful.  He was bad for EE 312, and he's even worse for this class.  He now uses quizzes to see if anyone is paying attention, or at least, showing up to class.  My biggest peeve: he issues a final for the last day of class instead of during the scheduled exam date.  It's unfair, because you can't finish a final in 1:15.  What a jerk!",0
"Never comes out from behind desk, sends students to colleges tutoring instead of works with in class, yells at class when scores on test low. First Test Class Scores: A=2, B=5, C=22, D=9, F=8. Seriously?",0
Jana is an excellent teacher.  There is no guessing with her.  She tells you exactly what she expects.  Her tests were over her notes.  The group activities were fun and her assignments were few but definitely a learning experiance.  I highly recommend any class with her.,1
"Englund is very strict, hard to get ahold of, and makes tests very difficult. He does not review in class nor does he give students a review for the tests. Rather he says ""just look over your notes and you should do fine."" Also, clickers are very important if you wish to have a good grade.",0
Took IDIS304 online. Very straight forward and easy. Not time consuming at all.,1
"Very good philosophy professor. Attention to the class is a must, as he teaches rather fast (and sometimes the topics can be very confusing). This is not an ""Easy A"" class, but it is very rewarding.",1
It was sort of difficult keeping up with what was due things felt a little disorganized at times but overall a good teacher.,1
Take someone else if you can,0
"This is a case of a guy that thinks he is good and that he knows stuff. Yet, once you finish your degree you realize that he was one of these profs that have done very little in their academic life and they just put up a big act. Pathetic!",0
Be ready to watch a lot of Youtube Accounting videos.,0
"Selph was by far my favorite professor of my two years at Lane. His teaching style is clear, straightforward, and never rushed. Although calculus is a challenging subject at times, he made the concepts easy to understand. You could tell that he truly enjoyed and got excited about teaching, and I adored his gentle and kind personality.",1
Dr. Flannery has really worked hard to make sure we had the best experience with the COVID outbreak going on. He dedicated time to making audio lectures on top of his hand written lectures. Though the presentation was a bit harder with having to do it online instead I definitely don't think it would be hard to accomplish in a normal course setting.,1
Beware! Avoid her. Critical and harsh comments. Fails to provide guidance but holds learnes accountable for info. does not go over. Grades harshly. I got an A and a 4.0 GPA still. Never take her again. Beware!,0
His teaching is just terrible. I pay good money for this class just to sit in here and be confused for 2 hours. His accent inhibits him from giving understandable lectures and he gets an attitude when you ask him to repeat himself. DO NOT TAKE HIM. EVER!!!!!,0
"Stay away from Dr. Singer. His lectures do not correspond to what the books say. His test problems look nothing like the problems from the book. At least half the class dropped this class (including me) because he is simply a garbage teacher. The material is learnable. I took it with someone else and passed easily, not because of a pushover teacher",0
"Just Had my first class. I didn't listen anything she was saying cause she is insanely pretty. She also has a cute accent. Or maybe, I found her accent cute b/c she is pretty.",1
This teacher really helps you learn your math. If you have questions she is ver easy to talk to and does not make you feel stupid. She also looks wherever she can on a test to give you points. Just like any math class though you will need to show up to pass.,1
Mrs. Nelson is a great teacher. She is an amazing singer as well and is so down to Earth. The content is very easy to understand if you study and read and pay attention. I would highly recommend this class.,1
I came in knowing a bit about stats then ended up coming out confused. He doesnt give any help. Email him he tells you to look at the module the book isnt any help he wrote it.,0
"Dr. Chen is a good teacher, and he tries to make sure that everything makes sense. Overall, the class is pretty difficult. There are quizzes at the beginning of every class meeting, so go to class EVERY TIME. There's only one exam and it's the final. Projects are difficult but he gives good feedback if you ask him to look over them.",1
"Mr. Fultz is a great guy, and will try to help you any way he can. However, he can be confusing at times, and when you ask for help he confuses even more. He's very disorganized and can be everywhere. His class was super easy, though if you plan on going into A&P classes you may not learn much in his class.",0
Don't take any mathematical class with him he will let you hit the wall my recommendation take with anyone else but not with him .,0
"She is a waste of space.  Totally useless, living in the 80's.  This class, on the whole, is a waste of time and just a way for SCC to get money.  She thinks she is funny, she is not.  She claims you need the book, you do not.  She likes to be the grammar and spelling police when most of her work is laden with errors. The class is a complete waste.",0
"You wouldn't know this class is a gened based on how harsh he grades you. You have to get down to the specific details of his rubrics in order to get an A in this class. When the class is struggling to understand what he wants, he records extremely condescending videos and shares them. Do not take this gened if you need world society filled.",0
"Lectures are 3 hours long, yes he is a bit boring and some topics are hard to sit through depending on your interest but it is very easy to do well in his course. He provides study guides that are 6-9 pages but if you go over it the exam will be easy since he pulls questions from the study guide. He also gives xtra credit 6% added to final grade.",1
She's one of the nicest teachers ever and her class is very easy. I took her class while still enrolled in high school and it was honestly easier than some of the courses at my high school.,1
"Teaching a course based off of self-help books is a waste of time. Online quiz, online lecture, loads of reading... busy work with a 45 minute presentation to fill class time.  supposed to be a 2+2 credit course but really it is 4+2 for 3 credits.",0
Final required you to attend class as questions came from lectures. ,1
"Dr. Topsakal motivates students to expand their education with tailored class projects and project based home works. The time and dedication he devotes to the students is unparalleled. His classes are by far the best experience you're going to get at VCU Engineering. If you haven't had a course with this professor yet, I encourage you to look.",1
"Professor Cosette is absolutely fantastic! She has a great sense of humor and is incredibly supportive of students regardless of their skill level- all in a way that makes you want to put the effort in to do well. Ashe has a more relaxed teaching style compared to some professors, but is always happy to answer questions/provide clarification.",1
"I took Crim. Pro. with Raphael after being warned by some of his Constitutional Law students that he was bad. HE WAS AWESOME. If you do the readings, it's not hard at all. He will call on you, but if you don't know the answer, he won't ridicule you or make you feel bad, he'll just move on. If you engage him, he's interesting and fun. I recommend.",1
not so great teacher.,0
THe BEST lecture ever ever,1
"she's a cool person, but she tends to ask for too much from an ACA class. Like its a 1 credit class and she doesnt understand some people's circumstances. So i'll be a tough rater, like she's a tough grader.",0
"Review sheets and in-class quizzes do nothing to prepare you for the tests. She is a great teacher with passion for finance however her tests are insane. She expects you to know how to solve problems that you don't discuss in class. If possible, I would recommend another professor just because her tests are INCREDIBLY hard.",0
best prof ever,1
"Dr. Batman is a lot better than Dr. Back. Unlike Dr. Back, Batman prints out notes for you and goes over example problems upon that particular subject. He's a very lenient grader and he gives out homework once a week or sometimes none at all. Dr. Back gives you hw three times a week.  However, he is an extremely slow grader.",1
"A great person, very caring and considerate. He is also pretty funny and interesting to listen to.",1
"very bad teacher , no examples",0
"Dr. T. is one of the BEST bio professors here. He's really passionate about the subject, he  truely cares about the students, very helpful and approachable. This guy is the best!",1
"Great guy with an awesome accent and sense of humor. Teaches the class in a discussion method by giving ideologies and then contesting them, or has us do that. Really witty, interesting and controversial topics, but he talks about them in such a great way. Would take again!",1
Learning to walk and taking fundamental steps toward the overall design is important; He brings out a creative aspect in us to think openly and express it in architecture! If you did not understand; its because you did open yourself up for learning! I still go through the motions that were instilled in me THANK YOU!,1
He's an amazing art teacher that genuinely cares about what he teaches and his students. He is incredibly nice and tries to help you in any way. Would take a class by him again.,1
"Her readings are extremely boring!!!!! Bring your pillows; she will put you to sleep!!!!!! A Don Quixote groupie, her stupid brownie points are annoying, seriously how old are we? She’s a harsh grader! Avoid taking her!!!!",0
"Good microbiology professor, I would recommend him as one of the best teachers in the CUNY system.",1
Take it. OMG I have such a hard time staying awake in class but online I understand things a whole lot more. Not only because it seemed to go my pace but because if I had an issue with a problem I could not solve I would add it to the discussion board and then as a class everyone would help solve it. I learned a lot no lie.,1
"This guy is useless. I took his online class and he never helped you and was a real jerk. He felt as if he was invincible when speaking over e-mail. Oh well, what else do you expect when a coach teaches?",0
Great professor. He clearly wants all of his students to perform well. ,1
Strictest teacher I've ever met. Her rules are insane for lab she will kick students out of lab for wearing ankle socks! She also never posts grades so it makes it hard to tell how well your doing in lab. She also doesn't teach how to do any of the calculations or go over parts of the lab before you do it so your left to your own devices.,0
Very nice professor and wants you to succeed. Make sure you understand coursework and do recitations and homework.,1
"Nice guy, but I hated him. I never understood what he was trying to explain. Sometimes would spend whole lecture on problem then say it was wrong, and it had nothing to do with homework or test. Too much theory and not enough examples. Only C I ever received at Stevens",0
"NOT an easy A kind of teacher. He will make u work 4 it! I got an A (thanks to xtra credit for perfect attendance). He gets frustrated if u question him too much or argue with him. My advice? GO TO TUTORING, stay quiet in clas (unless u have right answr) , good attendance  xtra credit, DO THE HW wa tutor!! He doesnt grade it, but it will help u! ",0
Very detailed and thorough explanations. Fast paced but does listen and gives excellent thoughtful feedback. Individual and group assignments. Practicums are daunting.  Overall very supportive and a fun class.,1
"She is literally one of the nicest professors I have had. In the beginning of the semester, the class was boring but then she grew on me and is such a sweet woman. Take her if you can!!!",1
"Dr. Bricker is the worse professor I've ever encountered. She has no respect for students, makes them feel dumb, and actually called our class of 120+ students ""stupid"" multiple times. She was the only teacher for this course, but if you can, DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE",0
"This is a science course, so expect to do a lot of studying outside of class. The key to pass this class is to utilize his practice exams that he posts on Moodle. Know those like the back of your hand! Regarding his lecture, they're a hit or miss. For some students, his lectures are pretty good. For others, not so much. Just put the time in !",1
"Class is easy, but time consuming. HW & quizzes are done on the McGraw-Hill Connect website. The HW is over 100 questions per assignment. Weekly discussions are simple, post and comment on one other. Her due dates & times are always messed up so be sure to check them. She isn't helpful & doesn't respond to emails. The final paper is ridiculous.",0
"As tempting as it is, ""Sharks with lasers"", is not a correct answer on any of his quizzes.",1
Dr. Shine is an excellent example of what all college-level professors should strive to become.,1
"I've had Dr. Altamirano for multiple courses and as an occasional, unofficial mentor. She is a wonderful woman. My first class with her was what made me first want to become an ANT major. She gives a lot of readings and sometimes the assignments are a little unclear. She can be a tough teacher, but if you're up to it, you will learn a lot!",1
"This professor definitely plays favorites. He's primarily interested in hearing his own ideas. His goal is not to teach you how to think, but what to think. He teaches from the same lecture he's been using for over a decade. Make sure you get copies of them from older students. Avoid taking this professor. Take Crooms instead.",0
Isn't he just the best? Very nice person & professor. Thank you Derek!,1
"This prof made me absolutely hate this class. She and our TA miscommunicate on everything. Get ready for the most unorganized class of your life. If you want to be spoken to like a toddler, take this class. Gets mad at people for being on zoom and not in class. Like sorry we're in a pandemic and I don't want to get corona? Extremely insensitive.",0
"This class is a lot of work, but pretty much what one would expect going into learning a whole new language. If you want to learn Arabic, you cant go wrong with Miss Tabur. So far I have loved this class. She doesnt mind reviewing the material with me during her office hours. She is funny and she also smiles a lot, which I find endearing.",1
"Prof. Gartland is a very sweet lady & she cares about her students. One important thing to note is that you will want to attend the live meetings because she throws bits of important exam info out in the meetings. Her off topic tangents are useful- sometimes exam questions are based on them. Overall very easy. Shes a little unorganized, thats all.",1
"Do not take her class. It's unnecessarily difficult and she gives A LOT OF WORK  to do for no reason. I like her as a person, but her lecture is really... boring for the most part...",0
"Don't be scared off. She is harsh in her marking but if you ask for her help, she will be more than willing. Her words might feel a little sharp but all she wants is for students to be ready for the harder parts of ASL. Even with online learning, she had clear and easy lectures to follow (not long). She listens to student feedback, don't be afraid.",1
Professor Valltos is awesome. His lectures are engaging and extremely interesting. He does an excellent job using real-life scenarios to explain class material. He's comical and tells it like it is. I would definitely take another class with this professor.,1
"This class is ridiculous! It has nothing to do with philosophy more of an english class. The professor is extremely boring and attendance is a MUST if you wish to pass. There's hwk due every first lecture, quiz the next, and another quiz in your discussion. WAYYYY too much for a lower div class.",0
Always seemed to be doing homework for his class. Most homework I have had in any class in my first 3 years. Considering this is a 100 level course I was not impressed.,1
His classes are interesting and he puts in effort to make sure we understand what he is teaching in class.,1
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
"Mr. Norton is a very humble professor. He is very knowledgeable and easy going. Take his class, you won't regret it!",1
VERY VERY VERY HARD,0
"Some lectures were a bit long (lots of information), but overall, she made the course more interesting. There were many activities to prepare us for exams. Very helpful.",1
"the worst class I've taken in college. Professor Lee was not only harsh but extremely critical and mean, and would publicly shame students in the classroom. The directions were VERY unclear, assignments were never given correct due dates and there was no feedback ever except for harsh criticism. This class interfered with my health & psyche",0
"Professor Loftis sucked. He never would clarify what needs to be done and his prefered style for papers goes against what all other teachers taught throught the campus(apparently transitional paragraphs are only filler, and enough to bump your grade down if used) he also gives you liberal speals ever so passively aggressive. overall,dont takehiscla",0
"Dr. Hines makes classes entertaining and fun compared to a solid lecture. Also, he helps whenever help is needed. Definitely recommend taking him for any course. Homework is every now and then and really helps highlight the material.",1
"Erin is one of the most amazing professors, more particularly she's intelligent, passionate, upfront and honest, entirely fair concerning grades and effort, and she will most likely convert you to the dark side (into a Biology Major). Grade received doesn't reflect Erin personally, it describes the unworthiness of us all to learn from her!!!!!!!!!!",1
Amazing. offers learning test to get to know your personal learning style. Draws Pictures and labels systems. emphasizes test material. extremely Supportive.  Its her passion and she was born to teach! I left feeling comfortable and confident. I wish all my teachers were like her. ,1
my favorite professor so far. lectures are long lots of class time just talking can get a little boring but def worth it.,1
BOOOOOOOOOOO. Bad professor. Makes a 100 level class way harder than it has to be and offers zero extra credit. If you want to get an A make sure you memorize the lectures and everything in each chapter as he will pull random questions from the book that were never covered. Only need a 50% to pass though if you're okay with a D.,0
I took him Fall 2019 for English 1C. Hes a good English professor and I felt like my writing improved but his personality is horrible. Hes arrogant and a narcissist. He will call on you in front of the whole class if he you do so much as laugh or make a sound. Hes not afraid to embarrass you in front of others. Horrible!!,0
"Definitely a prof who cares a lot about the subject and his students, but didn't do a great job teaching the topics, as I found myself learning more from the online videos and textbooks than from the lectures. Expect interesting lectures if you are passionate about the topics, but difficult midterms and lots of homework.",0
I have taken 3 classes with Chingling and I have loved her every semester that I have taken her. She is always ready to have deep discussions with you and presentations that end up taking 3 hours of a 4 hour class seem like they take 2 minutes. She always has interesting coursework and is a tough but fair grader. If you like a challenge try her!,1
Really enjoyed this class and Ms. V as a professor. Really makes you think outside the box and allows your opinion to be heard and considered.,1
"I HIGHLY recommend Professor Schreibfeder. I took his psych101 class over summer. You only have one essay, NO final, NO homework, and quizzes on every chapter that are open book and open note.  He is VERY sarcastic and likes to joke. He enjoys participation, so if you take his class don't hesitate to participate. I'm very glad I took his class.",1
"really great professor, cares about his students. The tests are fairly difficult, but he offers a lot of extra credit. also does not take attendance, but has questions to be turned in at the end of class that are graded. must read the book to do well on the quizzes.",1
doctor morgan is great. his accent is awesome (i guarantee you will end up saying words like he does by the end) plus he's very helpful especially in lab. overall a really good teacher.,1
"5 questions quizzes every class bout assigned reading, sounds easy right? Wrong. Questions always consist of the most trivial parts of reading! Tests are multiple choice, but don't let that fool you! They are still extremely difficult! The course material is challenging to say the least and his ;lectures do not clarify anything! Also talks too fast",0
"She's an amazing professor even in her first year. She helped me out as much as she could this semester, including meeting with me outside of her office hours multiple times. We moved the schedule around to make sure all our readings were clear and took less time on the things we didn't enjoy.",1
"Do not take this class if you want to learn something. Ms. Bouchard is interesting to look at, but she is not good at teaching. She is unorganized, does not follow the syllabus, makes up assignments as she goes along and does not grade anything until the end of the term. Her lectures are about the definitions and no real legal research happening. ",0
Don't take him. Worst profesor ever! 3 weeks to hit finals and the only thing I learn was football. I'm so disappointed.,0
really helpful and great professor.,1
"Dr. Israel is a very thorough lecturer. This can get a bit tedious at times, but if you pay attention, your level of understanding will be far beyond what you'll need to succeed in the class. 1-2 HWs per week on quest, which is very manageable. The best professor I've had so far at UT.",1
"The online class is very reasonable and interesting, you read the chapter take the test (short answer essay style) and the final is a paper. Very maintainable but its not a piece of cake, this is college so you want to think critically and apply your knowledge to the papers. Great, caring professor, I strongly recommend even if youre not art major!",1
He is the best math professor I have ever had. Would highly recommend choosing him does not require textbook and does not assign homework.,1
"Makes jokes the entire class, doesn't teach!!!",0
"Best Prof ever. He explains things well, and his notes are clear. His tutorials are really helpful. The first test reflects what we learned and was really fair. Definitely recommend him",1
"Never does example problems. Is not clear on HW, quiz, or test expectations. Tests are brutal. Reads (in the quietest voice ever) a Powerpoint presentation for the whole lecture, then you go home and teach yourself with the book. May add points to the tests (since everyone fails) but does not curve. ",0
"Whigham is an amazing teacher. He doesn't skip steps, explains everything clearly, gives reasonable homework, fair tests, and does everything that he can to help his students.",1
"The lectures are pretty interesting if you're engaged. The tests are super easy if you properly prepare and study. HIGHLY recommend going to the test review session before an exam, they'll help you so much.",1
"Mark was a great professor. At first I didn't think the class would work well considering he's pretty young, however it was quite the opposite. He more than well knows what he's doing and everything you do in that class is designed to make you a better writer. He gives great feedback on essays and explains things really well. ",1
"I loved Professor Allen, but this class definitely isn't for everybody. To do well, you need to attend every class and pay close attention. Professor Allen's lectures are very interesting if you actually want to challenge your mind.",1
Worst teacher ever. I do not recommend.,0
"Very nice professor and will work with you on your grades. Gives out extra credit a LOT. I enjoyed her class, and if you read her material then you will receive an A. She gives out a LOT of readings, which I think is unnecessary, and you NEED to read them for her quizzes. At times she is hard to understand and is unclear, but all in all I liked her",1
"she gave 19 problems for the final exam... HW due in class at 8 a.m. Though she did not take attendance, she use quizzes to drag you out of bed......",0
"Weekly quizzes encourage attendance. Enthusiastic, interested in communicating, and extremely knowledgeable.",1
"He's not great at lecturing. He has clicker questions, so attendance is mandatory. His tests are taken from the examples in the book, just with different numbers. If you get the right idea in tests, but the wrong numbers he'll give you most of the credit. Tests are typically 3-5 problems with about 3 parts to each. There's also homework on Pearson.",0
"Dr. Rivas was great in lifting the curtain and showing students what was going on in writing theory. It was enlightening to see the conflicts in writing pedagogies and he did a great job in making students a part of that conversation. It's rough at first reading essays written for people with PhDs, but it's rewarding when you start to get it.",1
"Worst class I've honestly ever taken. Majority of the students failed due to the professor being very boring, off topic constantly, and confused.  Despite the fact that he is nice older gentleman, the stress level within the class IS NOT WORTH IT. Do not take this class unless your willing to cry after seeing your test scores.",0
Very tough grader but really nice person. She gives great feedback and is accessible outside of class.,1
"Sweetest thing. She is a tough grader, but she will let you rewrite things. we had 2 exams with a few papers. she wants you to ask questions and participate and loves those who do. i would recommend giving her drafts and still rewriting it. she gives you study guides for the exams which you have to know inside and out. go to her. sweetest thing!",1
"He says class in mandatory but it isn't. Class lectures are boring as hell, if you can keep awake, kudos to you. There are 3  tests, 16 quizzes, and no final. And tests are composed of quiz questions and powerpoint information. There is a book you need to get but you'll find it worthless.",1
Such a great  professor! The material is very insightful. He really breaks down the readings for you in his lectures. Definitely ask questions and participate in discussion. You get quizzed every class but if you just do the readings you will be fine. There is so much extra credit at the end of the semester it would be hard to not pass with an A.,1
"She is such a sweet and understanding lady. She loves her job. She tends to do a lot of peer editing. If you go to her office hours, she will give you so many suggestions on your paper. She likes to see A LOT of improvement from your rough draft. Her grading is extremely fair. You get out as much as you put into her class. Take her!",1
"Dr. Bachman is a good professor who explains concepts clearly. I don't know what some people are in here talking about him being rude or impatient with students. Many people in my class (including me) asked very stupid questions and he was patient with all of us and tried his best to answer him. Your grade is just three tests, but they are easy",1
This class has a million TAs but it takes forever for assignments to be graded. The tests are very difficult and the reviews aren't recorded. High expectations for a GE class. Lectures are very very long and boring. Not a lot of talk about current events. Could have been much better and had a lot of potential but just fell flat b/c of COVID maybe??,0
"He is a very tough grader but I can appreciate that because he actually prepared me for ""the real world"". Plus, it was a GRADUATE course, you have to work for it. I learned so much! I thought I was a great writer and I was HUMBLED real quick, thank you for that because now I AM a great writer and have progressed so much just within this course.",1
"Her online class isn't even a class. It's terrible. She waits a month to grade essays and when she does, she gives no feedback. How in the world are we suppose to know what mistakes we make, if she doesn't point them out? She's not teaching. She just grades papers late with no feedback. She must enjoy killing our honors gpa.",0
She is a good teacher. She is a great photographer. I recommend this course.,1
"She isn't very friendly and is difficult to communicate with. I found her to be really judgemental. She is a tough grader, so even when you put your 100% effort into an assignment, don't expect to get an A.",0
"Easy professor for studio, doesnt give much work usually. but when he does he gives a whole lot together. Wen it comes to grading he sucks. If ur a teachers pet and suck up to him, then he's great for u.",0
boooooo brian,0
Mr. Luckett is a very arrogant and close minded professor. He refuses to venture outside the book thus making him one dimensional. very little assignments but he grades those assignments as if he was grading a paper due for nationals. Miss one step on his discussion rubric? expect a big ol fat 40 for the grade. i would recommend to stay away.,0
"It's easy to get him off task, but he's a really sweet guy and I feel he truly cares about his students.",1
Great teacher. I took this class in the summer and still learned a ton.,1
He teaches so bad. No knowledge about the the topics. Teaches basic level examples in the class and puts high level questions in exam about which he never makes us practice or any idea.,0
He is a pretty nice guy and makes a point of making himself available for individual questions after class. However the class itself is by far the hardest class to get an A in I have taken at this school. With new reading assignments each night (4 a week) usually ranging from 50-80 pages I spend more time on this class than my others combined.,0
If you are a theology major then this is the class for you. Seems like you should not take other classes along with this one. He created his own readings about 5 to 15 pgs sometimes to read every other day and take a quiz on it. You must memorize them b/c questions are very specific. Just take another class if you are taking a full semester.,0
"One of the hardest, but most interesting classes I have ever taken. Learned more in this semester course than I have during my past 2 years at KU. She really makes you work for it, but she is one of the best professors I have ever had. As long as you pay attention and actually try you will do fine.",1
dont take her she thinks this is a history school. fuller was the best bro whatever happened to that guy,0
"She is one of the best prof at FIU. They should really hire more professionals like her. She knows the material and likes to answer questions. The class was really interesting. 3 exams, which are not that hard, you get a review for it. There are 4 group assignments, if you have a good group, you should do well. Attendance is mandatory",1
Someone with such a lack of respect for American students should go home to whence they came.,0
"She time and time again made it clear that if you have personal issues that affect your ability to attend class or turn in assignments, SHE WILL WORK WITH YOU. Her assignments are pretty clear on what she expects. The main problem I had in her classes was the lack of respect from other students because they didn't agree with her personal opinions.",1
"Very hard grader!! I was lucky to even get a B in his class. You get 4 essays to complete throughout the semester. He allows you to bring a rough draft and edit with your peers,which helped. Make sure you do homework and participate in class discussions. Try to go to his office hours prior to handing your essays it will help avoid falling a essay.",0
"Knows the material well but is bad at presenting it and fails to make students feel welcome or smart enough to contribute. Lots of reading, but the readings aren't too dense themselves. The material is ok, but the professor himself isn't great.",0
"His course is very simple, you have the skeleton notes and you can fill it in during class. There are weekly online assignments that are simple, and weekly quizzes that are simple. Overall straight forward class, Tom himself is a great person.",1
"I had Professor Blankenship for Online English 112. She is a great instructor and is very understanding, even towards people with disabilities. She is not a tough grader and if you dont understand something, she will take time out to explain it to you. It was a privilege to be in her class.",1
I was not a big fan of this bio class. I felt like there was way too much information to read and hard to grasp so many small details when studying. Prepare for tons of textbook and powerpoint reading to study. The best part though is that you can study helpful practice exams and Quizlets.,1
"Gives an outline each class with underlined terms. On the exam, there will be an essay (100 pts) and 8 ID's  (underlined terms from outlines) & you need to choose 4/8 to elaborate on (100 pts) These 8 ID's could be any of the 40-50 terms from the outlines. Miss notes? you won't have enough info on ID's. Doesnt give any clues which ID's are on exam.",0
"Had Dr. Grimminger for Chem 1 . He explains things fairly well but somethings can be confusing at times. Kind of awkward and doesn't seem to handle large groups well. He is very approachable and not awkward at all talking to him 1 on 1. Tests are tough but if you do the hw and come to class, you will get atleast a B on the exams. Overall good guy",1
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
"Tanya continuously changes the syllabus and due dates without letting us know. She crams so much at the end that it seems almost impossible to finish the class. Do not recommend, this class is awful.",0
"One of the dullest professors I have ever had. She talks at a 2 mph pace and forgets what she is talking about mid-sentence constantly. When she explains something she will say the same exact thing 4 different ways and take up time in class just talking about a topic that doesn't matter. She makes it difficult to participate, although its a big gde",0
"Dr. Fetter is my favorite professor in the Butler MBA program thus far.  It is extremely evident that he genuinely cares about his students.  He tries to lighten up dry classes (such as stats) with humor.  He is clear, concise, do what he says to do and you'll earn an easy A.  He makes himself available to you when you need help.  A++",1
"I have taken Dr. Bamford three times to date.  She is a wonderful human being, she loves cats and also she is British!  She is very compassionate and loves her job.  If you need a humanity, take her... if you need an elective take her.... She is the BEST! P.S. You will never buy a book for her class.",1
"This guy is impossible to please. He seems happier when you do poorly. Be careful! He won't explain what he wants so be sure to ask as many questions as possible, he will take off points for Every Little Thing. Make sure to fight for your grades if you think he's slighting you. You might get some points back if you can argue them. Avoid.",0
Took her online 6wk course. At first it was intimidating bc there were many things due every week. You have a discussion posts due every Thursday plus two replies to classmate's discussion posts every Sunday (includes scientific articles/research& citations). There was also 1group project & 2 Diet analysis projects. Tons of extra credit though!,1
"(taken spring 2020) Love this man! Super intelligent and explains things clearly. Makes economics interesting. Cengage works great with this class. Self proclaimed ""hardest Eco Prof"" but if you just do the work it's fine. Really want to take him again when I can! Grade based on Cengage HW, tests, and participation. Definitely do the extra credit",1
"I loved Adelle's classes. She has such an interesting past and is very involved in the field of Forensic Psychology. The lectures were interesting and had awesome information provided. I enjoyed showing up for class and looked forward to readings. Grading was fair, the quizzes were easy - studying for midterm and final is essential!",1
Dr Schwartz definitely cares about the students.  He wants you to do well by learning the material. Had extra classes to help and even had a special class on a Saturday.  He's there for you if you study. I'd take him again,1
"Took him for American Government, one of the best professors and classes I have ever taken. Very knowledgeable about the material, and shows a passion about the students. Any people who have a passion for learning should not look any further than Dr. Baltodano. Not a lot of homework other than easy online quizzes.",1
"I'm taking Phil 7 - Intro to Critical Thinking, and this class is seriously the worst class ever. The material isn't too difficult, but the professor makes everything about this class bad. He wrote the textbook, and it's REALLY boring to read. you HAVE to go to class b/c he makes you hand in HW on Tues, short quiz on Thurs, and big quiz on Friday.",0
"Dr. Ruesink is the teacher to take. He doesn't want anyone to fail his classes, in fact, he does everything possible to make sure you go great. There were 2 projects in his class which he helps out with and is an easy grader. ",1
Dr. Wisner is nice and the class is well organized. He makes his expectations clear from the beginning and gives really useful feedback on your writing. Discussion posts are absolutely vital so don't skip them.,1
LOVE Dr. Marlow! His personality is definitely out there and made me nervous at first cause he is so hyper and full of energy. 4 major papers. If you go to his office hours he is TREMENDOUS help! Should have done it all year. He is funny and will deff keep you laughing.  I am for sure taking him for any future english class that i can GREAT teacher,1
"Took him for orgo 1 online for COVID. He put the class onto a strict bell curve based solely on scores on two tests and a final that did not have feedback or regrades. His lectures, which were all made before class started, were extremely confusing. I learned mostly from the book as no other course materials is given. Avoid at all costs.",0
Final is 40% of grade 3 exams-drops lowest Exams are heavily focused on textbook Required to write a paper that none of the other PS100 classes are asked to do She posts the powerpoints on blackboard but they don't help if you don't go to lecture Tompson is very knowledgeable but her class is a lot of work for an intro to psych class,1
exams are difficult,0
Dude is a rock star.,1
"Professor Garrisi is by far the best instructor I have had in my two years at OCC. She stands for 4 hours (I had her for a 4 hour block, 4 credit class) and never sits down and teaches. We get to speak all during class in Japanese. If this is a problem, don't take her. You will learn to speak Japanese without realizing it. I love her!",1
By far the best chem Professor Ive had. If given the opportunity I would definitely take her again. Studying is necessary to pass exams.,1
this had to be one of my worst teachers. she doesnt help and expects you to know everything. she makes a simple subject very difficult. i would never recommend her,0
Dr. Sweet is SO sweet no pun intended. She is passionate about what she teaches and has lots of experience. She has a nice sense of humor and is just a positive person. If you do the weekly assignments and give effort you will do fine.,1
"This professor is way too hard to understand. He has a heavy accent and also goes way too fast for the average person, sometimes he even loses his self in the midst of the lesson. I do not recommend anyone to take this class. There is a good chance for an A if you can actually keep up with him, but other than prepare to fail.",0
"indecisive , boring, not very smart",0
"Had her for Spring semester. She's easy but not very clear, she's also very confusing says one thing then says another the next day. She loves doing free writes. That's all you do and hand them in for a letter grade. I disliked her way of teaching.",0
"He's the man, definitely the best IR professor I've ever had BU. He is good at explaining concepts and sometimes tell stories of his diplomat time. The exams are easy. Totally recommend his class.",1
"I really enjoyed his class. He's helpful and made the material interesting, gothic literature is by far more interesting when he pairs it up with creative writing projects and comic books. In all honesty, he only seems vague and unclear at times because no one ever speaks up. He's trying his best, which is what I appreciate. ",1
His class is completely disorganized. I took this class for two semesters and not once did he follow the syllabus and the material on BB is only for his marketing classes. His lectures are very random and have nothing to do with what is on exam. The lowest he will give you is a B- so I guess it's an easy grade but you get nothing out of the class.,0
"WORST teacher I have ever taken. Very rude, and super unclear. Half of the class time would be spent would be spent going completely off topic and talking about her personal experiences (interesting but NOT related to anatomy or things to help us study). Never learned anything from lecture. Tests are timed and have 5 chapters per test. DONT TAKE IT",0
Avoid her at all cost.,0
"not the best professor i ever had, not tht worst. she teaches the first few weeks then for the rest of the semester students do a lesson each as though they were teaching in an esl classroom. there isnt any discussion about the student lessons so we just spend most of the class answering dumb questions other students ask about whatever they teach",1
"Great teacher, hard to understand. He knows what he talking about, but limited with his English. Still a great guy, i would have him again if possible.",1
"Dr. Barnes is really funny and passionate but for a required freshmen course, she grades way too harshly on speeches. She doesnt realize we arent all communication majors. Also her stories are funny and interesting but classes are pointless because she spends 5 minutes on the material and then talks about herself and her family the whole class",0
"You have to at least skim the readings and show up, if you do you will get an A. Go talk to her early in the semester even if you are doing fine. She will go out of her way for people who show some interest/effort.",1
"Very confusing. You only use the notes you take in class for about 4 different extremely difficult tests throughout the semester. They will do you no good on the weekly online quizzes. I thought he was okay as a person and he seems to know his stuff, but hes not a good professor.",0
"He's the only teacher for the Geography Lab classes offed at Dixie, but I advise you to not take that class at all.  It's a one credit class that's harder than the actual lecture.  He is not helpful or clear with any of his labs.  The tests were so hard that our entire class had to help each other to try to pass it.  Worst teacher I've had here.",0
He is very enthusiastic about what he teaches and he is all about the students. He gives great tips and lets you do all of your assessments in a group,1
He is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. All he does is wastes people's time with the stupid videos he plays which are unrelated to the topic.,0
"Students should only take this course if they are serious about working in the medical field. Dr. S provided weekend classes to further explain the material.  Read the book, his PowerPoints, watch CrashCourse on YouTube, take advantage of LearnSmart features.  You will study your ass off but you will KNOW the material very well and feel prepared",1
"She deducts points fast!  I wish she inspired me and all the other students in class.  Even though I passed with an A, I would recommend any other student to take another instructor.",0
"The professor had many students that found the material challenging and does not try to explain the material thoroughly. I attended his office hours and even that was useless. He told me because Im not doing so well, that I should try again next semester with a smile on his face. I would not recommend taking his class unless you already know the m",0
"strict grading,very strict on attendance. it's true, he does teach straight from the book, and he is a little overrated on this site. don't like him, but don't hate him. okay as a person, not necessarily as a teacher.",0
"She was clear in her expectations for the class, but her midterm and final exams didn't match the content of the chapter tests. Pretty much be prepared to memorize the whole book!",0
"I personally hated him, because of his waste of class time, didn't stick to the syllabus and seemed pretty stuck up and rude. It would be an interesting class no matter who's teaching it- I would avoid Chaahan.",0
"STAY AWAY!!! from this lady do not take her online for math because she barely explains anything, she just gives you the text book to read and expects you to know. She also is very rude when you ask her about extra credits.",0
"Though she was a sweet professor, many of her lectures are very unclear. Even when I asked her for help via email, she did not clarify any of my questions. Going to office hours didn't help too much either. Hope for a good TA and go to them for help.",0
"Professor Peters is great at explaining everything and doesn't rush through things. its easy to ask her questions as she responds very well, she does not respond to emails at all. my advise it to NOT miss class",1
"Chef is amazing he's tough but fair he make sure you get through the tasks very nice person he's retiring this year, we will miss you chef you kept me in school thank you I almost dropped out",1
This class was one of the most disorganized classes I have ever been in.  She tells you one thing and does another or marks in another way.  I don't recomend this class to anyone.,0
"Such a boring Professor. He is a nice guy, yet he is VERY monotoned. Also when he is going over the PowerPoints, he doesn't elaborate at all. I could not tell you a single that that we are talking about in this class. Tests and homework are easy though and the book is expensive.",0
"Here's the deal. If you enjoy astronomy, this class is great. Its a lot of stuff you've learned in HS and before. In my case, I always went to class but did other work. He givea you all the questions word for word on the test in the guides. Google questions, get answers, memorize and get A.  5 mandatory, random attendance. Drops lowest test. ",1
"Not a difficult class, just lots of work. Reading, bi-weekly essays and quizzes, one midterm and a final. Midterm is easy and essays are not difficult to get As on. The TAs pretty much do everything in the class). Espo is such a terrible professor. He spends 80% of class just reading the book and doesn't say anything relevant. Will fall asleep.",0
"Worse 101 to take @ NYIT. Do not take this professor, she gives at least 4 pages of notes per class. Makes you write essays from a book with garbage. Her mid term and final are stupid, you won't learn anything here. You be better off in a English class than her trash class. Oh yeah btw she has a project which is stupid along with final so GL.",0
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Very confusing, due dates are not clear, the syllabus makes no sense. He gives you 50 questions to do in 40 minutes for the exam. The directions for the exam are horrible. ",0
"Jade is a great professor! She cares about the success of her students and wants them to do well. Quizzes are much easier than her tests. One downfall is her multiple choice tests. I studied and still never passed them. The objectives don't prepare you for her tests. However, you can submit test corrections for a better grade which help",1
Very good explanation of material,1
"He was fun, entertaining, and kept the class interested. He was also incredibly helpful to those who struggled. He even took the entire class out to dinner for study time, in preparation to the final exam. That was the best, because everyone felt at ease to ask questions. He is a great teacher.",1
"he is an amazing teacher and really cares about his students. he gave me a second chance when i messed up in his class. very fair and understanding. loves what he's teaching, and will make you feel welcomed right away. wish i could take more courses with him.",1
"Why are you worried about taking this class/professor? You're a senior at WSU! You should know how to write proper English regardless of your background. I want to take this challenging course and professor. I want to learn. AND, he helps you if you ask. Want to go to grad/med school? Take this course. He will help you. Yes, he helps YOU. Thanks.",1
"Grading criteria was not clear. Gives extra credit, but she won't post it online. So, it is hard to tell if she's really applying them to your grade.  Not very helpful. When explaining something, it was confusing.",0
"Good prof, good ideas, hard to keep up with sometimes. Helpful guy though and generates enthusiasm, Tests not representative of any in class questions, could be vague and grading criteria subjective",1
"Gives tons of reading and writing, oblivious to your time. Thinks his class is the only thing you do with your life. Boring lecture, very repetitive, monotone voice. Grades and does not explain why you got a grade",0
"Professor Dodson is absolutely amazing! Even with doing an online class, she was a great help. The discussion board is the key to her classes (at least online). Statistics is hard but she made it fun and as easy as can be to learn.  I highly recommend her!!",1
"Worst proffessor EVER. All she talks about Is her family and how she lived in Spain, without understanding that no one cares. Always makes you participate and if you pronounce something wrong while speaking out she makes you look dumb. Gives a lot of hard test, you must complete the online homework, and you can only miss 2 classes. DONT DO IT",0
Shes incredible .  Amazing lectures and is hilarious and also keeps you entertained . Her class is basically a big open discussion . Id take her class over and over !,1
I took this class as a distance learning course from Armwood.  The professor never replied to any form of communication and was not at all understanding when I was unable to upload videos of my speeches due to internet restrictions at school and deadlines conflicting with mandatory afterschool activities.,0
"He's great to take for an animation class, but when you suck at drawing, you better drop the class. He is absolutely impossible to talk to outside of class, and his classroom wasn't the greatest focus environment for me, so I only attended if there was something important. He doesn't really tell you what he grades on either. Just gives you a grade.",0
"She obviously has a great amount of subject knowledge and personal experience with Asian studies, but she is a very poor presenter. Her lectures are long, boring, scattered. Use Wikipedia if you want to know what's going on. ",0
"Go ahead if you want to see how a professor can destroy the interest for a student who might at first want to consider majoring in mathematics. Her criteria in the exam (and yes, she doesn't have a grader, don't know whether it's a coincidence) is nonsense. You won't know how to get full marks even if you finish many other advanced math courses.",0
"Dr. Keeling is obviously knowledgable about toys and games.. but she changed the topic of the class after registration from a topic I was interested into toys so I went from being really interested into the class to not. She is an okay grader for papers, but a lot of the class is busy work. Participate lots bc its part of your grade.",0
"Overall, lectures are really boring, quizes are fairly easy if you watch the boring movies, essays are ok and no makeup or extra credit. Rather take a different class. Dont take this class unless mandatory.",0
Dr. Little's Cultural Anthropology class is completely unfair and ridiculous. His test are all short answer and he does not clearly specify what is going to be on the test. (The test are 12 chapters long) There is only one way to do things in his class and it is HIS way. I would not recommend taking him as a professor for any course at CIU.,0
"This class is all quizzes and tests. Horrible professor, constantly slandering students. You have to read the chapters and show up to class, to get a good grade.",0
Susott is a great professor. You can tell that he is really passionate about history and wants his students to pass. There are three papers assigned in this class but they are not difficult if you put In the effort.  Don't forget to take the online quizzes he assigns every other week. I definitely recommend him for  this class.,1
"Don't buy the text book. You will not use it. His grading is ridiculous. He was absurd with grading, he would do one on one sessions for your essays, make corrections, then mark you down on your final draft once completed. Even though he made those changes. Hes absolutely hysterical. Just make sure you're a unicorn in your writing to get just a C",0
Very passionate about the subject and knows a lot. Uses  interesting stories to emphasize what we are learning. Very upbeat and easy to stay interested for a three hour class.,1
"I absolutely hated this class and the professor.  His tests are horrible and super hard.  The fact that he does not give detailed study guides doesn't help study for his tests.  If you are the type of person who does not test well, but makes up for your grade by extra credit and homework, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Hated this class.",0
"I took intro to Journalism thinking it would be he basics in journalism, it was the farthest from that she acted like we already had a background in journalism which many of us did not, I endned up dropping the class. do not go into her class expecting to just learn the basics, and she is very particular on her editing, she critiques too much!",0
"I had him online for summer 2020. He is awful. His recorded lectures are him just reading off of his slides. I stopped watching because it was better to read the textbook and make my own notes myself. When asking him questions, he is unclear and I feel like he doesn't really listen to the full question. Quizzes are brutal; exams are fair. Beware!",0
"Dr. Guerriero is such a sweetheart! Although her class is a little dry at times, she definitely knows what she is talking about, and I learned a lot in her class! I would definitely recommend her if you WANT TO TEACH special ed! If you want to teach gen ed, she may be a little boring to you.",1
"she is a tough grader only because she likes you to give lots of detail. I wrote 2 papers and got deducted points for not referencing correct y she's very picky- follow her guide to a T. IT IS A MUST to make it to class, she's very passionate about what she teaches and that is good to have, if you have questions she will go over it slowly 4 u.",1
"Very good lecturer. Has a very expansive understanding of the real world application of the lecture material which made lectures more entertaining. Class was difficult by nature, but he gave tons of optional resources and very clear solutions/lecture notes, so even if you didn't understand everything from lecture there were other methods to learn.",1
She is a hard grader and gives a lot of work.,0
the average class grade on his exams is ALWAYS failing and he advertises a 20 point curve in his syllabus. The fact that he HAS to give a 20 point curve should tell MTSU that he can't teach and no one learns anything. Avoid this professor.,0
"Have not gotten through the semester yet - wish I had taken this course from another professor. She is nice, but a snail could cover the material faster.",1
"Grades distributed to be 50% from 2 midterms and 50% from a final. Medians for both midterms in the 50s, and curves the final median grade to a C+. Every lecture was on multiple or one huge proof, and hopefully you're lucky and study the right ones that are on the midterm/final. No practice tests or hints of what would be on the tests. Confusing.",0
She is smart and knows her stuff. No doubt about that and she is a good person at heart but I wish she could at least see how it is for first time learners when it comes to micro. We don't have a PhD in that field and need more time then what was given to UNDERSTAND. I took anatomy and so much other required classes for nursing major. I couldn't de,0
Hes good people through and through.,1
"I got news for those of you who were angry about her making you see plays. EVERY theatre class at Ramapo requires you to see plays. If you don't want anything to do with theatre, don't take a theatre class. GOSH!",1
I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,0
"He gives many readings but those are easy and fun readings. You will do well if you read the weekly materials that he's given. He is an easy grader, so that really helps. He always tries to help and he always responds back.",1
No interest in teaching and not accessible to students . His exam questions will be having no relation to his lecture or practice exams.,0
"Carlos is super nice, has his quirks (i.e. his rhythmic talking and random yay's) but that makes him extra cool. He is helpful and understanding. the class can run too long and it can get boring but i have no interest in the subject plus i grew up with the language.",1
"Pia is hilarious. Best spanish teacher I've ever had. She is very clear in her teaching, but not necessarily in her english speaking... She's very accommodating and helpful.",1
Tries to throw you off on exams. Didn't round up my grade when it was within 0.4%,0
"Dr. Meshelemiah is great! I had to take her class for my minor and it' my favorite class I have taken in college thus far. She makes class really fun, and takes it seriously. She has true passion for the occupation of social work and will show that starting the first day of class. She only teaches 230, so if you have the chance take her!",1
"Amazing TA. I had her at York a year ago. Makes you work for your grades, but she is a fair marker. Good sense of humour and classes are fun and engaging. Too bad she left York and is now teaching at Trent. I will miss her.",1
"He's not the worst, not the best. Chemistry is not an easy subject. Lectures can be boring. He has an accent so sometimes he's hard to understand. He comes off as being rude sometimes. He has a pet peeve about headphones. He's a fair grader. It seems like he wants his students to be successful. Better than some of the other CHEM 131 professors.",0
"I loved her teachings. I had her for a hybrid course so there was a lot of submitting and papers but they were very interesting because they had to do with children. Also be prepared to present a lot. It was kind of exhilerating to present and I think it helped a lot of my classmates', as well as, my own confidence in front of adult crowds. ",1
"Be prepared to do A LOT of homework (2-4 MyMathLab sections) and 1 quiz each week! Unlimited attempts with the homework, and 2 attempts for each quiz. Straight forward, the homework and quizzes are graded so heavily that you absolutely CAN pass with at least a C- even if you bomb the exams. DO YOUR HOMEWORK until you get 100%, quizzes based on HMWK",1
"She is an extremely tough grader. I even went to the writing center a few times for her class and she still found fault in my papers, however she is nice and cares to get to know students.",0
I would never in my life take this class again.. If you don't write your papers in his writing style then you can best believe you're not going to get a good grade in this class. He's rude and I did not find his lectures to be interesting. I would never in my life recommend this class to anyone... even if there aren't any other classes available.,0
"Dr. Yamazaki is a very knowledgeable teacher and knows the information she is teaching. Occasionally she has a hard time putting the information into understandable terminology instead of bio/physio jargon. She will help her students as much as she can, but you need to put in the work and asks questions if you have them",1
Do well on all the homework and excel projects. Do his review sheets. His exams are somewhat difficult but if you understand the hw youll be fine. Hes quite responsive to emails as well. Decent class for acc,1
"I took Melissa twice, both in Winter 2019 for ENGL101 and Fall 2019 for ENGL102. She was my favorite professor throughout Clark and she really cared about her students' success. She really connects with her students and helps them throughout the term. Instead of just ghosting with emails, she'll write back in a positive manner! 10/10 Professor!",1
Why is she still teaching?????!!!,0
"Probably the worst professor  I have had so far at Schulich (MBA). Clearly isn't well suited to teach the MBA curriculum, as all he knows are theories, but has difficulty relating back to relevant work scenarios. AVOID - take with Friendman.",0
"This was an easy A class. Lectures were boring, but if you go to class and actually try to pay attention (and study a bit) you shouldn't have a problem getting a good grade. Homework was due once every two weeks and very easy. He can be funny at times, but don't expect a really interesting subject where you actually learn something.",1
"Dr. Beckman's classes are not only interesting, but extremely useful in the real world. Highly recommend the program and miss being in his classes.",1
Ethan is a great professor! ENES 100 is designed to be a very challenging course for students early in their engineering journey. Don't be too disappointed if you don't actually understand what is happening. Be sure to go to office hours. He's super accessible outside of class. He truly wants every one of his students to succeed. You'll learn a lot,1
"Currently in the class. We just got our first exam back and I got a C. But, apparently, 19 people failed it- an exam that is purportedly the easiest of the semester. Material is DIFFICULT and he did an absolutely horrible job at preparing us for the test. When I chose to sign up for this glass I wish I would've read a review like my own. STAY AWAY!",0
He is a nice and funny guy but I would not take him again. He acts like he offers so much help but really doesn't. You really need to know your stuff to pass this class.,0
My favorite professor that I've had at App so far. I was eager to come to every one of his classes just because you could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching. Everything we learned was eye-opening and important and useful in order to go out into the world and to be a good person. Definitely take him even if you're not an anthro major.,1
"Mrs. Wang is the best math professor ever, no kidding/exaggeration. Her lectures are perfectly concise and she will do ANYTHING to help you master the material. She set up study halls on Saturdays for students who wanted to come in for more help (everyone benefiting from everyone else's questions). Correct ur mistakes on tests for half credit.",1
"Literally the worst professor I have ever experienced. Thank the heavens she isn't going to be teaching again. Mary Lou was 10x better, make phonetics great again. Shen is rude, doesn't know how to teach and even barked at a student for asking too many questions",0
"Really knowledgeable professor about the field of journalism, has practical field experience to share and will match you with a career path to start working toward while still in school based on your strengths. Helped me to obtain scholarships as well!",1
"I took this professor for Calc 114 and am having a blast! He is funny, gives lots of hw (all really great because the quizzes are FROM THE HW!) and the tests are similar to the hw and quizzes. He lets you know what you need to learn and everything. I have absolutely loved this class and the prof. He is always available after class. 10/10 recommend.",1
The text book is so much better than her lecturing. The class is pretty cool and straightforward. Just read the textbook and go through the example problems and you will do well. A lot of students do very well. Make sure you can integrate well (double integrals too).,0
"Dr. Lee is such a nice person but I would not take his class again. His exams are so hard, I failed every one. HIs lectures don't help, you are basically teaching yourself. Nobody even shows up to class. You have to read the chapter before class and that doesn't even help. Maybe tutoring would have helped me. HARDEST CLASS, PICK SOMEONE ELSE!",0
The best math professor that Ferris has to offer for pre-calc. I have struggled with math as long as I can remember. I retook this class cuz I failed with a different professor. He taught me so much that pre-calc became easy for me he is a real gem if you can get him then do it! Even though he offers 8 am classes it's worth it!!!!,1
"Professor Cho talks very fast during her lectures, and if you miss one you will be lost. There are 3 exams and they're worth about 70% of your final grade. Her lectures are long and difficult to understand. I don't recommend this class to anyone.",0
the way she thinks is so ridiculous. I can hardly believe that I willingly signed up for such a class. She also sometimes thinks that your not right when in reality you are.,0
"Spends most of class time speaking in useless anecdotes. Doesn't provide edited copy. I'm 90% sure most of his comments on work are just copy+pasted into Canvas. Clearly tries to insert his political biases into grading, and I'm on the left as well. He's not boring, but if you plan to learn anything, or need to write in future classes, avoid.",0
"Ryan is hilarious, caring, and knowledgeable. He does many things to ensure as many students pass as possible. But he seems to cover advanced topics for a course with no prerequisites, and his explanations are rapid and lack clarity. I suspect he's over teaching this class. The open note tests are the hardest I've taken ever, & I used every minute.",1
"Dr. Britton is one of the absolute best teachers I've ever had. Her lectures were engaging and interesting, and a lot of that has to do with her excitement about the subject. If you attend lectures and discussion, read the book, and study for tests you can get an A fairly easily. I miss her class already- she's absolutely brilliant. ",1
"I took Activism, Participation, and Protest with Professor Alvarez and I have to say that I am not impressed. I think she lets her personal political opinions get in the way. Her ""lectures"" are confusing and there are way too many group collaborations on the readings. (There are SO many readings). She's a smart person, though, which is nice to see.",0
"I hate to say this but she is honestly the worse professor I've ever taken. I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic, but I've never seen an instructor more disorganized before in my life. She constantly goes back and forth between topics in labs, and is very hard and agitating to follow along to. Also, very much condescending!!",0
"duane is a very smart teacher, he sure knows his stuff but he can be kind of stuck up but thats what you get for being a science geek. duane is a great teacher i really enjoy going to his class your awsome duane",1
"Read the book, do the online anatomy revealed homework, and come to class. Study for the test, and you will make an A. Mrs. Langille is very passionate about biology, and that makes this class worth taking. There are no trick questions only straight forward you know it or you dont.",1
She does not care if you go to her office hours and show that you are really trying in the class. I had what I thought was a good relationship with her and she still gave me a C. She screams in class a and you cant understand her that well at times. I would never take her again. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!,0
"Easy class, there was supposed to be 4 exams but he just got rid of one because of no time. Makes you buy the textbook but doesn't use it is class. 4hour class per week but only had 2 hours of class every lesson due to his personal problems. Highly recommend this professor for students who want to get an easy A but don't care about computer science",0
Good lectures. I leave feeling worse about myself though. Never considered myself to be a sensitive person. He has said negative things directed towards me. Shows favoritism and very judgmental. I felt it from the start but wanted to challenge myself but its hard when he talks down to the class like saying he was dumbing it down for the class.,0
I did not like the fact that I couldn't understand her with her accent so it was very frustrating. I am good at math and I couldn't do it so I had to drop her class and get a better professor.,0
We know you use a hair dryer.  What What What a hair dryer?  Great Instructor.,1
horrible...,0
"Horrible teacher. I took him for Biology 100 and hated every second of the lecture. I ended up with an F and nothing but a big headache. I don't advise this class unless you are a Bio major because he wants you to MASTER biology. He has 5 tests, grades them based on perfection, and your overall grade is based solely on the test.",0
"Nice lady, but she is not a good prof. Takes days to respond to emails, and it is very difficult in general reaching out to her outside of class, even when she has office hours. The group project is challenging, and I don't recommend her as a prof.",0
"Professor King ,makes a boring subject a lot more fun. I really enjoyed the class and her teaching style. She really wants to see her students succeed.",1
makes you speak in front of the class a lot. tough and expects you to learn spanish almost immediately,0
"This class was easy until we got to resumes. She told me to take off all my non-history related job experiences on mine. When it came to the mock interview, she said I didnt have enough on my resume. Her criticism was not helpful in any way. I could get into detail but there arent enough characters. Not accommodating at all given COVID going on.",0
"5wk summer course. I highly recommend taking this class if you are looking for a simple class. It was one discussion post every week, 1 response to a classmate, 1 journal every week, and 1 quiz every week. For the quizzes, i wrote down page numbers next to bold headings and got all A's without reading chapters. Legit strategy! klatzke was great!",1
DO NOT take this teacher. He treated me so bad and it was only my first semester. He blamed me for his mistakes countless of times and had always called me out for mistakes he made on my page.  i have never disliked a teacher so much in my entire life. & i wouldn't want any one to be put in this class.,0
"Dr. Li is difficult to understand at fIrst, he doesn't use necessary key words in his speech. Class requires alot of studying, and lots of patients when it comes to drawing the plant cells in lab. Hard class if you don't put in the time for it.",0
"Took this class from 6:15 to 9:15 at night 1 day a week. Never kept us later than 9. Book is not necessary unless you need to do extra credit. No need to take notes, but you do need to attend. After so many absences you fail the class. Gives you all you need for the test all you have to do is study. Gives points for being there. She is very sweet !",1
The class was interesting. There are a lot of movies & clips to watch/choose from.  If you want a good grade you really have to work for it. The essays are really challenging. There are quizzes on each module. The discussions & essays are peer reviewed first. The papers are based on a designated movie or you watched.,1
"This teacher is very good at teaching her dance steps as well as always caring about you as a person. Her class is fun , relaxing and a great break from a full day of hard classes, homework, and studying. I would highly recommend her and her courses because she is a great break from a hard day. Class requirements are get shoes and two write essays.",1
"Personally I didn't like the format of his quizzes but I still learned a lot from his lectures. His presentations were cool and the videos that were shown are neat. He's too nice about people skipping quizzes... he lets you take them at a later date, which isn't fair to everyone. Overall, he's a good history professor.",1
"He is one of the worst teachers at the school to take math with. He is not helpful at all the way he grades is tough. If you don't do it his way then he marks it wrong, even if you have the right answer . This was the only class i didn't pass this semester I got all B's in my other classes.",0
"If you are interested in German, take her class! She makes sure that you understand and won't move on until you do. I've already signed up for her class next semester because she is such a great instructor.",1
"He really knows his stuff and his lectures are very clear. He assigns classwork that really helps prepare you for the tests. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's very approachable and willing to help. For whatever reason, his teaching methods really clicked with me. I highly recommend his classes.",1
Great teacher and adviser,1
"Do not under any circumstances take this course online over the summer. There is a lot of forum responses to be made; however, the biggest problem is that he expects them to be done basically on the daily and you can't do them ahead of time. This made my weeks miserable as I couldn't go anywhere after work bc I had to go home and write a response.",0
Dr. Ben is great. He has good sense of humor so lectures arent boring. Info is thorough and hes very accessible if you have Question during or outside of class. Do the readings and assignments youll do well,1
"As an English major, I have never disliked an English class as much as I did this one, with this professor.",0
Great teacher. She personally called me to make sure that I knew what I was supposed to be doing.,1
"Went into the class thinking it would be really enjoyable, but I was wrong. He grades extremely harshly and is extremely abrasive. Not a nice dude and don't even try fighting for your points back because that wont happen.",0
"Doesn't care about you, your life, or your grade. Lets the book and lab work do all the teaching.",0
"Only a ""good"" teacher if you already know the material, which defeats the purpose. You have to buy the $90 MyMathLab access code to do homework, and the program is terrible and frustrating to work with. On top of that, she has a hard to understand accent, likes to randomly yell at the class, and only gives extra credit to her favorites.",0
"I have my Bachelors now and Monica was hands down the BEST professor I ever had between UIUC and Parkland. She was accessible for help, didn't make you waste time learning things you didn't need, and was thorough. She was very go with the flow and let us make the class our own in that she would give us options for the timeline of things. 15/10 lady",1
I took scientific inquiry for science majors. It was very easy and watered down. PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS because this stuff is applicable in later life. Don't just take this class to get it out of the way,1
Annoying and hard to listen to. For the love of god say the word verBs. Its not verVs. Her class was a mistake to take. Expects you to have gotten 100% in Spanish 12 when you're not even allowed to take it with span 12. Makes stupid jokes that aren't funny. Mainly talks about how much she loves random celebrities and how old she is,0
"Things aren't always clear when students do the readings, but Prof. Duina does such an amazing job clearing everything up and talking about theorists. LOVE DUINA, take a course with him. And he's sexy.",1
"If you are looking for an easy A, don't take the class. She is an amazing teacher who prepares you for future medical programs. I would say this was the one class that I actually learned from. She will go above and beyond to help those that want to learn, but if you don't to learn, don't bother sticking around.",1
"She is very smart and quite demanding. The text is hard even for native speakers (I met one on an airplane and asked for help interpreting). There is a lot of writing, like 3-5 pages, in french. Her english communication is not great so it's hard to ask questions for clarification. She'll never remember your name, even with only 8 people in class.",0
"Ms. Lee is a true professional who helps students to understand what is the lecture about. She is very meticulous on how you answer the math problems, but she still gives points even if the final answer was wrong. It's how you understand and process the question. She also offers a lot of extra credits to help you to pass in the exams.",1
"Worst class I have taken at MCC. Lots of homework, impossible lectures, no study guide (you are on your own between book info, online homework info, lecture info and info she assumes you know from previous classes. SAVE YOUR GPA AND DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She is rude to students during class. After having to deal with her I am changing my major.",0
"In my opinion, the worst professor out there. He is really immature. Acts like some kind of stand up comedian. Says **** jokes. Found him **** on campus and acting like a ****(Many witnesses). Tests are a joke. They are all opinion based. No right or wrong answers. He assigns you a random grade out of the blue.",0
"Professor Hinshaw is a genius!! He knows so much nformation, he can answer everything and give examples of studies for EVERYTHING! The midterms are tough since there is so much material, he expects a lot but he's an awesome professor!!",1
"Professor Brown is amazing!! The workload is heavy but his lectures are so informative & you can really tell he knows his stuff, so even though there's a lot, I respect it. He's been really forgiving about grading during COVID. He even made us an all-black artist playlist in honor of BLM. I'd recommend him to anyone. You'll learn a lot from him.",1
Professor Ortiz is very clear about what she wants. She's very helpful as long as you ask her questions after class. Has an extensive knowledge of ELLs and the school system. Flexible with deadlines. There is a lot of reading but you'll learn a ton and come away from the class with a new outlook on students. A great professor and a great class.,1
"Today in class this professor threatened a student who was talking out of turn: ""if you keep talking, the next thing you'll get is the clop!"" She did this twice. If you want a teacher who threatens violence to her students, by all means take her class. You should also know that her teaching methods are ancient, outdated, and often ill advised.",0
"Very unorganized, the whole blackboard site was very unorganized and professor didnt post some of the information that was supposed to be on there. When students asked questions in class she would say she didnt have time to answer, yet went on tangents about her personal life and stuff that had nothing to do with the material.",0
Of his 5 exams expect to spend 5 hours on each exam. Be happy if you get a 50% on the exam because that wont happen very often. Your grade is weighed 90% on the 5 exams and you will not remember anything from this class when your done. Dustin is nice and can teach but nothing that he teaches will resemble that which will be on the exam,0
Dr. Kosin is an awesome professor. His lectures are very specific and he explains  the subject very well. He puts a lot of time into his work. His availability is accessible. He really works with his students until they understand the material.,1
"Attendance is mandatory in this class, you will loose points from your final grade for each unexused absense. Lectures were boring, but there were no exams or assignments. Final grade will be dased on your attendance and 3 papers. I found this class to be an easy A, but if you don't like writing don't take the class. I didn't really use my textbook",1
"Gives ok notes and examples are mostly from the book. If you can learn by yourself, then you don't need to go to lecture. exams are like homework/in class examples but are still different. did a little below averages for midterms not sure about the final and ended up with a C with the curve.",1
"First of all, its not the easiest class in the world, and it certainly didnt help that Rayburn didnt seem to care to actually TEACH the material...pretty much he just told you to do it and whether you not you already knew how to do it or not didnt matter. Hopefully if you take this class, you are able to look at the book and just teach yourself...",0
"My favorite professor. Took her for ACC 311 and was genuinely expecting to hate accounting but DJB made it awesome. Teaches clearly and effectively, is hilarious in lecture, and will do everything she can to help you understand material. I would do my homework outside her office just so I could pop in and ask questions if I had any. Truly the best",1
Tests are impossible...he tells you to review homework problems but the questions on the exams are much harder and never relate.  I studied for weeks for a test and failed miserably.  And then there's lecture...  He's unable to teach the topic to students who only take his class because it's required for their major.  Avoid his class at all costs.,0
Great class.,1
"Heavy course load!  Great teacher, instant help in most cases, assignments are clearly worded, very helpful.",1
"Easy A, don't buy the book because EVERYTHING is online. The downside is that he never grades anything so prepare for that. I think he plays the whole ""disorganized"" thing up. WileyPlus take a bit of getting used to but for not having to buy a book and just pay for this online and skate through his class for an easy A, I'll deal with it.",1
"Professor Sullivan is a great teacher, but lectures can be confusing and boring. You have to read the books to understand the discussions. He gives mini quizzes on the readings which aren't too bad and often open for interpretation. Read the material and pay attention during lecturesdiscussions and you should be fine! ",1
"Nick Harland was a great prof. He converted the online learning of MATH 1500 very well, where you would follow through a set of established problems he made. I found his lecture videos to be a little dry. Homework wasn't bad, just put in some effort and you should be fine. He's also easily accessible outside of class. Take a class with him if u can",1
"Prof. Webb is so obsessed with his lectures, which renders them boring, irritating and ill-informative. He takes his job way too seriously for a GenEd!3 exams (essay portions) 3 essays, a film review, a presentation, a film every week that you must watch to participate in class, which accounts for 5% of your grade. I do not recommend him at all.",0
"He doesn't do much to help the class engage in his material. I thought this class was going to be really exciting since it was about Gandhi and his legacy, but he relied soooo much on papers and documents that he basically just threw at us to read for ourselves with little explanation. There were hardly any assignments and no exams. Very hard class",0
He is a good teacher and the self portraits from first vs last week of class showed a lot of improvement however the quiz of the names of the muscles and bones I found pointless and I feel like he definetly favored the people that were already good at drawing bodies. Hes a nice guy though,1
"Does not read discussion boards, so unsure as to how the grading works",0
"You should take Professor Cote if you love science in general and chemistry in particular. The things you will learn and the study habits you will develop will prepare you to succeed in your future classes. You have to ask yourself if you are ready to get serious about your education. Otherwise, take another section and short-change yourself.",1
I just want everyone to know this professors is not helpful at all. Totally doesn't care about students. Why is allowed to teach?,0
"she is a nice woman, means well, however: she is a VERY VERY POOR teacher. In fact, she doesnt teach. she goes over grammer in the book. explains horribly. responds to every question with: ""IT JUST IS"". though she is very knowledgable (speaks over 6 languages!) she is NOT recommended.",0
I took this class online. She didnt write the lectures or the quizzes/tests and that fact alone is absolutely ridiculous. I emailed her several times throughout the course to understand trick questions and she would say that the concept had been taken out or it WAS a weird question and still wouldnt give credit. Too tedious.,0
Professor King is awesome. great vibes great teacher great hair!! really cares about students .,1
"I took intro to calc in high school, and good thing I did because his teaching style was so hard to understand. Gives you one to two examples depending on the topic in his lectures, but you don't even get tested on those kinds of examples? Talked like that sloth from zootopia I'd rather bang my head on the wall than listen to him.",0
"Overall the lectures felt rushed and I felt the weight of the class all on my shoulders throughout the semester. He was not approachable/helpful. No study guide for hard tests. Way too much info, not enough teaching, lectures seem lazily put together, lectures have no structure and are all over the place. 10 year is the reason he's still teaching",0
"Instructor was inaccessible all semester, checked in once a week in a 6 week course, which led to a lot of assignments with no submit links, or being posted the day before they were due. Assignments are convoluted busy work, that she grades harshly for something she isn't available for questions about. Students had to answer each others ? instead.",0
I would never in my life take this professor again. Like seriously! Even if Salt Lake Community College would pay me millions I would NEVER do it.!,0
"I enjoyed prof Haucks lectures and his ability to talk about genetics in simple terms.  I was a health science major, but switched to biology because of his passion for genetics and science and education.",1
"This class contains  lots of participation and group projects.  Attendance really matters in her class, if you miss a lecture it is hard for you to pass this class.  The textbooks were used everyday for this class.  DR. Mark went out of her way to help anyone with any questions they may have.",1
Plant Evolution and Diversity. I have nothing good to say about this class or the professor. Grading is almost arbitrary. Impossible to get full credit on ANYTHING besides online quizzes unless he loses your assignment. Took points off a lab I completed for not having a parallel line pointing to 1 plant structure. This class will test your resolve.,0
"In my opinion, Alana gave difficult tests. Other than that, the course was fairly easy as long as you went to class and took notes. Alana is really passionate about music, so it makes it easier to pay attention. She makes even the most boring topics sound ten times more interesting, and she really likes to demonstrate by singing in class.",1
I would definitely recommend her as a prof. She is very clear about HOW you are being graded as well as your progress (unlike my last teacher). She clarifies things very well! Really enjoyed this class despite taking it in the 7 week summer session!,1
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
"Attendance matters a lot in this class, she does a lot of in class assignments so it's fairly easy if you attend class and pay attention. She is definitely one of the more tough grading professors I have had for a writing class. She is pretty straight to the point and rules are strict.",1
"I really like him. Lectures do drag on a little because class is so long, but sometimes they can be very interesting. He is an EXCEPTIONALLY fair grader and does not try to trick you on the tests. Lots of extra credit to help with your overall grade. Lots of required readings, but some are cool. Chill, laid back guy. Definitely would take again!!!",1
Great Proffessor! he is kind and cares about his students. Would definitely take him again.,1
"This professor is very hard to understand, boring to listen to, and his grading is all over the place. He drops your lowest test grade, but the tests are very difficult. Once you realize the tests come from the review, he changes it so that the questions come from nowhere. Do not recommend.",0
"I took two courses with Professor Donato in my first year before transferring to a public university to study political science. Professor Donato is extremely well-informed, humble and transparent. He is very clear about his grading standards, and the classes are manageable if you complete the readings and attend office hours. Use your resources.",1
"Ramey is awesome. He teaches religion where non majors can understand/enjoy it. Weekly quizzes based on previous lecture and reading, but the textbook is just a nonfiction book he likes. Really easy. I rarely read it and did OK. Two group projects, really easy. 4-5 tests, moderately easy. Great lectures, lots of extra credit, really cool dude.",1
"Completely agree with the comments previously made. Being involved with this professor was a terrible experience. The worst prof I've ever had. Mean, dishonest, unwilling to explain, manipulative, sadistic and cruel. A real hell. Very resourceful though and can be kind and presentful when she decides to.",0
"Do you want to feel humiliated? Do you want to cry after class and be stressed out? Do you want to have crazy high expectations in assignments but 0 teaching/guidance? This is your class! For real, stay away.",0
Knows his stuff! Informal lectures and discussions all to focus on what students are interested in. Highly recommend.,1
"Dr. Naresh is not bad but she is not great either. Typically, students get confused alot when she teaches. However, if you are already really good at math then it will be easier to understand her when she teaches. She cares but personally she does not explain concepts well because she expects you to know alot of things already and to catch on fast.",0
"ENV 331 is an intro to sustainability course, but Lisa Jo really knows how to make it about building your awareness on the topic no matter how much you may or may not already know. She cares about her students, she cares about the topic, and she knows how to make you care, too. If you have a chance to sign up for one of her classes, don't hesitate.",1
Great instructor... loves to teach... you can see that in her lectures.. very knowledgeable.... some test take home... but are tough... that's ok because... she is a great motivator...,1
Easy class I guess... but he gives a ton of homework and kind of a picky grader..,0
Professor Morgan is very much so an expert in the journalism field. His class is not too difficult. He can be a bit disorganized but it doesn't affect your grade. He is not a tough grader and is a nice and caring prof. I enjoyed his class.,1
Never taken class with him but hes definitely hot,1
"Worst professor ever. Last time I remembered Im taking intro psychology not an English class. My English class doesnt even make us write as much as she makes us. The discussion feel like essays. She so picky with grades, takes off points for the littlest things. Doesnt even give you feed back. I will never ever take a class with this professor.",0
"The worst prof I have ever had at Mal. He treats students as imbeciles; Duane is both rude and arrogant. He is very opinionated and I felt his lectures to be exceedingly bias.  He added labs and lectures not outlined on the schedule and made them mandatory, so beware, your class schedule will be much more than anticipated!",0
"His lectures are often hard to follow as he goes off on tangents that seem to be unrelated to what is on the powerpoint. Everything he says is referred back to HIS BOOK, felt like the class was just him promoting his books. Gave us a map quiz for 10% of our grade with a different map than was given to study with.",0
"Dr. Weiner is a tough guy to figure out. He can be totally charming and kind, but with the flip of a switch, he can be a real ass.I got stellar grades in his class with the exception of one grade and he failed me because I didnt ask him about the status of my grade (even though it was all on blackboard). Stay as far away from his class as possible",0
Professor Darling was awesome!,1
very passionate and knowledgable,1
"If you are actually looking to learn about Cloud Computing, Professor Auten is your guy. I've never worked with cloud computing professionally, but I did receive some job offers after interviews where I had to talk about a ton of Cloud Concepts (Buckets, AWS, Etc) and I was able to explain them off what I had learned from Professor Auten. Great Guy",1
"She rocks. Really cares about her students. Had high expectations but is very fair. Super helpful, just enrolled in my 3rd class with her.",1
Worst teacher ever. He reads off the slides in a monotone voice. good luck staying awake. does make u feel stupid when u have a question...thanks dick i love F's,0
Lectures are very confusing and work can be hard to follow. I'd recommend taking Differential Equations with someone else.,0
"Christy is extremely smart, but that makes it hard to learn from her. She tends to put assignments on moodle and never tell you about them until they are due. ",0
"Professor Birnbaum is a interesting teacher. He is unorganized with his lectures and grading. All over the place. IF you ask a question he will make you feel incompetent. tests are ridiculous, the study guide barely helps. I would advise taking this class with a different teacher. he ruined my experience of forensics :(",0
"ABORT! ABORT! Has made me work harder than all of my classes combined.  She's a nice person, but you don't want her grading you.  LOTS of graded homework questions every week that'll make your head spin after hours of doing them. Even if your time is well managed, you still wont catch a break. You basically self teach yourself  the entire course.",0
"While extremely intelligent, she expects too much and rewards too few. Her class is completely discussion based, so its critical to read all 150+ pages of journals for each class. Papers are graded harshly with horrible feedback. She clearly cares less about student progression and more about an immediate correct answer. Save yourself the trouble!!",0
Prof Burd is a wonderful professor. She really takes her time to make sure that her students know the material and is always willing to help. Highly recommend professor Burd.,1
"Doesnt use cuLearn to release grades & requires students to hand in hard copies of all assignments which wastes time & is outdated. There is only 1 knowledgeable TA & the others are basically useless. The prof doesnt answer emails professionally, nor is he helpful in office hours or explaining concepts during lecture.",0
Out of all my 18 years in school I have to say that she has been the BEST teacher EVER!! She is so understanding and her lesson plans are easy to follow and this is a class you'll miss 100%!!,1
"Horrible attitude towards students, demeaning, and insulting. Could not wait to get out of that class.",0
"Useless, grades you based off how other people do. You can do really good on a presentation and he won't have any complaints but you will still get a B. Horribly boring. He basically talks to himself the entire class and makes corny jokes that he thinks are hilarious.",0
"First time taking this professor. Above all, I learned a lot about Spanish literature and its awesome writers. It always involve the students hard work in order to get an A. Dr. Hess  is knowledgeable and makes the class interesting and funny. I highly recommend her.",1
"Danny is a really nice guy. There are 10 small assignments and then a final research paper. He was slow to get back grades and hard to reach outside of class but was willing to offer help and answer questions in class. He likes to have discussions in class and he made research methods, a class I was dreading, somewhat enjoyable.",1
"very good teacher , very fair and cares about your grades if you do too.",1
"Dr. Sarah La Belle's passion for ""research methods"" can take a toll on someone. Going to her class everyday was BEYOND the worst experience I have had in my very long time in academia. Do yourself a favor, do not take this class. There are other ways to fulfill the research methods cred (soc295 forsome). You will be saying, what is research method?",0
"Would never EVER take this class again, neither should you. Three classes left with ONE grade entered plus attendance. Talks about personal problems frequently with the excuse for not having papers graded to be ""there was too much negativity reading those."" Honestly just can't believe how terrible this class has been.",0
Literally the worst professor I have ever encountered. Answers no questions and is beyond rude. Would recommend anyone other than her.,0
"I had her for financial accounting so I decided to make her for managerial accounting. That was a big mistake. Throughout the semester, she didn't teach the material and expects you to just study harder. The quizzes and tests are much harder than study guides. She is a nice lady and is willing to help. By the time the semester I was done with her.",0
"I have had Proff Gaffin for about 3 classes now and he's a great professor. No you can't have your cell phone, he will literally give you the exact test question, read the answers in the book to you allowed and all you have to do is pay attention and write it down. He does expect a lot from his students but he gives you everything you need to pass",1
"Love Dr. Callis. One of the nicest guys, always smiling and has some great stories to tell. I suck at pchem, but he was still always super supportive and friendly even though I really didn't do well in his class.",1
Extremely difficult exams. If you want to do well you must come to every class and be ready to write down every word he says because it could be on exam that makes up more than half of your grades. Difficult class for a non-bio major,0
"Grade was based on weekly quizzes and written assignments. All you need is your book for the quizzes. Forget about the onlinein class lectures.  Warning: Class often turns into a group therapy session where students share awkward personal details that relate to topics in class Good teacher, seems bored with teaching, or just Psych 100. ",0
"She is the best Phil professor.  Your grade is composed of 4 forum debates, 4 essays, a midterm, final, and participation. She is there to help you succeed. Go to office hours and she'll give really good feedback. Really really great professor.",1
"Terrible. This prof wasn't engaged at all, just assigned work with not real follow up. Wouldn't take any of his classes again.",0
"Only thing I have to add to this is: she focuses more on poetry than fiction. If you are interested in poetry, take this and she'll teach you how to improve as a poet, but it is also valuable for writers. In fact, on our exam, we were tested only for the poetry readings and poetry terminology; none of the fiction.",1
I love her dank memes giving her the BEST educational knoledges for me btw i go to SDSU,1
He was very rude and set unrealistic goals for the class. I would not recommend anyone to take him!!!,0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS DURING THIS COVID PANDEMIC .His rules for his hard online exams and final are so strict that if you do something wrong intentional or unitentional, his Gradescope will straight up denied it. He also refuse to reply or give any feedback back to your email if you late or have any trouble with his final or exams .",0
Great Teacher! Definitely need to read the chapters each week but he goes over the chapter thoroughly each week. He keeps you for the full 3 hours but he is very helpful and makes sure you understand the chapter,1
"Todd is the most unflexable borish man that may exist on this earth. This is a 1000 level introductory class and yet with the extensive in-class assignements whcih can NEVER be completed using just in class time to the homework whcih may just take you 10 hrs to complete, this class might as well be a 5000 level CS major only class.",0
Class has no structure. He comes in with a vague idea of what he wants to teach and he goes all over the place when he starts teaching. Writing on board is all over the place and it's difficult to understand and follow. Has a lot of proofs that he explains once and himself didn't know what was going to be on the exam. Expects us to upper div math.,0
"She's one of the nicest teachers I've ever had. Half of the class didn't do their homework, and constantly turned in late assignments, but she accepted them anyway. She also gives extra credit for every quiz and test, which consists of doing the homework. If people think this class is hard, it's because they don't pay attention or go to class.",1
"Jean is a great prof. I looked forward to her class every day. She cares about her students so much and clearly cares about quality teaching. On the flip side, I really wasn't challenged during her class, and I dont remember any content from her cass, though she is a great example of what it looks like to really care about students.",1
stay as far away from her! she dose not know how to teach!!!! when students ask questions she just says every one is right and dose not give a complete right answer.... she dose not know what she is talking about and she forgets everything she dose and says...dont take her class you will regret! she is not helpfull and she is soo baD!,0
"laid back cancelled class when he felt like it, just like not showing up, or being an hour late, raised all our grades on a curve, i lucked out and got a B. he was very very relaxed. No homework ever, used text book once entire semester.",0
"I took my inquiry seminar with Professor Bullock. If you want an A, there are better options out there but it's not impossible to get an A from him. He is a very nice guy but a harsh grader who expects a lot out of the revisions if you want an A. His lectures are borningist things on earth and he has a no screen policy so the class time is a grind.",1
"Great lecturer. Class is pretty much from the book. Easy quizzes on assigned reading by contemporary author. However, I went to talk to him during his office hours. Absolutely rude and disinterested. I found him to be enjoyable in the classroom, but absolutely impersonal otherwise. Easy A, if you work for it on your own.",1
"This man was awesome. He was a super nice guy, kind of qwerky, but probably the best professor I've had in a while. While he did his best to make the class interesting, it could get boring every now and then. However, Mr. Todd always did his best to help you succeed, and I would take him again in a heartbeat.",1
Dr Wood is a great professor. Some people will say he is terrible but he is not that bad at all. Yes you must go to class but honestly if you wouldnt you would be lost. His notes are a lifesaver. You get a cheat sheet for every test. If you have questions he will clear them up. The only thing that sucked was the group project. Dont be afraid.,1
"This class is way hard. TAs are very bad, too. If you get nice TA, then you will pass. Do not think about getting A from this class.",0
"He is so cokcy and full of himself. He makes you buy the books he has wrote and read them. THEY ARE SOOOO BORING and crap that no one really cares about. If I were you I would change professors, unless you want to hear about how much money he makes and listen to him belittle other professors.",0
"Professor Wood encourages students to participate with respect to each other. During the semester we did a group, individual, and a short special occasion speech. In all of them she helps us with the process and the writing ideas to make a confident speech. Make sure you talk to the professor whenever you have issues, she is extremely helpful.",1
"I thought she was pretty good. Her lectures are kinda boring. I didnt read the textbook, just do her study guides because its basically the same as the test (I usually found the study guide answers on a quizlet)She says shes a hard grader but I got As on both the papers we had to write. Go to class bc she gives random extra credit!!",1
"EASIEST A EVER!!! I took this course online, therefore, participation in the group discussions are MANDATORY. Not much work, but being this is an online course you're definitely going to be engaging in discussion posts. The final was a reflection paper. Overall, I loved the class and will be taking her this summer",1
"Although he might know what he's talking about, the thing is when he rambles and goes too fast, it's extremely hard to follow!!! Also, his writing onthe board was so hard to read, I barely took notes. So, if there was another teacher to take, I would say take em'. But your SCREWED, cuz he's the only teacher!!! overall, I absolutly HATED this class!",0
he lost my paper and gave me a bad grade,0
Nordling is a very hard professor. His tests are unpassable. He only gives three grades if you mess up one your done. He doesn't tell students what to study or even give hints he just says study the entire first six weeks. If at all possible do not take him.,0
Dr. Dorsett is an extremely funny person and her class is never boring! Her work is no where near easy so you really have to study and pay attention but overall I enjoyed her and her class!,1
"Dr. Tiwari is a truly excellent teacher!  He teaches some of the hardest subjects (in my opinion), and does such a great job of breaking things down for his students to understand.  He was always quick with a joke too which made things not too serious!",1
I took her 8am psych sport class. SOOO BORING. You have to go to class and do the clicker quizzes that she does just about all the time. Her exams are a bit tricky so you have to read the chapters and study her power points to do well. Not much work outside of the exams though.,1
The two average ratings you see above dont accurately reflect this professor. One of the worst math professors at pace,0
"For the first two weeks of class he rambled about non sense. Then for the rest of the semester he splits you into groups and you teach the class the book.  He doesn't teach anything. Each group has to present their chapter for two weeks at a time, and once you get through all the groups, you start over.  Huge time commitment outside of class.",0
"I had an A until the last two weeks of class. Only the auto-graded things were graded and given very little weight like 10%. The term paper wasn't graded before the final exam paper was due so you have no idea how she grades. The things she has to grade (essays, short answer) counted too much and weren't graded until too late to apply feedback! Ugh",0
"As a Professor you expect them to be involved in the course and respond to student questions, this did not happen. Many questions in the virtual office went unanswered and it was almost as if he just didn't care. There are 4 modules in the class, each with 2 assignments and 1 test; so easy A or easy F depending on your test scores. No extra credit.",0
"Readings are interesting! Be prepared with questions and comments, so you can contribute to discussions, as participation is significant part of grade. Most of your learning will happen there, rather than through Prof. Tone. She's very strict about deadlines. Course had potential to be amazing, but Prof. Tone was not very present nor compassionate.",1
"Very poor lecturer. Makes many mistakes and tries to do problems ""his way"" which ends up confusing students even more since his explanations are never adequate. Too bad there is only ever 1 section for the classes he teaches so theres no way in getting around him. Learn from the textbook or youtube and do ample example problems for each section.",0
"She's amazing, helpful, willing to compromise to students needs. I would take her even if I didn't need her class for credit. Or if she was a personal trainer at a gym she'd be amazing. ",1
"Soooo, the class wasn't awful, but don't go if you're sleepy... he talks for huge blocks and it can be very difficult to understand what he's saying because his accent is so thick.  We watched really terrible movies and for the final project we had to make our own movies... way too much expected for a liberal arts class.",0
"Overall a decent professor. Not bad at explaining things, though I was still uncertain on several HW problems after she had gone over the lesson. Also, she initially didn't really distinguish between HW and practice for WebAssign (i.e. what counted towards the final grade) which caused some confusion in the class. Nonetheless, a funny personality.",1
"Math is not my thing at all but professor Doroshenko made this class a breeze. I was very nervous at the beginning of the term but her explanations, youtube, and our class study group made this class so much easier.",1
Mrs Schultz was a good teacher she is kinda hard to understand at times but she gives good lectures and will help you at any time,1
"Midterms and final questions all came from a bank of questions from previous years. The assignments were definitely difficult to do alone and would require you to spend some time each day going to TA office hours to get help. His lectures would go over the concepts of the material, but the assignments were about how to use and apply those concepts.",1
Don't take this class if you don't have to. You have a quiz at the beginning of every class on the chapter read in the book. The exams are difficult and hard to study for. The professor doesn't help much with teaching the material you basically have to learn it yourself.,0
"Quickly, I haven't much time. His first name is J-",1
"Tough class, but he will give you points for anything, so show your work. Great guy and awesome class. If you think the material is boring, it will make it hard to listen and do well.",1
"I took Hip-Hop 1 and it was fun and clear, she choreographs some really great dances. She's always there to help, although on the finals she definitely grades harsh on technique and performance. But other than that great teacher!",1
Horrible Chem program!! my advisor told me NOT to take it here and go to another school. you can pass the class. he flys through stuff and the grading system is b.s. (outcomes). if ur not very percise the whole thing is wrong. hes down to eart but u better be ready to work for very little,1
I had Professor Were for two semesters and I always enjoyed her class. The lectures were structured in a way that made French easy and understandable. I had originally planned on just taking this course to get the language requirement out of the way but now I hope to take more French courses in the future.,1
She is the greatest spanish professor i've ever had.  Extremely helpful and enthusiastic.  Will get you interested in material even if you never thought it possible.  Take her if you ever get the chance!! She's great!,1
"Do not take this class until you have taken physics! That's all it is! The people who were lost were the ones who never took it. 3 exams with an optional final. Exams were HEAVILY curved. She wasn't too bad, but didn't seem sure of herself. Study old exams, read, and visit office hours and you'll be OK.",0
"Justice is a good professor. I had little difficulty in understanding the content of the course. He is always willing to help students. There are no exams but many quizzes, which are pulled from the optional homework. I recommend taking his class.",1
Loads of work in the 2nd half. Assignments are tough. Very strict on papers.,1
"I really enjoyed going to class- we just had a lot of interesting discussion on really cool things! She was pretty funny and interesting, I did enjoy the class. But, she gives A LOT of work outside of the class. She is an easy grader on little assignments, but she is a REALLY harsh grader for essays. She does grades your drafts though.",1
I love RIT,0
"Class was 100% online due to COVID but he still made class fun and engaging. Normal amount of readings/homework. Quizzes were open note and he gave time during class for any group work. Syllabus gave clear schedule. Accessible outside of class (via Discord), gives PLENTY of extra credit opportunities. Do your work, you will pass.",1
"Prof. Tersigni is very good as a professor. He gives a lot of work for the course, but it is worth it as it prepares you for the capstone course. The community health nursing course is not bad as long as all the work is completed.",1
"She's terrible with computers, assigns the most useless things, and expects us to memorize AP style rules. She's the worst professor I've had in the department. And she used to tell us that we're going to be terrible journalists because we don't do things her way. The only reason she gets away with it is because she's the internship coordinator.",0
"Disgustingly strict, bad lecturer, doesnt answer hw probs throughly. I feel like there are still a lot of things I dont know before each midterm.",0
"I took spanish 125 with Luna and loved it! She is pretty easy and very helpful! Tests are pretty straight forward and if you are not great at spanish like myself, going to her outside of class helps a ton!",1
"Connect and learn smart hw is easy. Tests are extremely difficult, around 12 or 16 questions. Not clear on grading for exams. Cant believe we pay money for an accounting class, and we arent even accounting majors. Hardest class Ive ever taken.",0
"I really did not like this class. I use to love history, but after this class I dont know if i'll ever take another history class at oregon. She says if you know the answers to the questions in the beginning of her lecture slides you'll be fine but her questions are super broad and on the test they are very very specific.",0
This teach is a NO GO.  If you do not score over 80% on any test he makes you drop the course or does it himself.  Def is not someone to give help.  I can honestly say out of every teacher I have had he is by FAR the worst,0
"Refuses to publish his powerpoints, read the textbook and pay attention to his study guide to figure out what type of test he's giving this time. Unsure if he's just new to the job or what, but he was completely inconsistent in assignments. Also regularly says inflammatory things to get discussions going. ",0
"I would def recommend this prof. If you do the homework that is given every week from the textbook, you will be good for the exam. He basically does problems form the txtbk in class, so you dont need to go to class but I would recommend going anyway. He is also really understanding so if you did poorly on the exam, go to him!!!! and he will help!!",1
Oh Deb fels. Turned my multimedia in business class into the depths of hell.  no. bueno. ,0
"Great & hilarious teacher. Loves making movie references & makes class as fun as possible! Home work was just filling out packets of body labels (which you do in class) & copying your notes 5 times as homework. You have two sets of ""rounds"", & 2 big tests. Make sure you study or you won't pass, & if you miss get notes/labels from students.",1
"If you're looking for an easy A psych class this isn't it! Test material is taken from what she says during class (not just what's on the slide) and the book. That being said, her grading was fair. She drops the lowest exam grade, meaning that if you are happy with your grade going into the final you don't have to take the final",1
4500 words report + 1.5 hr quiz for final. NEVER answer your question properly. Whatever you say is a complaint.,0
"She has been changing assignments dates and adding assignments. She will say things like ""I don't want to overwhelm you..."" then proceeds to go overboard with what it due. She is incredibly rude and if you don't do it her way then it's not any other way. She also asks students to share private health information for a grade, which is terrible.",0
I had a lot of hope for this class and this professor. I have found Dr. Saunders very condescending when you are asking questions and seems aloof despite trying to make jokes in class. He flies through the PPT and excel examples. He says attendance doesn't count but will hand out random extra credit on a whim. Class is a drag and I am disappointed.,0
EXCELLENT!,1
"He is a very intelligent teacher with lots of interesting examples, and a willingness to help. Judging by the comments, it sounds like students take that for granted.  Either that, or they aren't smart enough to follow him.  (probably the latter)  Anyways, he is a good prof and I learned a lot.",1
"It seemed like this was the first time she teached in a classroom, but obviously not, after reading everyone else's comments.  She was always at least 5-10 minutes late to class, unorganized, WAY too much work for an intro class, and she couldn't keep the non-interested students from bothering the ones that wanted to learn.",0
"Do not take a class with Bryan. His explanations are very blurry and unclear. Whenever you ask him a question he does not directly answer.   I found that since his teaching methods sucked the exams were tough, but if you find a way to teach yourself then exams will be fine.",0
She is not helpful at all. She is picky with who she helps. ,0
"Very nice guy, but not very helpful. The other two portfolio professors Sean and Maria are much more productive with class time, and actually give helpful critique.",0
His teaching style is terrible.  Every time you ask a question he says you should have learned that in high school.  He goes out of his way to let you know that you are stupid.  If you love yourself you will not take this man for calculus.,0
"Professor Juarez is the best! He knows how to teach and I learned a lot in his class! Take him! We had two papers, three exams, three discussion boards, and attendance matters! Also, he is funny!",1
She is not helpful at all for a graduate course I had to take.  Does not have the  SME of anything but very good at shuffling paperwork required by the school.  Provides very harsh comments in an untimely fashion.  She assumes you will fail from the beginning.  You are better off to go to any other online schools for your graduate degree.,0
"I really enjoyed taking Interpersonal Communications online. She is super sweet and caring, and her online lectures are very professional and well put together. The class consisted of quizzes each module and either a discussion post or journal entry and a final. She provides great feedback on all of your assignments so take her if you can!",1
just awful. nothing else i can say about this mean person. thanks for ruining my GPA and my student life in general,0
"Class is really not needed because she covers the material from 335 all over again. Then at the end of the semester she goes over some new stuff, which can be covered in a few days. She requires attendance, has two projects. The way she words things is very unclear, therefore ask questions in class, she will give answers in class.",0
"This professor is awesome. There is really no reason not to do well on your essays. He gives you a chance to let him look them over and also have another student in class look them over. Unless you are just blowing off those chances, there is no way to really fail any of his papers. Try to pick a topic that he's excited about for your final essay.",1
Prof. Freed is honestly the best professor I have had at Oakland University. She has such passion for literature and has the class read things that are different compared to other lit classes. She has a great personality that makes coming to lectures fun. There are daily questions that you get credit for so definitely show up to class.,1
"You have you to take this guy for any class. He'll get you all ""fired up"" about accounting. Go to his office and talk to him just to say hi, he's so friendly! ""How bout that?!"" P.S. ask him where he goes shopping for his clothing.",1
"Make sure you have a SCANNER & PRINTER. very confusing, doesn't respond to emails, gives a lot of hw, doesn't make sense sometimes, makes you print out tons of paper. Quizzes on MML can be hard and not have things we've learned so be aware if you have to take her. My suggestion, would NOT take her AT ALL. She is tied with being my WORST prof ever",0
"Char could be pretty vague on what she wanted, not good with technology either. Make sure you completely follow the graph rules posted on her syllabus. You can turn a lab in early and make corrections before its due which is nice. Some prelab quizzes were annoying but manageable. I think ppl reported her bc she was suddenly nice at the end.",0
He makes class fun. ,1
"she is quiet (even with a mic) and talks slowly, so she is hard to pay attention to. she openly praises people (says their name and everything) during lecture for getting 100% on her tests and gives them small prizes for it, which is bad teaching in my eyes. i find her low key hard to respect, but that is just me. her test questions are confusing",0
"I would advise to take this class online. It is a lot of work required, but just make sure you do it bay the deadline.  She was extremely helpful and doesn't require you to do as many LearnSmart questions like other teachers. That's why I took her twice.",1
"This was perhaps one of the best teachers I had while getting my degree. Very professional and available to answer questions when I needed a quick response. English 2, as expected, is a good deal of reading and writing; however, he made the grading criteria clear and the essays were actually fun to do. Take this teacher and you will do well.",1
Tavss is an awesome professor. He puts a lot of time and effort into his lectures study guides. Do ALL the practice exam problems he puts online. The study guides practice exams are very helpful and essential to get a good grade. You can skip the book problems (not helpful) and skim the readings but COMPLETE ALL PRACTICE EXAMS ONLINE!,1
"Try to count the number of times she says, 'Ok.'  I got 387 in 30 minutes.",0
"We are 2 tests into semester&have turned in 2 assignments and NO grades posted online for class so no one knows where they stand in the class.  Last exam gave us a section on calculations that he NEVER showed us how to do! I have to teach myself everything& study guide doesn't help because he never puts 1/2 the things we are tested on, on the guide",0
"Shes a very nice person overall, but I didnt learn anything and didnt improve as a writer. Her lectures are incredibly boring and she stares at the clock the entire time. I honestly didnt try at all and got a B, so the class isnt hard... its just boring. The nice thing was we only had 4 essays to write.",0
"Dr. Mueller employs a workgroup, experience based, workbook method in Ochem. It does not work. He doesn't teach. The class is absurd. I am getting an A in the class but only because I study the book and other professors notes. You do not learn much in class. He also comes over quite arrogant.",0
She is very sweet and very calm in class. She makes it easy to pay attention and learn. ,1
"THE worst. I took AP English in high school and passed it with flying colors as one of the top writers in my class. I get to Shamane's class and I'm told that my use of grammar is ""offensive"" and that I'm too ""flowery"" and wordy in my writing. Passed with a 4.0 overall and on the portfolio bc I am a strong writer despite her comments. AVOID HER!!!",0
"The professor gets very political in class and it's annoying. Too many readings, no laptops in class, you need the hard copy of the text. Lots of HW. Don't take this class when you have other important classes that take a lot of time because this professor seems to think she's the only professor we have.",0
Amazing ! If only all math teachers were just like him ! Do your homework attend math lab take good notes and you are solid !,1
"Bowles is a really good prof. Chem 115 is a difficult class but he does A LOT of sample questions in class which help a lot. You have to do questions from the text to do well. But, if you keep on top of things, a high mark is easily obtainable. I would recommend him for sure.",1
"Class was alright, but Brandt repeats his weird anecdotes such as buying butter at the grocery store too much. Gets old fast.  Claims attendance is mandatory but only took attendance once. 14 quizzes, lowest 2 get dropped. NOT ALL QUIZ ANSWERS ARE ONLINE. 3 tests - provides 1 makeup during finals, but only if you missed an exam. No extra credit.",0
"After taking this class, I realized how poor my Spanish is. She is very particular with spelling, verbs and accents which was challenging for me. Overall, she gives great feedback about what one lacks and I think is very helpful. There are exams, discussion posts, homework, assignments, reading/assignment checks, 2 papers, and a video project.",1
"Extremely rude (condescending) to students. I've had plenty of bad teachers, but her level of disrespect is far above any other. She reads off slides created by a TA & HW that is way beyond the scope of the course. Exams are long and confusing. Only thing she cares about are her stories (football talk) during the 1st 30mins. Don't take if possible.",0
She was one of my favorite professors the year I had her (in person learning). She has a lot of availability for office hours and gives really good feedback in your journals. Make sure to participate and study (she does give pop quizzes in person)!,1
"Great guy, makes SE project manageable. Highly recommend",1
Tough grader but only because she expects you to learn the material. Great lecture and teaching style with lots of good labs. Tests were hard but contained material we had practiced and reviewed.,1
"Took both 1078 and 1088 with him, and I've definitely learned a lot. Homework is optional if you need the extra help, but tests are pretty tough",1
Wouldn't suggest to anyone,0
"Incredibly knowledgeable and smart, a practitioner within the field and has been published many times. You will learn from him, having said that... he is extremely condescending and sometimes is a bit sarcastic. He is intellectual and gets frustrated if you are not on the same level as him, he expects a lot from you but seldom gives feedback.",1
Very understandimg and easy to get along with,1
"Super sweet lady! Attendance is required, but you can do your other homework or study during class. Don't have to pay attention. EASY A!!! Gives tons of bonus! She gives you all of the test questions and answers during the review! Highly recommended!!",1
Very approachable. 4 homework's and 4 tests. Take this teacher!,1
"Despite getting the highest grade on all of the exams (90 avg), I still almost made a C in the class because of pop quizzes. Asks extremely specific questions and sometimes counts AGAINST you for getting it wrong. Burghardt is laughably condescending. You'd think you're talking to a celebrity with how self-important he is. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
This guy is totally out of control.  There is no way a non-chem major should have to perform in a general chem class like a grad student.  No reason at all.  UNCG needs to wake up and realize we are not a leading science school so start pretending Walsh...,0
"If you enjoy hearing the word ""um"" incessantly, this class is for you.  Prof Miiler is a terrible teacher.  Don't let her nonsense critiques of your papers fool you...she honestly doesn't know what she's doing.  If I were you, stay away!",0
Excellent teacher who knows her stuff well.highly recommend to anyone,1
"Unclear instructions given for projects. She is unwilling to help if you are having difficulty understanding. She taught a color theory class without using color, she would only verbally describe projects. She did not enforce any deadlines, so most students did not have their work done for critiques and she would critique unfinished projects.",0
"Professor Hutchens is one of the most amazing professors I have ever had! His class is highly graded on your participation. One day you are graded on your group presentation, the other day is a quiz day. Basically, don't miss or you will start failing. You do not use a text book, he gives you a website. Instant feedback on tests and quizzes",1
"Arrogant. His theory of dropping you in the deep end does teach you a lot, but then you don't know the basics",0
I loved her class.I took it as a Deck course my freshman 1st semester nd by far my faorite class...the acting techniques and exericses we do are fun and interesting...it helped me come out of my shyness..fav class at Stony,1
"Took advanced nutrition with this professor.  He teaches the first and last third of the class.  You should attend class because there are some mistakes in his packet, otherwise, his packet is pretty much what all his lectures are about.  He tests on the lectures, so make sure to attend so you're not studying extra material.  Very easy!!!",1
I love Dave Dusseau and would take this class over again with him a million times. Take it. He's an incredible prof.,1
I loved this class! She's an easy grader. You will have one powerpoint presentation to present. Study from her lectures and participate in the labs by completing all assignments and you will pass. Dont skip labs! You don't need the lab book only . She is very caring and willing to help you in any way possible.,1
"Mrs. McClain is a wonderful professor. I took her for math and aced the course with an A��������! As long as you show up to class, take notes, do the homework, and make decent grades, try for As and Bs on your test then youre good!",1
Doug is a great teacher.  He is friendly and has really mastered teaching drawing. He helps you strive to be a better artist.,1
"There is so much reading. The worst part is for the test, she gave us 54 terms for us to define and only 10/12 will be on the actual test and out of those 10/12, we only have to do 5/6. Lectures are alright but they do not redeem for how much reading there is or how she handles the test study guide.",0
"Outstanding professor, especially for organic chemistry. I recommend that everyone that can take ochem b off track so you can take Thompson. Slides aren't helpful, you must go to class to get the mechanisms and exact information you will be tested over. Material is hard and intricate but Dr. Thomspon explains it extremely well.",1
"I would never take this teacher again. She doesnt care about her students. If we asked her a question, she made us feel stupid. Anyone who purchased an eBook could not use it because she hates the sound of clicking through pages. Just a waste of money and time. Beware!",0
"Mr. Oliver, as he wanted us to call him, was a really funny guy.  Seemed really awkward at first, but eventually, once you get to know him, you start laughing at the jokes that nobody understood.  Gotta love him though.  Really nice guy and very lenient with grading.",1
Doesnt teach Bad,0
"This professor is tough and makes you work hard for your grade. BUT he is extremely knowledgable about Sociology. He is always willing to work with his students!! Very caring. I took this class online in the summer and it was discussion boards and 3 exams. Definitely took time and energy, but worth the outcome.",1
"Not bad, not great. Lectures are just cut-and-paste PP presentation's of the readings. Class is an easy A if you go to class, take notes, and write a good paper. If you need an easy GenEd, take Olsson. If you're looking for more in-depth study of the subject, look elsewhere.",1
"High expectations of the students but does a poor job in the lecture: copies material from book, poor time management (rushes to finish when out of time), lectures are very hard to follow, very fast passed (extremely hard to take notes), poor job engaging students, shows lack of effort in the material (not helpful material) Read! it's all on you!",0
"Took Prof M for summer B. Syllabus was modified for the short time, exams every week with inclusive review. Labs are full points for participation.  Always responded to emails.  She is such a really NICE lady. So show up for labs study the review it's an easy A.",1
"Wasn't as easy as I expected. The most challenging thing about his course is that he has been recycling material for over a decade now. The lectures, homework's, and projects are vague. At times he can be very rude, and at times he can be helpful. Be sure not to put off the projects until finals week. No late penalty for submitting late homework.",0
She is great. she will help u if u need it but u shouldn't need it if u do the HW and pay attention in class. she covers everything u need to know and no more. she will not make ur life miserable. It is an easy A if u do the Homeworks. Homeworks are on the quizzes and the quizzes are on the tests. Take her class if u can! You will not regret it!,1
"Such a cool, interesting, and fun class! One of the best and most intelligent professors I have ever had. You have to learn a lot to get a good grade but her lectures are so great that it makes learning and processing the material really easy since she teaches it so well!",1
"She might be a good therapist , but a horrible educator . One of my worst professor forever",0
"tough teacher, very hard to comprehend what she is even talking about and she loves to speed through notes like it's a race. tests aren't too bad but she will pick tricky questions to make you work for it.",0
Sara pushes you. Don't expect to take her class and do the minimum to get by. She genuinely wants to she her students succeed. If you are not putting in the effort to grow then she will not be able to help you.,1
"Disrespectful to his students and he repeats himself throughout the semester. He spams you with email everyday and doesn't teach you anything about photography. If attendance wasn't mandatory, there would be no reason to go. He brags about students that he has taught but he only does so he can find more faults in his students.",0
"He is the most caring professor I have. I at first didn't like him because he seemed a bit scattered, but he honestly cares about you and your progress. He is super knowledgeable and is easy to work with. You just have to be patient with him. He treats the class like you are sacrificing your time to be there, instead of him sacrificing his time.",1
Professor Thompson will stand in the front of the class and brag that students averages 66 on his tests. Ive never seen anybody be so proud of their own failure before. his tests have nothing to do with what he is teaching. This is like an SNL skit of an actual microbiology class. Except no one is laughing. Very sad to witness and pay for.,0
Professor Kendall is a really nice guy and a great teacher. I'm not sure what others are ranting on about? If anything he is too easy... If he spoke any slower or dumbed down the materail any more they would have to make a special hooked on phonics for AutoCad. Just go to class take notes and you should be able to complete homework in class.,1
"horrible! horrible! horrible! He seems like a cool teacher at first but very confusing on his grading and instructions. 3 test thats tough. Tough grader, long lectures, has favorites but makes you feel uncomfortable about learning.",0
"Super intersting guy, total nerd, and fantastic math teacher. By far my favorite math professor at the U. He was very articulate with his lectures and helped conceptualize topics for students. Decent amount of homework but nothing too crazy. He gave out a review packet that was a mirror image of each test so tests were a breeze.",1
Real world businessman. Highly knowledgeable and extremely intelligent.,1
"He is a good guy with a genuine interest and expertise in the field. But he makes you work for the grade, he has a mix of group projects, class discussions and lectures. He speaks relatively slow and spends a lot of time on a small quantity of topics. ",1
"I took him for intro to fiction , he is a great teacher and knows how to start great discussions. He tells you from the start his expectations and as long as you attend class and do your work you will pass !",1
"She is allot of fun! but! don't let that fool you, make sure you read and understand the information. double check your quiz answers and do not take them for granted.",1
Terrible professor who has no business teaching. If you ever want to talk to him about anything related to the class or your grade give up because he almost never has time to meet. He will always say hes busy and make up excuses. overall a horrible professor.,0
Easy A! Don't miss class and you will pass. Give a lot of extra credit. Overall a great professor.,1
She is a very good Instructor.  She is tough on the tests and tough on assignments but clearly is getting you ready for the next level!  She will make it easy to understand and uses great examples.  If you read the book and study hard you will pass!,1
"Calc 1 & 2 were not my favorite, but Dr. Justice managed to make calc 3 much easier for me. I can't speak for in-person, but online Fall 2020 has been great. It's still difficult content, but his lectures are easy to follow and his exams are very similar to his lectures. Honestly, quizzes were harder than exams. We love Brad. Take him if you can!!",1
"He does not give specific directions and then deducts a bunch of points when you don't tell him EXACTLY what he wants, even though he didn't tell you. I'm an honors student, a month into the class, and I'm getting a C already. His lectures are unnecessary and not always correct, just read the book. Unable to properly critique/grade papers.",0
"I have taken McNabb for both math97 as well as stats. He is a wonderful teacher and relates what you are learning to real life situations or obscure situations that really allow you to understand the material. He really sets you up for success, you just have be willing to show up to class and put in the work.",1
"So the class itself is not that hard, most of it is common sense. BUT she is horrible at reading and answering emails, She sends the same email to everyone thinking that they are talking about the same thing. It was supposed to be a two day online class but then she changes everything to one day. Discussion board she grades harshly as well.",0
"Dr. Vohs is great. He's a brilliant professor in my opinion. He's the best lecturer I've taken to date, he's clear and concise, he has good analogies to help students understand what he's teaching. He really dislikes swearing, so avoid swearing in front of him (I accidentally dropped a swear word and now he isn't particularly fond of me)",1
She is horrible. She did not teach anything in this production. It was mostly a play that was for her tribute to her heritage. We did not learn acting or technical things. We were used for her name and project. But in the end she was blaming us for everything. Run away from this person.,0
He's very good with feedback and will take the time to explain himself and his expectations. I would recommend him to anyone. Really enjoyed this class.,1
"If you are looking for a class that will make you bang your head against the wall, this is the perfect class for you. Dr. Taylor has extremely hard test and his lectures will put you to sleep. He does not really care if you succeed or not. This had to be one of the worst classes of my life. I did like the lab though.",0
Terrible professor doesn't teach anything during lectures and definitely do not need to show up to class. She expects us to learn from the 200+pages of reading she assigns per week as if we do not have any other classes to worry about. I would not take her course again.,0
"Palmer was somewhat approachable after class, but was completely disorganized with unstructured format of his notes, tests, and his class as a whole left me appalled. I learned little from his class and would warn students to not take him if they have the option",0
"Online course, easy, but assignments were boring and ""worksheet-ish."" Almost no communication. Course VERY poorly designed: missing info and instructions, erroneus assignments/dates; she clearly had not gone through the material and had copy/pasted from a previous semester. Grading return time awful (over 6 weeks). Disaster of an online course.",0
"Prof Stockton is awesome, and is such a caring and hilarious man. He is well seasoned and it was great to hear some of his life stories in between the philosophy lectures. I will definitely be taking his classes in the future!",1
"Please do not be fooled. He is average at best. I took him and his lectures are the blandest thing you will ever attend. Puts you to sleep every time. The only reason I kept going into class was for attendance points. # exams all consisted of learning 45-55 definitions, so if you can memorize it should be an easy A. He is not a good professor.",0
"Lots of weekly modules and assignments due but she provides great feedback and communication. She lays out the assignments on the syllabus and as along as you follow it and turn in everything on time, you should easily get an A.",1
"He is a teacher who knows his material, who loves his material and wants to teach his material. He is a guy full of knowledge and really helps his students with the subject and really cares about the students grades. He is very caring and takes the time out of class to review test material before the exams.",1
"Diane was a great teacher. She was very clear with her notes, and always took the time to help any student who didn't understand. She wanted all students to be on the same page! she actually cared! could get off topic about her family, but for the most part she stayed on task! ",1
"Mrs. Khan is a cool teacher, everything on the tests are in the lectures and class activities.  Do all the homework which are easy points. There are only two test and haft the finale is the midterm, which she will correct and go over the questions  if you ask. You do have to write out answers, but it easy. The speeches are easy to.",1
"Great guy. Average professor. You can fall behind fast in this class, so prioritize it over others. Plenty of EC. Main downside, taught in Java!? C'mon it's 2018. So beware, this class is more difficult than it needs to be because it is taught in cavemen language. Teach JS or Python based stacks. More job opportunities and it'll be easier to teach.",0
"Russell is awesome. The class was a little jumbled because it was her first time teaching it, but it wasn't that bad. Very little work and interesting discussion topics. Only criticism is that the TA grades papers and there's very little variance in grades regardless of quality--it's going to be a 90-92 regardless, which makes an A (96) difficult.",1
Professor Fitzpatrick was such an amazing professor. She is willingly to help on any essay she has assigned and is very concise with her comments on essays. She encourages her students to do well and is very passionate about the subject she teaches. I would love to take more of her classes.,1
"Great professor, I enjoyed the class she cares about the students. 1 paper, 3 exams, and the final, Study for the final exam is a little difficult.",1
"Linda lin is thorough, her tests are easy if you listen in class and do the homework. I had her for abnormal and really enjoyed it. She's really smiley.",1
BEST MATH TEACHER OUT THERE! He cares so much about his students and what they need help with.,1
"You can't avoid taking him, but be ready to self-teach. Lectures are confusing and meandering. Go to office hours with questions to do well. No curve so hard to get a good grade. Very old-fashioned type teacher.",0
"Due to the COVID-19, the courses transitioned to an online format. And she became stiffly reading slides. She could not explain the context in detail. Therefore, you will spend a lot of time on the PA assignments. The assignments are difficult and too much to work out.",0
"By far one of my absolute favorite professors I have had at Xavier. He is extremely funny and will teach you not only Calculus but also life skills. One of the saddest days was leaving the final exam. He knows how to reach college students and make learning enjoyable. Plus, you can learn how to get out of a speeding ticket using math!",1
"Please try to find a better english teacher. Professor Hetrick loves the sound of his own voice and will talk for an hour and a half straight about his job at USD and the drinking age. I went in for help multiple times and emailed him repeatedly to get almost no help on improving my essays. I wanted to improve my writing, but I learned nothing.",0
Reads off textbook entire class & takes too long to explain things and everyone in class is falling asleep. Everyone just does training on SAM since he opens it when class starts and he's wondering why nobody is paying attention to him.  Make sure you sit beside people who know what they're doing or you're either gonna fail or do really bad,0
a very nice guy. class discussions were always interesting and he makes you think about the topics. will spend a lot of time with you on your essays. really good,1
"Good teacher, never took economics in high school and I still understand it. Can make the students laugh and generally make the class not extremly boring. A top notch teacher",1
"Professor Kiesewetter is very good at explaining chemistry. She definitely knows what she is talking about and is very dedicated to the success of her students. CHM101 was mostly review for me because I took chemistry in high school, but she made me understand the new concepts. There are 4 exams and then the final. They are all fair not too long.",1
"I can't say enough great things about this professor. His lectures are clear and concise, and he even participates in class discussions, which is RARE in an online class. Although the media critiques and quizzes require some effort, they are not overly difficult as long as you complete the readings. Trust me, this class is an EASY A!",1
Mr. Brown is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He came to be a teacher from the job world so he has first hand experience with a lot of the material and has valuable stories about it. He assigns work frequently but it isn't constant. He gives plenty of time to finish harder assignments and is open to extensions (when appropriate).,1
"My favorite course at Walsh. I kept all books after class ended and still refer to them almost monthly. Do all extra credit including the grammar book. Tons of reading and tons of work, but I found it valuable and eye opening. Do a little of the living case study each week to make the end of class more manageable. I would highly recommend McHann.",1
She speaks too low,0
"Britten seems to genuinely mean well, but the woman simply wasn't called to teaching. Doesn't actually seem to care and is not particularly engaging. The text is useless but mandatory, and the lectures are meandering and poorly created. She also has far too many guest speakers and decides not to show up on a whim. If at all possible, do not take it",0
"Really good professor who takes his time to explain anything youre struggling with. He tries to make time for group work, and is available outside of class times for additional help if needed. Can be pretty picky about notation on turned in assignments but nothing that cant be fixed. Gave worksheets before tests which were very helpful as well.",1
"Easily one of the nicest people you will ever meet. Even though waking up for a 7:30 was rough, his attitude towards teaching and Latin made it easier. We had vocab quizzes almost everyday which aren't that bad, and he cuts you slack if you don't do the translations.",1
"This was an online Friday class, so the lectures and readings are on your own. There are weekly online timed quizzes based on the power points, fairly easy. midterm and final are multiple choice. Also a partner essay, straight forward. I enjoyed this class. I used the book for the essay mostly.",1
"Dr. Parker was enormously patient with us when we moved online. He accommodated our various schedules, supported us when writing, and made sure our final submission was a success through feedback.",1
"Often gets off track with her lectures. Has course info in multiple different places that are not always aligned/updated. Moves WAY too fast on a minute-to-minute level, even for a review course - she'll sometimes wait two seconds (not an exaggeration) between an asking a question and asking if anyone has solved it. Take someone else's class.",0
Professor Kander is great! Her lectures are very interesting and she is SUPER nice!!! She is definitely willing to help if you need it! Take a class with her! You won't be disappointed!,1
Great professor. Is very engaged with students and teaching the material. Lectures are interactive so you don't fall asleep. Expects you to participate in class and has weekly assignments to make sure you don't fall behind but they're very easy assignments.,1
"Great professor. Does A LOT to prepare you for tests and it really helps. Explains things very well. When she talks about a concept, she always tells us the reasoning behind it which will help you remember everything, not just memorize it. Use the materials she gives for test practice and u probably won't get lower than a B on a test. Def take her!",1
Dr. King is not a good professor. He is EXTREMELY disorganized and gets lost in the middle of lecture. The PPTs don't help for studying. He sometimes says random things that only confuse us. Tests are ridiculously hard. No matter how much we studied we scored pretty badly. He's the only one teaching cells so good luck and may you pass the class...,0
"As a dancer she is uncanny. Her dance class is quite nice. She does push a lot and wants you to get better. However she doesn't care to help you succeed. Academically she is a nightmare. Tests are hard and full of surprises; Difficult to study for and understand. Wont work with you if you have any outside conflict, including medical.",1
I don't recommend her if you need extra help. I couldn't understand her very well and her method of teaching made it extremely frustrating. She likes to do the hard way before she shows you the easy way and won't fully answer your question. Even if you're good at math i would still hesitate to take this class.,0
"She's just not a good professor. She curses a lot, assigns weekly homework and there's A LOT OF reading. She also wants you to go to libraries to borrow books to read a few chapters for class and return it. She's also a very tough grader. She doesn't really help students much and makes you feel dumb based on questions you ask her. DON'T TAKE HER!",0
"I saw how crappy her reviews were after starting her class, but after taking her for almost 4 weeks now, she's not as bad as everyone says. She's boring, and grades toughly, but she's definitely not the worst. She won't be your most fun class, but she's not the worst option",0
I would suggest that if you have to have a class and the offer another professor then take the class with the other professor. I would find myself emailing him for an assignment due in a couple of days and him not replying for weeks later. You learn absolutely nothing from him!,0
"This was a fabulous class well thought out.  funny, passionate professor, who knows a lot about abnormal psych.  good discussions and mindtap was useful to help us with learning.",1
Shes a amazing teacher! Mrs. Smith is very caring. Her name is spelled wrong Dolores,1
Really great guy and passionate about what he does. Very lecture heavy class though.,1
Prof Engelke was thorough and expected greatness from her students. I felt like she expected us to know the content that she was responsible for teaching to us before she taught.  She ran hot and cold...,1
"This class wasn't too bad. Professor D. is a good teacher. The class itself was good for a math idiot like me; straight and to the point, no B.S. I'd suggest you take her if you want to get through the class without too much trouble.",1
"The class average for each of her exams was 80%, probably because 20% of the test material is not covered in class. There are a lot of preparation assignments for this class as well. She tries to be relevant and funny, but is still dry and boring in lectures.",1
She gives an unnecessary amount of homework and takes forever to grade it. I always dreaded going to her class but she did cancel quite often.,0
"He clearly explains all concepts in lecture and explains ahead of time what will be on the tests. Your grade in the class is based entirely on the 4 tests, as there is no homework, extra credit, etc. The tests are challenging but the GSS resources (which are posted on ELMS) help a lot to prepare.",1
"Professor Malone was pretty organized and helped make this class pleasant. He lets us drop one test and five quizzes at the end of the semester, this helped my grade a lot. It is pretty difficult to fail this class if you do what he asks. Homework is optional and he lets us retake quizzes as many times as we want. Highly recommend I loved his class",1
"Worst Professor at NJIT.  I am looking to get him booted.  He never changes his slides, his accent is heavy, he is confused himself when he talks, his exams are confusing and do not correlate to what he teaches, he responds 2 days later too questions, the structure of his class sucks, bad textbook selection, overall he needs a major makeover.",0
"Always ends class early, very easy lectures, extra credit is offered, and she allows you to have a notecard on exams. There are several homework and in class assignments but they take no more than twenty minutes to finish and are always explained well. Gives ""study days"" where she cancels class so you can ""study"" which is cool. Great Prof.",1
"Nice professor. Classes are really relaxed, he lectures on some interesting topics and relates to students well. Fairly easy course (as it is a lower division GE)...few reaction papers (1-2 pages) quizzes and tests are pretty easy if you go to class (though a lot of the course is common sense, or easy to absorb). Great professor.",1
"A rough prof to take, wouldn't want to take class with him again, cynical.",0
"Pretty solid professor--class is straightforward, curved grading and some short papers. Packs a lot of info into lectures, which makes the tests difficult to study for, but he's pretty easy to follow. Be sure to memorize the experiments mentioned in lecture for the tests. And don't get the textbook if you take good notes!",1
"Dr. Rhoads is the nicest guy so I feel bad, but he is the hardest grader on the planet and his exams have material on them that you didn't even learn! He is accessible outside of class and willing to help but it doesn't matter. You can study as hard as you'd like, get tutors, and practice and will still fail the exams unless you're a chem genius.",0
"Currently in her class during the coronavirus. Although some teachers lighten up on homework during this pandemic, she doubled it for us. I know we have a lot of time on our hands, but an eight hundred points essay and a thousand points essay are too much on us students who is stressed about the times going on outside of the world and in their home",0
"If you want an easy A, take this class. There are 3 tests and the final all of which are online. He takes attendance randomly 5 times during the semester. Get ready to be bored as he reads verbatim to the slides that he does post online. You definitely do not need the textbook, so don't waste your money. Easy A, decent professor, no homework.",1
"Very hard class. I am a non history major and found this class very difficult, I read all the books he assigned, but had a hard time doing well on his test and quizzes.  The class is interesting, but not worth the low grade that is to be expected.",1
It was her first time teaching here in Queens College. Avoid her by all means. In the beginning there were almost 30 people in the class and then after a few weeks there were about half left. Get ready to read a lot. Heavy heavy stuff. Honestly doesn't know how to teach well.,0
very tough! if you don't understand she'll try to help but ends up being useless. Hated class with her.,0
This class was the easiest class I've ever taken. Two easy assignments that can be done early in the semester and four tests make up the entire semester's work.,1
"The test have nothing to do with lectures. Test are all on the reading and they are not covered in lecture. Very rude and unprofessional. Laughed at multiple students who were having hardships in class. Calls out students during lectures, brings up their personal issues, and laughs. Not understanding at all.",0
"I have had Prof. Merkel for Torts I and II, and Remedies. It is difficult to find a better Professor at Western. He is as clear as Brower, and as difficult as Mohr, but unlike Mohr you don't fear going to his class. You may hear that he is difficult, but how difficult is it when he tells you exactly what he wants on the final???",1
"If you want an instructor that will communicate with you, don't take her classes. I e-mailed her a few times and never heard back from her. In the online class there are group discussions once a week. Even when you meet her criteria for acceptable participation, she still deducts points. Tried to ask what I did wrong. No response.",0
Professor Petro is a great professor! I loved and enjoyed his class. His test are fair and he gives extra credit problems and a take home quiz. You have to keep up with the MyMathlab assignments in order to stay in track. I suggest that you go to every class to keep up.,1
"He is absolutely the worst professor I ever seen. I dont really understand why hes so miserable and why he makes it his life mission to make his students lives miserable, he should not have been a professor at all.. he legit needs to find something else to do as a career because TEACHING IS JUST NOT IT. Save yourself guys dont take him.",0
"Awful, currently in the class right now & cant stand it. Shes extremely rude to students who ask multiple questions. She zooms through showing the class the steps to learn & solve the problems because she can enter everything in excel & use function buttons. Requires you to listen to her online lecture as well lots of homework. WCCCD needs new prof",0
"Professor Couch is honestly amazing. Attendance is very heavy, and she will ask for an excuse if you do not attend class, but other than that it is such an easy class. She does weekly assignments from the textbook that are due the next week. You will write around only 3-4 essays, and she cares about her students! Take this class you won't regret it",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but he will use the fact that you are not in class against you. Along with this, he gives quizzes every week. He does not actually teach you how to do problems, just throws a bunch of equations at you and expects you to know how to use them to solve a problem when he has not shown you.",0
"Neglects to tell students about huge concepts until the review classes before the test.  Doesn't do anything but read from the slides. NO time in-class for students to do example problems and discuss, which is NECESSARY to understand math. Acts surprised and condescending when students aren't getting it.  DO NOT TAKE FINANCE WITH HIM.",0
"Would highly recommend to take her for psychology, she is very approachable and is there to help you. Also, she knows her stuff and gives amazing examples. Just take good notes and you will do good.",1
"Amazing man, terrible professor. He is kind, caring, and hilarious, but does not know how to teach in the least. This class was the biggest waste of time. I can't believe this is what my tuition went to.",0
Professor Liggin is extremely qualified to teach this course. His industry and classroom experience allow him to effectively teach how to read and understand complex plans and do take-offs. He is absolutely very organized and straightforward in his lectures. Even his bold language and character goes a long way in keeping the class engaged.,1
Took him for the basic linux class.  Within the first couple of weeks we had already covered the entire course material the department chair taught in his class.  We then started doing heavy bash scripting and customizing our kernal with little explanation on what exactly we were doing it for.  Taught material way to advanced for a basic course.,0
"Dan is the worst professor I've ever dealt with. He told my class that if we died, it wouldn't matter and people would get over it easily. Really disrespectful guy. That said, it was an easy A.",0
She was not clear with her lectures. Skimmed over a lot of the material and was not very thorough.,0
"No extra credit, impossible exams and quizzes, wording is awful so you dont understand questions. doesnt want students do to well or curve, no one got a good grade.",0
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
"Sooo much extra credit! This class was really interesting, even kinda fun. He could stand to clarify what he wants for the practicals and group work sometimes, but he's good about making sure everyone knows if he gets asked a question about stuff like that. The guest speakers are pretty cool too since they have a lot of experience and examples.",1
On tests he chooses the most difficult problems and tries to make his tests as hard as possible when they shouldn't be. His tests are much much harder than the homework and quizzes. He makes his tests as hard as possible.,0
"Seems very nice but is not teaching any information. Do not assign lengthy homework and only talk about 5 out of 40 things learned. Should be teaching what we are reading about every week but doesnt, I have barley learned a thing in this class and I suggest if he wants students to succeed he changes his ways. Your better off teaching yourself",0
"This professor is very passionate about geography. He keeps things upbeat to the best of his ability. He has weekly reading quizzes that aren't easy, but they're only worth ten points each. If you take this class with a friend, it's helpful",1
"Went to class twice, got an A. As long as you go over his 3 question practice exams there is no way you would fail, since he gives the same questions on the actual exams. Huge curve, even though everyone did great. If you actually do want to learn though he is actually a very good lecturer too. Take him, you won't regret it!",1
If you want to learn accounting principals throughly take her class. One of the best professors at Westfield in my opinion. She is definitely the reason accounting is my concentration.,1
"very laid back class. she uses 3 books. you must keep up with readings to be able to discuss them in class and to write journal responses. no tests or quizzes, and the assignments are fairly easy. just do all the work and go to class and you're good.",1
She is an awesome professor.  I highly recommend this class.  I took the course as an elective.  I worked very hard and I am sure I did well.  The money I invested in learning was a successful ending.  I recommend this class.  It is a lot of work and you have to work hard but you LEARN!!  If that is what you want to get out of the course.,1
"I have had many professors, but this one definitely needs to take an accent reduction class. Other then that, she is nice, but lectures are boring,  basically, you don't have to be there, it is just like watching slides that you can find online, but attendance is mandatory. If you need a credit, take it. For knowledge, look somewhere else.",0
"I acknowledge he need to work on his English, but at least he needs to prepare some lectures notes or something to make lectures more coherent. He marks hard to the presentation, term paper, and short responses. And presentation and paper take up 45% of total grade! unwilling to help you with paper and presentation ahead. workload is not much",0
"He is one of the best professor I have ever seen in my life if you want to get a good knowledge about history and of course, if you want to pass I will definitely recommend gis class he is the best !!!!!!",1
"This class was only out of 100 points, which seems tough, but if you don't do well on something, the final (optional) quiz replaces your lowest grade. Otherwise, you MUST READ YOUR READINGS. She looks for very specific answers. Papers/projects are not difficult if you follow directions. She's super nice and is very honest. Very professional & smart",1
"Terrible, terrible, terrible.  The woman is completely pointless.  Why is she employed here at all?",0
"He rambles a lot and it's hard to tell where you stand in the class due to the massive curve, but he's overall pretty good. His notes are good, if a bit wordy. Projects and tests are hard, but there is a large curve and I thought they were pretty fun. Fair late policy. I recommend using the 99hr extension on project 3 or waiting untill the end.",1
This was a great class! All of the readings and assignments we had were interesting and thought provoking. Professor Tisdale was also super sweet and easily accessible outside of class. I would take this class again or any other taught by her.,1
one word. horrible,0
"I have always been at an advanced English/composition level and have always enjoyed it, but this class kinda made me hate English. Dude was a little condescending and scoffs at your opinion/response even though he asked for it. I disliked it enough to drop the course and take it with a different prof. Attendance is mandatory for sure. Not worth it",0
AJ shows true passion for ASL as well as a true desire to see her students succeed. She is always open to hearing about any way she can change the class to make the learning process easier for her students and always makes herself available if you need extra help outside of class. Keep up with vocab or you'll be lost. Highly recommend taking her!!,1
"This teacher is difficult to work with. I am an honor student and the things that he assigns are completely different than what he expects on the due date. He is rude, and refuses to take into account your opinion, or justification. DO NOT TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS PROFESSOR!",0
"Ms. McDonald Smith is fantastic! As a Business Marketing major, taking her course was extremely delightful. Her continuous years of social entrepreneurship and sales experience make her class informative. With a raw and uncanny personality, Ms. McDaniel-Smith will incite wit and cleverness into your school days. Great teaching style!",1
"One of my favorite professors I've ever had! He teaches super clear, provides awesome, detailed study guides, but you have to show up to class. It's a pretty fast paced course, so paying attention is necessary. He is a great guy and makes an accounting class a lot better than it sounds.",1
"Just horrible. Confusing, goes off on rants, awkward. I wouldn't recommend this professor to anyone. I can't believe there's such a horrible professor at USI.",0
Easy class. Don't miss class. Attendance can make your A to a B if you miss.,1
"He is somewhat passionate about A&P, but lacks the microbio/biochem knowledge to teach at an upper level. Many of his quizzes aren't based upon what you know, but how well you memorized his convoluted diagrams. His lecture heavy class shows a general disregard for depth. Labs are rudimentary.",0
"Tom seems like a nice guy at first, but then you quickly come to realize the mundane nature of his lectures. A typical day in class alternates between lulling you to sleep and painfully awkward. The tests consist of 5 essays that will be picked apart to the bone. There are much better courses to take to get the most from your money.",0
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
rude to students calls us stupid and lazy by saying all we do is play on our phones. tests are unbearably tough and half the things on the test he never talks about in class. Whenever u ask questions he rolls his eyes won answer them because apparently he told you about it before. I could go on and on about him! If you see him as your teacher RUN!!,0
"This professor is very emotionally driven, thus unapproachable. She assigns readings for every class of about 20-35 pages; two readings on the days after a weekend (because ""you have more time to read""). Lectures are useless and not posted online. She flies by them, so type fast. Quizzes are the bulk your grade. Avoid at all costs.",0
"I took Advanced Adolescent Psychology with Dr. Wolff her first time teaching it and really enjoyed it. You can tell she enjoys teaching about this subject and is very knowledgable. No tests, just two homework assignments, participation, a final paper, and a group presentation. Show up, participate, and do the work and you'll get an ""A""",1
I was a Paralegal Studies major when I took Dr. B's class and the way he taught got me interested in history. He's the reason I changed my major. Taking another of his classes and will take more. He is an amazing font of knowledge. It flows freely. He answers all my email immediately and is so much fun. He makes history a joy. We need more like him,1
"If you think logically and have a good math/proof based background, Dr. Buhler's explanations will make a lot of sense. Otherwise, you may have trouble understanding him. However, he is helpful if you have questions, and is willing to listen to student feedback.",1
"shes a nice teacher..you will definitely need the book and study on your own because her lectures are EXTREMELY brief. make sure you do well on the essays and the in-class work, take notes and study for the tests on your own and you should do good. overall, smart and nice teacher. class is fun.",1
Be careful of this emotionally manipulative person.,1
"This class is awful. An insane amount of work and the homework consists of questions with up to five different parts where if you get just one part wrong, it gives you a 0% on the entire question. The professor does not help in any way as I have reached out through email multiple times with not even one reply. Please don't take this professor!",0
"Professor Tran is SO sweet and passionate about the topic. She has a lot of useful material in her lectures, plus attendance is mandatory, so showing up to class is a must. Her tests are open note which takes off a lot of pressure. She's super smart and friendly! (Although I wouldn't say she presents strictly objective material like others said)",1
"Good: free points for attendance, labs, hw. Notes are short and sweet. Bad:  since I can only type 350 characters I'll just mention the main topics. Thick accent, purposely makes tests tricky, grades harshly. No partial credit on a test problem when I left out a number, just ""-10""! In my opinion, a little arrogant and likes to make you feel dumb.",0
I really don't understand the bad reviews. He is very fair with grading. He will take the time to explain things if you need it. He is passionate about chemistry and really wants his students to learn. He will take the time to explain things to you and keeps at it until you get it.,1
"The class is out of 100 total points. There is basically a paper due every other week. You end up reading the entire book, page for page. By the the hardest class I have ever taken. If you miss an assignment you are screwed. If you can take this class with another professor, do it.",0
If you are quiet in class you will be forced to an online class with mandatory C grades for all in class assignments. Ever heard of the saying the customer is always right? Cool in this case the teacher is God and youd do best to follow his commandments or else...,0
She is the best psych professor! EASY A and easy test! Take her seriously. Shes great!,1
"Dr. Monroe is probably the best teacher i have had at OCC. Lectures are very inclusive and will always stop to better explain something. No electronics rule allows you to really focus on the great content. HW for every chapter but the minimum requirement for it is very easy to meet. Grading is clearly laid out. Do the HW, study, pay attention  A.",1
"She's very unapproachable. Rarely smiles, has a smirk on her face and does favour native speakers. She's very unorganized. I have no idea how she's still teaching in a prestigious school like UBC. She's worthless!",0
Overall  i think one of the best statistics teacher  at palm beach state. If I had to i would  take him again  as long as you have the Ti84 or Ti83 and do the homework you should be ok. And if you ever need professor Davis his at the math lab to help.. very good professor..,1
"I dont even think this guy knows what hes doing in this class. He doesnt give out syllabi. He is unorganized and he mocks students in front of other students. Even worse, he is the only professor to teach this class. If you can help it, dont take this class.",0
She is one of my faveorite professors on campus.  She could not be more helpful or nice.  Her class is very interesting despite the fact that the material in my opinion is not exactly easy.  I recomend her hands down and wish I had more time to take other classes with her.  She has become one of my faveorite people on campus.,1
Prof Paige is hands down a great professor. She is easy to understand and she makes the classes interesting. For the first hour of the class she teaches the material and then the class is divided into groups. 30 minutes before the class ends we all come back together and each group has a turn to discuss. She is flexible so just speak to her.,1
"He is a very good lecturer, but his homework and tests are very difficult.  He does consulting work in addition to teaching, so he is impossible to reach if you have questions or need help.  He is very nice and helpful if you can catch him, but good luck!",1
"Extremely rude, and egotistical. I had not completed assignments in a timely enough manner, even though they were not due yet he reported me as being a student who he was concerned about not going to be successful in the course. After emailing him and addressing some concerns I had, he sent a very condescending response that was overwhelmingly rude",0
"He does utilize mymathlab for homework. He offers a ""review"" day before a test. He teaches at a high school level, homework is undergrad level, and tests are masters level. He is helpful when you go to his office to speak with him but I had trouble grasping his lecture methods. Take the time to talk with him and see what you need to do to get the g",0
"While Professor Sinha was a caring person, her plant bio midterm was literally the hardest test I've ever taken in my entire life. She would go way too fast during the lectures, so much so that you would not get a chance to process anything you just learned. On top of that, her midterm would make you remember the most minuscule details. Neelima was",0
"Graded by 3 exams 50 q mc (but she said they're written response from now on due to online), ec quizzes, and tophat homework on 12 chapters. Can get off topic when talking but it's insightful to know so it doesn't bother me. Very passionate about teaching, strict about cheating so beware. She provides lecture videos and always answers emails.",1
"The course pack was abysmal, it had incomplete texts and pages that were incomplete as a sticky-note was left on the page. The majority of the semester was spent listening to presentations of a high school level on artists and art movement or a philosophy. Where was the teaching?! Oh that's right, we watched movies on the Greek & Romans & a church.",0
He's awesome.  Tough class but great teacher,1
"I cannot stress how horrible this professor is. He will leave you hopeless and confused. Even with the copious amounts of tutoring I attended nothing could have prepared me for those horrid exams. Save your money, save your time, and save your enthusiasm for an actual professor. Avoid at all costs, even delay your graduation. Its worth it.",0
"Melissa's such a good professor. She has a lot of passion for the subject, she gives you a lot of time for projects because she knows how busy students can be, and she's so genuinely chill. Highly recommend her and there's an 80% chance you'll develop a crush on her if you take her class.",1
"Great instrustor. Clarifies questions well, makes sure class is following what he is teaching. He is not an easy A. You need to study. He has what he calls case studies, and they are almost like rounds on the show ""scrubs"", I found them to be fun! midterm and final are essay questions. Basically if you can re write notes from memory well,your good.",1
"Take her you will get B- on papers but you can get an A in the class, just do all the journals and you should be fine. she is really caring and not anal about the work you give her.",1
He's kinda boring.  Acutally pretty boring and his syllabus gives you no direction whatsoever on what to read and when.  He usually takes the full class period and at times goes over.,0
"Sullivan is very disorganized, things are often not graded on time and he takes a very long time to respond to e-mails, or just does not respond at all. Notes given in class are often very different from the things we are expected to read online and in the book and there is no correct way to prepare for the test, all of them have been different.",0
Most of these reviews of her here are not very accurate and are way too harsh. Professor Bauman is great. Work hard and listen in class and it will pay off. Her class is very interesting and shes a great person and teacher. She is very helpful but can be a strict grader.,1
"One of the worst professors I've had. Nothing she talks about in class is on the tests so if you don't memorize the text book, you won't do good on the test. All she talks about is sex because apparently she is a ""sex anthropologist"" -which would be funny if she didn't make the class so hard.",0
one of the best courses that I took.,1
"Mrs. Bolt is very knowledgeable about her field of study, that being said i would have to say she doesn't enjoy to teach. She grades extremely hard for a class that is suppose to be simple and it doesn't help that she is unorganized. Mrs. Bolt expects the world of her students but doesn't put in effort into the class",0
"One of the worst classes, he couldnt care less about his students. Most of the class had failing marks and he enjoys talking down to students infront of everyone. Take any other class than this, hes an awful person. Most of your grade is based off group work, if you have a bad group then you will struggle.",0
"Horrible, nervous and unsure.",0
"Fun class, she is an excellent teacher and really encourages students to particpate and learn about french culture. It is not overly difficult, but you must study outside of class to retain the material. She truly cares about student progress. Wouldn't be difficult without previous French, but any experience prior to the class is helpful.",1
He is ok but make sure you do your homework to a T he will drop your final letter grade down if you do not meet his standards,0
I with I could assign Margarita higher than a 5-star rating. This is an incredible instructor who knows exactly how to work with language-learners. I want to keep her in my life to practice Spanish in such a beautifully non-judgmental environment... Not to mention the fact that she would be an awesome person just to spend time with.,1
"she is sweet but like super mcfricking unorganised and yeah. take off your binders, take your meds, im proud of you, & have fun!",0
"His grading is extremely hard, loves to talk down to people and seems full of himself. This is a capstone course, so it's required. Before taking this course, make sure that you ask your regular legal research instructor to teach you how to write up legal memos and how to prepare legal forms b/c Wiley will not. Good luck!",0
Expects extra assignment but does not make clear what the expectations for said assignment are.  Punishes student when his expectations are not met even though they weren't communicated properly,0
"You'll hear nothing but horror stories about him, but you're essentially guaranteed a B. Additionally, taking Abeh is a two-decade tradition for Aviation majors at Lewis, and to skip him for Merzlock or (God forbid) Schaeffer is just a shame.",0
He was an ok teacher.  A lot of the times he would have to go back and correct himself.  I had taken the class before and he made some of the easiest topics confusing! I would stay away if math isn't your strong point!!,0
"closed minded and not helpful- Announced to the class that ""white people steal everything from us."" She was very offensive and only accepted her opinion. CANT STAND HER",0
"Dr. Evans is definitely a toughie, but the classes he teaches are very interesting and he knows so much about his subject. His tests can be brutal if you don't give yourself enough time to study for them, and his feedback on the tests is usually illegible because of his handwriting. But besides that, he has taught me so much & I've enjoyed classes.",1
Mark is my favorite professor,1
"Stochastic Processes is a difficult subject to learn, but Professor Koshevnik tries to show you tricks and tips to get the answer easily (without proofs). He goes over everything you need to know in class, but if you don't understand something, he always responds to his e-mails soon after he receives them and has many office hours.",1
"Bret was a really good professor. You do quite a bit of essays and projects in this class, along with the mandatory student-learning portion. However, the student-learning wasn't as bad as I originally thought and he puts a lot of time and effort into making sure you understand his feedback on your essays.",1
"I took the online interim course. As someone who is HORRIBLE with dates, names, events.... Dr. B made this class extremely doable, especially in such a short amount of time. Listen to his lectures while looking over the slides and take detailed notes of everything he says. His syllabus is clear. DO THE READINGS. Would definitely take again.",1
"David Englund's a solid choice. The class is scored through multiple choice and clicker points. 5 tests, one dropped. If you want to learn something take Englund.",1
"Good prof, took 2600 with her. Exams are fair. If you attend her lecture you will do well. Will involve the class and go through a final review. Very understanding prof",1
"Haleh was very caring, but it is hard to get past her accent and yelling. Her lectures were eh. I read and watched many videos to make up for this. She was good at making easy quizzes and moving deadlines just in case. I didn't miss class, but if you did, it might become harder to pass. Take her if you need to, but don't expect anything special.",0
"This man has driven more students out of ME than all the others put together.  I respect him, but the way you respect a bull when you're in his pasture. Do the homework, ask questions, and if you don't understand, DiBella teaches a night course...",0
Honestly the best teacher I have met. Very respectful. During my 8-week class has never gotten so distracted with us not understanding the topic. Spends time talking about it.,1
"Group project that is worth nearly half of your grade and is semester long. Very intense, but he grades it fairly. Must show up to class. For a tough subject, he does an adequate job of making it somewhat interesting. Core class that you must take, I would recommend him, but just know that you will have to work hard.",1
"Dale is awesome. He cares so much about his students, and knows how to teach! His passion for ASL, interpreting, and his students is clear. He explained things so well, and my skills improved drastically throughout the class. He assigns an appropriate amount of homework for maximum benefit.  I wish I could take Dale for all the skills classes.",1
"best professor at elac. all you need for this class is a printer. provides printable notes. Exam are based of hwk, lecture notes, and study guide. Use a proctor for exams. Caring professor. Makes you work for you grade. HIghly recommended.",1
Toughest grader I ever had at JMSB.,0
"I dropped his class, it was the worst. don't be late! hell lock the door and won't let you in. he has an accent and is a little hard to understand. he makes you feel bad for asking questions. and goes through the lesson very fast, I could barely keep up. he also gives tests like every other week",0
"Avoid!!! Nice lady but she is by far the most unorganized professor I have ever had. Posted every week's assignments late, grading criteria was unexplained until semester's end, and she never graded anything on time- seriously, not once. Can BARELY get a hold of her by email. Posted final paper guidelines 10-days late too. Not worth the headaches.",0
"The first couple of papers he assigns are confusing. Throughout the course it gets easier. Good note taking skills are important as he explains what he expects from students. Lectures are confusing sometimes but it you take notes and ask questions it will be helpful. Very little homework is assigned, go to his office hrs. Great professor!",1
Dr. Hemmings' section was right at the end of an already dense course and her section contained more specifics than any of us really anticipated. It also did not help that she never gave us practice questions. You have to work REALLLLY hard for her section - memorize even the diagrams on the slides. She is very detail-oriented. I had a tough time.,1
"hehe, she was pretty cute at that. Also, she taught well, and graded fairly. That class was a pleasant experience.",1
Ok if you don't come to class your double done he is super harsh and can come off as an a hole but once you get what he wants his class is attainable he grades very harsh and is BIG on correct MLA and citation,0
"Mostly had test and group work was considered to be a grade. She also didn't offer reviews for her class and was just expected to know all of the chapters. I would say her lectures were good, but I feel as they didn't cover everything in the chapters/tests.",0
"Overall good teacher, always ready to help, but his advices are not always helpful. His main problem, I think, that his methods of solving the problems are different from the book, the homework is from the book and when you ask him questions about book methods of solving he can not answer.",1
Worst mistake to take this guy... absolutely clueless,0
Great teacher! This was my first time taking a math class online and it was an amazing experiance! Everything was super clear and easy!,1
"I don't know if it was because we had to be online, but there was always tons of confusion in this class. He would easily get angry if we didn't know something, even if it was our first day looking at it. He would randomly start ranting about things that weren't related. He didn't show up for class upwards of 5 times with no warning too.",0
"Awesome professor. He will help you through this class if you are unsure. Take home final, project, and 2 artical critiques. Really easy.",1
He's really nice and pretty laid back. He is always willing to help. One time I and nearly the entire class hadn't written a paper that was due and he gave us all an extension. Such a sweet guy!,1
"Schellhorn is deffinetly your best option for Finance 201. Gives study guide, tests are exactly what she teaches in class, and little homework. Do yourself a favor and take her for Finance 201, especially because all of the other teachers are so bad.",1
"Absolutely loved her assignments. They were always eccentric and fun to do, and great ways to exercise a writer's mind. She's a tough grader but she always gives great feedback. The only issue I had with her was how much she'd go off on tangents about her life during lectures, which made it really hard for me to focus. Overall a pretty good prof.",1
"Dr. Lockhart is a great teacher and a very nice man.  He makes the class interesting and really makes you understand the information.  His tests come right out of the reviews, and his projects are easy and straight-forward.  I would definitely take Dr. Lockhart again if I could.",1
"Very kind person. Very inspirational. She makes me want to achieve the most out of life. Thank you, Alynn !",1
He is the best professor. He give one midterm exam and one final and both of them are home take. in the midterm you can do as many times you can and raise your grade. He usually look at the effort that students put in his midterm. He is simply awesome and care for his students.,1
Pretty hard to understand at times and needs to keep up on the test to pass the class.  hardly any homework but online quizes.,0
Dr.Nikkel was a fair teacher for the most part. He seems to really enjoy what he dose for a living. His class is mostly him running about the room and looking at these videos. I liked him cuz his work was stright to the point and he really wanted his studnets to learn. Also i got my best naps in his class.,1
really poor and mean,0
"This is not a very difficult class and if you show up he will gladly help you. I got A's on all of the tests and hw, if you do not understand the material at first he'll help you learn it. I found the class interesting & even funny sommetimes",1
"Years ago now... Had her for Shakespeare in 2nd + 4th years and Milton in 3rd year. Every time was roughly the same - regurgitate the ideas she gives in lecture if you want a good grade. Not a difficult concept when you think about it, but a bit stunting. 2nd year Shakespeare was the only course of hers in which I felt I had a little freedom.",0
"Prof. Shobeiri really tries to help everyone and make sure they're on the same page but most of us struggled since the methods he taught had better ways to get to the same answer. For example, there's more than one way to answer a question, and he teaches the extra long way when there are quicker, easier methods to get to the same answer",1
Best prof ever but amazing teacher. Her best trait by far is that she gave birth to the absolute unit of Matt Carlson. Kid has the physique of a Greek god combined with Arnold schwarzenegger. You look at him and think there is no way someone that good looking can be smart as well but you are mistaken. He is everything you wished to be in 1 man.,1
"Textbook was assigned, but I didn't use it. Her lectures were enough to pass the exams for me. You get to drop an exam if you need to, or, if you get a high enough average on the three exams, you can skip the finals. Only three tests and the final, plus extra credit. She is funny and uses a lot of videos in class. Definitely liked listening to her.",1
"I LOVED HIM! He is the sweetest guy and you can tell he wants his students to succeed. I did not think his accent was strong at all. All quizzes are online and tests were MC and FR. He gives you all the material you need to succeed. As a plus, hes only the only BMS 251 prof that gives extra credit! Would definitely take him again!!",1
"Meyers is young, spirited, funny, and overall an inspirational professor. Her lectures are truly entertaining and they make you WANT to participate(even though you may not usually). EVERYONE should take this specific course by her as well, seriously changed the way I see things, which is rare to say about other courses.",1
Good class. The lecture part was interesting. Can be a hard grader but fair. Always willing to help.,1
Not a hard class with a really sweet and nice teacher. Really understanding and overall a great teacher. If you don't take her for Spanish then you're missing out.,1
"idk what to say theres 0 connection between her and students everything is done by the tas, she will stop by tutorials and is easy to set up meetings with but she will tell u 1 thing and that ta will say another, the course is disorganized but at least u don't even gotta pay attention to the lectures cus no final exam or midterm",0
"I agree with the clothes.  Not professional at all.  Sometimes very rude to students should you not share the same interests.  Group work is too much.  There isn't much of a lecture/she just reads from slide shows.  Only positive about her is she calls you when she cancels class.  Expects a lot of work to be done (this is college, not high school).",0
"She is very strict with her grading on the homework assignments, so even minor errors can drop your score significantly. Her lectures were all PowerPoints and she didnt really explain how to actually code a program very well. Labs often took way longer than expected, and required work outside of class.",0
"I wouldn't recommend her online EDU104 class to anyone. She doesn't respond to emails  in a timely manner, and when she replies it sounds like she thinks you're stupid. It also seems like she thinks this class is the only class you're taking and you have no other responsibilities. ",0
Take this prof for any class. This prof makes the class easy to learn and understand.,1
She has a different teaching method.. Quiz every first class of the week. Homework is from textbook but it is not looked at or graded.,0
If you wanna have no life outside of microbiology go for it. Tests every week with questions that are tricky af and will make you question all of your study habits. If you are taking any other class that has the potential of being at a difficulty level of above 2 do not take this teacher!,0
"This class was so incredibly confusing. She explained things in a very unclear manner, even my TA said that she was confusing.",0
"Mr. Haberman was a great professor. He is a really excited and energetic person, especially about math. Talks a little fast but will always help you if you ask. Most of the work you do isn't checked or graded, but the weekly labs and exams are modeled off the problems. A little picky on syntax. You decide how much work you need to get the A.",1
"In lecture, Jason makes complex topics fairly straightforward. However, in my opinion, the tests were not very reflective of understanding of the material. He said to use his slides as a study guide, which isn't helpful when there are hundreds of slides. Often, test questions were random throwaway facts from lecture. This course was a challenge.",1
"No rubric for any assignments and shows you how to do stuff, but doesn't teach what it is you're doing. Almost every class starts at a different time. Instructions and guidelines are unclear and vague.",0
"if you get an option of a thursday or tuesday lab take thursday because the tuesday lab can tell you everything on the lab exams, don't take the quizzes lightly, they add up and are a huge factor. Don't rely on her as a teacher, she simply goes off the ch in her class time. She does her best to be there but in the end its just a job. good outlines",0
He is pretty hard to understand. Get the textbook so you will know what is going on. His in-class examples don't make sense and he writes in an unorganized manner. You will have no idea how to calculate your grade because he makes it up as you go through the semester. There are hardly any explained practice problems so you're screwed for the exams.,0
"Incredibly difficult to work with, and rude when asked questions. Made up words like ""dramatical"" in an ENGLISH class.",0
If you're concerned with your grades I would highly recommend taking this class from another instructor. The classwork is far more extensive than needed and the instructor is very inflexible.  You will be required to do several hours unrelated volunteer work and raise a virtual child online which is time consuming and holds little educational value,0
"She's a terrible teacher. She's a tough grader, very vague in directions and isn't very helpful when asking for help. Secondly, this is just an assumption, but she's been picking on certain students for harder samples during the labs.",0
Awesome class - easy A ! Great GPA booster as long as you do your work. Boyer is an awesome teacher wish they had more like him in the AA program. I've taken three of his classes. Wish I could take more.,1
"Lectures were not very helpful. Had to google most things for my homework, didn't buy the textbook nor did I need it. Doesn't take attendance so don't need to go to class. Not a stimulating class, not an easy class. He's a cool guy, but not a good professor",0
"Cool guy, great teacher, but he looks like a veggietale character.",1
"I highly recommend Dr. Sharma's pov and soc welfare course. Reading isn't required due to her power points being based on the book. All assignments are easy and the videos she has us watch were interesting. Lectures can be repetitive but if the whole class participates, it can make it more interesting. Also, she wants her students to participate.",1
"He is a really good professor for REL 102. His lectures are pretty interesting, but attendance is not mandatory. There are a lot of online quizzes before class. The tests are sort of easy... definitely study more than just the review quiz he gives on blackboard. Would recommend him for students who want an ok grade and want to learn about religion.",1
"This class is intellectually demeaning and should not be required. I have learned absolutely nothing that I did not already learn in high school or in my other intro-level SPEA classes. The course is only challenging in the sense there are so many small, petty assignments that are easy to forget and honestly taking them is offensive as a student.",0
"If you want to fall asleep in class you should really take him for english. He talks waaay too much, but nothing he says makes sense. He leaves too much work and theres alot of reading, talks more about history than anything else. Does not know how to teach I dropped his class and if you are smart you will too!",0
Don't take this professor she is one of the worst online professors. She provides little to no instruction on assignments & will not provide any meaningful assistance. She provides no feedback on assignments to understand your grade. She is also a stickler when it comes to APA citations/references. She essentially looks to find flaws in your work.,0
hate this class i went to every lecture and didnt learn a thing. he made me want to sleep for the 50min i had to spend with him. horrible grader. besides the tests being hard the homework was super hard and just plain dumb. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS choose something fun,0
"I don't recommend her for first year students as she'll destroy your gpa with her hard tests and exams if you don't learn to adapt. If you're stuck with her, go to all her DGD's and PAY ATTENTION to all examples she does in class as it might save you during a test. Overall decent prof but expect to put in at least 20 (or more) hours a week for an A",0
This class is very lecture heavy. It is impossible to retain all the information given. Each exam is on approximately 10 units with 20 slides each. Additionally he is a very tough grader. DO NOT TAKE unless you absolutely have to.,0
It took me a while to get used to Mrs. Barclift but she turned out to be my favorite teacher. She gives a lot of homework but it actually helps your grade a lot if just take the time to do it. I wish I could take all of my classes with her!,1
"She gives prompts that are TOO vague. She made us write too many papers, and have graded only one. She dropped the rest because she thinks ""we going to work way more the second half of the semester."" She uses Grammarly for grading... gives us no help in our writing. I couldn't switch our of her class :( do NOT take her class.",0
"He is not the worst or best. You will have to work for you grade and spend hours on math homework so be prepared. There will be days you will multiple assignments due and some days you will have 0. Get in the mindset to put in the work and you will pass. Will it be an A or B? Most likely not, but you will pass if you do the work.",0
Very nice and caring teacher and person. She will go out of her way to help you with personal problems or school problems. NUMBER 1.,1
Being in her class made me wanna kms I could not,0
"Embarrassed me in front of my whole class by using a piece of my essay (not before completely editing it to make it unclear and confusing) and then promptly told the whole class that I make her job hard. Stuck in her older generational ways and thinks young people are pessimistic. $130+ text book, no time to write drafts/essays",0
"If you're not a math or science major DO NOT take it with this guy. Guy can't speak english, offers no help, and doesn't explain his grading system. I've had great experiences with other teachers in the math department but not him.",0
Below average teacher,0
You will do a majority of your work through MyLabMath with almost no communication with the teacher herself and when you do talk to her she is always aggressive and hardheaded. Your entire semester grade is essentially just the two exams and that's it since she weighs their grade so heavily.,0
"Fantastic class notes and overall approach to teaching the material. If you don't understand the material visiting him during office hours is like seeing a friend for help. Assignments can be challenging and the tests are fair. Anyone planning on taking Math1000, Dr. Dyer is the man",1
"Mr. I is a great coach, he truly cares about the students. He teaches tools that will make you successful in life. He is very professional and loves his job. He makes sure each student is comfortable in their environment, to deliver their speech.",1
"Prof Connelly is a very intelligent and helpful teacher, although he often takes himself too seriously.  If all he had to manage was the DC Term, then he would be perfect.",1
"I had Xandy Gilmore for A&P 1 & 2 during the summer, I had no interest in science, but I needed this class to transfer. Xandy was by far one of my favorite instructors at Vernon she made A&P fun and interesting I would find myself eager to go back into her class. She also taught me new was to study and memorize things that were important.",1
STAY AWAY,0
"Casey is definitely talented and knows what he is talking about, but he does not explain through problems well. His study guides were nothing like his exams and he seemed to not have much care for his students and what they actually learned. I know he is a great person and very smart but I would not take him again just because I did not learn much",0
"Difficult, unhelpful, unresponsive to questions, designed to make you struggle and fail.",0
"I'm really unsure why people gave him such good reviews. He's a great guy, horrible professor. He only puts up 4 or 5 grades a semester and 4 of them are tests. He teaches his 101 class like a 300 class and goes way too deep into geography. He doesn't teach what Geography 101 warrants. He's also incredibly monotone and difficult to listen to.",0
"As long as you follow the reviews for the test, this class should be an easy one to pass.",1
"I loved Mr. Pearson. He was blunt and to the point, and his comments, though often not flattering, were never a personal attack. He remains one of my favorite teachers from AMDA, and the benchmark for what i look for when i need someone to teach me something difficult. I think it was because he made his expectations very clear.",1
"Goldner is by far one of the best professors I've taken so far in the History department. He clearly know his subject and adds a great personality to lectures which keep you engaged which is important for a history course. He's somewhat strict about classroom etiquette, but I can respect that since it feels like he puts his energy into his lectures",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. It seems like she is never prepared for lecture. She mumbles, and if you pay attention to what she is saying she repeats the same idea several times in one sentence, just reworded. She does not know how to help students and when you ask her one question, you're left with many more after her answer.",0
"Awful. Didn't grade anything and gave tons of lengthy weekly assignments.. at the end of the semester I had 4 recorded grades. 95 95 87 74 I ended up with a B.. I did over 20 assignments (essays, projects, quizzes) I have no idea how my grade was calculated.",0
"At first I really enjoyed the class , but it went somewhat downhill. I learned a lot from the class, but felt that the teacher was judging what people said, even though it is supposed to be a share zone. She also grades papers very hard based on APA and wording, not so much content. I would rather not take again. I dreaded the last weeks of class. ",0
"Great class discussions about borders, so relevant. I enjoyed the class and will take more classes with Prof. Arrizon. She is obviously an expert in the subject. Extra credit too.",1
"I stopped going to class because of how rude and demeaning she was in class. She would yell at us if answers weren't exactly she was looking for. Eventually no one would answer her questions and she got even angrier for lack of participation. Lost 20% for not participating, have to retake. Bad experience with her as department head as well.",0
Terrible experience... Her voice is quite low... Too much homework always due in a short time...,0
LOVED HER! I'm taking her for spanish 102 for the summer. Such a sweet woman. The class is VERY doable and she definitely wants everyone to do well! She will help with any questions you have and very helpful in general. I personally loved her. It's not the easiest class in the world but if you can put the time in definitely take her she's the best!,1
All I have to say is eh. Its an okay class. If you can remember stuff and like to read then youll pass. Everything is straight from the textbook.,1
"This Professor is HORRIBLE! Please I am being honest, do not take her class. She talks and talks and talks about nothing. Gives a lot of pop quizzes on readings that are way too long, and is a harsh grader! She will never give you the benefit of the doubt. Save yourself and DO NOT TAKE HER!",0
Loved ENGL1101 with Wisner. He was so nice and I got an A with ease! As long as you do the work you'll be fine! Highly recommend.,1
"She is really hard to understand on her video lectures. Also, she often times works on the homework in her video lectures and gets the question answers wrong.  That's worrisome. She takes forever to upload her video lectures. Really nice person, but not the best professor. If you don't like doing HW and quizzes last minute do not take her. ",0
"He wasn't very thorough on how to actually solve most of the equations he'd talk about. Also, his examples on how to solve the problems were less than mediocre. He doesn't really put that much effort into his lectures.",0
"worst professor, giving thousands of homework and expect you to finish it in less than a week. her precal 165 is the worst class to take online, please run, do not take her online",0
"She doesn't mind helping students during her office hours, however she made a lot of mistakes when teaching in class which then will confuse you a lot.  If you want to do well, attend her office hours, she might give you a hint what will be on the mid term, which happened to my friend. Overall, not a great prof. Come on U of T!!!",0
I absolutely love this woman.  She is vibrant and interesting and makes me want to try harder....I wish she was my mom :(,1
"Professor Fox is great. She expects a lot, and she definitely won't just hand over a passing grade. She makes you work for it, which is so important. She genuinely cares about her students. I definitely plan on taking her for ENG 102 as well, because she has been one of the most helpful teachers I have ever had. (high school included) ",1
"I dislike science, but this is the best breadth course!! I learned a ton of important info also. Attendance not mandatory, but definitely watch the lectures. He's super helpful, passionate, and knowledgable, willing to answer any and all questions! I highly suggest taking this class.",1
"I would never, ever recommend taking this course or this professor.  He graded so hard that it was impossible to please him.  I have a 3.9 GPA but I will be lucky to get a C in this course.  For a 100 course it is ridiculous.",0
"He was so bad I had to drop his class. Grades quizzes and exams only, assigns homework, but wont grade it so it cant help offset a bad exam. He is nice, but his lectures are confusing to the point it looks like he has never taught. I talked to ex-peers and they all told me he is pretty bad and were at major risk for not passing.",0
"I love her,she is understanding and easy to talk to.The only problem is she gives long readings.",1
"This teacher is horrible! Hardly responds to emails, and if he does he's rude! He is very unclear of due dates. He forgets to put links up for the tests and doesn't let us know any of our grades! I would not suggest taking this teacher!",0
"The best professor I have ever had in my life. By far the best engineering professor on campus. Willing to help anytime. Laid back, if the class doesn't want homework to be due that day, he'll just move it back. Take him whenever possible.",1
Ms. Zink is knowledgeable and subject material. She knows what she wants from her students' papers.  She can be rather challenging at times. She's always willing to help with any questions or comments one might have with her critiques of an individual student's paper. Ms. Zink has high standards and wants her students to do well period.,1
"First of all, she was hard for me to ask questions to. When I did, I felt like she was talking down to me. She assigns homework but never actually looks at it and if you don't pass her tests, your chances of passing the class aren't good. Not a chance in hell I would ever take her again.",0
"She will give you a bunch of documents that the book already has and youtube videos, if you don't understand then don't try to ask her, because she won't help you much but send you dozens more the useless thing you already search for on the internet, to get good grades or trying to get an A in her class will only be magic that can help you LOL",0
"Great man and a great teacher!!! Truly an educator and a good man. He speaks his mind and is old fashion which i loved! Show up to his classes pay attention, be courteous, and do well on his quiz, 2 tests and paper and youll do fine...( BTW: Do the paper on something he loves to talk about! Easy A!)",1
This professor was horrible! I had her for the lab portion of PSYC 4483 and I did not enjoy having her. ,0
"The worst class I have taken in my entire life, it's literally the middle of the semester but I can't stand this class. For heaven's sake DO NOT take this class, Spare yourself from stress.",0
"She doesn't assign a lot of work, but she's     picky about grading.",0
"Shes a really really good prof if you dont get an a in this class its either because you didnt study for the tests, or read the textbook! Btw make sure you read the research study because alot of those come on the test",1
"Great lectures, he was always entertaining and I learned a lot without really using a textbook. He uses a lot of outside materials and brings it all together in class. You have to be able to listen to him in class and I would highly recommend going to class, but if you don't it's not a huge deal and he wouldn't hold it against you.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU DON'T NEED TO! At first she seemed really cool, but come to find out there's homework EVERY WEEK, You have to type a 500 word journal 6 times out of the quarter, which is a drag. Has two midterms and a final. She has study guides for it btw. You Also need to participate or you won't get any participation points -.-",0
Doesn't explain things well in order for you to get a really good grade in this course. A calculator is not allowed! Better be excellent at Math or you probably won't pass. Majority of students dropped his class and one student switched her degree because of this professor!!! HORRIBLE WOULD NOT EVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!! TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!!!,0
"You may want to throw a test rock in before entering her office. Sometimes she's great, helpful, interesting; sometimes she's stark raving mad (I mean ""Yellow Wallpaper"" mad).",0
"The final was ridiculously hard for this class. None of the type of problems on the exam were ever given to the students as homework, practice, or web problems. It's almost like he needed to lower the average grade of the class.",0
"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",0
"Even though his Finals are hard. He is one of the best instructors at East Bay. He replies fast and is very kind and helpful. I took two ITM classes with him. Do your website, weekly homework which is easy and you'll pass. Just his exams are pretty hard.",1
"He is an amazing person, very friendly and makes it a point to get to know you as a student and individual. But the lectures don't connect with the books, and neither of those connect with the tests. I payed close attention to what he was saying in class and did poor on the tests.",1
Do not take her. Very hard grader and tests are horrible. Says she is available for help but never emails you back.,0
He coo,1
"This class seemed interesting but it was kinda boring. Teacher is great though, his stories are funny and we watched interesting videos in class. But the tests are extremely hard.",1
"I POSTED TO HER IN AN EMAIL FOR FALL 2010 SEM CLASS  FINAL GRADE                  I need to ask you a question; I noticed my grade was a B in the class, with a pt total of 1015. I am very happy about it, but?.  According to the syllabus grading system a pt total of 852-958 would qualify as a B in the course.  As I mentioned I have 1015 pts.  That w",0
He is a nice guy but his class is difficult. You have quizzes from the book every week and he expects every student to participate in the discussion. You are graded for participation. Sometimes his grading was very hot and cold. He didn't ever have anything good to say about my discussion posts and left long messages as to what I didn't do right.,0
"Kubota sensei is on top of it!  She keeps us engaged as well well as stimulated!  She reviews and repeats, which some people complain about.. but that is what learning a language is all about!  She is very funny and very nice.. and totemo genki desu!",1
"Boring teacher, likes to fail students.",0
"He is a very good professor. He did not lecture in class but if you needed help he was super eager to help you. Since the class was online and let us have our space, he stays up front and his tests are easy. He's a great professor when you need help and when you don't. He did not take attendance but if you get too far behind he'll withdrawal you.",1
"Constantly late to class and lab. Easily distracted and rarely stays on topic. Poor control of class, so students are constantly talking over him. Be prepared to write fast, notes are long. Quizzes are easy and so is classwork.",1
"great enthusiasm, really encourages participation,makes you really think,which college is about-She has a great career ahead of her-i plan on taking more classes with her-Hope UNO can keep her",1
"she's a very nice lady who is always willing to help. i took the class online, so the fact that she responds quickly to emails was essential. the class wasn't difficult per se, but there's a ton of material to absorb. luckily she allowed the exams to be open note since it was an online class.",1
"Lectures tend to be boring but the coursework was easy enough with prior CS. Will go on long tangents of his time working at places such as Microsoft or ethics. Very very lenient on late work, you'll still get full credit for something few hours late (he justifies this as ""an employer would want a finished product late rather than incomplete"").",1
"This class was amazing! I've always loved psychology, but Criminal Behaviour was fascinating and exciting. There is a lot of material, and unless she changes something, you will need to read the textbook for testable material (but text's in library). Her tests and assignments were fun and fair, and gave you lots grade opportunities!",1
Approaches the course with an intersectional lens and helps develop thought social issues and policymaking. A great course. I learned a lot.,1
"Very knowledgeable and has a lot of real life experiences.  As previously mentioned, he is an easy grader and the class can be somewhat boring.  Definitely take him if you want to learn some things.",1
"Pros: he knows what he's talking about Cons: cocky, arrogant, belittles any student who asks him a question",0
"This is one of those professors that says there's a ""method to their madness"" because they know they're too disorganized to teach properly",0
"My 8th online class-4.0 GPA. Worst prof. by far! Description of 8 wk online course: Step 1) Read the book. Step 2) Take 4 exams. Step 3) Write 2 papers(7+ pgs each) AND 8 pg group project AND write & give 5 minute speech. She told you which book to buy, graded papers & then zip. What about using the internet to show exs/clarify topics? AVOID AVOID",0
"He is one of my favorite teachers. Prepare to laugh while learning because he is a very funny teacher. He's very helpful, but makes you correct your own mistakes.",1
"Gives you a chance to retake one test each semester. I had him for math 0700 my freshman year, and luckily I am taking him this semester for finite again. He is a little goofy, but the best math teacher I have had at AUM. Also, you don't need to purchase a book because all his material is on his website.",1
"Dr. Carr (he received his doctorate in Fall 2020) is truly a leader of future leaders. His class is helpful on so many levels and can assist anyone. He makes you read for sure and there are many assignments to help reflect on yourself. He requires a lot and sets high expectations, but it only serves to help you. Dr. Carr is inspirational.",1
"Anderson is great. Especially for classes like Bcal 267/268. She can go pretty fast in class, but doing the homework helps a lot (plus its extra credit if you do it). She's phenomenal if you go to her office hours too.",1
I got an A on the midterm paper and blackboard says that i have more than 100% on every quiz but I was still given a B in the class. I pretty sure she is out to get me. Not to metion she likesto push her politics on the class.,0
Professor Wood is a great professor. She definitely knows her stuff. She is extremely smart and she is definitely great at explaining the subject. She is very tough at grading. You have to attend the class if you want to pass it. Students don't like her because she is not the kind of professor that you can mess around with. She won't tolerate it.,1
"Participation is important. Reading assignments given for in class discussion and lectures. Easy group in class assignments, but you can also complete on your own for credit if class is missed. ",1
"Nice instructor overall, makes you read a lot. The reading she picks are nonsense. Full of socialistic ideals and very ""Class oppressive"" orientated. Took too long to say very little in the long tun. Thought my ideas were crap one week then used them as her own examples a few weeks later! Did not care about my grade, all I needed were the credits.",0
"Professor Schap's lectures are fast-paced and pretty confusing. He assigns a lot of textbook reading and practice problems that are not graded. HOWEVER, this extra work is how I actually learned and did well in the class because the lectures were confusing. If you take this class, do the extra work because it will be to your benefit in the end.",0
"Nice Professor, Helped me on my journey. I am doing much better now.",1
"Class notes are scattered like the lectures.  He can't stay on point and jumps info all over the place.  Took his class for part of my nursing, no nursing info was taught.  I don't know anything more than when I started except about fermentation which he must like.",0
"If you have any interest in studying Political Science, stay away from this professor as she does not teach it. Lois' teaching style is to espouse her own views and belittle yours. Grades are given willy-nilly with contradictory feedback which all but guarantee a stifled learning experience. Steer very clear of this one, fellow students.",0
"One of the most terrible lecturers in MIS department. I was forced to take two of his classes, and none of them turn to be a good experience. Extremely unorganized lectures, a lot of workshops and homework. Silly attendance counting method. 100% unrecocommended",0
"Professor McDevit gives very hard tests that are easily overcome by studying. Class attendance is mandatory, as without going to class, you miss many of the questions that appear on his tests. He's a great teacher for his lab class and his regular class, but studying is necessary.",1
"Class is smarter than she is. You can argue your answers and get credit for being wrong pretty much as long as you have a good arguement. She moves off topic a lot and is easily distracted by student dicussion. She also favors to a degree. Easy to make her favor you, sound smart and outgoing. I prefer her class over any else because she's so easy..",0
She is very disorganized and doesn't not explain assignments clearly. Assignments and readings take forever to complete and she has unrealistic expectations.,0
Dr. Yang often interrupts his students midway through their questions for no discernible reason other than to show off his knowledge on any number of subjects. A bit of an egomaniac as well as a real stickler for the rules. Whole class is him talking while everyone else just stares down at their phones (except for like two or three teachers pets),0
"Dr. Hayes is the most intimidating woman I have ever met. I had borderline panic attacks every time I walked into my piano class. If you mess something up, she will call you out in front of the class & make you do it over & over until you get it right. I would try to ask questions but she would just look at me like I was stupid. Worst class ever.",0
"This professor is tougher than she looks. The course seemed to good to be true, and it was exactly that. She would provide me with feedback that really made me feel incompetent and discouraged about my writing, especially since I received a 4.0 in both my English comp classes. Vagueness seemed to be attached to all of her assignments too.",0
She is a very lazy and boring professor. Her power points are packed with information and it is nearly impossible to remember everything for exams. She does allow unlimited notecards on the 2nd and third test. Despite being difficult she took our input into consideration and tried to make the class more fair after the 2nd exam which avgd in the 50s,0
Her use of real life examples adds a level of humor and rememberable applications to topics. Going to class makes the topics stay in your brain.,1
"EASY CLASS, WONDERFUL PROFESSOR, EASY A, FRIENDLY CLASS. BEST CLASS EVER!!! TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ""A"" WITHOUT MUCH WORK. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIVITIES. EASY A!!!!!!",1
"Great professor.  If you have a question outside class e-mail him and expect a response within a few hours.  Great guy, no attendance policy.  Be your own boss when it comes to learning speed and what you do and don't do for the class.  I loved it!  Would take him any day.",1
Her tests are worded really badly so you won't do well on them. She also lost one of my assignments which kept me from getting a B in the class and when I tried talking to her she didn't seem concerned at all. She's rude and unclear and takes forever to grade things. I don't recommend her at all.,0
She was the most horrible teacher she doesn't allow you to make up work and also doesn't allow you to turn online she also do petty stuff.,0
"This guy was a terrible and is always ""right"". He will doc you points for things he didn't ask for. We can't read minds.. you will also never get 100% on anything.I have already learned all of the material before but found a way to doc me points",0
Very hard to understant do to her accent.  Class was taught at a graduate level over our heads.  Did not like answering questions.,0
Mr. Wilbrandt was one of my favorite teachers at AU. Was never that interested in ECON but he tried to make class as interesting. Always made sure his students understood the material and if not would always be willing to meet with you. He held study sessions before each test that helped a lot. Tests and quizzes are easy if you put in the time.,1
"Even though much of the class was failing, she would say that this was baby bio in comparison to the Biology course she took in college. This was demoralizing and humiliating. She also would discourage nursing students who have children, which I thought was odd because Goodwin is a career-focused college with a lot of students who have families.",0
Worst teacher ive ever had,0
"I found Amit's International Economics and Policy class to be pretty straight forward. His lectures literally repeat what the book says, so it can get kind of boring but it makes knowing what to study for the tests easy. His tone of voice sounds like he's really bored when he's teaching. We had 3 hws, 2 midterms, clicker attendance, and a final.",1
"Find someone else to take. He is not helpful at all. DO NOT buy the book you'll never use it, unless you read it. But thats what Khan Academy is for. So save yourself the money and buy the ebook",0
"Nice guy but I hate his class. A lot of homework and projects. Also, have a midterm and final. he grades really harshly and ridiculous. If you're not very familiar with excel and access microsoft don't take his class.",0
"He is amazing, and I would recommend people to take him. Very understanding, and works great with his students. Lets you use notecards on tests.",1
One of the main things I remember from his class is that he would always stop after every concept and ask if he needed to rephrase something. He begged for people to ask questions but no one would. His lectures aren't confusing if you participate & ask questions. He made study guides for tests because someone asked if he would. He cares a lot.,1
"Ms. Magdaleno is a great teacher, she makes the class and the assignments fun and interesting. If you walk in thinking that it's an easy A think again, because you have to put the work in. There's always something due and it's east to get behind if you don't stay on top of everything. She makes class exciting with her nice sweet ass and purple hair",1
"Great professor, makes class interesting with his stories. Extra credit is hard but worth it, really boosts your grade up in the class.",1
"typed his lectures during the course. overall, unprepared and sloppy. failed to provide clear grading criteria for coursework. ",0
"Prof. Robertson had a huge workload, so much that I felt my other classes started to suffer because I was constantly worried about her work, even with my good time management skills. 4 group projects in 1 semester and some overlapped which was annoying. Gives no feedback and is extremely annoying. Save yourself the trouble.",0
"She scares me. I mean, I walked into the class and afterwards got on the phone and was like ""daddy, my production teacher scares me."" Also, if she says you need a text book (prod.2) You Don't. We didn't use it once. She gets nicer the longer you're in class but still first impressions are everything. And she scared me.",1
"The class always acts like theyre always mad with her and she doesn't have a great rating- but I don't get it. She is respectful, very intelligent, always responds to emails, etc promptly. Few assignments and 3-4 tests, nothing too difficult. Pop quizzes, again nothing too bad. Off topic and rambles often, but not a big deal. Shes act. very sweet!",1
"Her phone goes off during speeches all the time. She is unclear in directions, and seems to confuse herself. She grades this level 100 class that most must take as if the people in it are supposed to be professional speakers. She does not pay attention during speeches and then counts points off for things she didn't hear, even if they are included",0
I absolutely adore Dr. Record! He's my favorite professor and his lectures are always super interesting and insightful. His class is very engaging and he always makes sure to check up on how we're feeling which is appreciated.,1
Whats really cool about him is that his passion for law rly radiates in his lectures. The content was super interesting so that was an added plus. Make sure you do EVERY SINGLE READING b/c although his exams are open-note you genuinely have to understand every aspect. Go to lecture if youre confused-- he pinpoints exactly what he wants you to know,1
I really enjoyed the class. The professor is extremely helpful and willing to meet outside of class for additional help and clarification. I really appreciated that the syllabus was well organized and easy to follow.,1
J'adore ce prof!!!,1
"As a Chinese, I don't even understand her accent.... Too much information for memorize and she only test on 15% of them. Do not try to run away during break.",0
"Super friendly! Admitted he wasn't great at lecture timing with class being online. However, the material is digestible and he gave us practice questions for each lecture that line up with the difficulty of the exam questions. 5 exams, pretty straightforward with a take-home part for each. Don't even need the textbook, just rewatch lectures",1
"Very rude, do not take his course if you don't have to.",0
Very good teacher and he is also very funny. Pay attention in class and study even a little bit and you'll be more than fine.,1
don't take this class,0
"Curses, always cancelled class, never emails, never gives criteria for work, has walked out of class",0
"Bioethics class I took in the summer. Summer classes can be tough since it is a 4 week class but this kind of hard was on another level. Weekly long readings, quizzes, discussion forums, papers, videos to watch. ALSO a group project, research paper, and reading a novel! All in 4 weeks! I work and have a life. Amount of work is ridiculous. AVOID!!!",0
"great teacher! Had zero interest in Logic & he made everything really clear, though not necessarily easy.  Read the book, do the homework & you will do fine.  Attendance is required & there are quizzes almost every week (lowest 2 dropped).  He really reviews what you need to know though & is willing to meet students to help them with any questions.",1
He's one of the best,1
"Prof Voss-Hubbard is an excellent teacher.  This class really made me think about alot of issues in US history.  He's smart, interesting, tough but fair, and definitely hot!  Well worth the effort.",1
I took Garrigan for psych101 and I loved this class. All the information was there from power points and notes. There are no tricks on the quizzes. If you study the material it is easy. Lectures are interesting. Not boring at all. I would most definitely take him again. Getting up early for his class is not a problem. ,1
Took SI101R (with another prof) and did well. And then decided to take 102R and he excepted us to be masters of the language even though we were still in a 100s course. Will not take another course with him AGAIN!!  ,0
"She got rid of extra credit. She prepares you well for the exams, but the final is a huge curveball so expect tears",0
"shows preference toward kids who already know a little spanish already. not too tough of a grader though, fair. heavy textbook usage too.. If she doesnt like you , she will out you a bad grade (( dont take her class )",0
shes one of the best teachers on campus. shes really down to earth and she doesn't talk down to the students. i'll miss her!,1
"His online course is not that bad, really! He offers plenty of extra credit and has quite a few movie clips throughout the course. One thing you should consider is that he has a ton of flash video lectures that take up a ton of your time. Make sure you watch them early! Overall though, he seemed open, available and understanding.",1
"Amazing German guy, he's funny, energetic and he knows what students need. His lectures are bearable and he comes up with new ways for students to participate even in a 150 person lecture hall. Highly recommend taking this class with him. The class is largely dependent on easy homework and quizzes. Just remember to do the homework!",1
"Good professor, tests basically right out of textbook problems so do the review and you'll do great on the exams. Exam graders seem to be quite lenient with points. Homework can take a very long time to complete!",1
"Mrs. McGee is a great professor. You will have to work hard though, she grades the open ended questions pretty toughly, but she gives you study guides so you know what to expect. You will be able to pass if you put the work in, and she posts the powerpoints online so that you're able to stay on track.",1
Doug is so funny and gives you a lot of freedom.,1
"She's such a cool professor. She's very down to earth and willing to do anything to help you understand the material. She gives a lot of essays, but she isn't a very hard grader. She likes to really get to know her students, she doesn't just see you as an obligation.",1
Dr. Hwang is highly knowledgeable in his field and is a very nice person all around. He is available to help students who are struggling and is very helpful in general.,1
"Class moves VERY fast, but that's not really the professor's fault--the department chooses to cover all of Greek in two semesters. There's really no time to enjoy what you're learning. Pretty nice lady.",1
"he was a rly good french teacher but he is also a very hard marker. Though when he teaches you see that he's passionate about it. He can have some interesting stories to tell the class when he goes off topic, which is often. :)",1
"I did not really like Dr. Kaminski that much. Too scatterbrained for me to understand fully what she's talking about. She tends to ramble a lot, too.",0
"Pretty terrible professor. Completely unorganized, sometimes passive aggressive with his students. Handled the whole transition to online classes terribly. He drones on during lectures. Extremely clueless at times. Highly recommend you to avoid at all costs.",0
Professor Ruiz is a good teacher. You will learn in her class. I took Intensive Span for Heritage Learners and get ready to work! She gives a lot of online homework as well as quizzes apart from your tests and group projects. If you do no make time for this class you will not pass. She does have patience and is willing to break it down for you.,1
Overall not that bad of a teacher. She gives you about four assignments to do for the year and she engages the person in conversation. If you fail it's generally because of your own fault. stop making excuses and take some credit for your life.,1
"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",0
Grosholz loves herself - you probably won't.,0
"I have had her for several classes now and I enjoyed them.  The books that she chooses are not run-of-the-mil, but very good.  She is very informal and knows what she is talking about.  She can be unclear at times about what she expects, but overall, if you do the work, you get a good grade.",1
"she is ver helpful, very nice and made the course easier than what I thought. I took the class on saturday morning..... It was not that bad..... I recommend her if you are afraid of speech classes.",1
Mean,0
DO NOT TAKE HER! She makes you buy an app and has in class quizzes EVERY DAY and she starts class on the dot and ends on the dot. She will not let you leave and takes attendance before and after class. She words the tests / quizzes in a really uneccesary difficult manner. She is also really rude and her lectures are super boring.  Tests are hard!!,0
Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,0
This is the worst class I have ever taken. I have never felt more disrespected by a professor in my life. She does not care about her students' education. She has no intention of teaching the material. Her grading scale is completely random and unfair. Her lectures are not helpful at all. She hands out random assignments with no explanation.,0
"Extremely boring class and the way he lectures makes it even more boring, the guy can never stay on topic and talks about research half of the time. Tests were ridiculous cuz theyre on stuff he says and very boring to listen to. Im changing my major. they need a guy who can stay on topic and make the class more bareable. Did i mention its boring?",0
She is dedicated and kind.  She cares about her students,1
"A good professor, but also a good person. His lab manuals make everything easier to follow, and if youre having trouble hes happy to help. I wouldnt have passed the computational portion if it werent for his guidance. Everyone loves Matt",1
"This class is hard, but Professor Dutta does everything he can to try and give you the opportunity the succeed.  His YouTube videos are a step far beyond what most professors would do.  You should go to class and pay attention.  Doing the practice problem really helps.  Tests are open book, but if you aren't prepared, it won't matter.",1
Very helpful professor who knows his stuff. Costa puts in a lot of effort to make sure his students learn difficult and abstract concepts. He maintains a course page where all stuff for the class gets posted. I wish my other professors cared as much as Costa does.,1
It is helpful if students are proficient in APA style of writing.,1
"Professor Fan is a very good professor. She is an expert in her field and her passion for teaching is incredible. The course is a bit difficult, but she is always there to help. Class consists of 4 tests, 4 homework assignments, and 1 case paper. Overall a pretty easy class just need to put in the effort.",1
Slightly painful but bearable.,0
"He might be a very smart person, but in my 15 years in school I have never had a prof that was this bad. He was not helpful, made no effort at all to help students outside class time and NEVER replies to email. He admitted he doesn't check them. To top it off he threatened me when I brought up marking. Worst prof at UBC.(Would punch in the face)",0
Very opinionated and does not care he he says. I dont know why he works at Bloomsburg if he talks about how much the students are not great. He also talks about other professors doing poorly. Very unprofessional professor in my eyes,0
"unless you are fluent in french, don't even bother taking this class. When you show up every day, do all the homework, struggle to pass her brutal tests, only to be told you're going to fail the class...... just avoid this teacher like the plague. Lectures were useless, you have to go home and teach yourself, and the online homework is a joke.",0
Extremely hard grader. He is very smart and lectures the entire class. He gives breaks in the middle which last about a minute. very hard to follow and gives a ton of information. only take this class if you love reading the textbook every night.,0
"He is a terrible man.He is makes his students feel so stupid.He thinks he is the most intelligent human on the planet and everyone else is dumb.He doesn't help you if you go to see him after class;instead he talks down to you and tells you all the things you do wrong and tries to convince you to drop his course because ""you are not smart enough""",0
"I had english with Dr. Stephens this spring, and she's ok.  But make sure you hand in all your work, because she has a tendency to forget things and blame you for it.  Her midterm and final had nothing  to do with the classwork tho...",0
"Listen. She's a good professor, ok? If you go to class, she offers a lot of extra credit. Also, I don't think her class is hard. Everything is literally from the notes. Sometimes  she'll really reeach for a real life example/metaphor (?)  and it doesn't work lol, especially in the beginning. She'll round you up a grade. You'll be ok! Good luck!",1
"Andrews is the man. Loved his class. Great professor, interesting, and not ridiculously hard and nit-picky like a lot of professors at this school.",1
"Had Dr.K back during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008.  Awesome, awesome prof.  Do the readings, and you'll be golden.  He has a hilarious sense of self-importance.  Ended class 60 minutes early one time to bitterly complain to the tech people about the faulty projector.  After all, he did want to give a Renaissance Art Lecture LOL ;)",1
Her class is a lot of fun! She doesnt make spanish so boring to learn the only bad part is speaking out loud!!,1
Talks a lot while not really helping much..,0
Dr. D. is the best!! She is consistent with her grading. She uses her sense of humor and clinical experience. Each semester Dr. D's courses are the first to be full. If anyone said anything less about her they must not have done their best in her class. This is on them not Dr. D.,1
"He is one of the best professors I had this year. His lecture was easy to understand as long as you follow his stories. But the reason I'll take him again is that he can always help you on any type of question outside of the classroom like current events. Go talk to him, you will be amazed.",1
"You can tell Sam is a very smart man, and he genuinely enjoys what he teaches. However lectures are very unstructured and don't follow any slides. You have to pay close attention to catch what's important. If you get a good GSI (which i did not) your discussion section will help you acheive the grade you want. You HAVE to go to lecture to do well.",1
"She is rude when you asks questions, but I am not sure she realizes it. Does not review for exams, and there is no SI for Bio 2.  She does not make lecture very interesting and her Power Points are awful. ",0
"She was eager to help and very understandable. She explained it in a way that even I, being someone who doesn't usually understand math, could understand. It took her a long time to return our assignments and I did not know my grade in the class until the very end... But she made math fun!",1
"Very nice guy, he understands that philosophy is hard so he tries hard to make sure you understand it. Super helpful and an easy grader. Not many assignments, just papers. If you come to class and put in a bit of effort you should get an A. Also- He's British.",1
Matt was an awesome teacher. he was very helpful and made psych very interesting.,1
"I would not recommend Prof. Ehring to anyone. The material he uses in class is not his own - you can find the PPTs on Google. He reads directly off the slide and gets bored teaching (he announces it in class). Syllabus is not downloadable, was not helpful when I asked for it, grades are not clearly communicated with you. Stay away!",0
"The book is free. She is hilarious. Show up to class because she grades attendance. Listen to her lectures, read, and be on time with all the papers. She will accept late papers but make sure you have done a good job on it. Her Midterm is open notes and Finals were online! Shes an angel!",1
"One of the worst teachers i've had to deal with during my educational road. Seems unprepared during class, does not know how to lecture either. Constantly goes back on her examples saying forget this forget what i said this and you never get through anything. I suggest studying the material to understand it, because exams aren't math heavy at all.",0
"Prof. Smith is warm, dedicated, and a great facilitator of discussion. The workshop format she uses in this class is really fun and a great way to practice giving and receiving feedback. I highly recommend taking ""Short Fiction"" with her.",1
"Professor Ikegwuonu is a very nice woman. Often times, she goes off on irrelevant spiels and forgets what she's lecturing about. The book is trivial as long as you take good lecture notes. I gave her a 4 for difficulty because the tests sometimes do not follow the lectures making them hard. There''s one 10-page research paper, worth 35%.",1
"He is a wonderful Professor. I am not saying this because I passed but because he really takes the time to help you understand math. He shows different techniques to solving a problem in case you don't understand. He's awesome! Offers extra credit. Do the work, study and you'll pass. You can't expect to pass if you don't do the work.",1
"Professor Steiner is the best. She really does care for her students, if you are struggling she will stay with you after class. Supper nice and caring, she wants you to pass the class and learn the material too.",1
"I loved him and the class. The subject is hard/a lot of information, but he made it enjoyable and palatable.  I learned a Lot. He is a bit disorganized, but his mistakes and forgetfulness is never taken out on the class. This was also the only class I never fell asleep in. He is funny and quite cute too! ;)",1
Forces you to go to class by not posting any of his notes. Doesnt make slides. Class is so slow going because he takes way too long on the same questions over and over. Absolute worst prof I've ever had. Grading scheme makes no sense. Do not recommend.,0
Dr. hill is a wonderfrull woman. Her goal is to help the students pass while helping them learn. I have enjoyed her class more than any other. She is also very helpful. Her test are hard but she is fair about taking them.,1
Great Professor. Just pay attention to the interesting lectures and read the book to get an A. Objective grading (just get a total score of 400 with all tests and homework for the A). Funny and fair with lots of extra credit. Would take again.,1
"You will use every single page the book.  Make sure you are in class everyday because he goes over the chapter, but in his own words and adds even more information to be used on the written section of exams.  Exams are open book, but not quizzes.  No notes can be used on written answers either. So the things he teaches in class, you better remember",0
Professor Goldman is a good professor with a pretty easy grading scale. Her tests can be difficult with the lectures hard to follow through. Make sure you ask questions!,1
"Dr. Arthurs is a very nice lady.  Attendance is not mandatory, but if you miss, you will not get points for in class assignments.  If you take good notes and do your readings, you will do well.  Make sure to spread the readings out - trying to to all of them the night before is awful and impossible.  Overall, not a bad class.",1
"i do not like him at all. he seems so full of himself. he is not understanding, yet everyone understands him and respects him. he has this attitude i dont like. it's a very hard class, confusing, impossible to catch up. i studied so much for so many hourse and guess what his test question was? Who is the author of the textbook?",0
Helpful and interesting!,1
"Great class, great professor. The only thing that can be challenging is the group project. Other than that pretty easy.",1
great teacher!!!,1
"Dr. DeVoney is one of the most caring teachers here at Stetson, however, she is still in her first year and is still looking for her style of teaching. While that part sucks, she takes most of her time out of class and dedicates it to her students, whether it being always open for office hours or holding ALEKS Sessions. She always looks out for you",1
"This is the professor you want to take for ENGR 101 and ENGR 102.  She will help you with anything you need.  Very nice person.  She tells you exactly what is going to be on every test and quiz.  No pop quizzes.  You use the textbook once or twice in ENGR 101, but very often in ENGR 102",1
"Extremely easy, learn nothing. Easiest A I've ever gotten.",0
"He only assigns two tests and 4 essays, so you only have a few assignments all semester to make your grade. As long as you attend almost every class and put effort into your papers, you should pass. He also never cancels class and assigns a bunch of reading, but it isn't that bad. He is really helpful and a good professor though. I'd recommend him.",1
"As a student currently enrolled in this class, I truly wish I wasn't. This might actually be the worst class I've ever taken. There is an exam every week which, there are three versions for due to how hard they are and you will inevitably fail the first one. Stanton is unclear and does not help you at all when it comes to lectures. Do Not Bother.",0
"Prof Jones is so awesome in every way. He is fun to learn from, kind, caring, easygoing, and interesting! His assignments are totally doable. He's so smart, but not arrogant. A real professional, great teacher.",1
"(African Images in Film) Love this course and the professor. We watch movies and do presentations in the class. There is also a book report, movie review, conference paper, and an Essay Final of your choosing. The professor grades pretty easy and is understanding. He is also hilarious and a nice guy overall!",1
Extrememly easy! Cancels class ALOT! Do all the homework assignments! Guaranteed an A!,1
"Wonderful professor, great class. Human sexuality (BIOL 30/PSYCH 30) was very informative about a lot of things I had no knowledge about prior to taking this class.",1
"She doesn't explain anything!! She is just a very mediocre teacher, and that is being nice. She moves WAY too fast, doesn't explain anything, & doesn't know how to answer students' questions.",0
"She is a teacher who cares but expects much from you.  If you really want to learn the material take her class.  She will show you exactly what she wants.  Sometimes it is hard to understand her, but if you don't just ask someone else.  She is extremely caring and wants everyone to pass.",1
"Horrible teacher.  I skipped 1001 because of my ACT scores, and I dropped this class right after midterms.  He gave me a 0 on m first paper because my criteria was not clear enough, and a 0 on my second paper because I used the word ""they"" instead of ""she.""  I do NOT recommend him to anyone.",0
"Dr. Vohs is a very good professor. His lectures won't make you fall asleep, and the class is almost enjoyable. Once test day comes though, it can get rough. He will give difficult tests and will grade harshly. I did not have a good chem class before coming here and I struggled a lot because of it. He's also a great first year sem teacher. (GenChem)",1
"DO not take her online course. You have to buy an expensive, confusing online textbook to use for the 100 question midterm and final. Wasn't helpful when I emailed questions, wouldn't take again.",0
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or get a tutor. When you ask to get help on a question he will not help you and look at you like you should know everything. He doesn't give you credit for any homework if you miss the class period they checked it in no matter the circumstances.,0
"Wade is really easy going and good about giving feedback! We often talk while practicing guitar and he is really fun to talk with! If you dont know a lot about music it will be harder as he isnt that great at teaching how to sight read, however still is a really great teacher!",1
"The class consists of heavy reading work, weekly reflections, and an overarching group project that is based on the idea of creating a well rounded lesson plan. Note that this is a foundations course, so it was my first ever lesson plan. We were verbally torn apart in front of our class for 10 minutes. Still got an A but it was not a pleasant time.",0
"I took lessons from pawkett for 1 semester and it was disappointing. Not a good teacher for ROCKBLUES type stuff. He seemed like more of a classical guy. His lessons are monotonous and a lot of the time it felt like I was learning random things for no reason. Plus he hardly seemed interested throughout the lessons, often ending lessons early. ",0
She is a very good professor who focuses on the needs of her students.,1
"I was looking very forward to this class, however, taught myself the information. This was the first online class I have had at FAU where I did not receive much feedback and professor was somewhat disengaged regarding class discussions. Also final is 30% of your grade and you are on your own, no study guide and no guidance on what to focus on.",0
"Very intimidating at first, but she looks for your best interest, nice lady and is very helpful",1
Very helpful and knowledgeable,1
"if you really want an easy A without really learning anything then take his class. If you really want to learn the material to prepare yourself for a University then please avoid him. He doesn't even know his own material, make several mistake during with his own code, which he ask student for help. Sometime lecture is not even related to the class",0
"an earlier post said ""run for your life""  you can't, she is the only one teaching this class. she may be belittling if ask a question during office hours. This will be one of the instructors who will be in your ONE OF THE WORST lists. I think she found the WRONG occupation, but despite the years of Poor Student E-Vals, she has the same job?",0
pretty terrible,0
"Lauren was very unhelpful all semester. Cancelled class every few weeks, and had really brief classes with the material ever fully being covered. Was unclear, didn't take in people's opinions, and marks VERY unfairly. GPA killer for sure. Would not recommend. Very disappointing. Exams are unfair and trys to trick you on almost every question.",0
Mrs. Perrel does not know how to  pass to her students her knowledge. Weird way to teach. Inpatient!,0
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE HAD AT DAVIS. Im a math major. Temple is not a good teacher. He may be good at his research, but he is deplorable at teaching. Look at all the other reviews. I cannot think of one thing I like about his class. No textbook, no homework, no feedback, no communication, no planning. Only take him if you are an effective self-teacher",0
"She's a sweet lady but she's an awful teacher. You basically have to teach yourself. She teaches super fast and is confusing. She doesn't care if you get it or you don't, she just keeps on going. Sooooooo much homework! The class is basically just doing homework. She quizzes you on what you haven't learned yet called pre-quizzes? Do not recommend.",0
Waste of time to go to class. He just rants about non-relevant topics that are fairly self explanatory. He doesn't actually seem to understand to what he's teaching. It was the worst class I've ever taken.,0
"Ms. G is a nice person, and Im sure she is a great nurse, but she should not be teaching NSG 120. It's a horrible class to begin with (boring, dry, IDGAF about nursing history, sorryNOTsorry) but she honestly was not trying at all. Didn't really cover material throughly. I never felt well prepared for the tests. Rushed through lectures. ",0
"She is amazing. I agree with some of the negative comments because she does not like it when you disagree with her but besides that she is perfect. She is very knowledgeable and an entertaining professor. Once you understand what she likes, you will get an A no problem.",1
She is nice n helpful.   Not much stress.  Class is easily than any other classes.                                                                                                                                                That's it.                                                                                                        Yeeeeeee,0
You get what you put into the class knowledge wise. You can just show up for the midterm and final and get away with an A . But i would highly encourage you to go. Mensah is one of those professors that really should not be at Howard and took major pay cuts to be here. Though it does not come across all the time he is extremely knowledgeable.,1
"Professor Lim is the worst professor Ive had at Hudson Valley. She is a tough grader for both engineering tools and engineering design. When asking her a question, she just says to look it up online or in the textbook. DO NOT buy the C++ textbook. We never used it in class. Avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"Great prof., very helpful.",1
"Frau Adam was a fantastic professor. She cared about her students, and taught really well. Class was never boring. There's a LOT of homework, but it's necessary for success. The class moves very quickly which makes it hard to keep up, but that isn't her fault. Put the work in and you'll do great.",1
- Provuding great coverage of the material,1
"He doesn't have any consistency in presenting the material. He uses outdated apps so he is not able to upload the material to the university portal and refuses to learn how to do it. He doesn't respect student opinions. I took Middle Eastern Architecture because I'm fascinated with it, but inconsistency got in the way of the learning process !",0
I had him for intro to philosophy and it was probably the most mentally stimulating class I've taken.  He is great at promoting thought on the readings while guiding class discussion and interpretation.  He's a really smart guy and class was very interesting.,1
"Not accessible outside class (and class was ONLINE!) Brings in a salesperson into lecture just so he can sell us LSAT prep material. I literally PAID to listen to an hour-long ad. Is strict on deadlines, while she herself never follows them. She gave us feedback on our papers 24 hrs before the final was due! Avoid this course. A true WASTE of money",0
"he is a great professor. he is clear, and will patently answer all questions regarding lecture. His exams are easy. everything is in the notes. just study and pay attention.",1
HOnestly I have taken manuy online classes and have a GOA of 3.74 before before I took this professors class. She is hard to please if you get a bad grade and you question her she will give you details but when you apply her notes to the next assignments she will just add more issues. This professor is seriously the worst professor ever. STAY AWAY!,0
"She was an amazing teacher. The tests were a little on the tough side, but if you study and take notes you should be fine. ",1
This class by far the worst class that I have ever taken at this college. Be prepared to stay up till 4 am 4 nights in a row studying for her quizzes and tests. I have seeked help from her and a tutor multiple times and neither were help at all. I feel she sets us up for failure. She takes forever at the beginning then goes physco at the end. awful,0
"If your looking for a great CIS 150 professor this is the one! She is very helpful and answers your questions as soon as she can. She knows a lot about computers and is very knowledgable in about the CIS field. Most of the grader projects she did in lab with us as a class. Homework is easy, lots of extra credit. Overall a great professor & class.",1
"Had her for Personal Fitness Rude, disrespectful. Mocks you when you work out if not up to her standards. It's a 1 credit class and she treats it like three credits. One of the worst teachers I've taken at this college. Think very hard if you're going to have her.",0
Very rude. Transferred out of her class after 1 session,0
"Memorization heavy; 130+ terms per midterm, three poetry recitations, eight papers ranging from 1 to 6 pages-double and single spaced, three midterms all recall/essay questions, re-writes tests every timeno student feedback on questions, no curve, little mercy on late assignments, extra credit often in the morningunavailable, hated the class.",0
"I don't do these at all, but let me tell you the rudeness I received from such a professor. I used to like Kathleen, she was and still is amazing. But personality and favoritism aside, I give her a 0. I definitely will not take one of her classes again. ",1
"Amazing lectures, easy to understand, very helpful if u don't understand",1
Rebecca is the bestest ever!! I have taken a couple of her courses and have loved them! I wish she taught every subject.,1
"Very generous grader in public speaking class. If you try, she cuts you a lot of slack. Explained exactly what she wanted and even gave examples of outlines to follow in the class. Wasn't  nerve racking since most speeches were with a team. If someone on team didn't do their part, she gave individual grades to members so, do your part!",1
"Good teacher, enjoyed his class.",1
"Personal negative, social and political views where constantly issued, some students where ignored and dismissed often.",0
"She's knowledgable and can make any class exciting, even when it's on the Old Testament, which is often considered dry subject material. Yes, she is a tough grader, but her assignments are not difficult; for example, you might wind up with a B+ when you figured you earned an A. She can be funny and makes you think. No complaints here.",1
"I had Dr. Thomas during her first semester teaching. She was amazing! She truly cared about the students in the class and wanted each of us to succeed. It was a lot of studying for the lab quiz each week, but it is doable. She made the more boring or in depth material fun and relatable to us. Also, lots of opportunities for extra credit.",1
"The professor knows his stuff, its just a hard class because not everyone is in the same level some topics you might talk more about then others depending on how the class is. He does give an excessive amount of homework about 50 or 60 problems a week. If you get the homework the test would be a breeze because thats what he uses to make the test.",1
Sharon is a cooky professor! Exactly what you want for fundamentals of acting. She pushes students to get outside of their comfort zones through contentless scenes and monologues. A class I would look forward to every week.,1
"good teacher, she is pretty easy if you just do the work and do all your response papers. She lets you make up essays if you get a C or lower so that's cool. The objective finals are easy, only hard part is the final essay. good luck!",1
Professor responds to email promptly and makes effort to communicate with the students. The course is heavy however she makes it easy by being caring and understanding of your difficulties. Follow the syllabus and assignment rubric well and nothing can stop you from your A.,1
She is an excellent teacher. She give fair grades and give interesting assignment to do. She is the best teacher you could ask for.,1
"no syllabus to follow, everything that is assigned is just thrown at you at the last second and she expects all of your work to be perfect. if you do not agree with her opinions then you do not do well. she has her favorites in the class and only those people do well and she is rude to those students who are not her favorite.",0
"Possibly the worst professor ever. So unprepared. She'd come to each class, and just ramble. She showed up for two of the tests without a test. Once, she had us write the tests ourselves in groups and then she READ them back to us, and gave us about a minute to answer each question. Her excuse? She was training us to be professors. Awful!",0
"Asks you to show up to class everyday but his power points were word-for-word from the text book. I ended up just finishing up the course from home and still managed to get an A, but he does reward points for showing up.",0
"Yarwood gives no guidance and no assignment is clear and outlined. She also has awkward encounters, is easily confused, and constantly makes a pained face when shes talking to students. I know that sounds picky but when you are asking for help and she looks like shes in pain its frustrating. Also her lectures are terrible",0
"This class is one where subjective grading is prevalent. A majority of the class is made up of discussions and participation grades, where no real grading rubric is available. Many times the professor would talk about topics very one sided that made some people openly feel uncomfortable. The class was not the best experience for me.",0
Had this class online. Professor Bazil does not communicate much and this caused problems sometimes. You watch his lecture videos for a certain module and then take a short quiz. There are 4 papers throughout the class. The online setup could have been better. Easy A though.,0
"Class sucks, might as well be reading out of the textbook. Most of his students fail. Dont do it. Loves to talk about his college experience and college football thats about it. Tests cover chapters he didn't go over.",0
I liked him a person and he was a good teacher most of the time but sometimes he would ramble on things that were not tested on which would make me more confused. I also found that he rushes through the slides and does not give you enough time to take notes.,1
"Top notch. Lectures clear, concise. Helpful in class. Communicates via e-mail too. Have a question? Ask away! Avoid missing class, each day is 5 hours. What you learn is applied practically (lab). Read supplied online book to supplement class. First few class days feel long, but feel shorter thereafter. Pursue if you have a passion for networking!!",1
"He is a very funny and caring professor. He wants everyone to succeed and makes a bunch of funny jokes. He makes it very easy to understand the topic (however, I was clueless for one or two). As long as you follow his guidelines for the papers, you'll get at least a B. I recommend taking him if you are new to philosophy.",1
Maril taught the honors version for SOCI2110 and he was very demeaning. It felt like a true lecture versus discussion and we just had to swallow and accept his ideas. He said his notes were based on facts but he picked which facts he used and omitted others. Very harsh grader and told me I didn't care about my grades when I went to his office hours,0
"very fun class! i enjoyed it! all you do is pay attention, take notes as you watch movies and you will pass guaranteed. Has 4 essays, presentation, 1 midterm, final. No hw! i recommend this class for anyone who enjoys films and need an easy A. Very nice prof and knows a lot about the subject. I actually learned a lot in this class.",1
I have a music background so I was able to breeze through the first half of the work book with ease. It's an online course so time management is key. Clear criteria for how the class works. Probably difficult for those with little to no music background. It is a hard subject! Knapp is accessible and knowledgeable but voice is monotonous online,1
"Her exams are extremely difficult with no help from lectures. She's a tough grader and her assistants are even worse. she's VERY kind, very attractive, great personality etc but as a professor, she's a wolf in sheep's clothing. 100% AVOID.",0
"Such a great professor! So sweet and adorable. She loves political science and gets so excited speaking about the topics covered in class. She prints out readings for you so no textbook, yay. Oral midterm, final essay, but beware of pop quizzes. Take her if you can!!",1
"Maria is a really great person, and I wish I liked this class but at the end of the day this course was a hot mess. To say it was unorganized and confusing would be an understatement. No one knew what was going on. It was like an unanswered riddle; I can't even say for sure what the course was about, or what I got out of it.",0
Excellent Teacher,1
"I do not have professor Hartman as a teacher myself but he works with me often in the math lab. He is so helpful and works very hard to be sure that he is tutoring to your personal satisfactory.  If he is this great of a tutor, he must be a fantastic math teacher as well. I would definitely recommend him as a teacher without doubts.",1
"This teacher, though sweet and caring, set up her online class in modules. A LOT of reading, I did not like the class one bit. I prefer professors video themselves teaching instead of making students read and understand the material by themselves. There are lots of small quizzes. I wouldn't take her online class if you're not a reader.",1
"prof. Jalalvand is a very kind professor. He cares about all the students. You won't understand alot from him, but if you want to pass with B make sure to go to the class and participate. One more thing, he likes students to come to his office hours",1
"excellent,responsive,invested, study for your exams from text. If you work hard you will get a good grade. She uses some audio and highly communicative. excellent teacher!",1
"Every single part of the class covers different material (lecture, discussion, and textbook readings) and it is never reviewed or elaborated on. Discussion quizzes are just useless busy work because they are not handed back so students can use them to study for tests. Lectures are so boring and the tests are too specific.",0
I'm Junior and this is hardest class I've ever had. I have no hope on exam 3 tommorrow. Professor is good tho.,0
"By far the worst teacher I have ever had. She was rude and told me there was nothing she could do to help me study more. The class material isn't hard, but her tests are tricky and I don't know how I just scraped by with a C. I would not recommend her. Look for someone else.",0
Dr. Ruiz plays around to much in class and favors female students. If you don't like classical music do not take this class.,0
"Mr. Boyer was an awesome professor! He made Math114 so easy; definitely and ""easy A"" class. I would definitely recommend taking him for this class.",1
What an amazing professor.  He encourages conversation.  He finds value in many views.  He uses real like experience as a way of teaching this class.  Very supportive of students.  Available to answer questions and help when needed.,1
"for a 100 level online class she really requires a lot of work, its like you have to write a book in the bb discussion section every week. if you post it early enough she will tell u what u need to add to get the full 100 points. she requires a stupid amt of citations from the txt and explanations, or else its not good enough, shes really annoying.",0
Her main aim is not only to make you understand math through practice but also to pass. She knows we all make mistakes. She helps correct them.,1
"I defiantly thought he was a bit on the strange side on the first class but he's very funny and has the most interesting way of describing things. Not much studying is needed. No homework, just one 15 point quiz per week. He goes over at least half the answers before the test so pay attention and youll do fine!",1
Makes the subject harder than it needs to be. Gleans clicker questions from another Biology text book (& does not cite on PP slides). Will put challenging & convoluted questions on tests not covered in class or explained by the book. Definitely do the review sheets & homework (marginally helps for test;more about extra points) Take Prabhu instead!,0
"One of the best teachers I've had in a long time. She really makes everything clear. Her course materials are very easy to read and makes a huge difference in learning ex. On a powerpoint slide, she will put the reference chapter for the topic so you don't have to search it up yourself. She's very real; will tell you what you actually need to study",1
"Wildly interesting! He explains things in a wacky way that is extremely clear. Embraces any idea or concept and helps refine it. Keep you independent, yet help is there when you ask. So far, best teacher i'v had here.",1
"TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!! didn't give me feedback on my paper after emailing her MULTIPLE times. Forcing me to put quotation marks on a sentence that is ORIGINAL and MINE!!!  How does umb even hire such professors, I just don't get it. After putting in ALL my hours into this course I got a B- !!! Seriously avoid ",0
would not take a class of hers again,0
"Amazing teacher, truly loves his job",1
"Not a good lecturer at all, harsh grader, and made the class extremely theory based to the point you would just have to memorize everything and hope for the best. Tests were very difficult and he refused to curve or even let kids use formula sheets during the exam. If you're not a math major or naturally good at understanding theory avoid him!",0
"Went into the semester looking forward to having her as I've heard she was a great teacher. All she did for our class was powerpoint after powerpoint (and they are not posted online). She is very passive aggressive, and got angry when students would take notes on their laptops. Won't take another class from her.",0
"Misurda has the style of teaching being, ""You're on your own"". His lectures are very dry and hard to convey sometimes. For 5 weeks he did his 'slides' on a piece of paper where students would follow and copy notes. Come exam time, he doesn't have them. The class average for that exam was a 60 and our second midterm exam average was a 58. Dont recco",0
Please don't take his class!!!!,0
she's so nice and the class is relatively easy,1
I do not know where to began because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps and can't teach.,0
Gives pretty good lectures. Easy to get participation credit by using the clicker to answer questions. Must read assigned texts to answer class questions.  Only 3-5 questions per class. All assignments are given to the TA and they grade them. Not as much work as it sounds at first. Nice guy and very clear.,1
"If you are someone who runs late sometimes like I am, don't take this class. Quizzes on readings were not hard but given in the first minute of class - if you miss it, you were ""absent"" and get a 0/100 for the day (with only 3 allowed per semester). Some extra credit offered by writing papers. Tests are all essay and definition and are not easy.",1
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR; TURN BACK NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!  STAY AWAY!!  DO NOT ENTER!!!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,0
"She gives us a 5 min break during our 90 min classes, but she never has the break, she answers students' questions during ""her break"". Very helpful. Very clear teacher. Just a great professor. She enjoys teaching CHE 243. I trust you will enjoy having her as your teacher.",1
"aw i cant beleive what im reading with some people. He is so nice.you have to try to understand his humor,he talks alot about himself butthe man is proud. he also is very smart he makes me crave potato chips and soda cause in class he eats.. other than that he will prepare you for e2 cause his e1 class is way ahead of the others.. HE IS A MUST TAKE",1
"Don't like this class, feels like any passion for MIS has left me after I took 3202 and this one. Ryan is very lengthy with his explanation and the slides are usually confusing and hard to comprehend. He teaches with a very high level mindset so that'd be useful more for IT consulting. Did learn from the cases but didn't enjoy his teaching.",0
"This class was kind of hard, its a lot of content and reading. Her test can be a bit tricky, but most of it is straight forward. She knows her stuff and is pretty funny so it makes class a lot more enjoyable.",1
"I had Dr. Li for bio 150 lab and you cant understand what he says, he  doesnt teach very well. Also for the lab assignments he doesnt actually grade his own students work. A grad student does and that same student also gets all other lab teachers assignments to grade. He hurts you because he doesnt teach you what you need to know for the papers.",0
Easiest class I've ever taken. 3 test and weekly assignment that could be done under 20 minutes ,1
One hour assignment on WebAssign 3 nights a week. Due MWF.  CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HIM. Tests are a lot harder than class lectures.  no classwork. just lecture notes and the homework.  good thing is homework is 50 percent of grade.  but tests are really hard for the other 50%.,0
"One of the worst professors at the law school by far. Pretty hilarious that he is referred to as ""academic"" and ""cerebral"" (probably his own review) in reality he is just overly theoretical/impractical and graded the exam in a manner that rewards cookie cutter CREAC and basic regurgitation of his own lectures.",0
Your whole grade in the class is based on tests and quizzes and there are no study guides. She does offer office hours if you dont understand but she is kinda standoffish. Hard class dont take,0
"I would not recommend taking an online math class because of the frustration of getting problems wrong because of rounding or technical issues. The computer grading did not offer partial credit. However, the teacher was always quick to give points back when I explained errors. Her grading was fair and she always made herself available to help.",1
"He likes to tell stories about Bears, and He owns a Beet farm. His favorite show is battle star wars. He loves football and all team sports. He usually will pass a basketball player if they can dunk a ball. He played on three different sports teams and really likes to talk about the local teams.",1
Tests are rediculous. Cheat sheets dont help because he  has stuff on tests that you have never seen before. Sucks at teaching/and tries to fail everyone,0
"Easiest class I've taken! Material is hard but her tests are easy! Straight from her notes, most are fill in the blank but she also has some multiple choice & matching. Even gives a few small hints on tests. She even gave us a word bank on the muscles test! Gives lots of points for homework & attending class.. Gives several ""bonus"" quizzes too!",1
"Very very into himself. Never wrong, even when it comes to opinions. Immature and calls students out in front of the class. He does not explain material well. He doesn't give study guides or guidelines for exams. This class should have been way easier than it ended up being.",0
As somebody who is not a history major this class was very difficult because I did not have a lot of prior knowledge about  other than what I learned from high school.  I learned so much about European history in this class and really enjoyed the professor's lectures.  HE IS A VERY TOUGH GRADER. Do not expect an easy A or an easy B,1
"I took her Child Development class over the summer. The 40 question chapter homeworks seemed so easy until you really got into them. There is always more than one right answer (all taken right out of the book) and you just have to guess which one she says is ""most correct"" what a joke! She never replies to emails, tests arent like homework. ugh.",0
"I would have rated her a 0. She is a harsh grader for no reason. BEWARE of exams with locked browser, webcam and no way to go back and forth. She is not helpful and will eventually ignore emails and won't reply. no matter how well you do on anything else, if you fail the exams: you will fail. Unclear grader as well.",0
"Absoultely hated this teacher. She does nothing for her students, all she talks about is her dog. She does not care if you pass or fail her class. She does not give any points for anything besides quizzes and tests. DO NOT take this teacher if you want to succeed.",0
"Dr. Zwier is a very understanding professor. However, his expectations are very high. You need to attend all the SI sessions because  one of them could be an integral part of passing the exam. Listen carefully to his lectures and UNDERSTAND all the practice problems he assigns. Don't waste time taking notes from the book, use it as a backup. ",1
"Nia Mahallati's Procurements/Contract Law course at Webster university is extremely informative. She is very knowledgeable and well respected in her field. She also brings her government contracting experience to the course, which is very practical (especially for those of us working in this field in the Washington DC area). Recommend this prof.",1
"Professor Couch was a really nice lady, this is basically the dream English class if you're decent/mediocre at writing. Ask questions if you are unclear about something, she is easy to talk to.",1
"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless.",0
"This is by far the best professor I've had in my 3 years of uni. He either likes to teach or he's really good at acting. His lectures are very engaging, he's invested in what you're saying and doesn't belittle you or make you feel bad even if what you say isn't the exact answer he's looking for. An inspiring individual. Take a class with him, trust",1
worse teacher ever,0
Professor Bacaner is extremely motivational. The way he speaks to my soul is just so profound and touching. I took him for ENC1101 and liked his class enough to take ENC1102 with him. Would recommend.,1
"I don't understand most of these negative reviews. He is probably one of the best math teachers I have ever had. He breaks down the information well and makes it easy to understand. I honestly think that if all math teachers taught math like him, more people would be better at math.",1
Lectures are hard to understand because of the teachers accent. The teacher goes too fast and is not clear with explaining. The teacher assumes you should remember everything after just going over it once. I was not prepared for tests at all.,0
"Jeanette is one of the most vague professors imaginable. All questions are answered in an impossibly ambivalent manner. Grading is also very subjective. Overall, though, she knows what she is talking about and will better prepare you for the world of business.",0
"Tove is awesome! I took her online intro to bus class and she was very clear and communicative. She provides great feedback and encouragement and it is super easy to do well in her class if you pay attention. I didn't open the textbook once, but her instruction was clear and easy to understand. Take her class if you can!",1
"I had health complications during the semester that caused me to miss a lot of class, and talked with him to explain this. He told me that hed work with me to help me through the course. Admittedly, it mayve been useful to talk to him more to drill it in his head, because either he just forgot or didnt care at the end of the semester.",0
Dr. Pringle taught the second semester of this course and she is a fantastic person and her lectures were well organized but her tests were absolutely ridiculous. She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,0
Professor Schuster is a great professor has lectures that are well formulated and is easy to understand. He does have a research paper but if you keep up with it you'll do fine. He uses YouTube clips to engage and shows material that pertains to lecture topics.,1
"He was okay. Based on these ratings I was looking more forward to this class, but was disappointed. Class got a little boring because I don't have that much interest in the Bible. But he seems like a nice enough guy.",0
"Disregard your textbook.  Bailey tests purely from his notes and what was said (or what he thinks he said) in class.  If you study from his notes, your test scores should be adequate.  He prides himself on his small pass rate.  My class started with approx. 24 students.  We ended with 9 students.",0
"Very awesome teacher! Had her for Engl 301 & 111. Very relaxed on grading, and is very concerned for you to retain the material. If you WANT to learn, you will learn. Otherwise, this class can be ""whatever""... Just turn in all your work and you will pass no problem. Probably, my funnest class yet!",1
"Dr. Ranft is a great guy. However, refrain from taking his ethics class. Everything has a right or wrong answer whether or not your values are different. He loses assignments very frequently and is often late to class. His test are ridiculous and most material is from Google. If you have options, do NOT take his class!",0
Amazing class and an amazing professor. Took this class online and Professor Wolfsen is on top of her game. Modules are well prepared and clearly laid out to make online study smooth. Insightful relationship information. The finale (last lecture) was inspiring and powerful. Live discussions and ability to interact with classmates is available.,1
"My writing actually improved while taking this class, and I have gotten compliments all semester from other professors on my writing skills. Uses positive reinforcement and praises student for content as well as writing. Tries to make the students feel more confident in their writing. She will make you read aloud but gives extra credit. Loved her!",1
Professor Ou is VERY chill. I recommend going to lectures but not listening because he WILL put you in groups. Most assignments you can bs. He rambles a lot. You don't really learn you just get a good grade basically if you do the assignments (if you have prior knowledge of the subject then good). He will give you more time. I never read the book.,1
I took the night class which was like 3 hours long and he always made us stay until the very last second which would be fine if he wasn't so boring! He's cocky and makes you buy books that he wrote to read for the class. He talks about stuff that has nothing to do with sociology and he doesnt make sense. I dropped this class after the first week.,0
Kathy is VERY smart. She has worked for many newspapers and she loves what she does (teaching). She has a great attitude and will work with you if you miss an assignment due to missing class. ,1
By far the worst class i've taken in college. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESOR! Even if it's your last option!!!!,0
Death by Power point!!!All he does is read the power point for 2 hrs. This is an intro- class! this man thinks we are 4 year med. students.,0
"Professor Sanborn actually very approachable; doesnt mind questions. She is willing to provide additional help. Honestly, the best accounting professor at wayne county community college. I took the class online & i was still able to get extra help in person to review the material along with other students from her accounting classes",1
one of the best economics prof in thsi university...,1
"She teaches and keeps you busy all semester long. If you like to write and enjoy doing it, take her.",1
"Sign language is a great language, but this Professor makes me question if I should continue with studying it. She has temper tantrums, extremely impatient, and will put down students when they have a genuine inquiry to further their learning. It is taxing having to come to each class and have to feel like you are not good enough for sign language.",0
"If you take Oceanography1 with ITV make sure you are motivated and well prepared to study. He's a great prof.,treats students very fairly also he's very generous with grading.Oceanography is very broad and sometimes difficult but if you study with Study guide you'll be fine.",1
THIS IS NOT A CULTURE CLASS IT IS A HISTORY CLASS. What I thought would be interesting ended up being super boring. I skipped class all the time and when I did go I never took notes because she went way to fast. Her tests are pretty easy though. Get the english version of the book if you can...that saved me in this class.,0
"I loved Prof Odelius, she was magnificent and extremely passionate. I appreciated the content and couldn't have asked for a better teacher",1
Her summer online course was a lot of work. Multiple quizzes a week and a ton to read but if you get it done you will be ok. Definitely will make you work for a good grade but the course over all wasnt too hard.,1
"Dr. Kim is really good in the lab. I took her for Organic Chemistry 2 Lab. She was Helpful, but a really tough grader. Only major problem is that she speaks REALLY REALLY fast. You won't understand what she's saying sometimes.. overall, Good professor and would take her again in future classes. Good Luck!",1
"I have never once had any issues with any professors at Clark, but Jamey Marsh is not one that I would recommend taking. I would not say that Professor Marsh cares about his students success because he purposefully sets you up to fail. He is not helpful when it comes to trying to understand what you got wrong, and you only pass because of the curve",0
"Students your educational intelligence would be tempestuous with you, if you don't have the privilege of being a student in his course of instructions.",1
Very rude teacher. Never gives a direct answer when you ask a question.  The work isn't hard but I don't like being treated like a 16/17 year old.  It's a lot of work but not hard. She gets really mad when you don't attend class. Not worth the stress for me.,0
"McConkey is a great teacher. Interesting lectures and personal stories however he does put that information on his tests, it's helpful to at least get recordings of lectures if you're not in class. Would recommend taking him, would also recommend trying from the start. Each test counts a lot.",1
"This isn't an easy class, no matter who you take it with. But he knows what he's talking about & is a great teacher. Go to class, do ALL the hw, never miss a lab & memorize the sample tests he gives you they are exactly like the tests. Great as answering questions. I couldn't be happier I took this class with him.",1
"What a windbag.  Loves his opinions, and you better be careful if you don't think the Bushies are sent from heaven",0
"Kelli is a super fun woman and I genuinely enjoy her lectures. However, she can be a bit wishy-washy on grades and assignments which can be frustrating. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you miss an industry exercise, your grade will suffer. It wasn't my favorite class ever but it really wasn't bad. Not a lot of homework and only four exams.",1
"Nice guy, takes his time when teaching the material and really tries to make it make sense to you. He taught the summer section of PHY 2410, so the classes were really long, like 2 and a half hours. Still would prefer over some other professors.",1
"She should not be teaching. At first I really liked her because she seems really sweet, but then she turns on you. She definately picks favorites in every class, and I have had her twice. I had to take my Grandma to the hospital once, and she still told me that if I miss class I will lose points. She will never admit she is wrong. She is very rude.",0
"Professor Rasheed is an amazing professor. His exams are simple, so long as you study for them.  Attend class everyday and you should be fine.  Just do the work!!",1
"I am in her class this semester and LOVE it. It is hard enough that I feel motivated to study, but easy enough that it isn't scary. She is so funny and gives a lot of real world examples. She doesn't post the lecture slides online but she does give out  A LOT of material to make sure that you are ready for your exam.",1
"Love Barclift! Come to class, do homework, you will have an A+! She is very blunt so if you get butt hurt easily dont take her class. If you appear to care about the class & material, she will love you.",1
"Due to the pandemic and making no accommodations in teaching style or tests, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Missouri State. I would definitely recommend other professors for this class that were more accommodating and understanding due to the pandemic.",0
"I loved him so much, I took 2 classes with him. His jokes are corny but my kind of humor. If you're stuck, he'll get you thru. As long as you make an effort and he sees that, you're fine. Can't not make an effort and expect an A",1
"He's a terrible teacher. His classes consist of him reading off of powerpoints and saying ""uh"" and ""soooo"" a lot. Sometimes he decides to take attendance by passing around a piece of paper for you to sign, sometimes not. I will NEVER take Cast again. Try asking him a bio question - he won't be able to give you an answer. I have learned nothing.",0
"Had prof Hegner at the beginning of year.Skelly's hard for visual learners;does quiet explainations by mouth only and most people in the class were lost.When he did write on the board, it was sloppy,unstructured,almost illegible.Learned everything from reading the text-I only came to get attendence credit. Listening to his lecture only confused me.",0
"I've had Dr. Gerard for three classes. She's great to have because she is interested in what she is presenting, she provides great examples and even personal humor while teaching.",1
Absolutely love Mrs. Sexton! She is a fantastic lecturer and always demonstrates exactly what she wants you to do in lab. She is very willing to help you understand in any way she can. She also gives great study guides each test that are helpful. Will definitely take her for my others labs!,1
"THE BEST professor within the nursing department. She strives to inspire and motivate students as well as teach them real-life scenarios. She is practical, personal, and approachable. She encourages all students to be the best they can be. You will find her class rewarding and her experiences memorable. - Class of 2015 Section 2 :)",1
"Not a hard class if you stay caught up.  if you fall behind it may prove to be more difficult than I experienced.  Helped considerably with my writing as I learned to edit, and edit, and edit.  Definitely worth taking.",1
"The ancients told us of a man who was born beyond time who would come down to bless us engineering students with the wisdom and knowledge from beyond. But seriously, this class is definitely the most helpful with understanding engineering in an industrial setting and will prepare you for real-world engineering.",1
 he didn't clarify much and he's a very hard grader I wouldn't take him ever again,0
"if you aren't passionate about gender, get a different teacher. she will give you lower grades if you dont agree with her. she doesn't give exams or any homework except for essays, so if you dont do well, you're screwed.",0
"This was honestly one of the hardest classes I have ever taken in my life. His tests are extremely hard, and the Excel chapter of the course was the hardest test ever. All in all he is a great professor. He offers a TON of extra credit, you even get extra credit by participating in class. Just know that you will have to do a ton of outside work.",1
This professor is a terrible example of what college will be like.  She doesn't tell her students when assignments are due(and they aren't on the syllabus)and then blames them when work isn't done. She also favors certain students and gives them extra cred for running coffee to her. Complaints have been made on her evaluations but PHSC does nothing,0
"This professor is one of the chillest, and really coolest to have, yeah of course there's work but I believe she's one of the best to have. you wont' need to even worry much if you listen to what she has to say. her work is  easy as long as you do them, and its only a challenge if you make it one. she's worth having, oh and her final is open ended.",1
"She rambles on for way too long about nothing, barely relates it to a topic to write about. EGUMPP is stupidly long and tedious and you do it again in 111 which she teaches. She also pats herself on the back often, she says ""I'm a great editor"" about 5 times a class, and hands out papers saying to bring them back for next class but we don't use it.",0
Great lectures however the tests are graded completely unfairly by his group of 4 other graders so there is no consistency.  if you can afford the high probability of a C  the material is worth it.,1
"Ms. Wright is um mediocre. Her class isnt hard, if you show up youll pass (and if u dont show up youll probably still pass). Not too much hw. Her tests/finals are straightforward. She relies on the class to do a lot of the talking, so idk what she knows. Class kinda drags on , I took notes to stay awake.",0
"Great professor! There is no reason not to get an A or B in this class, just do the work and show up, Prof. L really sets you up for success you just have to make sure you don't slack off. A little intimidating in terms of material in the beginning but it all gets clearer day by day. You will learn a lot, take this class!",1
"Presents relevant content with practical application.  Conscientious, generous, invested, knowledgeable.",1
Best teacher ever. Easy class and he makes it fun. If i could i would have him for everyclass,1
This teacher is useless make sure if you get her run. Her grading is ridiculous and grades you down for the wrong reasons. She has her favorites and her tone of voice is very annoying. DONT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Econ and the Law is a basically another semester of his 305 class. So many interpretive discussions and thought papers but the worst part is this class has basically 3 finals you have to do. If nothing makes sense or seems relevant, don't stress, the rest of the class is most likely on the same page. Biggest workload of the semester.",0
The AMST 200 course is an awesome course! Six times a semester you meet up to watch a movie about the topic you are studying and they are really interesting movies! The class is completely discussion based and you have daily readings. She's the nicest and funniest prof out there! THE BEST GEN ED TEACHER AND CLASS! TAKE HER!,1
"Often late or not in class. Most of semester was in-class activities then in last month had 2 group papers/presentations, 5 homework assignments, and 2 exams. No plan and not clear in directions or answering questions. Changed 20pt extra credit to 40pt regular assignment without telling us. Late grader, did get an A but do not recommend.",0
"Dr. Capper is an amazing professor. This course embodies what a college course should be in requiring you to apply yourself, take notes, attend class, and give a well written essay. It is easy to retain all of the information because of how he teaches in his lectures. There are no surprises on tests which makes studying easy!",1
I went to every class paid attention. Went for tutoring in math lab & nothing helped. When he gave the first test the info seemed foreign to me. I wouldn't advise taking him.,0
"She takes *forever* to grade assignments. It's incredibly frustrating.  You have to wait weeks. Also, her assignments have a lot of grammatical errors which is annoying. She made several mistakes with assignments and I would politely email her and get the credit added back. Frustrating but at least she was fair.",0
Professor Bakewell is one of the most positive and motivational teachers at Rhodes. His passion for teaching and the Classical Studies is contagious. He is invested in making sure absolutely everyone in the classroom is on the same page and goes the extra mile to help you feel at pace and comfortable in the class. MUST TAKE PROFESSOR AT RHODES!,1
Very boring class Very difficult grader He offers help but it does not do much he just criticizes everything and doesn't tell you what you should do to get a better grade Try to avoid this class!,1
"You should only take her class if you are proficient in math. She makes many mistakes and often gets confused. A nice lady, though.",0
she's a hard grader but shes really nice.  she knows what she's talking about so if your into politics take one of her classes.  she does stutter tho which can be annoying but shes cool.,1
She is one of the worst teachers i've ever had in my life. She doesn't know what the hell she is talking about half of the time and repeats herself constantly. Very disorganized and you never get out early!!! She always talks about her family and when she lived in spain. Don't take her class she is HORRIBLE!!!!!,0
Great professor! Very clear grading criteria and tests/quizzes were right from the notes and textbook. Interesting material and class! Highly recommend.,1
I have never got an A on a math test until this class! She is clear and really wants to help you understand the math. The note sheets are very helpful!,1
"Not as great as everyone below says , grading criteria is clear but if any assignment is missed or is not good according to her rubric she wont let you fix it or make it up . Makes you do all the work on blackboard but is never on blackboard herself . Writing intensive course so youll have to write 5-6 journals and two major papers .",0
"AWFUL. Took this online, his tests are 70% of the grade (4 tests in total), so don't even worry about doing all the homework and quizzes assigned if you do poorly on even one of the tests. You fail a single test, you might as well already withdraw. Amazing how you must teach yourself the subject (its online) and then the grading criteria is strict",0
"You really have to work for this class. Don't be fooled by the course's content, it's pretty hard. I had a 70 in the class at first but then i bounced back to an A. Turns out her notes are CRUCIAL (TAKE NOTES!) as sometimes she tests you on problems that are not on sapling. Take the time to redo the notes questions and the sapling questions.",1
Shes great overall. There is a lot of reading by yourself. Youll be assigned chapters and there will be open discussion about what you read in class the next day. She trys to be flexible with turn in dates. Shell ask if things are too much and if we need help to call her or email her. She cares about students and want us to have #WakeTechSwag,1
"Mathi clearly knows how to do Calculus. However, her delivery is poor IMO. Her accent is heavy and makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. For example, when she says ""8"" she will instead say ""yayyyt"", or instead of ""A"" she will say ""yayyy"". This isn't to be rude, but rather totally honest about my experience with her.",0
"the guy just goes too fast. i took it over summer and got D, but this guy is teaching at a summer's pace. a section per day. homework everyday except maybe the weekend.",0
"Difficult to keep up. Way too much material covered.By the end of each class your mind is cluttered. She is a very good teacher A+, but doesn't weed out unimportant concepts. You'll be given everything in the book to learn. The book exercises are wordy & confusing. Homework is very time consuming! Extra credit given in addition to book material.",1
"Prof. Fast can be a bit dry, but he knows the material and he makes sure that he covers everyone's questions. Teaches by going through the homework and explaining concepts as they come up, which is a lengthy process but effective. If you show your work on quizzes and tests, you'll get partial credit even for a wrong answer. It's difficult to fail.",1
I took this class as one of my English program requirements and I want to take the rest of my classes with him. We only had two papers for the quarter and a small midterm paper. It is easy to get by doing just the reading for your essay and he is very helpful in giving you feedback before you turn in your paper.,1
"LOVE THIS GUY! Took two classes with him and ahhh, he's just the best! This was like a life class. Honestly, everything I learned in his class has helped me and will continue to help me not just academically but for every day life. RECOMMEND! I would just sit in on his class if I could haha. He's awesome! TAKE HIM!",1
Interesting professor. There's lots of reading and a certain amount of journals you must do by the end of the semester. There's only two tests (which are essays and you know the prompt prior.) Keep yourself on schedule and you get an A easily. Hes really nice and grades really easy too.,1
"This class is not easy im the slightest, and park is the only teacher so you habe to just keep going. She does give a lot of extra credit but trust me its because everyone needs it. Without the extra credit I MAYBE would have gotten a C-. Conmect with Park on Game of Thrones and she will love you forever",1
Excellent Instructor,1
"Yes, it's possible to get an A but you'll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting, but you have tog get super organized in this class. You'll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible, I'd avoid this class as an 8 week course. You'll definitely always have somethingto do in this class. ",1
"This teacher can't understand anything other than the strict facts that she has memorized out of the textbook and lacks any kind of creative thinking abilities and alternative teaching methods. I could have just read the whole text book and learned just as much. She is a waste of her 105,000$ a year salary",0
he is the best professor in the world. i would take him for the rest of my college classes if i could. gives study guides for the test and he gives you notes. helps students whenever they need it and tries his best to make things seem easy. great i would recommend him for anybody.,1
"I love psychology with a passion but this has been by far the worst class I have ever taken. She is a sweet women but my goodness! I never even knew what my grades were because nothing was graded till the end of the semester, by that point I couldn't fix my errors on the next assignments. This was also a very unorganized.",0
"Definitely one of my Top 2 professors at Tufts. Great in lecture, on average just 3 hours of hw per week, and awesome guy in general. Tests are tough to most people but they are definitely fair. As long as you do some of the practice exams, take notes and pay attention in lecture, and do the hw, you'll do great!",1
"he is a great professor, makes the material easy to understand.",1
"HORRIBLE professor... he will not ""take you to the promise land"" as he says. Extremely nit-picky, and rude, cant understand you and you cant understand hiM! DO NOT TAKE!",0
She is a nice lady but her teaching is terrible. I would recommend you find another professor. She does not use a grading rubric for papers so the grades become very subjective.,0
I started off with an F but i immediately went for help during her office hours. she can explain complex ideas extremely simple and it was a joy to have her as my professor. Before each exams she prepares the class with a practice exam so make sure you complete that before the test. Great professor if you want to learn the beauty of algebra!!,1
"Took her for civic engagement. Great class, and I'm a business major. Not too hard, but you have to listen well in class and take good notes; no need to read the book! Civic engagement is a lot of fun, you get to volunteer at a hospital or other med institution.",1
She's horrible!!,0
Amazing teacher. Really tries to keep the subject matter lighthearted and interesting. She is very straight forward about her requirements for assignments. Very lecture heavy though and only gives term lists for tests. If you go to class on and take notes you should get an A no problem. Attendance is only mandatory on reading discussion days.,1
"On the first day of class I thought what the heck did I get myself into. He comes off as being very intense because he is a very passionate professor. He is actually very cool and understanding, just pay attention and interact dont get on his bad side!4 tests total, and two map quizzes, each test has two short essays that go along with it.",1
"One of the worst professors at CSULB.  That may be thrown around a lot, but he takes it.  Teaches absolutely nothing, sits in front of the class and reads slides ver batim out of the textbook.  Tests are very hard, espically the written portion.  Very tough grader, takes points randomly off of homework and tests.  Doesn't curve.  ",0
Expect to read about 30 pages of textbook before each class. Nice person but her lectures are really boring. She will talk about the readings for the entire hour and half while you sit quietly and try not to fall asleep. Probably should pay attention tho because the passages/sentences she talks about will appear on the quizzes every Thursday.,0
Brittney rocks!,1
"Good teacher, knows a lot about music. I learned a lot about music, probably one of the single most interesting classes I ever took. Important to make a friend in the class though, there was a partner project and I got stuck with a difficult partner. Other than that the class should be easy do the papers and make sure you spell cymbols right.",1
"DO NOT TAKE!!! I had a horrible experience with my group and when I emailed her about it, she responded with ""There's nothing I can do"". Everyone in the group gets the same exact score, even if one person does more work than the others. There are also very long modules every week and quizzes with questions that don't even go along with the module.",0
"I kinda wished he would give us test and exam reviews. He is a nice guy however, his tests are hard to prepare for.",0
"He only talks about marketing and talks a lot about himself rather than the course. Lectures are long and boring, only two exams and he will not give you anything less than a B- in the class, so this is an ideal class if you want an easy A but it is not interesting at all.",0
This is one teacher who is SERIOUS about her music. Easy class just make sure you pay attention to instructions for the her test. I made an A on every single one them. Sometimes you have to write a short paragraph so its not too bad.,0
"I'm sure she's great for upper level classes because I can tell she's caring & intelligent. However, this was so much work for a 100 level class. & I don't think she planned her lessons. I was stuck listening to directionless ramblings twice a week. Take someone else for ENG 104, especially if you've waited until senior year to take it (like me).",0
One of the worst teachers I have had in my life. He doesn't explain the topics thoroughly at all and he expects students to know the answers. I've never even took the time before to rate a professor but this professor is so bad I need to let other future students aware to stay away. Teaching is not for him and he is setting students up for failure,0
"Not good. Doesnt explain material very well, gets confused by the information himself. Doesnt do enough examples and usually stands there and points at the power point. Only uses mymathlab ppts. to teach. Tests are the majority of the grade, there's only 3. MyMathLab assignments barely count toward your grade, so if youre a bad test taker, beware.",0
"!!!!!DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! only one that fits in your schedule? Change your schedule. only one open? Wait until next semester. He puts about 50 extra words in between the answer you ask for, discourages questions, writes like a 4 year old, doesn't review, doesn't even teach what shows up on the test, and uses unknown methods. I hate this man",0
"Vitz is a great lecturer. Although the class was 1.5 hours, he made it really interesting, so time just flies. He is relatively an easy grader and detailed professor. He tends to lecture fast but if you ask questions he won't mind. Although he is not hispanic, he has a love and passion for Latin American studies, which makes his lectures great. ",1
"I had Mr. F-M for ENC 1101 and 1102, and I enjoyed having him as a teacher for both classes! He is very clear on the requirements of the assignment and gives good feedback on the rough drafts. He is very comical and is understanding when it comes to stress level, especially during finals and midterms. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Dr. Jones helps inspire students as writers looking to make a difference in the community and is extremely helpful in every way. She cares about each individual student dearly and see great potential in everyone. The class was fun, if you chose a topic you were seriously passionate about. I would take any other classes she teaches here at BSU.",1
"Professor Ivanov is great! Super easy class and gives a good introduction to music, his only flaw is his thick accent which can be hard to understand at times, but overall he is a great guy. He really cares about his students learning the material.",1
"Do not take for a gen ed. Hard to get in contact with and when you do her feedback is useless. Really tough grader, not worth the stress and frustration. Dont know how shes still able to teach :/",0
"Dr Jasmin is passionate about organic chemistry. He mumbles a little, but he is very clear in his explanations.",1
"Will never take this professor again! His quizzes were very tricky, all quizzes had questions that had nothing to do with the assigned chapters. The weekly reports are heavily graded on grammar. Take at your own risk!",0
"This online class was my least favorite business class of all time.  The instructor assigns an obscene amount of homework for how basic the class is.  I was also not a fan of having ALL homework, assignments, quizzes, etc due on FRIDAY NIGHT.  Ouch!  Expect hours of busy work and an absolutely detestable TWO group projects that made no sense!",0
She is one of the sweetest teachers in the nursing department at MATC. She has a lot of experience and knowledge. Her discussions are helpful and she does reviews before the exam that focus on key points. You have to be prepared for class and have to read. I would take her again. ,1
"Fran is one of the best teachers in the WORLLDD. I love her so much even though I am terrible at Chem and found the class to be challenging. Tip: her lectures are always more helpful than the book. Also best way to study for her exams are by doing practice problems (I learned this the hard way). Shes sooo CARINGGG almost like a mother :,)",1
"Get ready to spend HOURS watching lectures that you can't understand. Seems to me that he cares more about the way he sounds in lectures than actually teaching material. Discussions make no difference in your grade, while tests are 100-200 points. Don't bother asking him a question as he will make you feel stupid for even asking in the first place.",0
No extra credit,1
"Worst and most unfair professor I have had at UCD. Bad lectures, harsh grader, boring as hell. She is the ONLY professor that has ever given me a C/D on over 60+ essays I have wrote while at school, all other essays have been A's/B's.....other students who sat around me in HIS 173 felt the same way.",0
"Yifan Li is good as a person, but not so good as a teacher. I got a hard time to understand his leature, which is what the exams are based on. My english is not good, but I can understand all of my other classes. I couldn't take notes because I was not sure what he was talking about for most of time, and these notes can't be found anywhere else.",0
"Dr. Li is a sweet man, however is not the best professor. He tends to explain things that are not presented on the slideshows, which makes it difficult to grasp concepts since he is often hard to understand. Labs are generally easy, though I don't feel like I retained much knowledge from them.",0
This was the last class I had to take at SVSU and thank god it was. He ruined my experience at SVSU. He does nothing but talk down to students and makes you feel scared top ask a question. He is the biggest hypocrite. He complains and projects his feelings to his class. He also makes very inappropriate comments about students. DO NOT TAKE!,0
"Loved Russell's Con Law class. It's a ton of reading, but it's rewarding material, and she has fun and engaging lectures every day. She's approachable, super nice, and knows her stuff. I looked forward to trekking to Commons at 10 AM three times a week. Take her class.",1
"Earp is a great professor. His work can seem overwhelming at times, but honestly it is not much and helps you figure a lot about yourself and life. He is there for you and his test are straight off the PowerPoint. So as long as you study that at excel at the homework it is an easy A ",1
"She makes Chemistry EASY. Print power points, read them before class, and you will have no problem following along and passing. Exams are easy if you study power points. She presents material in a way anyone can understand, builds upon material to the next subject which is helpful, and very laid back. Extra credit opportunities. Homework is rare.",1
"This class is supposed to be an easy A because no one cares about classics, we only do it for requirements. Lectures are like watching paint dry, some of the TFs are hardos and dont let you go on your phone, youll get points docked on your assignments for arbitrary reasons. Theres a lot of extra credit though and and that can save you from an A-",0
I went to catholic school my whole life and am well rounded in philosophy and theology but Professor Fallon was a merciless grader. He gave relatively no feedback and his comments on my papers were rude to say the least. He said he would help and seemed reassuring but there was no improvement whatsoever,0
"This was one of the best classes I've taken at UT. Everyday we learned something new, useful, and usually state of the art in CBE. He doesn't give below a B, bc although it's difficult material, he only wanted us to interact during and make sure sure we learned everything. Take this class!!!",1
"Best professor I've had at the Lake! She actually is very engaging of her students in her class, and teaches the material in a way that students can relate it to everyday life. Would definitely recommend her!",1
Uses same material for Perception & Cognition Classes.  Completely full of it.,0
Super boring classes but they always ended early. Three super easy essays and an extra credit essay. Hes not very nice but an easy grader,0
"Everyone loves Betsy! She is a super lenient grader who really cares about her students and their success. Sure, she asks that her students do a lot of reading, but that's part of going to college, and all of the reading is super relevant to learning in the courses. She makes her students feel loved and inspired to do better.",1
"She's the sweetest, nicest lady ever! She is very, very approachable. If she notices that more attention is needed on a certain subject, she makes sure that attention is given without jeopardizing the rest of the material in the semester.",1
Homework for her lab takes hours and is extremely unclear! You email her for help and she doesn't respond. Her power point notes make sense in class when you talk about it as a class but are hard to understand at home. Shes an extremely tough grader. Short answers tests.,0
"Professor Epley gives a substantial amount of feedback on graded papers, which was extremely helpful. We did not write that many papers, and I hardly had any homework. Class participation is important, but the class discussions are stimulating. If you try in this class, you'll get an A.",1
Professor Daphney almost never shows up to class abd when he do he never wants to explain the homework pr quizzes he assigns us. He teaches pretty good but his consistency of coming to class is horrible. We barely get to meet up for class. I would not recommend taking him unless you are prepared to teach yourself.,0
"He's a laid back guy with a lot of experience, which he is always willing to share. Don't be fooled though, the exams can be tough. Got a 99 on the first one, a 40 on the second. A reasonable class over all  - not an easy A, but it won't kill you either. He was very empathic about my second test grade and really encouraged me to work harder.",1
"Professor Nelson is seriously the best chemistry teacher I have EVER had! He is just amazing! He is very organized,very helpful, and does anything he can for his students. He actually cares! I am so lucky to have had him as a professor. I learned and actually retained the information! I would recommend him to everyone!Take his Lab as well very fun!",1
"By far the best professor! Very laid back, cracks jokes and is very informative. Two open book exams, an extremely short paper, and one debate. Other than that you just sit back and enjoy the class. I wish he taught all the business courses.",1
He was not really helpful at all. He never gave us graded assignments back on time. He was disorganized and did not follow his syllabus. He graded papers way too hard for no reason. I didn't learn really anything in his class.,0
"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE HER. She seems sweet at first but you quickly see the other side of her. She hates when students ask her questions but then asks us to ask questions. She cannot teach, simply reads off the notes packet which makes less sense than she does. Only took her because she is the only professor who teaches the course.",0
She gives back to back homework!!! Everyday!!!,0
"Very passionate, felt like he actually cared about the subject. Didn't bs us, told us what we needed and didn't need. Kind of insistent about textbook use but if you have programming experience you probably won't need it. Easy grading criteria, very accessible in and outside of class.",1
"TOOK HER ONLINE SHE IS GREAT, AND SHE DOES NOT PILE ALOT OF WORK ON YOU AT ONE TIME.",1
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
Amazing professor and very professional. She cares a lot about her students. She helped me so much.,1
"I took his class online. He assigned chapters for each week from the book but I never used it, explains everything in his notes. Easy class and he makes the material interesting.",1
"Charles Putnam is an exceptionally well spoken dedicated professor. He has a knack for engaging all of his students despite the large lecture size of JUST401. But distract other students at your peril, it's the quickest way to get him angry. What you put into this class you will receive. But it wasn't too hard either. A+ Professor, would take again",1
"Nicola's use of the Canvas website had a lot of difficulties. she has pop quizzes and would take pictures of the board but then forget to post. I emailed her once asking how to turn in an assignment because it was unclear on Canvas, and she never got back to me. Overall, Nicola and her TA's taught this class with little regard for her students.",0
Her tests are all writing and if it isn't in her words you don't get credit for it. Awkwardly stares at everyone in class and makes you write a short essay everyday in the beginning of class,0
He's horrible. He's hard to understand and when you ask for help he just shoo's you away. He's all over the place during lecture and the problems are always unfinished.,0
Took Cog and S&P. He is an extremely nice professor. Need to read the book and attend lectures. Definitely need to think deeply about the topic and applications. Your grade is 3 tests. BE sure to ask questions in class because he will explain until you understand.,1
"He's 'flamboyant'  so be prepared for that. His lectures are useless, the papers are vague and difficult and he grades very strangely. I've never had an issue with writing, and in fact enjoy it, but he seems to find an issue with everything I submit, and gives nonsensical reasons for the deductions. If you're an engineer, not a poet- stay away.",0
"The teacher was not only super unfair grader during the COVID, but did not respect issues I had with technical problems and therefore dropped my grade. She was rude when you asked for help during the labs.",0
"Before taking his class, I had been in three photography classes and I loved all of them. When i was in Doug's class, I loathed every second of it outside the darkroom where he hardly ever showed his face. He was overly picky on assignments and failed a majority of the class for minor things that were totally irrelevant to the content.",0
"I got a 68 on 2 papers. One had a lot of spelling errors and made no sense. The other was just a bit heavy on the quotes otherwise pretty good. If I've already improved on my mistakes, there's nothing else I can do to get a better grade. It was the same story on summaries. He seems to be determined to give me a fixed grade no matter my effort.",0
"The ""professor"" was absolutely terrible. Nothing but simplified lecture straight from a power point. When asked anything, her only response was to look through the power-point. When asked if she could demonstrate the MMC, she replied I don't know what that is"". One project toward the end of the year accounted for a large majority of our grade. F-",0
Tests are unnecessarily tricky. The way she asks questions makes you second guess yourself. They are so tricky that even she messed up 3 of the questions. The NCLEX questions aren't even that tricky. I am an A student and got a C on the first test. She told the class we were doing very well with an overall C average. How is that a good thing?,0
Fantastic Professor. He will make you a better writer.,1
Too much sass. Very disrespectful. she made one of her students cry. Shows no remorse. Speaks in 3rd person. worst accounting teacher  ever. look somewhere else or you will get the worst time of your life.,0
She's super sweet and very helpful. Homework isn't required but it's the basis for all the quizzes and tests. Gets confused a lot but she goes over things in class and makes everything clear. Always available for office hours &allows one page of notes for each test. Do the work & you can have an easy A in the class. Best math teacher I've ever had.,1
"bad professor, not helpful at all. Just tells you to read the chapters and expects you to do a 60 question test in 30 minutes...dont take this guy trust me.",0
"His accent is very heavy, he does not clarify what he teaches in class so get ready to teach yourself!!! he shows absolutely no enthusiasm, but he'll give you chance to make up homework if you miss it. I was extremely bored in class, he would talk and write on the board and if no one understood he'd go on to  the next problem. AVOID HIM!",0
"This manz is great, hes so caring and funny!! He does not give you too much homework. Hes so chill about everything. Honestly just show up to class and do your work on time and you'll get an A. He is the best professor here at NOVA. 10/10",1
"Prof Radley is one of the sweetest professors Ive had here. He truly cares about his students. Hes easily accessible outside class via email and hold office hours on Zoom every week. He also does a review by himself for each exam a few days before and covers any questions. This class is hard, not going to lie, but take it with Prof Radley!",1
"He is the worse instructor I have ever had, he will not email back because it is a hassle. Doesn't really understand english and really don't think he knows anything about the powerpoints that he uses!",0
"I do NOT reccomend this teacher. His Biology 101 class is one day a week, and you have THREE quizzes every class. He is unorganized and someone else comes up with his tests, so he has no clue what will be on them. He gives no study guides or extra credit. My friend missed one day of class and his grade went down TWO letter grades. No leniency!",0
"Jeannette is awesome. She really cares about each student in her class, and will work with you to improve your business communication skills. The class is tough, but she does a good job of making all of the effort worth it.",1
You can tell she enjoys History and is very knowledgable about the subject. Would not recommend for an easy A due to most of her classes being unclear,1
Class was so easy grade is based on tests only pretty much and the one easy project. I didnt even read the book and still got a's on the tests,1
"If you don't come from a reading heavy or history background her class can be really tough, since you could be assigned 100+ pages per class. Her lectures were clear and even when they went off track were still relevant and interesting to the course. I thought she was a great lecturer, but be prepared to work hard for a good grade.",1
Gets in your face a lot. Treats you as if you're still in Middle School. I wouldn't recommend her class at all. Less than half of the class stayed for her class before I left.,0
"She really thinks she is an intellectual, and will hold it over anyone who doesn't meet her standards. Snobby and unpleasant to learn from. Demeaning. She needs to work on her personal issues and know when to leave them at the door. There are better teachers at BCC.",0
"Possibly the worst class ive ever had. From the beginning of the semester, the entire class had to spend countless hours at the math lab.  If you have trouble with math STEER CLEAR. Dont get me wrong, professor is a nice guy, his teaching is horrible.",0
"She is a great professor and funny . moves dates around a lot. one presentation on your reading which is easy, one mid-term, paper and final and thats it.",1
"Good person, nice, accessible, a man of intelligence and ehthusiasm. However, Intro to economy is really not suitable for him to teach. so many reading without any specific instruction. Always looking for your visit during office hour, which is good, but often I don't have questions because I do not really understand what we are learning.",0
"She has a tendency to rant or try to make the class a group therapy session, however if you go to her website and work on the test reviews in class you'll do fine on the test. She gives you an oral review right before the quiz/test with exactly what's on the quiz/test so that helps too.  Overall easy A. Do the work, show up to class, you'll be fine",1
"Lively teaching style, never bored me. Can be irreverent, has many interesting ideas and topics that broaden knowledge in other classes outside foreign languages. Brings in fascinating, worthwhile Spanish and Latin American literature selections. I wouldn't have missed these classes for the world. Highly recommend!",1
I took astronomy in high school and attended almost every lecture for the class but it was still extremely challenging. Reading the chapters and taking notes in lecture was a breeze and I felt I understood everything until I would get my tests back! Very nit-picky grader for an introductory class and tests basically make up your entire grade.,0
"the best CSUMB has to offer.  she's the dean now, so there's not much teaching on her plate.  stop by and say hi to her anyway.  she's a great human.",1
The prof is fairly knowledgeable in the subject. In the intro level class she can sometimes move a bit too fast for students with no experience or knack for programming. Willing to work 1 on 1 with students after lectures. Most tests are open book and notes.,1
This professor is clear with his instructions.  He is helpful with feedback and is approachable if you have questions.  His grading scale is kind of harsh because there are not enough assignments to offset many deductions so you have to be careful and make sure you do the assignments fully.,1
she is hard and she grades terribly!!! Don't take her. Try taking any other professor. She will torture you!!! Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I want to be Dr. Braun when I grow up.,1
Dr. Colavecchia is a great lecturer. Her podcasts are useful when you can't make it. I re-watched/re-listened to the podcasts when I was studying for the term tests. You can re-listen at the gym or while you're driving. The content is interesting. Make sure you read the courseware and know the facts for the tests/quizzes and you'll do well.,1
"Daily. Roll call. questions. She grades you after class, sometimes during class. (she sees you). She emails her students wayyyyyy to much. ALL HW DONE ONLINE, but does not allow phones or laptops in class.",1
"Awesome class! At times, it can be boring but as long as you study a little bit, you can't get anything lower than a B. He's an awesome pianist too! Three short concert reviews, three tests, and he even has a nice ""Kosnik Surprise"" Extra Credit given out, too! I'd definitely recommend him if you're in the honors college, too!",1
"Dr. Best did a great job with medical sociology this semester. Interesting content, easy to follow",1
"Great lecturer for a difficult subject (don't worry, it's way better than PHYS122). The demos are super important to pay attention to and you should definitely at least skim through the textbook before lectures.",1
"Ala is amazing! She gives ample extra credit, is very clear in what she wants, and just wants to help her students succeed and learn. I am so grateful this was my introduction to physics. I am leaving her class actually liking physics and excited to learn more!",1
His notes can be confusing. You have to read the book to help get an understanding of the topics. Can't use calculator on tests. Best to try to get a hold of his old tests to help study for the tests. He does curve on the grades.,0
"He is a very dry Prof. The class is very lecture heavy, and if you dont show up, there is no way you will know whats on the test. The readings dont matter at all, except for the 2 assigned books. The real textbook is more for personal reference if you do not understand the basics. So you have to go to class, and try to stay awake, its a challenge.",0
Hands down the WORST professor Ibe ever taken at DSC. Very unfortunate he is the only professor teaching physics or else I would advise to avoid Dr. Tulsian at all costs. Hard to understand him through his mumbling and rarely explains what he is doing in his class work problems. Extremely rude and condescending. F-,0
I am a worse person from meeting her. She constantly berated my ideas in both seminar and on my papers. I am a b+ to an A student and I barely passed her classes. she is a tough grader and picks faves. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. she caused me to have a mental breakdown in first semester of my second year because she constantly made me miserable.,0
"So it's my first semester at UAA. I take Ross's class online. The prof seems nice-but he doesn't interact with you at all. Outside of BlackBoard, he doesn't talk. If you take his class online, be prepared to read the textbook and take notes. DO THE ONLINE QUIZZES. DO THEM. They WILL save your butt on the tests (which compose your entire grade btw).",0
I have never met a more self-absorbed professor in my life. He believes his way of teaching is the best despite the high fail rate of his classes caused by nobody being able to understand his lectures. Your only hope of passing this class is to study on your own time from the study guide and recommended questions. Don't even bother going to class.,0
really sweet and caring. actually teaches but she's a tough grader and assigns a lot of readings. she's a tough grader on the paper but allows for rewrites and tells you exactly what needs to be changed. she really makes you work for your grade but doesn't make an A impossible. final is all open answer but was relatively easy.,1
"Very sweet and helpful. Seems like a professional in her field. But she says one thing and then later says and does the opposite. Unreasonably tough grader. The class had some of the most interesting topics for me ever, and the most annoying teacher ever.",0
You are never going to know your grades.,1
Andrew was a quirky guy but a great teacher. He understood that you had a life outside of just this class and was a pretty lenient grader. 3 essays and they each weigh more toward your grade. A few homework assignments that were super simple. Just work on your papers and you're golden. I'm not the greatest at English and I got an A.,1
Super Sweet Professor. Relates real world and the textbook. I highly recommend taking Positive Psych w/ her. Take Notes and her tests are all multiple choice. Def take her for psych!! :),1
"Pretty thick accent, but if you listen, you will learn. You will get a study guide with several essay questions and roughly 20-30 individual identifications. On exam day, you randomly select a paper with one essay and 10 IDs, so make sure you know everything!",1
"Dr. Holtan is an engaging, fun professor who still manages to pass on relevant information. I recommend any of her classes.",1
"This class is pretty straight forward and easy if you do the work. Weekly quizzes with all answers in the book, test werent to hard but reccomend studying a little before taking them. Weekly videos that are short and easy to watch. Occasional discussions. Nothing in the class is too hard everything can be done. Really nice and friendly teacher !",1
"She is very disorganized that it just blows my mind. Gives lab reports like it's Christmas, like chill, your class is not the only class I'm taking during the summer and I have other responsibilities that are more important then her ineffectual labs.",0
"Dr. Thibodeau is easily the best professor at Bentley College, and I've yet to see anyone who even comes close to this guy. While his class is difficult, he teaches it with a vigor that is unseen among all professors at the college, and he wants you to succeed. He will never bore you. You need to work hard, but you'd be a fool to take anyone else.",1
"Her lectures are so long and boring. Get ready to wait 3 weeks for her to reply to your emails. Her test are hard and you read about 3 different books at a time and skip around, it gets so confusing.",0
"Dr. SInha is a very nice lady, but her lectures are poorly organized. Not just her, but the prof she co-lectures with. The tests are similar to lecture, but you must read the book and truly study from the BIS labs to do well. She needs to work on organization and making points clearer. I don't recommend taking her class.",0
"Class consists of one weekly discussion, one midterm, one project, and one final. She is very clear on her directions and a very fair grader. I am a sociology major and I very much enjoyed her class, thanks professor!",1
Stay away from him. He cannot teach. I have had much better teaching from my High School teacher. His bedside manners are horrible. He will judge you and it is automatically assumed that the student is bad. Not true. Their entire department needs to be overhauled. I wish I had never come to SMU. They keep him so he can make you keep retaking $$$,0
"Terrible at teaching, you will have to rely on others / youtube / buy a textbook.",0
Stay away if you want to pass,0
Dr. McDougal is one of the best professors I have had. His lectures are very helpful and should be attended although it is not mandatory. Organic Chemistry is challenging but if you do what he says you will learn the subject and enjoy yourself listening to him joke around.,1
"Best professor ever! Incredibly interesting lectures, time flies by unnoticeably! Dr. Clasen is very knowledgeable and cares about your knowledge as well as your grade. Prepare to work and to study. I haven't worked that hard in a class ever in my life, but I exit it confidently with solid knowledge. Thank you, Dr. Clasen! You taught me well!",1
"I'm sure she is good at what she does in-person, but as for her online class, it's a disaster. I have no idea how to navigate the blackboard page for her class and even the syllabus doesn't match what she actually wants us to do. Just a lot of miscommunication and disorganization.",0
"Good class. Used online textbook, no hard copy needed. Pretty easy math class. Very applicable information.",1
"She was great! took both of her online classes Anthro 1 and 2 and I love them, especially 1. She cares about her students and is very nice and understanding. Loved everything about the class.",1
"You will not pass if you don't have the textbook. On your review sheet, review and read every single little detail she tells you to read.",1
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
This class has been relatively easy and enjoyable. I would highly recommend taking Professor Hippensteel. He gives great feedback on assignments and the workload for this course is very fair.,1
"He doesn't really teach during the lectures, more so just tells stories. The tests are very long and detailed. Tests are 20% each so make sure you study. He has online quizzes which aren't horrible and activities online.",0
Patrick is a bit hard but a very fair teacher. He makes you think. He works and engages the class.,1
"Good suggestions on color mixing, paint handling. Poor management of class time. Critiques went way over; she stayed later to finish & implied that anyone who didn't stay was not committed. As a single parent w child care obligations I had no choice but to leave, although I was hugely committed. Left a bad taste, insensitive, elitist.",0
Hands down would never take again. Literally the worst math teacher I have had. I spent more time researching how to actually solve math problems than I did learning what was actually taught. There's also videos in the course that may be either on point or completely not what the homework is about. No Communication at all,0
Brilliant teacher. I enjoyed her class. I hated learning spanish but she made it quite enjoyable. The class is fast paced lots of assignments and you need the books but if you want to get and A and learn at the same time take her. You will enjoy it plus the exams are easy. She gives pre-test which are basic replicas of the actual test. A+ teacher:),1
"Very nice man, but this class was awful. He assigned YouTube videos instead of teaching and yet gave the hardest exams and homework I have ever had to do. Questions were unclear and made to trick you. He takes off an unnecessary amount of points for small errors. In office hours he is not helpful and says that it is for you to figure out. Run!!",0
She is really great at teaching. If you miss a few classes you need to get notes from someone in your class or you will be lost. She's very understanding and she will try to make sure you understand her lecture before moving foward with the lecture.,1
"Worst English professor at the jc. Unorganized, not clear when giving directions. His essay prompts are nonexistent. ",0
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
"I didn't get the feeling that this professor wanted me to learn japanese. It almost seemed like it annoyed her. Her quiz's and tests were pretty easy if you study. Watch out for her final, she made us do a oral presentation timed. Studying Japanese is my passion and I felt that her class took away a lot of that passion. Be ready to talk a lot in cl",1
"Took her for 2 semesters and easily the worst professor. During the pandemic most professors eased up, but not her. 2 group projects, had to present both over Zoom. Plus 2 essays that were 3+ pages not to mention the quizzes every week. The quizzes have a study guide with the exact questions but its 10 out the 24 you have to study from. ����",1
"I love Tanush!  He's there for you 24/7, in person or by email.  He also incorporates new research into class concepts very often.  I really love that!",1
She was always giving us homework at 12 at night and expected us to complete it by the morning 8 30 class. Dont take her class at NJIT. Not worth the time.,0
"He seems like a nice guy but he was not willing to work with me and offer me extra credit, he grades the critique way too harshly & took off several points for things that were irrelevant. he never gave a clear structure for the critique. this class is an easy A BUT if you ever have anything going on in your personal life dont expect him to care.",0
"I would love to hear one of his lectures, but as a professor? You couldn't pay me enough to take him again. If you can avoid his class, do it.",0
"Funny guy, but very hard to follow. A lot of homework, quizzes and 4 exams.. Have not learned anything from him, had to find everything on my own.",0
"Homework - Takes so long but outlines a lot of what you are tested on. You need to read the book and do the homework. She isnt that helpful and she is pretty clueless about a lot of the material. Its hilarious, go to OH and she wont be able to answer a single question you have unless its adding vectors or taking a derivative LOL",0
Everything was so logical. If you study the quizzes and exams are easy.,1
"Micah is very smart, there is no doubt that he knows what he is talking about when it comes to design and typography. And although he is HILARIOUS when it comes to sarcasm & dad jokes, sometimes I struggled & probably took his sarcasm too personally. I was convinced & I still think that he can't stand me--But who knows? That could just be me.",1
"Very hard to contact! Does not answer emails and is very unclear when he does! He makes it very difficult to succeed in his class, and he lets you know that as a student! We are beneath him as students! Stay clear! Avoid at all costs!",0
"I loved Mr.Nelson! He is a very sweet old man and he really does care about his students. He is willing to sit down and help you with whatever questions you might have, his hand writting is alittle messy but overall easy to understand. I would recommned his class to anyone!",1
"Although the class is easy, she will decrease your mark just to respect the York University bell curve policy. She is UNFAIR, her lectures are boring, she doesn't give more than 80 on the presentations, she does not care for students. She's very fake and will smile at you but won't hesitate to decrease your mark. NEVER TAKING A CLASS WITH HER AGAIN",0
"Absolutely awful. Didn't get the feeling I could approach her at all, and any questions I would ask, she would end up beating around the bush and not answer them. She treated us like children, talking to us condescendingly and just all around gave us disrespect when some of us have done nothing wrong. Got an A somehow.",0
"if you dont like sarcastic dry humor then he is not the teacher for you. i had him for lab and his practicals areVERY straight forward. if you study, you will do well. if you dont study, you wont do well. simple as that",1
"All info is presented and you have 2 months before things are even due. No interaction until something is graded, and she grades on technicalities, not if you even understand the materials. She comes across really pretentious and condescending. Exam questions are based on YouTube videos. Honestly this class is hard to pass and I have a 4.0.",0
Dr. Mizell was the best professor I have had in a long time. She was great. I enjoyed her class each and every time I walked into her class room. She was so nice and caring with all of us. She made literature interesting. My class was great. I would take her class again if I needed another literature class.,1
"boring course,too many things need to remember. don't waste your time.my GPA is 3.5 and got a c in his course.worse grade i ever got. don't expect he will curve Hundreds of slides notes. if you want to suicide, take his ee333.",0
"She is a comp. 1 professor. Comp. 1 should not be hard to pass, especially at a COMMUNITY college. She is a weird grader, very technical, and will rip your essays/summaries to shreds. You are warned.",0
Love Thomlinson. Wish he taught more classes. One of the nicest professors I've ever had.,1
Poor time management. (Waited almost 3 weeks for him to post an online exam.) Very wishy-washy on the material he was using. Added a required book to the class with less than a month left in the semester. Also tells lots of stories. Im sure hes a hoot at barbecues but theyre mostly distracting and rarely relevant to the question asked.,0
"Nice man and a great chemist, but I found his lectures to be all over the place. He rushes through examples so fast and skips mathematical steps, so if you plan on just learning from lecture and not reading the book... Good luck. A lot of out of class effort is required for this class, I found it harder than organic.",0
"I took his American Heritage course. As was spoken before, he is very eloquent and intelligent. However, he is very condescending, rude and arrogant.",0
My first time taking her. Absolutely terrible. Through online classes she makes you take a quiz before and throughout class. All the questions she writes and her English isn't the best so it actually made it harder for me to grasp concepts by the wording of the questions. I am also 90% sure that she hacks zoom and can hear you even if you're muted.,0
"When you take Honors 210 do yourself a favor and do not take White's & Ritzenhoff's section. Before, this class was only taught by Ritzenhoff, which everyone said was fun. This was the first year with White & she was awful. Gives no assignment guidelines, not available for help with assignments, and then has audacity to tell you not to worry Awful",0
"Regret taking her pilates, very picky person. though she's dedicated it's way over the top, especially for something students are just taking as an extra curricular exercise. She comes off as rude. when I emailed her for clarification on an assignment, she told me to look at the syllabus even though I had and was the reason I had even emailed her",0
"He is an amazing professor. He's tough, but fair. His experience in the child welfare field is awesome and you learn a lot from hi. The best Social Work professor ever!",1
Good. Helped me with my essay,1
"The materials that she chose for the class were interesting, but she rarely  gave me any meaningful feedback.  Her grading criteria on major assignments was confusing. Plus, she was not super nice when responding to my questions.  I would recommend buying the textbooks via kindle.  Also, ask a classmate first if you have a question.",0
"I really wish I would not have taken this professor. Luckily for me, since I failed I can choose a different one next time. Simnet is fine,  easy to use and helpful. I got A's and B's on all the online assignment. My problem was that I had an out of state emergency and could not get the courtesy of a response back from Mr. Douglas re: a makeup.",0
"I really hope she reads these and sees the feedback. This class was horrible. Way too many readings, responses, quizzes, and some nice 50 question exams. Most professors choose either a long multiple choice or a full essay, but she does both. WAY too much work total for 100 level class.",0
"Picault is a really nice prof, he seems to be very knowledgable about what he is teaching but the class is very hard. I took this as a requirement and it was very difficult to grasp most of the content. The course was interesting nonetheless.",1
"She is a nice professor who really cares her students. She gives extra credit projects to improve ones grade. She has lots of knowledge about Chemistry. Do study !!, and it is an easy A.",1
goog,1
"Very easy class the only thing you need to worried about is the quizzes, the two mid terms, and the paper which is easy. For the quizzes I would highly suggest you bring some type of voice recorder  because when he goes over the quiz the class before, he talks kind of fast...but its a pretty easy class.",1
"At first was very interested in the topic at hand, Feminist Anthropology. But my interests quickly dropped due to the lack of direction and off topic rants. Horrible at returning assignments on time! I do not recommend this prof. Gave her two chances and that was more than enough. Not worth the money.",0
Professor McFaul is definitely one tough grader!! He makes you work for your grade. He really makes you stay awake in his lectures because he is engaging with his students. He is a caring guy but I did struggle with this class.,1
"try to stay away from TTS for Chem 111. I wasnt very into her class from the start, and because of that her mediocre teaching had no effect on my learning. i remember getting an 83 on my first quizor exam, then just downhill from there. try to get Vining for any Chem course he teaches (including 111 I believe)",0
"the material for this class was very dry! there is no homework  and you do not need a text book either. There is a quiz EVERY week on the material but he does tell you what it will cover. take advantage of making notes on an index card and using it on the weekly quizzes.  Overall, good eye candy.",0
Challenging but rewarding class. She is very passionate about animation. Shows animated films during class which are very entertaining. If you love to draw this is the class for you!,1
"MA is the best accounting teacher I've ever had. Yes you have to do work in her class, but you actually LEARN accounting. If you want to learn how to regurgitate facts, take Larry Clark or someone else, otherwise, take Prater.  Yes she'll challenge you, but its not an extreme amount of work for a class.",1
He is the smartest man to ever walk the earth. He has infinite knowledge about anything and everything. You walk out of his class with a higher IQ. He is a once in a lifetime opportunity. He is the one man that really does know the true meaning of life in itself. Tamm is the greatest modern day teacher ever. Plus he is super hot.,1
She was an amazing professor that really made learning Chemistry enjoyable. I LIVED to hear her rants on the real world that was related to the chemistry topic for that day. I found her lectures inspirational and motivating. I am happy I was happy to take her class on her last semester. The later classes will miss out on a great professor.,1
"Sammons is the homie! At first he comes off as being dull but if you actually pay attention and participate he's funny and entertaining. He also isn't too hard on grading, I'd definitely recommend this class.",1
"Wasn't sure at first but honestly this professor really cares and loves his field of study. He has his own sense of humor, loves poetry, vocabulary, writing. Book is used so buy it, papers are easy, JUST DO THEM don't let them pileup. Trust me. He just needs to work on how he connects with the class. It was very boring. He's cool one on one though.",1
"I truly enjoyed this course and having Mrs. McGlynn as my professor.  She cares about what she does and is happy to help.  She infuses meaning into what she teaches and has inspired me as a future educator.  If you have the opportunity to take a class with her, please do.  She is a gem!",1
"Professor Lopez is an incredible speaker, very intelligent, and has many interesting points about Shakespeare that you will not learn anywhere else. He's also surprisingly funny. Grading is fair. If you like Shakespeare, you'll enjoy it a lot!! Kept sleeping through the 9am lectures, though, and missed all the days he handed back the test aha;;",1
Worst teacher I have EVER taken. Test have nothing to do with what you study. If you think you can study homework and pass a test you a mistaken. Any test is completely different from any hw you will be doing . He never uses canvas . Don't I repeat DO NOT take this horrible teacher.,0
she is fine you just need to pay attention.,1
Patty is awesome! She's always there ready to help u wether that b via email/text/call. She provides feedback and always praises u when u do something right and shows u how to do something when ur doing it wrong. She's friendly & nice and will even hell u w/ur other courses even if she's not ur teacher for those. ,1
Amazing professor! You will be really lucky if you get prof Schloss in clinical. You will learn a lot!!!,1
Extremely easy! He gives you the EXACT questions and ANSWERS that will be on your midterm and your final. All you have to do is memorize them. Speeches are easy. Class is enjoyable.,1
"He's (more than) a little crazy, but definitely knows what he is talking about. If you put in any effort, the class is pretty straightforward. Midterms pulled straight from the homeworks with different numbers.",1
"Very tough grader, and takes point off for no reason. Does not want you to pass, only to fail. You will not be able to get an A in this class, even if you spend 27/7 studying the material. Do not take it and fail. Take another teacher or drop out",0
"Good teacher, helped with resume.  Classwork was not hard, tests were not easy but in all if you attend class and listen to the lectures you will pass the class.  He is a great teacher with a good heart.",1
"If you want to take this class, be ready to write seven pages for exams, which have no guidelines. This class was harder than my upper level college classes. She treats everybody that takes this class like an Art Major an expects you to know everything that an Art Major would. Also, she does not give any feedback. Worst class I have ever taken!!",0
"Mr. Tyson is not a very good Political Science teacher. He is not very helpful and will not communicate clearly with his students. His lectures are EXTREMELY boring and there is little chance to get your grade up in this class. I think there are 4 tests including the final, and a few quizzes. DO NOT. DO NOT take him. You can do so much better",0
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
This teacher is great. He is extremely helpful and takes extra time if you need additional help. He is very nice and understanding. I would also say that he is very smart. I was hoping that I could take his class for managerial accounting but CSN already has teacher to fill that position but I will be writing to CSN to let him teach that class.,1
One of the best teachers I have had.  He was very organized and informative.,1
"Would not recommend this instructor. Very unorganized, it takes him forever to return exams. He seems too busy with outside life",0
"KB was awesome. He was very relaxed about attendance, but held you accountable by your work. He was helpful and open to ideas, never made anyone feel that they were wrong for their opinions. He grades according to the college standard guidelines (where a c is a good thing), so I was worried, but I did really well in the class.",1
"You need to show up because she doesn't post notes. Also, about a third of your mark is based on discussions, so you should be ready to talk. You get a lot of freedom on the research paper, which is nice. The final exam wasn't super tough. Overall, great class and probably my favourite class and prof so far.",1
"Not a very helpful professor. Doesn't care about his students. If the choice is between him and Falzone, go Falzone, or go home.",0
Coolest professor of my semester.,1
"When I say do not take this professor or this class I MEAN IT. Please spare yourself the extra brain cells when it comes to PLSC101. She constantly changed the assignment due dates, never responded to my emails, and overall made me very frustrated at times. The units were interesting though! (Probably because it was just the textbook teaching us)",0
"loved her, You either get her or you don't at first, but trust me she makes life easy and she is by far the best English teacher I've had. She is NOT harsh and relates/understands her students. TAKE HER CLASS (English 111)",1
"Very odd grading scale, grades off what she thinks is right instead of using the correct rubric",0
"She is really nice and sweet and tries her best to explain things! There were connect assignments, 3 exams, and 1 speech. She also gives out extra credit. I would definitely take her again.",1
"Eh. He's okay. He's not the best professor in the entire world. He's quirky and makes you think, but he won't tell you ANYTHING about a big project. He grades harsh and doesn't really tell you what he's even grading on. You can easily make a B. Always go talk to him in his office. He gives great feedback after your grade is out there.",1
Tough grader,0
She's extremely critical of everything you come in late you will lose points for your assignment. Very tough grader for a beginner college english. Would NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!,0
"If you had Pasqualetti for ME18 during F2014, you have the right to complain. It was on of the most confusing and nerve wrecking classes I've ever taken.  For ME145 it is one of my favorite classes in all of undergraduate. It's really interesting and builds off of ME120/121. VERY HEAVY MATLAB for labs.",1
"He is a great TA. He cares that you learn the material, helps beforehand during exams and quizzes. I would definitely suggest taking his discussion class.",1
One of the best teachers I've ever had!!! She really cares about her students and mathematics! 10/10 recommend! :-),1
"Dr. Goodyear was definitely a challenging professor. If you differ from his view he will try to belittle you in front of the class. When his beliefs do not align with scripture he does not engage in meaningful conversation but instead shuts you down. In addition, two tests dictate 50% of your overall grade and 11 essays decide the other 50%.",0
This professor was a tough grader and very specific in grading . She took a long time to grade assignments which made it very frustrating. When asked for help she forwarded general information to blackboard as oppose to specifically answering my question based on my work. I wish I did not buy the book as well as more of her study guides were used.,0
Really hard to understand. Goes over practice problems in class but the way he describes them is really confusing. Business calc is extremely difficult with him. Would recommend another professor.,0
"such a boring professor, tests are easy if you follow along though. You will never understand what he is talking about though. He seems like a nice and settle fellow though.",0
"While he is very knowledgeable in the arts, his teaching style is very mundane, so much so that it makes you disengaged in the learning process. I wouldn't suggest his class unless you are an art major, as the lecture is pretty heavy and there is a fair amount of reading involved. I also found him to be a tough grader, more than he needs to be.",0
"To start off Dr. Bazil is very disorganized, which led him to not follow the syllabus. When a paper was turned in it would take 3-4 weeks to receive the grade back . He also duplicates the written feedback so it's not a personal feedback response. I would not recommend taking this professor. He does not answer questions that are asked in class.",0
"awful prof, im so glad my class with him is over and i never have to do another with him ever again, I've never had a prof as bad as him",0
Do not take her. It will be a waste of your time.,0
"Michael Perez is the best for COM 221 (Technical Report Writing). Mr. Perez helped me with my long research paper and gave many great advices on how to make the paper good. Overall, in order to pass COM 221 is to have a topic you like doing research on. I would really want Perez again for another class. If you have him, he will really help you",1
"She an amazing teacher. Very caring and helful. If you need help, ask her;  office hours, email, in class, she really helpful. One time I emailed her at 9:30pm and she responed back with a half hour! I will be taking 102 with her.",1
"Mcentie is a jerk. He rarely communicates you, and seems to not care at all for his students. Even for a community college this guy's a joke. The course is already bad, tied in with a terrible professor is just a bad time. He's not clear with what he wants in hws and essays. Just throws boring lectures and textbooks and expects you to be an expert.",0
"Everything on those power points. She is a little too happy, never seems sad or angry, talks to students like they're kindergarten students. TOO EASY CLASS, I felt like she wanted to help students pass, one of those easy prof. that have too easy class that doesn't really prepare you for BIO Series at UTSA. You will not find easier BIO Class at NVC.",1
"i came to improve my speaking skills, I not only found new information, but tricks of the trade to improve my focus, I am always nervous. Matt helped me improve my skill set and that is why i took this class, when you get what you came for the professor gets an A",1
Really enjoyed Ms. Thielos class. Very informative with great readings. She was extremely sweet. Watch out for pop quizzes. I recommend this course for those in CJ or those interested in this field.,1
LOHERY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACCOUNTING PROFESSORS! HE IS WILLING TO HELP AND CRACKS JOKES ANY WAY HE COULD. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND KNOW HIS INFORMATION. TEACHING IS PROBABLY NOT HIS BEST BUT HES WILLING TO HELP ANY WAY HE CAN. I WOULD TAKE HIM AGAIN,1
"If you are not a history major, try to avoid Paulet. She knows her stuff and will make you work really hard. Just turn in all the assignments and you'll pass. If you're lazy and cannot manage that, don't take her. She required books we did not need, which was frustrating. But if you like American History she is the one you should take.",1
"I honestly don't know why she's listed as a professor for this course because she doesn't teach a single thing. Everything we learn is through a program made by McgrawHill-no content is hers. Several students have emailed her struggling with some concepts this semester and rather than teaching or giving advice, she told them to drop the class.",0
Hard grader and the test are really confusing and even with the supposed answer you can still get it wrong.,0
"She's shown up late to class nearly every day.  She is vague about her expectations, and the tests and quizzes are a nightmare. Also, I'm not a fan of the way she weighs grades.  It's hard to communicate my questions and concerns to her.  Nice lady, fun personality and funny, but I wouldn't take another class of hers if I could help it.",0
Worst instructor ever. Does not provide any feedback. Assignments were not graded until there were only two weeks left in the semester so you have no way of knowing what you did right or wrong. Does not reply to emails in a timely manner. Final exam was difficult. Avoid taking him if possible.,0
"Interesting guy. Not that great of a professor. Never really read the book. But used it on the test. Would suggest doing the tests in groups since they're all outside of class. Watch out for the papers, they sneak up on you.",1
I love this man. I too creative writing and he kept it a fun atmosphere by just speaking like a peer would. The reading quizzes were a bit difficult but I failed them all and still got a B. Pay attention to syllabus and syllabus day- he will NOT remind you of assignments that are due.,1
"She is a TOUGH COOKIE! This class is hard if you don't put in your all. If you want to pass this class with an A, I recommend doing everything she tells you to do. She will try to intimidate you by picking on you and blast you with tons of questions. Believe me, when I tell you to study, study, study! Good Luck!",1
"Such an easy class and such a cool prof! His assessments are very easy and his lectures are a lot of fun. Only downside is he has no clue how to use mycourses. If you miss a lecture there are no slides or anything to learn from, that content is lost to you forever.",1
"Buhler is a basic professor who is out to prove a point. If you really want to learn the concepts, take an online Algorithms course, or just read CLRS by yourself.  You'll learn more and get your money's worth. 541T is not worth the tuition cost or time. If you do take it, be sure to cheat on HW. Everyone else does.",0
"During this class it was a cold case institute, due to the pandemic we werent able to continue in person but Professor Massnick made it easy for us to make sure we get our work done online and made it adjustable and helped us out with the assignments/quizzes",1
"I took his online Econ class, and it was the worst class I've taken. Unless you are an excellent test taker and like to teach yourself the class, steer clear. He posts zero lectures or any other original material, grades everything on 2 proctored exams, and tells you to buy an extra textbook--that he wrote. Save your money; take the CLEP instead.",0
"He is rude. I asked him to answer symble questions that I was not understanding. So I asked a symple question about an exam that is coming up. I asked ""what can I study for this quiz specifically, so that I do not study the wrong thing"". Simple enough. He said ""I am not answering any other questions"" which I thought was rude.",0
"TAKE HER CLASS! and more importantly, GO to her class. It will change your life, and as long as you're showing up with an open mind it won't be hard to get an A.",1
Let's be honest Robinson is a grrrreat person but a horrrible teacher. It is sad to say that someone with as much knowledge on the subject he is teaching NEVER teaches. We have to do these group projects and all this busy work which does not help you learn what Social work is. This is just a heads up take this class if your good at self learning.,0
"Professor Pilkington is very caring and always has a smile on her face! She is a great Spanish teacher and wants everyone to do well. Group activities help you get used to speaking the language instead of just writing or doing grammar. The activities are relatively simple but are helpful to do them. The class was fun and easy, so that's a win win!",1
"Don't bother buying the text book, but you will need the code for online weekly quizzes. Show up to class and you will get the answers to extra credit questions. She is super nice and laid back. Can replace lowest test grade (including final) with attendance grade. ",1
"Teacher is terrible. She contradicts the information in the textbook when lecturing. She seems to not have read the book. She makes a very easy class harder than it really is. The quizzes WILL NOT prepare you for the exams. No idea where she pools the questions from or the format, but the Exams are awful, and she won't prepare you for them.",0
Had Michaels for MCHT 111 ad MCHT 213.  Hands down best professor on campus.  Signed up for his MET210 course and got royally screwed as Evans is teaching it.  WHY ISN'T MICHAELS TEACHING MET210 AND ALL ENGINEERING COURSES FOR THAT MATTER???,1
"Ms. Rebecca Slate is an excellent teacher.  She is easy going and does take her time to connect with the students; does take her time to remember students names.  Lectures might be long, but at the end of the semester one would have learned much more.   She does go over the basics which is a good thing if one has forgotten.   Recommend to take her",1
This class is frustrating beyond belief. Doug makes the already confusing subject of philosophy much more difficult than necessary. He makes you purchase a book he put together which has spelling and grammatical errors that a fifth grader could catch. He is a very hard grader considering how unintelligent his own book makes him seem. Take any1 else,0
"Wasn't a big fan of Fetter.  His class consists of asking questions and watching Panoptos out of class, not the way I like to learn.  Quizzes and tests are lengthy and hard.  Likes students who ask questions and seem interested.  Doesn't really go off grading scale and curves, but class is difficult.  Go to review sessions and go to class.",0
"She cares a great deal about her students who also care. If you are often late or absent, she will drop you from the class. Her lectures can be difficult to follow and her responses are not always clear. I recommend reading the chapter beforehand and taking notes. This helps you follow along with her work. If you try hard to pass, she'll help you.",1
"Took his cals 001 class as a requirement, though apparently it was not a requirement for him to teach it as much as it was for me to sign up for the course. He shows up late to class and dismisses us 20-30 minutes early. He has cancelled 3/10 of our once a week classes and during the classes he doesn't cancel we learn nothing. Waste time & money.",0
"Very hard to keep up with, knows what he's doing, but not very good at explaining himself. This is the first class I have ever failed. He is also not good at posting grades on blackboard, so you aren't able to see what you have overall in the class. Would not recommend.",0
"The class was OK.  He was super easy and always seemed to be thinking of other things, super preoccupied. Overall I recommend his class if you want a super easy A.",0
"This was a very easy class, and I enjoyed it a lot. Sara allowed us to get to know her as well as the other students in the class. Our projects were fun, and the workload was fairly light. She is a very good teacher to have as an intro to theatre.",1
Took async fall 2020. It was on the Tophat and textbook is included in the purchase. You read the book and answer mc and short answers for like 60% for your final grade. Midterm and final were easy as the questions were mostly from the textbook readings. Easy A as long as you do the work.,1
"Great class, great teacher, easy grader and he cares about his students a lot. I enjoy coming to chemistry and I feel prepared for the next level of chemistry.",1
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"A sweet person but her teaching style is pretty awful. Despite the pandemic, she has actually made it more difficult to complete this course and has been kind of insensitive to the course load that her students have. Since then we have essentially been teaching ourselves, while she continues to assign things while still not grading past assignments",0
"Seems like she doesn't want to be there. Homework is online (extra $40). Acts annoyed if students ask questions. Complains about the dept. head w/ another instructor during lab. As long as you have something scribbled on your lab report you'll get a 10/10. Tests were very hard. I'll be retaking the class, wish I had dropped. Waste of a semester :-/",0
"Thad is a really nice guy. Phys is hard, but he does his best to teach it. Lab is really easy and so are the tests. Recording the lectures helps,  but the tests are harder. He takes a long time to get grades back. Best phys teacher there is at Butte.",1
Nice guy but too disorganized to run an online class. Spent hours trying to figure out which site each assignment was on (never used blackboard like most online profs). Paid $100 for book + $100 online course fee and got an A but couldn't even tell you what Human Geography is. Easy enough to fulfill requirements but you won't learn anything.,0
Very hard to understand bc of his accent and he doesn't talk loud. If u get him in the fishbowl sit up front or u will not get understand. He is not very thorough of material and speeds thru it. When u ask for help he isn't clear. 60 on a test u will get a 65. If u show up and do hw u will pass but his grading scale is weird. Wouldnt take again.,0
"Absolutely terrible. She's off topic most of the time, because she's got nothing to teach, since she's got nothing in her brain. It's sad, but it's the truth. If you want a good grade, might as well stay home and read your textbook. ",0
"He is an awful professor. You can't understand a word he says because he mumbles so bad. If you ask him a question, he repeats the same thing over and over again that doesn't help at all. He's definitely a big part of physics ""teaching you how to teach yourself"" so don't expect much for lectures. Avoid if possible.",0
class is really hard and not worth the stress. exams are worth so much but the professor doesn't properly prepare you for them,0
It was an easy A and only had 2 tests and research paper that I got a 100 on because I do not think she even read it. She does take attendance every class. I did not learn that much and was able to do my other work during that class. Do not take her class if you actually want to learn about child and adolescent development.,0
"The textbook is completely unnecessary and doesn't tie to lectures. Slides are of simple graphics that are explained poorly, and presentations have no organization whatsoever. Prof seems like a nice guy, but the complete and total lack of objectives, concepts, and structure makes this class nearly impossible.",0
Great professor.  He gets right down to business. Be sure to stay for the entire class...he checks role at the end of the period. ;),1
class a waste of time. Didn't use textbooks or discuss readings. Allowed some students to monopolize class w/inane diatribe. Did not give constructive criticism on assisnments. Wasted too much class time for group project instead of teaching. I learned nothing from sitting in her class....would recc a different professor.,0
"brutal. avoid her class at all costs....impossible to understand what she is teaching in class - she jumps around her notes, and her exams are BRUTAL! don't take her class unless you have to!",0
She doesn't help at all. No extra credit. I was going through some personal issues and I explained and share my personal issues with her and why I wasn't doing well and she still didn't help. No compassion. Not nice at all.,0
"This class was quite confusing. Since she would say something one day and on the next lecture she'd contradict herself. if you study everything on the powerpoint and what she says will be on the midterm and final, you'll do either good or ok. there's a quiz everyday you meet up in class.",1
Reisinger is the best French prof I've ever had. She's a hard grader but is always willing to help and tries to make class interesting. She gets to know her students and is friendly.,1
"Prepare for a heavy dose of ""Ok, Ok...""  and ""Shift to the Right, Shift to the Left...""",1
her quizes are hard now and she marks paper hard too!! and she changes syllabus 3 times...not easy any more.,0
"Nice guy, never took roll, crazy drawings on the board which were hard to decipher upon later review-so I recommend book study, his study guides never matched the exams either, but I still managed to ace the tests somehow (luck?), only 2 assignments- 1 final paper & one homework during whole class- EASY OVERALL! Boring lectures though.",0
"Professor MacPherson's lectures were very interesting. However, they seemed to go on forever, and the class ambience was tense. We had a two exams and two quizzes. The exams were hard and confusing. The quizzes were not that easy either. We wrote two difficult papers -follow his instructions-but he would give you some feedback before submitting it.",0
"A very bad professor. Slides, examples and explanations are ripped from the book and is incredibly rude to students in her class. Does not follow schedule, no syllabus given and exams/quizzes are not like the homework. Be prepared to the course coordinator or student advocate",0
"I have never had a more confusing professor. She does not teach well, she expects you to know everything she is talking about. She emailed everyone in the class that the majority is doing poor, she should take that as a hint that her students do not understand what she is asking for. If her students are failing, she is failing as a professor.",0
"She is not a good teacher.  A lot of people also in my internet class feel the same way.  There are some questions on the assessments, quizzes and exams that are not in the book at all.  When I contact her, the replies seem like she is typing out of a script.  I feel like she does not understand issues that I am having in her class.",0
He is a terrible teacher. Please don't take him. I had to drop. I don't feel like he gave me the chance to really appreciate the subject and topic. His exams have only 3 questions and are nothing like the 40 questions homework he gives you. He CANT TEACH! He will mess up your GPA.,0
"Not a good teacher, hard to get into contact with and gives huge amounts of homework.",0
I took this class online and I don't regret it. There's a lot of writing but the assignments are super easy. It's an easy online class and a stress-free class. This class can also boost your GPA. Take this class if you have the chance.,1
"The class I took CHEM 1010 was really hard, especially since it's for non science majors. She doesn't teach very clearly, and her tests are not straight from old worksheets or homework. She's not very approachable either. However, she will boost your grade if you come to class every day and make an effort - and trust me, you'll need the boost.",0
"Such a great professor! The reading material is very interesting, he takes the time to explain and analyze the texts clearly during the lectures, and the response papers and reading questions make the two formal papers much easier to write. Once you pay attention in class and participate you will definitely get a good grade.",1
"Dr. Westpfahl is the sweetest and I loved taking this class with him! He lets you ask random questions anytime and for however long you want. There are no tests in this class. Only group projects, homework, and a paper. It's really easy to succeed and his class is very interesting. He cares a ton about the students and is always willing to help!",1
He's a great professor who likes English way too much.,1
"Dave Barrett does not know how to teach this class. Every year he teaches it, he changes the format because it never works well. The homework assignments can take anywhere from 6 to 15 hours yet they are weighted the same! His explanations don't make any sense, but at least he is nice and grades very easily. The worst class in the MBA program.",0
He is one of the worst professors you can imagine. Talks more about politics than physics. Stay away from this professor if you are actually looking to learn.,0
Absolute worst teacher I have had. Grades extremely hard and will only put the hardest possible questions on the test and quiz. Also the longest test has been 6 questions so very little room for error. Literally every test the average score for the class has been failing.,0
"Very nice lady. Pretty much an easy A. Gives you about 8 essays, no penalty if you hand in late work. She allows you to pick you own essay topic. Also NO textbook needed!! Took her Spring '11",1
super easy but super boring. There were 2 open book open notes tests and one paper that everyone got an A on. If you're looking for an easy a take this class but if you plan to take more CJ id recommend taking a class with someone you can actually learn from.,1
"All you learn in this class is editing videos. You don't learn anything else about media. He is picky on how the videos need to be done. He does mot teach anything. You just film, edit, & present in class. He also has favorites. You make 6-8 vids throughout the semester. He thinks we will all become reporters ugh. If you cant use imovie, good luck.",0
"Really easy teacher, awesome dude. Funny/stupid humor. Tough grader on essays but he will really help you out on proofreading it. Definitely take his class. You can probably get away with not having the textbook at all.",1
She is really nice and helpful.  There is no reason anyone would have a hard time in this class.  Must take.,1
"She was not very helpful to someone who doesnt do well in math. Her grading was unnecessarily tough and she gave a lot of homework.  We only had 3 tests and one group project, though the project didn't even count as a test grade. I found some of her comments were rather rude and unjustified. Overall poor experience and would not suggest taking her.",0
"Terrible professor. Extremely unprofessional, pushed off big assignments for ones that didnt matter as much. She has a lot of experience to share with you, but is very close minded & not open to other view points. IMPOSSIBLE to contact outside of class and not very accommodating. Inconsistent grading.",0
Dana is a great ASL teacher. Many students are hesitant when they find out they will have a deaf instructor but she is very patient and easy to understand. As long as you do all of your workbook assignments (which take 20 mins typically) you will do very well in the class. Love it!,1
She is by far my favorite instructor I've had. She's very caring and fair!,1
Will is a captivating prof. He is very knowledgeable and wants you to ask questions. He took a few weeks to get back to me on an email. And LFS 250 will have unequally distributed grading because some TAs mark differently. Your writing will improve over the course of the year.,1
"Fortunately she's often busy talking about things off topic rather than assigning class work. This class is very simple. Dr. Pittman should learn how to take advantage of the use of the online assignment submissions to avoid so many printed paragraphs throughout the sememster for, it is 2019 and printing every assignment is no longer necessary.",0
"If you are in a sorority, fraternity or want to have any other kind of a social life; do not take her. Her class is very test heavy and if you do not have a strong background in chemistry and biology you will not pass. You will be studying for this class every day. If you dont, you fail. Her test questions are tricky. 5 tests including the final.",0
"Even if you have experience in the real world, this prof wants you to keep responses by the textbook. You think you're giving 100% only to receive a D. Assignment List: 10 Discussions, 3 quizzes, 1 Final, 1 Research Paper (based on non-profit organization), Interview Assignment with licensed Social Worker. Prof gives extra credit.",0
Don't listen to the rest of these reviews because they are faker than a flying talking unicorned donkey wrestling a rich tax paying man who also does the dishes and his own laundry. Dr. Evan's is a sweet sweet prof. who bless his heart tries his best but.... you know he is special in a not good kinda way.,0
"Dr. Richards was one of the most amazing teachers I had. I learned so much from her and found her class to be the most beneficial at of all of the education classes. She's an amazing lady and you can really learn a lot from her. She is challenging, but everything she does is for a legitamate reason.",1
"Rudest professor at FAU. He seems to hate what he does. He is very confusing on explaining the material, and makes it too hard to understand. Run away!",0
"Online class, home works and quizzes are easy. Test are all short answer and barely relate to topics on homework or quizzes",0
she is a good teacher but she is kind of crazy. It is hard to understand her because of accent. but she Is pretty good,0
"If you want to know what you are doing, she is the one to take. I struggles with my Finite class with her, but ended up making an A on the final for Statistics in her class. She is always willing to help. I will say that her demeanor and speaking and class can make some of us feel quite low, but i do not believe that is her intention.",1
By all means she shows she is very knowledgable of her subject but she is not friendly at all. It seems like she teaches just because she has to.,0
"Professor Lopez always takes the full lecture to get through half a chapter AT MOST. This dude goes on rants about irrelevant things almost every class. 4 tests make up your whole grade. He gives no review classes because he gives you 30+ slides of PowerPoints for each chapter and tells you to study that. Overall just a boring dude, don't take him.",0
"I'm in between when it comes to Professor Guerra. He is funny, insightful, and kind. He has an arrogance about him, but what 30 year old man doesn't. His tests are difficult and you cannot find the answers in the textbook or from his powerpoint slides, so you have to write down EVERYTHING he says during lectures.",1
"I made the mistake of taking Charles Snow online. He is a terrible professor. He still uses his old slides from IT classes and records his lectures however you are not able to view the notes he is writing sometimes. The worst thing about him is that he take FOREVER to grade assignments, tests, or quizzes. I would personally avoid at all costs.",0
"Prof. Keeling is a good teacher, and I found his course material really interesting and engaging. I would have liked the course better if he were more respectful. He tends to be very passive aggressive to his students and even complained about several of them to me in office hours once. Recommended as a professor, but not as a human being",0
She is by far the rudest professor you will ever meet. She doesn't even teach in this course. You are basically on your own. Whenever you want to go talk to her in her office hours she has this rude vibe to why you are in her office. She belittles her students. I wouldn't recommend this professor to ANYONE!,0
"Hard teacher, but if you are an accounting major take him. It will give you a challenge. Sometimes he isn't as clear as he can be, especially when a student asks for explanation over again.",0
Very strict professor AVOID him.,0
No rubrics or clear instructions for essays.,0
Professor Stevenson is amazing! Anatomy lab can be quite long but her lectures are interesting and she is very clear about what she expects you to know. Tests and quizzes are straightforward and she doesn't try to trick you. She also makes sure to give credit where credit is due. Highly recommend!!!,1
Tough grader and does not return emails in a timely manner. Would not take again. Nor would I recommend this proffessor. ,0
Was no help when I asked for help and basically told me I had to figure it out on my own. Gives examples that are nothing like the ones on the quizzes and exams.,0
"Lectures are extremely fast, no clarification. i would not recommend him.",0
"He is an incredibly sweet professor, his class seemed difficult at first, but he allows you to send in your drafts and will give you amazing feedback. With his essays, they were long but not really hard to complete.",1
Best professor I have had!,1
Really great professor! He tries his best to make lectures fun and interesting. His grading system is very fair and as long as you do all the work its a real easy A. He does his best to help you learn and to help you with anything you don't understand. Very relaxed guy.,1
"hard and rash professor, I event think he's ****, does not help at all, condescending, and rude, study a lot if you are minority, in order to get good grade.",0
"Out of the three profs I had for bis 2c, she was the worst. She taught the plant section and made me hate plants. Her study guides are useless trash and she will test you on a detail that was not even emphasized during lectures. Her slides are often disorganized and makes things very confusing by using her stylus and writing on her tablet. AVOID.",0
"Professor Jervis was very inconsistent with due dates and was an extremely tough grader. She preferred to teach a Psychology class rather than a Writing one, asking a lot from her students in terms of analysis. Multiple papers assigned with not enough time to properly work on them and too early in the course (one assigned in the first week).",0
"Easy and nice professor, If you do your work and pass the tests and labs. Then your guaranteed to get an A or B grade.",1
"Great at explaining difficult topics. It can be a hard course if you're not good with Chemistry, but he explains well, and is available to help. Had him for ChemII after a bad professor for ChemI. What a difference. He was able to explain the stuff I didn't get the first time very well.",1
"Don't get me wrong -- Scott is a good guy. I just don't understand his class half of the time. I have to go hunting in the book to understand what exactly is going on. Penalizes you for group mates' mistakes in group projects. I do my homework the night before and he gives me more credit than it was worth to begin with, though, so that's nice.",1
"Worst professor to take. She seems nice at first, but is rude. She will write nasty comments on your projects and paper so be aware. She doesn't actually teach anything for the midterm or final. You have to memorize 30 definitions when she only pics 10& then she uses things from the textbook that she doesn't even go over or explain. Learned nothing",0
"Nice professor, she rally cares about you learning finance. She goes over all the exams the class before and gives very little work outside of class.",1
She doesn't teach. She just keep talking about stuff. I have to go through the book all by myself in order to pass. Her class is boring ,0
"He is a highly educated person with good intentions. However, his classes are a waste of time. His facts and data are usually wrong.  He talks in circles and most of the time makes no sense.",0
"Pretty good professor and class. She doesn't provide much feedback when grading assignments, but other than that I have no reason not to recommend Professor Davis or her class.",1
I had him for recitation...he's so boring!  He just rambles on and on..maybe he'll be better in anthropology since it's his topic..,0
This prof made me dislike Economics... lecture is extremely boring.,0
Great dude and a great teacher.,1
"This professor is not suited to teach. He rambles on and on during class and hardly touches the VERY SPECIFIC information needed for the test. His tests consist of 10 essay questions, that are asked in the most obsure and misleading language. You will not get a good score unless you rely on only the textbook to teach you everything for this course.",0
"Professor Engelsgaard is... interesting. She likes to drag assignments out (like the class wicked question, we spent 4 weeks on it and we're behind now on the personal question). She is very nice and does care for her students. Just make sure you are on her good side.",0
"Dr. Rivas is engaging but relaxed.  He believes in student led discussions that allow for conceptual exploration and explanation of the texts.  Not the easiest course due to thick academic reading, but very thought provoking and useful for future educators, or aspiring writers.  Well worth the required reading and rhetorical response writing.",1
Professor Jarcho is fine. The TA is the worst nightmare of the class. Gives your paper the lowest grade you would ever get in any classes and doesn't explain why. TA does all the grading so be prepare to fail.,0
"A lot of information to go through, but it is very interesting. She gives excellent feedback that is useful and answers all questions. Very approachable and funny. This class was very homework heavy, but ultimately it is beneficial to your learning. Great instructor.",1
Great teacher overall explains everything with clarity and is very helpful and understanding i would advise taking her clases. only negative is she kind of looks down to students on rare occasioms.,1
The work is very easy and he explains what he expects of you for each assignment. Reading the book helps a lot. If you keep up with the work and pass the quizzes you can get an A.,1
Overall I would have to say this was one of the worst professor I have had. It is nearly impossible to get in contact with him and his instructions for the lessons/class in general are not clear at all. I would say its a fairly easy class although the way he operates makes it horrible and confusing. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take,0
AVOID!! She is boring and boring as H E L L. She is sooooo disorganized and confused about the material that she teaches in class and what appears on the test. Her expectations are unrealistic.,0
"Lectures are boring, VERY boring. He's funny. You don't have HW other than online quizzes, which don't matter that much because the tests run the grades basically. This was the only class I could not get an A in no matter how much I studied or tried. There's no curriculum, no method or comprehension. If you can memorize a lot of stuff you're good.",0
"He's a great professor. He always explains what you can do better in your drawings, and will understand if you speak to him about any problems you have. Classes are very entertaining and he fully explains what we need to do for each assignment. Dont be afraid to ask questions. He grades you based on your improvement in drawing, not how good u are.",1
"A total jerk in no other sense of the word. In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, Jeffrey required students to record themselves at home taking tests, stated himself he will fail students for typos made, and stated that if you solve a math problem in any way other than what is thought - which is very possible if you use some tutoring  fail",0
"Super cool guy! His class is super easy, if he likes you, you hardly need to show for class. As long as you do some effort you will pass with an A. He likes people who take his classes for enjoyment! super chill",1
"He is very tough, and a strict grader. He is not welcoming to the students at all. Get ready to take notes and not understand what he is talking about at all. Just study from the study guide and mark down notes that he mentioned to be on the exam and memorize how he did it.",0
"This was a horrible class and professor. She is not a good teacher, is very disorganized and is an embarrassment to the profession. I do not think her students learn anything productive.",0
"A must for anyone with any interest in the music industry (artists, you too!). Thought I knew a bit about the business and turns out I had barely scratched the surface. There is so much to be taught and Dr. Young is so knowledgable. If you truly are interested in working with music, you will get over the heavy course load and take this class.",1
"I think Joe is either a love him or hate him kind of guy. I like him but as a teacher, he wasn't super helpful. I was always confused and didn't know how to do the work. It was a pretty easy class, but his teaching style just wasn't for me and my classmate. We switched at the semester point to a different professor. He is very nice though!",0
"Awesome class! Very entertaining class taught by the godfather of mediation. Very smart professor, but we never used our textbook. Get his outline at r/lawschool. Remember to keep it tight!",1
I hated her tests. When I had her they were only 35 questions! So if you missed a couple you were screwed. The questions were bunk most of the time. The final has is cumulative but has some of the same EXACT questions as the previous exams - so make sure to look at the old tests.  She's nice but if she doesnt like you - you'll know.,1
"Never in my college career have I had a worse professor than Mooney. She does not give clear directions and when she gives outlines for tests, no matter how hard you study, its never on the test. I hope she sees this too. She spends 30-45 minutes on just one slide and rambles, so boring. AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
"Very knowledgable and charismatic with his words. Does not know the meaning of ""conceptualizing"" he does not know the art of teaching. His classes and test are all about specific details which are impractical for students.",0
He is a great professor and i would recommend him to everybody that i know! As long as you dont miss the deadlines his class is an easy A. He is very clear as to when the dead lines are and the Projects and Tests are easy as long as you listen.,1
"Sweetha has been a great biology lab TA this past semester and she really cared for her students. She would always try to make sure everyone understood the content. She was great at prepping us for the exam and I would take her again if I could. Beware of her quizzes though, they're not easy multiple choices questions. They are always short answer.",1
"I LOVE HER! Hartman was a great prof to have. She was so understanding; clear on her expectations; gave amazing feedback; gave plenty of time for projects, and assigned fun projects. Dr. Hartman is not that challenging but she does have high expectations and expects participation. I would take her for every English/Comp class if I could. 10/10 lady",1
"If you want to learn something, do not take him. There is definitely something mentally not right with him, he is constantly off topic. I went to every class, did every assignment like an idiot and got an A. Meanwhile people who never showed got an A- because it was 'easier' for him to deal with. Worst English class and experience ever.",0
"Jasmin gets a lot of hate, but he is a solid choice for Orgo. The class is not easy and his lectures are all over the place, but he is hilarious in office hours and is always available to help. Exams are hard but doing a little better than the average (just 5%) you'll be fine. The curve at the end of the semester will save your grade.",1
"Not a ""chill"" professor whatsoever. Take from that what you will.",0
Prof. Haas is a really great teacher. He explains the concepts very clearly and has clear grading criteria. By only reading from his slides and listening to his lectures you can easily score a good grade.,1
"Dr. Yamazaki is hands down one of the best professors at CSULA. She makes sure everyone understands everything. She does go through each lecture fairly quickly, recording each lecture will be helpful. Not an easy class if you've never taken a physio class. You must put in the extra effort to get an A. In class group assignments, 3 midterms&1 final.",1
"Although there were times that he had some comments that were uncalled for, I think he is a great professor. He was very nice and funny most of the time. Very easy grading and best of all, no midterms, quizzes, nor final!",1
"He is very good professor for accounting. He write everything on board. He explain everything slow, so no one stays behind. If Final exam grade are grater then all other text he will ignore the other grades. Get ready to take notes. He give study guide for exam which is a great help.",1
"In the beginning you think what a great teacher...then he grades analytical essays that he makes you do all semester. He has very opinionated views and grading system. This shouldn't be a history class, more like a essay competition class to make him jump out of his seat but that won't happen b/c he thinks everyone sucks at writing except himself.",0
"She is very clear when explaining questions in class, and cares if students are actually learning. She is helpful and when there is clearly a problem fixes it fairly for students.",1
"Best Instructor I ever had. Can't say enough good. Sometimes had class at Coffee shops, and in Uban Min. Met at them alot.",1
"Ehhh, this class was okay. Definitely not easy A. The context was interesting at times. Look on note swap for tests and quizlet for the quizzes. Stoner was a nice and credible guy but his lectures were jumpy. Being able to write good and dense one paragraph essays is key to test. Final consists of one paragraph essay and a 2-3 page essay.",1
ok,0
"She doesn't care about individuals. if you ask for help she tells you to go look it up or says ""I've already told you how to do it"". She isn't helpful at all inside or outside the class room.",0
Do NOT take his class unless you are looking to be stressed and fail. I am a hardworking student and complete all my assignments yet that doesn't seem to matter. He yells at you or makes a sarcastic remark if you ask a question even when you go to his office hours he makes you feel dumb too. Just do yourself a favor and don't take him!!,0
Jeff Rules!,1
"Learned nothing from his class. He is a terrible professor because he doesn't even try to help you learn or give any advice about careers or the industry. He's the opposite of Bryce, who actually teaches real world applications of finance. Haltiner just drones on about useless theories he copies from the text, and he's completely useless.",0
"Very intimidating. Do not even think about bringing any electronics into that class. The only good thing about that class is that he pulls his MC questions straight from the study guide. Final project was very difficult and if you get a sucky group, too bad you are stuck in it from week 1 to week 14. Very rude to students. Not a pleasure at 8am.",0
"The majority of the class is taught from PowerPoint slides and she basically just underlines the information, so you're forced to teach yourself. Her tests are unreasonable, because she kills you with multiple choice and T/F questions that are worth about 40% of the test grade and are very tricky. Avoid Her!",0
"Super passionate about the material, if you study the powerpoints for five minutes its an easy A on the exams. One project during the semester, he is very clear on what he expects. Short papers due every week, nothing deep or difficult. Attendance counts. Easy A",1
"If you have the option to take another teacher, go for it. She's unclear about what she wants due for class.",0
Such an amazing professor! Super nice and caring towards her students. Very good at explaining concepts. Make sure to take good notes from the lectures and readings for the quizzes. Only 2 main presentations that you have to give and one is a partner presentation and the other is part of the final project grade.,1
100% of your grade is based on your midterms and final but felt very unprepared for the midterm. Felt like there were a lot of trick questions that were very misleading in what was actually being asked. Very clear that many of my classmates were not too impressed with the test format and the grading. I won't be taking his classes again. ,0
One of the most sincere and approachable professors at the college. I would definitely take a course with this professor again.,1
"These German classes have been structured better than any other foreign language classes I've taken. Each night after class you have homework, but it's easy and really helps you grow your knowledge of the language. The grades for all of the assignments are fairly divided, the in person lectures are great, and the textbook is easy to understand.",1
"I took 240 online with Dodson. I do NOT agree it was an easy A, but participating in discussion boards helps A LOT. Course material as it progresses gets tougher, but Dodson is a great resource. She's available by Email or discussion boards to help. Would take her class again. I was nervous after being out of school 10+ years but she was great!",1
"He was never really organized. Last semester, he planned on covering at least 10 chapters but we ended up barely doing seven. He wasted a lot of time in class fully reviewing an example from the previous lecture or trying to get the microphone to work even though we could hear him fine without it.",0
This teacher is tough. Be prepared to learn everything on your own. She is an NP and expects you to know everything. Half of the things she teaches in class don't be on the test. She brags about herself and has a million and one life stories to tell you. If this class was not required for me to take I would of definitely dropped this class.,0
Reads from the projector many class days. Has a good speaking voice and good grammar usage. Speaks English much of the class time. Is not over bearing with work load.,1
"You may read the tags and think this class is boring. However, if you're interested in using Excel/Access (huge part of business), take this guy. There is a lot of homework, but each assignment takes about 30 minutes. The lectures are not the most interesting, but you can do a lot with what he teaches. Great teacher & knows his stuff inside and out",1
"Dr. Ptak does a great job at getting you to think about the lesson in new and interesting ways - and he's a great, approachable, and caring person too. Class was fun and engaging, and I really learned to think more carefully and analytically about my thought process. That said, I wish the class was more organized and that he graded faster.",1
"Very easy class. I had MWF at 9 AM for 50 min. The syllabus is clear. Tests at the end of each section, homework due by 9 on each test day. One short essay, pretty easy final exam. You need access to at least the online textbook to pass.  All of the lectures w/PPT are on YouTube, so when I missed a class, it was very easy to make it up.",1
"She did not believe me when I told her a test was not open for me online and proceeded to give me a 0. I believe this says a lot about her as a person, and I do not recommend you take her class.",0
"Had Lim for 4 classes, he was my only option for each. I consider him to be the worst professor I had at any point in my college career. I did not receive good feedback on questions I asked. Graded homework did not give feedback. Only benefit seemed to be that many students quit trying, while I did try, leading to me having decent grades. Terrible!",0
"An extremely nice professor, but marks very hard. I did well in the course without trying too hard only because of my previous knowledge of french. She is also very organized and meticulous, which is reflected in her marking!",1
"Class is HARD, but Dr. Dave certainly knows how to make learning English interesting and does do through comic strips and modern world examples. There's barely any homework. Just a small paper for each chapter (like 500 words), five quizzes, and the final paper. Final paper is difficult, but I would take his class again in a heartbeat. Also works with you during personal emergencies. Thanks Dr. Marlow!",1
He does not explain topics well. his lectures are no help at all I had to learn everything from the textbook even though i attended every lecture. The examples he goes through in class he uses solutions for the textbook which is not helpful at all.,0
"Very interesting lectures. Lots of outside reading, but short response papers. Lowest graded paper is dropped.",1
GREAT PROFESSOR HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM he seems like a gem of a guy,1
Learn nothing from this class! Lecture are terribly boring. He expects you to know everything! Midterm and Final are bummer. Do not take this class unless you know all the code and HTML!,0
"Very helpful, makes class easier to understand, professional at her job",1
She is very unorganized and unclear.,0
"Wished I would've passed though. I thought the class was fun. He is willing to help but his exams are difficult. Spelling counts so make sure you know what's what. His lectures are short (roughly 45 mins to an hour) but the rest of lab is your time to study. If you are unsure, make sure you ask as many questions as you need, he won't get irritated.",1
He looks like Nicholas Cage....and i hate that guy...overall this teacher is not good if you want to learn about cinema..but if you want to learn about Greg's collection of horrible movies than take this class.,0
Cares about students and funny stories,1
We weren't able to have his class face to face due to there not being enough room for social distancing. If you're not good at chemistry definitely do not take this class online. I struggled but was able to pull out a high B. 5 tests and random quizzes sometimes weekly. One chance for extra credit and its an essay.,1
Worst math class ever! Goes over material too fast. Before you get one thing done he is already starting another.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD! IF YOU HAVE TO DELAY GRADUATION TO AVOID HIM, ITS WORTH IT BECAUSE YOU WILL STRUGGLE & FAIL ANYWAY! doesn't show you how to work out a problem, just scribbles all over the board and mumbles/trails off, no structure to his lectures, gives problems on tests that you've never seen before. 90% of my class failed or go D's",0
Picks favorites. Make sure she likes you within the first few courses or she'll tear you apart. Is unnecessarily rude when giving feedback. Worst class with the worst professor ever. ,0
This class is hard for anyone that has not taken BIO. She is super sweet but her powerpoint's are too much. She gives us a study guide but its up to use to study the right material. I passed her class with a B but it wasn't easy.,0
"Whoops, accidently submitted a review for the wrong prof. (Its the one below for ACCT2302 - disregard it) For Prof. Papapavlou,her grade book consist of: LearnSmart (45%); HW (25%); Exams (5% ea. & 10% for the highest one); common assignment (5%). Drops the lowest 3 HW. Her class was SUPER EASY. Finished it in 1 wk cuz I aint trynna pay 4 Connect.",1
hes the worst teacher EVER,0
"Showed up late to almost every class, likes to hear himself talk and tends to ramble. Exams were easy as long as you studied and did the guide he gives you, show up for attendance points.",0
"Best professor I've ever had. Made learning really fun, and made me laugh a lot. I was always interested in going to class every day, plus he was an easy grader.",1
"Smart & witty, she really makes the class interesting. Her little side comments about society/loyola/students/etc. are one of the best things about this class! She makes you work hard for the grade, but in the end it's worth it. I got so much out of this class. She's great to talk to outside of class. Missing class can throw you off, so go.",1
"Disrespectful toward students in class, terrible job handling subjects like race and gender. Plus the class felt disorganized.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESOR. Class is just him reading off a powerpoint slide, very boring, and very hard not to fall asleep. Class material is easy to learn, but he makes it very difficult to enjoy it. Tough grader. And only has one perspective when grading. Tests are made up of multiple choice with some of the questions made from his opinion.",0
he's really nice! stat is kinda hard but if you try it won't be that bad,1
great with explaining difficult theories.  makes class fun and enjoyable especially when people are willing to participate in class.,1
"He cares about his students, he wants us to do well. There is quiz every week, you really need to review and do your homework. He expects you to preview the next chapter before coming to the class. He is a good educator, knowledgeable, and passionate in his field. He got frustrated when students do not study, he means well though",1
Definitely recommended professor He engage the whole class in discussion and describe the concepts very nicely. Learned a lot from his class.,1
She has no lesson plan and expects us to learn everything ourselves. She literally puts people on the spot when they are unable to say something in French and its extremely embarrassing. She's rude and is not lenient with anyone whatsoever. Im really about to not ever take French because she's the only professor who available for my schedule.,0
"Do not take this class! Hardest class ever. He expects you to memorize everything from pre-calc. Tests are the majority of the grades and are waaay harder than the homework. I'm usually great at math and I have never struggled so hard through a class at GSU, making this the first class I have ever failed. Do not recommend.",0
She is very smart but sometimes treats her students like children. She yells a lot and is constantly taking phone calls during class. She does not put up with any type of nonsense. She can be very mean and rude. She is very tough but means well.,0
I did not enjoy this class as much as I thought I would because it was an on demand class. He was spotty with when and how often he posted lectures and assignments. He kinda waited until the end of the semester to post a lot of the lectures. The quizzes are tough in my opinion but the exams are made from the quizzes.,1
"I took his online class. 2 Minor Speeches and 3 Major persuasive speeches. Quizzes every Sunday, based only on textbook and after 2 lowest grade dropped. 3 Exams based on selected chapters. The textbook was expensive and the access code is required. His lectures were based on the quiz after it is taken, which was repetitive. Overall, easy grader!",1
"Professor Galan is an extremely nice teacher. You can tell he loves his subject a lot. His class is very easy, attendance is not taken, but he gives a TON of extra credit for sign in sheets. No quizes, no hw. I would highly recommend his class!!",1
I took this class online which I was very hesitant about but I don't regret it at all!!!!! I loved the way the class was laid out and everything was very clear! Mr. Carter is very easy to get ahold of and always lets his students know when he will be out of the office. I would recommend Joe Carter to anyone!,1
Too much material for him to teach. I've never heard anyone say anything good about him. Very arrogant and impressed with himself. I am a little confused why he teaches this class since he mentioned he had a degree in engineering. He forgets about the PP behind him that goes along with his lecture and clicks through it at the very end. Avoid.,0
"This Prof. is very funny and nice. You will need to take a lot of notes, which he will grade. He gives out a lot of quizzes after like 2 chapters. However, they are NOT hard at all. Just make sure you show up to class and take notes! He does give extra credit. I really recommend taking his class.",1
"all you have to do is write papers. They dont even have to be good. You'll probably get an A on the paper, if he remembers to grade them. the lowest grade i ever got on a paper was a 92, but he forgot to grade one of my papers so it went in as incomplete and i almost couldnt have english 112. It eventually got turned into an F and i recieved a B.",0
She is an awesome professor. She is very caring. I took several COAT Classes with her. She assigns a decent amount of homework. Most of the tests were hands on projects typing.,1
"Shes an amazing professor. Therere 3 essays , a midterm and final , but they are fairly easy. She takes attendance daily and starts off by asking everyone to answer the roll call question. Her class is easy and manageable. I would really recommend her class and her as a teacher if you are a Child Development major.",1
"Professor is outstanding!!! Totally take him!!! Attendance mandatory, but you don`t want to miss a class anyway because we learned something new every class session. Very engaging, interesting, funny, smart, do your homework, ask questions if you don't understand something. He is awesome!!!",1
good teacher he defenitally gets you ready for the industry like everyone else says and correction he can make rice pilaf in 2 min. He also likes everything cooked at the last min. He can also make an omlet in 45 sec. ask him he will do it!!!!,1
"ACCENT HEAVY! I could never understand her, she was constantly asked to repeat herself due to her accent! She would also get frustrated when questions were asked about material. She is a sweet lady, but I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for a quality education.",0
She is super funny and super helpful!,1
"She was funny and knowledgeable. I learned a lot in her class. However, she could also belittle students when they asked questions and you were graded by 4 exams. The textbook was free and online (!), but very little from her lectures was on her exams. Overall good prof, but I wouldn't take her again. Her teaching style didn't work for me.",1
"makes an impossible class not so bad. however, he teaches like a flipped classroom so you do homework then learn it the next day. this class is so hard he should have just taught it normally, but go to his office hours and he will help as much as he can. this class is either something you get or you dont, so good luck",1
"If you were a musician in like high school, take this course. This course covers basic music concepts and explores musical periods. Make sure writing assignments get done as well as those exams. There is a quite bit of homework, but with planning and maybe an all nighter it's not impossible to do. DOn't be afraid! Sign up!!",1
"I really enjoyed this class. A bit repetitive at times, but she's incredibly nice and very helpful. She is willing to help you with anything she can, even issues outside of class. I later did an independent study with her and it was great. Take her class.",1
"SO many errors on her tests. EVERY test we had there were at least two questions she had to go and ""consult"" with another instructor about. She is CONSTANTLY talking about irrelevant information (her son and her ""granddog""). Over half of lecture was spent talking about her family. You don't learn in her class!",0
"VERY HARD TEACHER. He's a Great person and a very smart professor, but he's NOT a GOOD teacher at all. I felt lost throughout his lectures until i started reading the book, then everything began to make sense. Doesn't know how to get a message across and to top it off his tests are just impossible to do in 50min. Not recommended. Great guy though.",0
Cool professor very likeable,1
"This professor would pick on specific people. There was one girl in my class who she would be extremely negative towards. She would make fun of her when she wasn't in class, tell her her ideas for projects were terrible with no constructive criticism. She lacked a professional attitude and she seemed to lack compassion for her students.",0
During the class we gave a few speeches -- we did not receive any feedback and the grades were posted minutes after giving the speech (indicating there was no true thought process behind the grade). Mr. Gentry could be quite harsh with students and there were times I felt uncomfortable being in the classroom. It was an okay class but was not great,1
he lets you get to know the other students before actually teaching the stuff. the book stuff is boring but the speeches are fun. he makes it comfortable and easy to speak in front of the class,1
I had not known what to fully expect when I signed up for this class. I was glad I did. Interesting lectures. Very in-depth. Sometimes the material could be a little difficult but Dr. Lamas made time to explain. I now have a new perspective on how to approach religion and the way it is passed down from generation to generation. Cool class.,1
if you are looking to take this class in the spring or any time in your life please dont. heres why This professor at first might appear nice and warm and funny but she is far from it. the aleks program she uses has no mercy when it comes to grading. take another professor. i spent 24+ hours on one hw which is far too much when u have others,0
"Olsson had the potential to be a great teacher but unfortunately, she was not super accessible. She would not respond to emails nor the discussion board she put up for questions. Her grading is very arbitrary and often would not give feedback. I would have learned more if she cared more about her student's learning experience.",0
We all love Doc!!! Best Instructor Ever!,1
Awesome.,1
"Fair professor. Make sure you actually practice Arena in your own time though or you're screwed. Keep up with the work he assigns, or you will be lost. Nice guy though. Takes attendance.",1
"If you want to simply pass the course without hard work and don't care about good grades, this class is for you. It is easy to pass but getting a A is hard. The professor takes forever to respond to emails and the reply is short and rude. The power points and other materials covered in class are outdated. Horrible class.",0
"Never disagreed more with an art teacher's teaching style. I've had art teachers in the past that simply irk me because their strict guidelines disallowed students from truly expressing themselves through their projects, but Besemer completely discouraged me from wanting to complete her assignments bc of how particular she was abt the outcomes.",0
She is an awesome teacher and I would take her for every English class if I could.  She makes sure that you understand everything before you take that final exam.,1
"um ummmm ummm um um um.... this is all I would hear in lectures. He can sound intelligent but at the same time also sounds like he is just reading the pp. again he says um so much the class started to keep count, up into the 700s....",0
he is so inspiring with his teaching delivery. you will definitely learn and be motivated to further your course concept. this class was very difficult because it was a minimester but as long as you do your work and participate in class you will do well.,1
Prof Wallace is great! Exams are super fair and exactly like the practice exams and lecture examples. No surprises on exams and so many resources are given to help you prepare. Wallace makes this class very manageable and an easy A,1
Great teacher. Actually makes it her priority to make sure you learn the material.,1
"I would highly recommend that you choose a different professor for Comm R110. She does not respond to emails, is very unclear about what she wants and about assignments, and is insensitive to students. Im not saying that this should be an easy A, but it is a prerequisite class and she makes it 100% more difficult than it needs to be.",0
She is very nice and knows a lot about photography. I entered the class already having proficient knowledge about photography but still learned a lot and went on to take Photo II. She isn't a harsh grader and she makes her expectations clear. Happy I took this class.,1
"Ferguson is a typical old fashioned and opinionated professor, and he is definitely a character. I found the class and content interesting, and his personality contributed to that.",1
"Once you understand his sarcastic and sometimes cynical humor, he's an awesome professor, although somewhat predictable. His tests are not difficult if you just study the slides and skim the text.",1
Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm. This class was not made a priority. My advice: avoid her and this class at all costs during the rest of COVID. The only positive thing I can say is that she responds to emails.,0
Hes a really tough grader but his lectures are amazing! If youre willing to work really hard and put all your time and effort into one class then I recommend him,0
Great Teacher! He wants his students to do well and will go out of his way to help you. Really enjoyed his class. Looking forward to taking Span 2 with him next semester.,1
Fannie is a fairly new lecturer but she was very good. She was speaking clearly and adjusting quickly to the students' needs. She was receptive and helpful.,1
"Professor Conway is a good professor who is passionate about communications. I took this course online and learned a lot and I never once thought it was hard. His quizzes are ten questions each and you can use your notes, as well as on the midterm and final. He is also very understanding and nice!",1
He is a nice guy but at first he doesn't come off that way. He wants you to work hard as if it was your major. You will have to teach yourself throughout the whole course. This course is hard and you may need a tutor. If you take this class make sure you read ahead and request the power points from him via email and GOOD LUCK,0
"If you want to spend hours EFFECTIVELY learning about the Psychology of Personality, enroll in this class, buy the required textbook, and then withdraw. Tessier's attempt at teaching her online course reminded me of a dictionary that uses the word it defines as the definition, its overwhelmingly annoying and leaves you exactly where you started.",0
"This prof is terrible. He is the most horrible prof I have never ever seen before in the school. All he can do in the class is to only read PPT. Everyone can be a prof if only reads PPT. Also, he hates to answer your question. I take his morning class everyday but leart nothing. Do not take his class unless you want to fail this course.",0
My GPA went down coz of him.Not A good professor. I recommended NOT TO TAKE him. Dont ruin ur career and grades. Take Other Professors than him who can teach you hard way but then you u get something at the end. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.,0
She is not an easy grader. Her test ask random questions about half in her powerpoints half from the book. The amount of Studying I needed to do to get an A was the most I have ever needed to study. Others will study for hours and only get a C on the exams. She is not the professor just be prepared for the class I guess.,0
"Thought having an online class the professor wouldn't matter b/c you teach yourself, but I have never had a more unclear, rude, demeaning professor in my life. Unclear grading along with the worst feedback and no room to do better unless you harass her with emails asking what you did wrong and how to improve and she replies so nasty 5 days later.",0
"He is very lecture heavy, and flies through the material as if you already know it all just as good as him, which isn't the case or you wouldn't be taking this class. Not very good at explaining unless you ask him 1 on 1, which you would have to do for every question. A quiz everyday, and then a test every 3/4 weeks. You teach yourself if possible.",0
She's very unclear and doesn't give specific instructions. You have to beg her for help. ,0
"Dr. Jaime really cares & wants his students to learn the concept and enhance their skills, always responds to questions, in-person, at office, by e-mail and we had this GroupMe where he helped us a lot. One best thing he did for us was reviewing whole College Algebra and Trig. before getting into Calculus which paved the way for us to learn better.",1
"If I could describe his class with one word, ""disorganized."" His scribbling on the board was hard to read and all over, making note taking a tedious and pointless process. Difficult to follow along in class. Not much notice was given on when tests, quizzes, and worksheets were to be assigned. Unless he changes his ways, avoid him if possible.",0
terrible dont go to class the test is so easy and you dont use your lecture notes.,0
She doesn't try to work with you. She has extremely high expectations of her students. I almost feel like she's setting us up for failure. Teaches pretty quickly and hates when you have a question. She also hates repeating herself. I highly suggest you not take her class.,0
"He makes learning about A&P easier, his lectures cover pretty much everything. He is always available for office hours, and has SI 2+ days a week. He does have an accent, but I could understand everything just fine. He has always been helpful and is great at making sure you really understand the material. I would take his clas s 100 times over!",1
classes start with a quiz so watch the HW videos and take notes and dont be late,1
"I found this class really difficult personally. I studied hard and still really struggled though I typically struggle with math. The lectures only further confused me and only helped me when he would rarely go over the word problems. Homework was heavy, Tests were hard and timed to where you didn't have time to look through notes and on honor lock.",0
"Dr. Hill is a very honest teacher. He expects respect with no cell phones, which I find very helpful. He is trying to teach people how life really is and how to act respectfully. Do not show up late and do not give excuses. The class is a bit hard but if you do your studying and read your labs before the lab day then you'll do fine.",1
Chef Douglas Gahns is one of the finest Chefs I know. He is fair and very passionate about his craft. He provides great feedback when asked and make sure we understand techniques in the Culinary Industry. Awesome Instructor that deserves to be Department Chair. Displays great Teamwork.,1
I loved this teacher! She was very nice and understanding towards students. You could tell that she wanted every student to get a good grade and helped everyone to the best of her abilities.,1
"Spends half the lecture ranting about student complaints; said he gets so many complaints he doesn't care about them anymore. Doesn't teach anything; told us we ""have to learn how to Google."" Don't bother asking questions, he'll answer with ""I don't know"" or ""you have to figure it out yourself."" He'll kick you out of his office too. Disgraceful.",0
J.R Jones hates Java and but loves his students. He interacts with the students and  gets to know them. He never forgets a name and always is your friend.   Best Teacher ever,1
She was unhelpful and confusing. Her grading was nit picky. Her review of the papers of how you got the grade made no sense at all. AVOID THIS CLASS. She does not work with you and is very rude. Talks down to you alot. Not flexible at all. I could go on and on but just dont take her class!,0
"Dr. Morales is extremely knowledgeable about the subjects discussed in class. However, he is ridiculously disorganized. During class, he goes off on long tangents about obscure topics that are hard to follow. His review sheets do not help prepare you for his exams, and he is a spotty grader. Be prepared to be frustrated the entire semester.",0
Dr. King is amazing! He is one of the nicest professors around and he is very helpful. Try to take a class with him if you can.,1
"Class is not boring. Only two papers, and two written, brain-dump exams. EXTREMELY  tough grader. I was the ONLY student to get an A in his class. Extremely, extremely, extremely difficult.",1
"i dont think this class was easy. like someone said, u cant come into this class without prior knowledge. and hw assignments were very unclear and difficult, tests were hard! i dont like this class!",0
He is a great guy. his class was made up of a few short papers and one 10 pager plus a final. He gave you ten or so essays before the final from which he picked about 3. Put it this way i've taken 200 level classes than are harder than this class and it was really interesting. ,1
" If you don't log on top blackboard by her date, she will drop you. I had homework every day. Test and quizzes are online except for final. She a nice person but she is very fast and doesn't really review old material in class. Each day is a chapter. If you missed yesterdays chapter you might as well go online and learn in your own.",1
Interesting....,1
The class was great!! I learned a lot got recognized for my hard work and enjoyed sharing my opinion. Class relies on research the final project was very challenging it took up 30 pages so be ready to work hard. Class was mandatory for my program but enjoyed it.,1
Do not take this class... Professor was not good at telling students what they need and don't need to know. Wasted countless hours studying material that I would never need to know because she said we would.,0
"Dr. Falk is the nicest professor that I have dealt with, but I had a hard time learning in this class. Every day I was so confused and did not know what I was writing down. The homework dealt with topics that are not even covered until a few class periods after they are due and the exam grades are always really bad in regards to the class.",0
"Being a philosophy major, Professor Wilburn is one of the best philosophy professors I have had. His workload is completely manageable and he goes in length to explain and clarify the content. Only 2 papers and 2 exams and 1 pg weekly responses. Hes also very knowledgeable on the content matter. Would definitely recommend this class.",1
"I feel like this class is rigorous, but Miller makes it easier than others do: he is a solid choice. Only 3 students can get a solid A since it's a class of about 25 so that blows chunks. However, he is willing to work with you if it's during his office hours. That is the key to getting a decent grade in the class;meet with him and ask for feedback",1
I should have gone to this site before I signed up for this class. This professor was very difficult. He didn't explain things very well and made you feel super dumb if you didn't understand something and tried to ask questions (even though he encourages questions). I understand A&P is hard.. but he was RIDICULOUS! Threatened extra credit too much.,0
Favorite college professor thus far! She is very helpful and entertaining.,1
"The way he lectures makes what he's saying really easy to follow. He emphasizes what's important (what you should know for tests) and when he gives extra information that isn't necessary for you to know, he makes sure you know you don't need to be memorizing it, but it's always interesting, relevant stuff. Very helpful, sympathetic if you get sick.",1
"Terrible professor, avoid at all costs. She's horribly disrespectful and the class is difficult only because she gives unclear grading criteria. She uses too many group projects to avoid having to lecture. Participation points are given arbitrarily and will bring down your grade. Worst professor I've ever had.",0
Lab with Prof Stevenson is the best! She is VERY clear about what she expects you to know for the test. She goes around and quizzes you during each unit which was super helpful. She always makes sure there is extra time the week before a test to review anything you want from the lesson. Use your time wisely in her class and you will be fine.,1
"i failed the class once. but let me tell you, the first time i took the class we had masters students taking the class too. all of the exams were DIFFICULT. you still can pass but you wont be able to get the grade you r wokring for. i took the class again and didnt have any MASTERS students and the class was easy. and i got the grade i worked for. ",0
"She makes you memorize several concepts. She is not the best at explaining problems nor is she that helpful during office hours. She is not the worst choice, but is not the best.",0
"Not a nice experience, she is very unpleasant and mean even to those people working very hard. You will regret taking her classes.",0
Hard grader (very hard to get a A on anything). Teaching style is very dry and makes it hard to keep focus and learn from lectures. Troys to cram too much information into such a small amount of time.,0
"I'm a good student,so I know what I'm talking about.His power point slides are all at a mess,really boring class, homework and projects are hard yet non-related to his lecture",0
"I took her for approaches to Literature. She is mean, unless you agree with her feminist agenda. I have to give her credit though, she was on a grading committe who changed my grade, so I give her a little credit for that.",0
Decent Teacher just does not know how to present material in a understandable manner.,0
"Dry sense of humor, but the good kind. Makes it possible to get that A, but only if you deserve it. Put in the effort for this class and you should be fine. She provides you readings and has a question or two about them on her exams. Study guides are provided so use them. Loves what she does and it is pretty obvious. Overall great lecturer. ",1
TAKE HIM! He has been at Bentley for so long and he cares about every single student. He really is passionate about teaching but allowing the students to have a space to express themselves. His lessons are the most applicable to daily life. He is a rather easy grader if you use course content in the papers and if you apply yourself in class.,1
You are a really nice teacher and person in general. And you're hot. keep doin what you're doin,1
"Super great professor. He loves class discussions but you won't be penalized if you don't speak, though he may ask you a random question here and there. Take notes every class and he may grade them at the end of the semester. He is different for every class but we only had one midterm and one final with little homework. Super nice and very caring!!",1
Just really boring. Her voice is really shrill and she says the same stuff over and over. There wasn't really any structure to the class and all you need to do is read the book. ,0
"Harland is really knowledgeable. Sometimes this makes his explanations more complicated than they need to be, but he'll explain it if you ask questions. He knows what he's doing and he provides good examples in class. Harland is your best bet for this class.",1
You use wileyplus instead of blackboard. It costs extra and honestly is pretty confusing. He barely remembered to post anything on time. Honestly for as little as he did to teach us I think he should have gave us all As. Dont plan to learn anything in his class. Not good for students who do not want to teach themselves the material.,0
If you are looking for a challenge and want to become a math pro make sure this is the only class you are taking because he will throw every trick problem on the test in fact he will determine if you pass his class or not on the first test. Do not go to office hours as he is on his phone and not very helpful with feed back. Expect no mercy.,0
"An excellent instructor and a very sweet lady. She's very helpful, gives more than enough bonus points, and gives you all the material that is going to be on the exam.",1
"I HATE political science, but Dr. Swint made class very interesting and I actually enjoyed learning about the discussions.  Not quite an ""easy A"", but very manageable and you will learn a ton!",1
Dr. Corsi is a gem. He is very laid back. Just really wants students to participate in discussions. This is the easiest Writing Intensive class I've ever taken. Final paper is 4 pages. 3 other papers are two pages. That is it. 1 test is the final. I would highly recommend.,1
"Definitely does assign A LOT of reading (20+ pages per class) however, i read maybe twice and got an A. The only major grades are the midterm, final, and research paper. She gives you a list of all the terms you have to remember as well as the possible essays and its a lot to memorize but it can be done. She offers a lot of extra credit.",0
"Good teacher. Doesn't give too much feedback on the course work. Had to write a few papers, the last one being at least 8 pages of text. Will give you a 90+ on papers as long as you meet rubric requirements but wont be specific about what needs to improve. Delayed response at times but other than that the course was pretty easy to do.",1
"Prof. Durso is extremely knowledgeable and looks for details in your work - do not generalize. CITE YOUR SOURCES, no general opinions, and use .edu for sources outside of text books. Read the instructions for posting in the discussions -and follow them! Some people just weren't able to get it, and they withdrew. Overall he is an excellent professor",1
"Beato is a nice guy but also never seems prepared for lectures. He is equally as surprised with what is on the next slide as you will be. Because of that, he gives off a chaotic vibe and often teaches out of order. That is not to say that he doesn't know the content, once he remembers what he wrote, he can normally explain it pretty well.",1
He's very repetitive with notes. He also requires you to buy the textbook which is not necessary at all. We used the textbook once to do a homework assignment and that was all. He will give you review outlines for the two test and final and they clearly tell you what you need to know. Do not miss a single class.,1
"Worst teacher ever!!! Tough greater, doesnt even teach but expects you to know everything and she will report you if you forget to cite anything. Shes absolutely terrible this lady should be fired, not a teacher at all!",0
"Majority of your grade is made of quizzes. She is very sweet, sometimes all over the place but knows what material to cover for class. She changed the dates of the quiz many times, which was a bit annoying. Go to class to learn what will be quizzed. Some quizzes where not reflective of what she said the style would be for the quiz.",1
"Quite honestly the worst professor Ive had in a while. She was almost completely absent from the course the entire semester. Never answered emails in a timely manner, doesnt respond to student questions online, never made assignments available in time for when we were to do them. Complete lack of attention from professor. Do not recommend.",0
"Sammons knows a lot about San Francisco. Crazy to see how much of his lectures are given on the spot, mainly ad-libbed, in monotone. No power-points or anything to go off of which makes it difficult to differentiate between what needs to be known for tests and what are just ""fun facts"". Pretty chill class overall but the tests take you by surprise.",1
"This class by far the worst class I have taken at Troy. There is no study guide and the information on the test is confusing. The instructor really does not take time out to help you in the course, my advice choose another instructor.",0
Make sure you go everyday although she doesn't take attendance. Not an easy class but you'll learn a lot.,1
"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",0
Would never take class with this professor again. He does not care about his students. Told me in front of my face i never tried. Doesnt care about you. Very hard teacher. I have heard he is a bad teacher for intro courses what i took but better at high end classes. He just doesnt understand how kids do not understand math. Not recommended by me :(,0
"Online Class While I've had harder classes, I've never had a more useless teacher. He does nothing to contribute to the class and gives zero feedback on the assignments. If you state your opinion in the discussion board, you get an F for that week. If you feel like self teaching, go for it. Otherwise avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
On god this is literally the worse professor I have ever had. When I tell you do not take this class you better listen. She is so picky on her grading and everything she will not give you credit for some small stuff. The grading is not in your favor if you mess up on part its over for you and the semester. If you get caught lackin on GOD it's OVER,0
"The WORST professor I have ever had the unfortunate chance of knowing. She is terrible with directions, does not thoroughly read through submitted assignments & then deducts points because of her terrible reading skills, and takes 5+ days to get back to you on any questions you may have. She also gives you 40 minutes to complete a 60 question exam.",0
Your review is graded at the same time as your test so go over your review with a tutor to make sure you have something correct to look at for your test. Tests and reviews are only graded by percentage you will not know what you got wrong unless you specifically talk to teacher.,0
Horrible teacher she doesn't explain at all she expects you to know everything she give a lot of homework and she grades super hard DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!,0
"Tough grader, not helpful at all. Class moves very fast pace. Unless you are already familiar with accounting do not take this class. She expects you to know what you did wrong.  I think she has been teaching to so long she forgets some people are new to the accounting field.",0
Such a great director. Definitely recommend joining her team. Live changing and bonds that cannot be broken.,0
Bad really bad,0
He is a great professor and really makes your use your critical thinking skills. Do not take him if you just an an easy A.,1
She was unfair at grading and made the class a living hell.  I now HATE animation class and never want her as a teacher again.  Worse time of my life.  She is good but expects too much from you and the grading is unfair and bias.,0
I really like Dr. Lorimer. She knows her stuff and encourages people to participate. I liked reading the sources from history and using the iClicker/REEF to earn participation points. There were a lot of assignments to help people who dont do well on tests. I would take her class again!,1
"Terrible teacher. She barely speaks English yet is not a language proff. I couldn't understand her and all she does is read off slides and say ""were going to talk about"" then never explains it. Worst proff I've ever had by far. Wouldn't recommend her classes to anyone.",0
"He doesn't ever stay on topic, he is late to class and he keeps you over the time alloted. His opinions are never backed up an if you dont agree with him your mark suffers.",0
REALLLLY easy class. The teacher gave off a weird vibe like she didnt really want to help me but she answered all of my questions and was perfectly fine. I didnt use the textbook and BARELY made an effort and I got an A,1
"Gentil, beaucoup d'expérience mais passe trop de temps a nous compter des histoires. Apres ca il défile la matière en 10 minutes et tu dois lire le manuel pour comprendre. si tu fais les exercices tu devrais bien réussir l'exam. Qqun qui a deja fait de la compta ne devrait pas avoir trop de difficulté. Il refuse de repondre aux ques. pr la simul.",0
The Best. Period. He makes a subject that to most people would be dreadful very fun! He lightens up the mood with jokes and goes over exactly what will be on the test. He provides study materials and hints. I definitely recommend Baumgartner. He will keep you interested throughout the entire 2 hours.,1
"She can seem a little intimidating at first, but that's just because she knows the material so well. She's friendly and approachable. I would have liked to have study guides for the first three exams, but if you show up and listen to the lectures/take good notes/study, you will do fine. She will go out of her way to help you if you are trying.",1
"Professor Ruder can be boring if you don't pay attention, but is actually a great teacher if you listen even 10%. Class is very easy (He literally codes your homework on the projector in class) as long as you follow along. Knows alot about coding and if you ask more questions he is always happy to help.",1
"One of my favorite courses that I have ever taken, and I am normally not the kind of guy who likes literature based classes! Dr. Osborne is awesome in leading discussion, and makes sure everyone is engaged. I highly recommend!",1
He doesn't excuse being sick even if you have a note. Almost never uses chalkboard. You do homework online and its very disorganized. I had to contact Dr. Baretta for specific webpage as the prof required it but had no idea how to assist us.  He is not helpful and is never at his office during office hours. It's pathetic. Good luck if you take him.,0
agree great prof.,1
He does not teach well,0
Great professor who is well qualified. Very informative class and I am glad I took it although my passion does not lie in accounting.,1
"She is a terrible teacher for physiology. She was forced to give everyone curves because her tests were always terrible. She goes way too fast, cannot explain anything, but she does try to be nice. Her grading is just....bad...half of the time she doesn't even know what she marked you off for. Avoid her at all costs!",0
"He hand writing stinks, but he's an interesting guy who knows his stuff. studied at berkeley. grades were based on 2, 4 page papers and 2 essay style tests. i liked the books used in this class. come to class and do the work you should get an A. lots of in class assignments. TAKE THIS ONE",1
"Her class is tough, but she is very sweet, not to mention very funny! I thing there isn't enough time to completely retain the material but I don't think that's her fault, but how the class is set up as in time. Definitely need the book, and will probably have homework on a daily basis most of the time",1
Takes away participation points for texting your mom during class. Doesn't ever give reasons for why she gives you the score you get. Inconsistent grader. Please don't take this professor pls.,0
Debbie is my home girl and an excellent facilitator,1
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
"ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY! Even if you have a valid excuse he wont let you make up anything, youll get a 0. He covers material very quickly & does not respond to emails. I went to his office hours once & he was almost an hour late!  Hes very rude & belittling about everything. Definently easier/ better professors out there!",1
She gives a lot of hw and grades VERY hard. Her tests are also very difficult. She cant teach very well in my opinion. She usually rambles a lot and teaches as if you are supposed to know the material. Also i feel that shes somehow passive aggressive. If you take the class just be ready to teach yourself because shes really no help.,0
"Please Guys, He is bad bad so bad professor DO NOT TAKE HIM  HE IS THE WORSE PROFESSOR EVER. he can be nice may be smart but doesn't know how to teach and thinks that everybody should know a lot about chemistry before you get to this class out of 17 students 9 dropped the class and the rest he didn't want to sing the W/ form. Else nobody would stay",0
"One of the best professors I ever had. Class material is tough, but he is very helpful if you go to his office and chat with him. I can't think of a reason not to go to his class.",1
Outrageous expectations for students in an INTRO(!!!!!) to ASL course. Will not slow down to help students who have trouble. Syllabus full of threats...serious attitude problem.,0
"Worst professor at QC. NOT accessible outside of class, she doesn't answer emails. Disorganized, opens the submission link weeks after assignments are due. Boring, we read straight out of the textbooks during class discussions even though reading the textbook was our homework. She will call on you and make you feel dumb if you don't know the answer",0
"He is simply one of the best professors in this school if not the best. He hardly ever use the book. He talks a lot about the real world application of accounting. By paying close attention to his class,you'll easily understand account and there is no need for those extra readings after class. He is very straight-forward on final. TAKE HIS CLASS.",1
Terrible teacher. I suggest you drive up to another school to take this class. He never replies to any of my issues that occur learning th information. The teacher is making me think about switching my major cause I dont know what i am learning. If you are a person that can only learn through a teacher I suggest to find diff. teacher. bad teacher,0
"This isn't my hardest class but I'm failing it. I suck at math and I know it, yet I can do molar conversions in chemistry and have a difficult time understanding stats. She sucks at this. Don't take her unless you like teaching yourself. Never gives any study guides for exams and there's a quiz every week. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL FAIL!!!!!!!",0
"She's super sweet, and even gives the class a few laughs each lecture. Lectures are long, take a LOT of notes. Tests are the majority of your grade and can be extremely hard, especially if you do not study days before. Overall, she is great at teaching.",1
"Prof. Barnes was a very horrible professor. She constantly goes off topic while teaching and you will learn absolutely nothing. She grades speaches extremely hard and leaves rude comments along with the grades. I took her class after reading all of these good comments. However, it was a huge mistake. I will finish with and A but shes still horrible",0
"Her classes are extremely boring.  Although she does let you copy her slide shows from her website, you still have to show up for class... and all she does is read the slide show to you.  And she cant dress appropriately (stomach hanging out) but tells you to dress for your mentor teacher. I dont quite understand that. And group work? come on!",0
"He goes very fast and it is hard to follow along. The practice problems will help you keep up, so do them. He ends up curving the entire class at the end, so if you are not happy with your grade don't worry because it will go up.",0
"I took his online class and it was BRUTAL. I took econ because I like econ and understand econ, and this class made me feel like I understood NOTHING. I read the books & felt like I understood everything, and then when I went into the exam I was lost. I don't even know what I got wrong on the exams! I would NOT take a class from Ross ever again.",0
"She's a tough grader, which is bad enough considering she doesn't teach class online. It's basically do it yourself. The deadline is at 10 instead of 11:59pm like the other classes. She's very strict about turning assignments in on time even if you have valid excuse as to why you couldn't turn it in. If you take this class, be prepared.",0
You really should take lab with this guy! One of the funniest professors I've ever had. Half the time you don't even do the lab and he grades you on TAKE HOME tests! You rarely stay over an hour and a half!,1
Professor May knows his stuff. I really benefited from his knowledge. I would recommended his class.,1
"By far one of the worst teachers I've had I'm currently in her class, and it's extremely difficult, gives very little information in lectures, and gives you labs that hardly have any information, her test are also difficult as they are explaining rather than multiple-choice questions like every test, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"We only have one month left in the semester, and I have received one grade back. Attendance is mandatory, but nothing is done in class. Tons of homework. 0/10",0
"Very smart and interesting professor! Class can be a bit boring, and it is hard to know what she is looking for on papers if you aren't too familiar with art history papers. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you will get thrown off if you miss. Ok class, but i wouldn't reccommend it if you are a non-major.",1
Very good explanations on such difficult topics.,1
"The content of this class is fine but his grading system is simply awful. It's far too easy to pass but far too difficult to get an A. With surprise test questions, sporadically dispersed (yet heavily weighted)  iclicker questions, and no extra credit I was the only one to actually achieve the score for an A (95) in nearly 250 students. Ridiculous.",0
The best Psych teacher on campus hands down. I learned so much with out even knowing it!,1
"Worst professor alive. His practice tests make you complacent for the real test. Also, he grades on grammar over correctness. I felt like I was taking an English class not a Biology class. Take Ecology online!",0
"There was one quiz, a paper, a mid-term and a final, so overall, not a lot of work, but your grade rests on only these things. Hard to pay attention because she is barely audible. I would have been more inspired/ learned more with another professor.",0
"Debra Curtis is the best professor I've had at Salve. She's passionate about what she's teaching and makes lectures funny and interesting. However you MUST read the book, tests are difficult and all from the book, not lectures. She does provide multiple extra credit opportunities. One essay that she grades relatively easy on. Take her if you can!",1
"Me and all my classmates loved taking Paula's class. She is an amazing woman who really cares about her students. She can tell when you're taking advantage of her kindness though. Made public speaking super easy, and made us all feel comfortable. Gives great feedback and explains assignments in a very clear way.",1
"Took this class online- Pretty easy...you have to do the work- Discussions all the time, quizzez, & tests just about weekly. Just do the work, i got an A.",1
"Mike is my favorite prof so far at the UW. His grading is very lenient with re-submissions, which saved me in some instances. He is very helpful during office hours and on slack as well. This course content is difficult especially if you are new to coding, but with hard work a high score is possible.",1
"This teacher is the absolute worst teacher I've ever had. She's incredibly unclear and confusing. The more she tries to explain, the more confusing it becomes. It's clear she doesn't know what she's doing. The homework is on way too many different websites and never seems to have anything to do with what we're learning. Exams are very difficult.",0
English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand. Very Disorganized. He forgets to teach the tricks in his trick questions. Would never take him again. Avoid like the plague.,0
"Excellent for 108. NOT for 201.  I was 2% away from passing and I only missed one class AND did tutoring, and she didn't care.  Only cares about smart students or those in front row. Rude outside of class. She got corrected EVERY class period.  not a good teacher for 201",0
She is an awesome insturctor.  I had her last semester and received an A.  I worked hard for it but she made math fun.  This semester I have a terrible Math teacher and I wish I would have dropped it already.  I wish all teachers were like her.,1
"Easy class, talks alot just rambles on and on, hard to follow at times. No rules, which is nice as you can basically get a good grade by doing extra credit. Over all just ok.",1
She was a difficult teacher to have. Don't plan on taking her class if you don't want to spend all weekend long on homework. I'm not kidding. If you are really good at accounting then it would probably take less time. The homework is online and difficult to understand.,0
"Im really surprised at how low her rates are. Out of all the professors I've had she was one of the most inspiring. Unconventional, yes, but I learned a lot from her. I think being challenged to learn in different ways and to trust the process is important, and nobody does this better than her. If you let her, she'll change the way see the world.",1
"best professor ever!!! excellent knowledge about he is teaching, many years of experiences :)",1
"I had her for lab. She is overly difficult. Her grading is INSANE. She is sometimes a bit rude to students; she is definitely not a professor who would say ""There's no such thing as a stupid question."" She at least has a good sense of humor. I would avoid taking her if possible.",0
"Dr. Vohs is a great professor. His lessons are clear, to the point and prepare students for his tests. Don't expect to just slide by without doing any work, but if you so much as show up for class and pay attention the class will not be too much of a struggle. Tests are cumulative.",1
"Harsh, unapproachable, avoid taking her classes.",0
"I thought he was boring and sometimes difficult to understand, but his class wasn't unbearable.  I took Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, so he only taught for a few weeks.  I wouldn't take another class with him.",0
She''s rude. You have to beg for assistance which she will cut you off for asking. She is scatterbrained and never organized. I dread this class every day because she is just not a good teacher and she drives me insane. ,0
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
"Honestly he made this class bearable and enjoyable. I tried 3013 once before, had to drop it, then took it over the summer with Alek. He's passionate, intelligent, and genuinely wants to see us do well. His lectures aren't boring, and he's very helpful in and outside of the classroom! Don't skip out on taking his class!",1
"She doesn't give ANY quizzes, midterms or finals but do expect for that to be made up for in homework. The readings are a tad heavy and there is a lot of reading questions involved per reading but I would take that I heart beat over a quiz in this class! She is so so willing to help. You can text her or call her anytime.",1
Very thorough and very fast paced class. Take good notes and the class is easy. Very approachable professor and helpful. He is definitely has his opinions and shares them with his reasoning to his conclusions. Found him very interesting and left me with new perspectives on the influences of historical events. Highly recommend.,1
Ms. White was a good teacher and really knew how to make the learning environment fun. The only issue for me is there was only 3 exams and that was your grade. Personally Im not a big fan of that style of grading. Other than that she is a great teacher. ,1
"Heather is really kind and cares about her students. I was not looking forward to public speaking, but taught different techniques to help with nerves, and it made it a lot less stressful. I would actually call this class fun! There was lots of creativity allowed for speeches. Impromtu speeches were my favorite. Take her class!",1
She would be a great 4th grade teacher with all of her petty nitpicky rules.Chastising grown adults is totally inappropriate for a 400 level college class.She gets really madd when people arrive late and are on laptops.She does not post her powerpoint lectures so you should be there for every class.She is knowledgable about the subject matter.,0
B-O-R-I-N-G !!! Impossible to stay awake in his class... he surely is a nice and intelligent teacher but there is no structure in the course. You can definitely stay at home all semester and just read his power point online...,0
"This was my third time have Professor Williams. I knew what to expect in his class. SF 341 was my favorite class. I recommend it. You learn about Airport Management, Airport Security, Airport Safety, Airport Inspections, How to run the Airport, and most importantly keep the Airport Safe. If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",1
The homework itself is easy even though theres a lot. Just pay attention to due dates. Also quizlet has basically all the answers. Final and tests are online and not in lockdown browser. Easy A. The assignments that she grades can be biased however if your opinion doesnt match hers. She gave me a B on a writing assignment that shouldve been an A,1
"I would not take her again. Her ""lectures"" were just typed out(not formatted) on D2L. They were hard to read and practically useless. She had a discussion post required every wk, but she never commented on any. You did it, you got graded. If you want an easy A, this class is for you. If you want to learn something, take a diff. teacher.",0
Really interesting class to take. You will learn a lot. He is very humurous and that makes the class more enjoyable,1
Profesor McCarthy is a very nice but I would not recommend taking her class! She is an extremely tough grader and will not give out an A. I am an A student and I got a C on my first paper. She allows you to correct your paper which is helpful. You are given 3 papers but she just expects way too much. Assignments are unclear.,0
"She was excellent with everyone in class, no matter your writing skill.  She could have been clearer about how to revise or about the genre.  Overall, a pleasant class and she was concerned about your own perspective and writing improvement.",1
I've done very well in Spanish in the past and I didn't pass this class. Tests were massive and very specific she takes points off like mad. You have daily homework and the quizzes are with a big chunk of the grade. She moved super quickly through the material. Do not recommend,0
"Great guy, very helpful. HARD CLASS and HARD TESTS! GPA KILLER!",1
She sucks a lot. Do not take this class she cannot teach and is confusing. Be careful as she expects u to write like u were in college for years.,0
"Hope and pray you don't get her for you senior internship LYHS friends. Communication is SO low, and I had to do ANOTHER senior project because she didn't think me getting a 3,000$ grant for my site was ""good enough,"" even though I was the only one who worked on it. I'm looking forward to May 11th so I never have to see her ever again.",0
don't take her. she has people do the most ridiculous assignments. nice lady but very hard grader. also holds grudges,0
"Dr. Harris is very passionate about what she does. I like her style of teaching, take notes because she won't give you her power points. You have to work hard but it is worth it! Exams are critical thinking style so you have to study. Keying is hard but you get better. Cool as a person and gives you chances to recover points. ",1
I loved him. He made everything so easy to understand. Plus he's cute,1
His resources for success are not helpful and are outdated. Way too many things to navigate throughout the website. Feedback from work arent helpful. Prof responds emails in a long time. The online meetings have nothing to do with what were learning. The criteria and rubrics he left for us to work on for assignments are not resourceful or helpful,0
"Found this class very refreshing in that it was mostly composed of reading the text book and then answering questions on it. No extra fat in this class, 2 group forums per semester, 3 Exams each covering a third of the classwork. Very straightforward would definitely recommend.",1
Excellent professor. Lectures are always fun and interesting. Attending lecture is not enough to do well in the class; you must read the textbook too. Also he is very reasonable when it comes to grading papers.,1
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
Prof. Cutler had done nothing to help her class. half the people dropped out after the first exam and lies about what will be on quizzes. She does an awful job at explain questions that students have. It seems as though she is setting her students up for failure. I would NOT take this ever again with her.,0
"I was completely lost.  Tests did not accurately reflect the homework.  You had to really understand the concepts (and I did not).  Tests were open notes/book, but it really didn't do much good.  I got a B because I randomly did well on one test, but I didn't learn anything.  My grade was pure luck.  Most of the dept. sucks so I guess he's alright.",0
"Professor Walker is a great teacher! This class can be tough but if you ask for help, she will help you and show you examples until you understand better. Her tests are tough but she goes over similar problems days before you take the test. Just practice and practice those examples and you will be fine. Take her class if you want a good challenge.",1
She makes learning a foreign language fun & interesting. I learned so much from her class through her teaching & study abroad experiences. I took an extra semester of Spanish just because she was the professor. She is AWESOME!!!!!!!,1
Stats was hard because it's time-consuming.  Prof reyes is the best! i took all my math classes with her. She makes lecture so clear and understandable. You just need to take good notes. I would recommend everyone to take her for stats. Her study guides helps you a lot because you know what to expect on the test. seriously she is the best!,1
"AJ is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She knows everything there is to know about ASL and the Deaf community. We got off topic in class a lot, but it always came back to signing. She also gives plenty of extra credit opportunities if you need it. It's very easy to get an A, as long as you pay attention in class.",1
"What he was looking for in a paper is never immediately clear. I would turn in three essay drafts (2 more than required) trying to get them to his liking and he was never satisfied with them. The class structure was unorganized, but he says some pretty entertaining things. Would not recommend this class if you can take another elective.",1
"If Dave switched to teaching underwater basket weaving, then I'd want to change my major to underwater basket weaving. ",1
"Overall this instructor SHOULD NOT be teaching ANY  online classes. She will blame everything on the student, and will not accept any of the responsibility. She is also unwilling to assist a student that requests any type of help from her. Taking a class with her is the same as lowering your standards of learning. She is uncaring.",0
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
"Dr. Pasquesi is a phenomenal English Teacher! It was a true pleasure to be a part of her class. If I had to describe her in one word, that one word would be ""Educator."" Most professors focus on the curriculum and syllabus. Dr. Pasquesi has a high focus on the development and progress of each individual in her classroom.",1
"Jana was awesome!! I took her class on social issues and social justice. She does a wonderful job at presenting both sides of an argument which helps us think for ourselves. Headed on only 4 things, but its ok. She gives plenty of opportunity to succeed:):):)",1
"Erika was one of the worst professors I ever had. She's very rude and only lectures. She showed us really boring movies also and I wanted to fall asleep every day in there. I enjoy history and anthropology, but this class made me question that. Also, the readings were so long and hard to do. Please don't take her class.",0
"This was an online class. She is NOT organized at all. When she makes assignments, there are several different portions to the assignment, and they are all in DIFFERENT places within Blackboard. Tedious, lengthy readings. Instructions are NEVER clear. Save yourself the frustration, don't do it.",0
Dr. Bryce is the gem of the department. She knows her stuff and has a nice teaching style and I learnt a lot. It was a hard class but worth it to get some real skills from class and then get my job .,1
Hes courses are very easy. He cares about his work and students.,1
"Love love love her! Go to class, take down notes (she won't post all the powerpoints to her content section), and complete the test study guides to pass. She's very energetic and is great at getting her point across. I will be taking another (and hopefully more) class with her next semester.",1
"He is a terrible prof.  He may know the subject well but portraying it to students with very little mathematical background in the manor he did was horrible.  He has no control over the class, his accent is very thick, his exams are very hard which are multiple choice with no feedback.  The hw is online which makes it difficult to learn.",0
"Mr. Goodyear is an excellent teacher with great values.  Very interested in his students success, is very helpful during and after class.  Very well spoken, relatable,and humorous. He is a great teacher!",1
"Katey is super nice! The class was incredibly doable and chill, but I didn't feel like I learned a whole lot. No lecture class, but we met for a live chat talk every few weeks. Final project is a bit of a hassle compared to the rest of the course, but she gives a fair amount of extra credit. This is the perfect class to take in a busy semester!",1
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM! Can't understand him, and makes you feel bad for asking questions. Homework takes hours and is extremely hard. I wasted money and withdrew cause I couldn't stand it anymore.",0
This professor needs to take responsibility and quit teaching at CSULA. No student should suffer with their grade and learning because of this guy.  Albert didn't  grade anything until finals week and doesn't bother to reply to student emails.  Midterm and Final was 10x harder than the homeworks and made students suffer. 1/10 worst  professor ever.,0
He has a discord with the professor in it with TA's which makes life a bit easier. His lectures are well organized and always enjoyable. The programming assignments are almost never boring and not labor intensive. A great class with great energy.,1
"An absolute DULLARD, 0 lecturing ability: why are you a Professor? You ruin an interesting topic. Unbelievable",0
"Took her for spanish fourth semester and the class itself is pretty repetitve and boring, but shes a good teacher and tries to make the class interesting. Pretty Easy to get a good grade if you follow instructions and participate. Homework isn't that bad. The only complaint would be that she doesn't really help you prepare for tests.",1
He does not really care about hi students and he is not very specific. He goes through things too fast. He takes too many points off of lab and it was a struggle to get good grades on labs. I would have to go to another professor to get good grades on the labs.,0
Morales-Ortiz constantly returned graded papers (needed for exams) back VERY late or not at all. He would often be caught playing video games in his office instead of working. He was clearly unable to convey much of the taught material at all to much of our class. His lectures consisted of disjointed rambling which themselves were very confused.,0
"She is strict when it comes to grading. Syllabus was confusing, had to buy a whole textbook for an online code. Didnt use the physical textbook at all. Didnt really like the online program, either.",1
"Don't waste your money or time, unless you can  teach yourself or have help at home. He doesn't answer your questions when being asked. The only thing I did like is that the test were the same as the  homework.",0
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
"5 papers, the grade she gives you is random but never lower than a B. She says the textbook matters but it doesn't, not worth the price. Class time isn't anything special so easy to skip. She is very flexible on due dates. Very nice lady, not a great teacher.",1
"I loved her class! You can tell she's really passionate about teaching, and there's never a boring class. She's honestly one of the nicest teachers I've ever met, and she tells you what's going to be on the quizzes and tests. Just make sure you practice and study!",1
"Class was extremely difficult. Attendance is not mandatory and really does not help much other than that he might touch on a couple of conceptual points that may or may not help. Most of the learning needs to be done solving the book problems (Do as many as possible, not just assigned ones). He curves a lot but still easy to fail. Tough subject.",0
"Dr. Bulinski is clearly passionate about her work and gives clear, easy to follow lectures. She supplies the textbook (which is more of a workbook) and her exams, though sometimes lengthy, aren't extremely difficult if you study and pay attention. Take notes and ask questions; engagement makes the class even better.",1
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
"good prof. watch his lectures read the textbook and youll pass, quizes are shortly times so you will have to work fast!! the rest was pretty solid .",1
"If you completely understand something, you will be confused once she explains it. She never finishes a thought, and is completely unclear. She is not too tough in the grading though, but get ready to teach yourself. ",0
"She gets confused more than a Math Teacher should. She's had to correct my quiz grade numerous times and I don't know why. She'll grade it a 4/10, ask her why I got that grade, and she'll correct it to a 9/10, which really urks me. I'm glad I already know what I'm doing without her teaching me.",0
Lectures are pointless but you have to go because of pop quizzes. If you arent already experienced with computers or programming prepare to teach yourself. The class itself isnt that difficult but he assumes you have prior knowledge. Very bad lectures.,0
"Was really hard in the beginning, and slowly start to not care? He let the students teach each other which isnt exactly helpful to every? but not really lecture like. The class seemed like a high school class...",0
"Mr. lopez is prob the most realest , most chill instructor your gonna find in the criminal justice department in lbcc. (clough is number 2). no book is require,  loves to answer questions. you have a topic you have to do in which he allows you to pick.  Any classes he teachs take the class and dont think on it.",1
"Rammaha is an actual genius and for that reason, he shouldn't be teaching classes as basic as Calc II. I was fooled into taking the Honors section (DON'T) and as a result, he had high expectations; I used YouTube to study for the majority of the class because my notes made no sense from his lectures. I've never struggled with math until I had him.",0
I enjoyed her class. Very informative. She is abrasive but was very nice when I would ask questions... Be sure to follow her directions and STUDYING IS A MUST. Good luck,1
"She's really great. Her lectures are always very interesting and entertaining. Plus, she's always very excited about helping students who are struggling and speaking with you about your ideas. Plus, she REALLY knows her field. I would definitely recommend her. ",1
"Dr. Fetter is the man. He genuinely cares about all of his students, and wants them to succeed. He is always willing to help if you need it, and makes so many tools for you to understand stats. I'm not a math person but I had a B/A the entire semester.",1
"Has a great personality. Wants his students to do well, wants student to participate in lecture. Makes sure everyone understands the information and is available for help outside the classroom. Tests require memorization and final is cumulative. Easy A, would not take economics with anyone else.",1
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
Professor Wiley is a awesome teacher but makes you work for your grade.,1
"to many writing assignments, you should be able to read up to 10 chapters a day because he makes you read like crazy and its too much stress especially if you have a job, hardly any tests in that class, its too much freaking work for a class that you'll never need in life!!!!!",0
"This guy is great! i absolutely hate history but he makes it fun! you need to pay attention and take notes, or you won't do well on tests",1
"Grades differently than the provided rubric, expects assignments that are not on the syllabus, is extremely disorganized, grades according to her personal opinion, and gives absolutely no exceptions for any assignments missed or any missed classes. I didn't learn anything from this class, if you want to pass, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!",0
"Honestly, one of the worst professors i have taken at UCF. She has such a sassy attitude with people its ridiculous... Waking up at 7:30 to sit through her lectures, which mind you last 3 hours is not an example of a good teacher, especially when they teach us that lecturing in front of a group of children is not the most effective method.",0
"I attended every lecture and took notes, but pretty much taught myself everything. It was difficult because the professor was not clear nor helpful. To be honest, he didn't seem that enthusiastic about teaching nor did he show genuine care for his students. If I could retake the class, I would choose a different professor.",0
"Really cool prof. Fun to take Bus Strat with. Has very generous curves on his tests, which is nice. He uses lots of relevant examples to connect lecture material to the real world. Doesn't require attendance but it would be hard to get a good grade in the class without it.",1
Dr. Lin is one of the sweetest professors I have ever had. I always felt comfortable in her class and enjoyed coming. It can be a tough subject but Dr. Lin always makes sure everyone is on the same page. I can't say enough good things about her. I wish I could take all my classes with her.,1
"Nancy rocks. She seems unapproachable at first but she isn't. She knows her stuff. This class is all lecture, but she's clear and makes it interesting. Sometimes she's monotone, but she has a sense of humor. I highly recommend her.",1
"Jim is honestly one of the only professors in the department that I have had that I feel like knows about the field. I learned more in his class than most of my others combined. He is also one of the most caring individuals I've ever met. His tests are very hard, and he gives a lot of homework. Do your work and youll pass.",1
"Diane is extremely helpful! Very rarely do you find a professor who WANTS everyone to pass her class. The material can be extremely difficult but with the extra credit she gives you, your certain to get an A. Do not procrastinate to ask questions or do the homework, can take hours to complete. Even though its tedious work, I love her!",1
"She is probably a decent professor in person, but on D2L shes a nightmare. She doesnt do redos, she is difficult to communicate with, and at times her rubrics are unclear. If youre even unfortunate enough to take her class online, ask lots of questions and be as thorough as possible with your work.",0
"The Test are hard in the beginning but as you go along they'll become easier. In order to pass you will have to study, you will learn in his class. He has good lectures and he's caring. All around he's solid",1
Not the best professor. if you don't have the same opinion be prepared not to do well on tests.,0
The class was overall easy do to the fact that the test review she gives before each test were a carbon copy of the test with just different number/variables. Homework was also easy but it can take lots of time to do. She came to class late numerous times and at time it seems like she didnt really care. Her teaching was also confusing most times.,0
"Dr. Mark grades you off of her personal feelings and will not clarify when you ask for reasonings as to why your grade is so low. She is a very boring lecturer and does not respect students when grades are late or if there's a family emergency. She also grades your participation on how she feels you did in class, her personal opinion of you.",0
"Mr. Jackson is a great instructor. He explains and goes over many math problem examples, that students request when they don't understand a homework or lecture. Very patient and gives extra credit,if, you complete a practice test. He will give partial credit in on a test question if it seems reasonable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM !!!",1
"a great instructor, remember her stories, they show up again",1
"hated her, UNCLEAR, pulls questions on tests out of her you know what. RUN the other way!!!!",0
"I definetely recommend taking any Calculus classes with Adam! He makes the topics very clear and tells you what you need to know. He also goes over lots of examples and the homework is relevatn to quizzes, practice exams, and the exams.",1
"I took the class in person using the ALEKS program. Attendance was a large portion of your grade despite ALEKS being all online. She was also almost always late, and did not teach just answered questions. Nice enough lady, a little awkward but didnt teach much.",0
"Two things wrong.  1) Her lectures are confusing. They are not well connected and the slides are not made available to students. 2) She is very rude. She asks questions of students in class and then cuts off their answers. She occasionally commands students to stand up and move about the classroom, as if to show she is in charge.",0
"He's a good teacher because he makes himself available, but DO NOT take his remote class, do the online class instead. In his lectures, he repeats himself over and over and uses the whole lecture time to tell students stuff they learned in the 1st class. He doesn't actually teach anything in the remote lectures.",1
"I have her now and I want out. She's nasty with her students and gives a tremendous amount of ""busy work"". She then lectures you on the content you have already read.",0
"nice lady, but if you care about your GPA id avoid taking this class with her at all costs! shes very unorganized & there is almost 2 weeks of class left & shes only posted one grade plus attendance. she is also picky at grading so its unfair for us to know what to work on to get a better grade when she doesnt give us anything to compare to.",0
Kelm really doesn't care if you pass or not all of his lectures are done through online videos and he does not teach in class. He simply goes over questions that students have. He assigns a ton of homework so I recommend only taking him if this class is your main focus.,0
Very good at explaining things. I'd recommend her if you aren't good at math (I'm not),1
"My man Dr. Hazell was the best professor I've ever met. His tests stem DIRECTLY from his stunning and electrifying lectures! I'm not that much of a history gal, but he made it so interesting and made me actually want to come to class. There is no homework other than reviewing notes, and there's only one paper! Amazing professor 10/10.",1
"Prof Kim is an amazing lecturer! As long as you show up and take notes, and keep up with the readings you should do fine. His exams are very fair, no trick questions. The essays are not bad at all, especially with the TAs and Prof Kim being so willing to help. Would definitely recommend taking ASA with him!",1
"Dr. Sewell is a horrible professor and does not listen to his students. He is all about him and the school does nothing about it. He allows subpar material, then assigns tasks in which students spend more time figuring out what the actual tasks are than what they spend on the assignment. I would not recommend anyone taking courses under him.",0
"Mrs. Vasquez is an outstanding teacher. I learned a lot from listening to her lectures. Her teaching style is based on power point lectures and great points of interest throughout history. She connects well with the students and is very sociable and likeable. As a history fan myself, I would love to take any of her available classes to learn more.",1
"During the semester I took this class, Professor Horn was sick on and off but she still made the class as easy as she could. She does take-home tests AND in-class tests, she's super forgiving about missing class periods if your reason is valid, and she's genuinely a great person and cares for her students. Great class!",1
"Hardest class I have taken. He expects you learn the concepts fast and doesn't have many examples when trying to explain. Although he ask if you get the concept he makes it you feel dumb if you get it wrong. Started chapters for the following test before even taking the fist exam. Easily gets frustrated, gives lectures about ""back in my days""",0
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
"Every time he just went through his staffs quickly without good explanation. Feels like he was so rushed. Only talked problems without explain why need to to this, he just pulled out one general entry and said you need to do this and this.",0
"Hands down Madame Pillai is one of my favorite professors. This class definitely requires class participation. She makes you work for an A as a great prof should. She is extremely passionate about teaching. She is very approachable and you can see how passionate she is for teaching. Just come prepared, because that's all she asks. It's that simple!",1
"A LOT of reading and extensive papers. I could tell she was very passionate about the topics we discussed in class, but they often dragged on and didn't relate to the material we needed to study for exams, quizzes, etc. Her teaching style is a hit or miss for some students.",1
He is not a good teacher.,0
Quizzes everyday and is a tough grader. Her tests are very hard and her tests / quizzes are worded very hard. Don't take her you will hate that class and she makes it so much harder. HW every week and her lectures are so long and boring but you have to stay to get points for the quizzes.,0
"Ms. Jimmerson is wonderful but she's a very rigid grader. She will take off points for even small grammatical errors and syntax, so editing is your new best friend. Utilize the writing center for every paper, as soon as you can; doing so, and not missing a day of class (a secret source of bonus points) can help boost your grade significantly.",1
"This is my 2nd time taking this course & yet again, I am on the verge of failing. Looking at past comments, I have no idea why he hasn't been fired yet! He is rude & refuses to help. I went to his office hours & it was like he wanted nothing to do with me. 66 years old. Why hasn't he retired yet? HE NEEDS FIRED!",0
"Such a personality makes me think whether wisdom can be distilled from a prideful nature, or maybe the root of pride is some deep and unresolvable insecurity.  There should be no place allowed in the classroom for belligerent pride.",1
"Very nice and funny but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. He will not let you make up for anything, daily quizzes and read one chapter (20+ pages) per homework.",0
"I had to drop because I was so confused.  When I went in for him to sign the drop papers, he said ""Why didn't you ask me to clarify in class?""  Well, I did.  I just didn't understand a thing he was saying.",0
"Dr. Buck is very helpful, though his teaching style is very confusing. His lectures are boring. The class is fairly easy you could pass without having to show up to class. Also his study guides for his exams are not helpful at all just the essay questions. I would never take another class from him.",0
"Fun personality. Decent teacher. He's not very good when it comes to actually teaching material on PowerPoint. When students would mess up it seemed like he judged them. Everyone makes mistakes and isn't perfect so he can't expect students to be experts right away, especially with his lousy teaching.",0
This class is hard so make sure you study and practice a lot out of class. Each exam is curved at least 15% and he offers at least 5% extra credit in the whole class. You need to study a lot to even get a B. He really tries to make sure you do well so go to his office hours. The final isnt curved and its the ACS so be prepared.,1
"Dr. Lamas is a fantastic professor. He is well-organized, good at explaining difficult concepts, and communicates clearly. There are many readings that are difficult to comprehend but as long as you try hard, you will do good. The essays are tough, but if you ask for help and utilize the tutors, you will pass. The class was very interesting to me",1
"She is very nice, however a very tough grader. She is hard to understand(strong accent). The labs are worth only 3 points each, and lab attendance is mandatory(taken for points). The average on the tests are 52-56 percent(for the entire 85 person lectures)&she refuses to curve them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO TAKE A DIFFERENT TEACHER!",0
"Max has not handled the situation well, did not give us guidelines or dates of graded material (quizzes). He also does not give respect to students at all, and will not even give guidance on exams. It's no wonder the midterm average was so low. All he has to say is what would be on the exam, rather than respond with ""don't pry for information"" BAD!",0
"Mrs. S seems mean at first, but once you show her you are serious about nursing she will love you and help you with everything you need. I can see where some people might not like her, but if you give her a chance you won't want to leave her. I promise!!",1
very very tough grader. I made one little error on a ten point essay question on a test and she marked the whole question wrong. Did that with everyones test all or nothing grader. Tests were made up from quiz questions but she changes the words around most students I talked to got Ds on the tests.,0
Dr. Capper is one of the best teachers in the department. I've had him three times and he really cares about his students. He makes religion interesting and makes you want to learn more.,1
"I LOVED her class! She was seriously the sweetest professor i've met. She is so extremely passionate about what she teaches that no class was ever boring. The journals are hard IF you leave them for the last minute. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE ON THEM!!!! She was still amazing, so sweet and I loved some of the strategies that she would give us!",1
Honestly very disappointed in this professor. Took a class I cared about and came out less interested than I started. Meyers is extremely dogmatic and narrow minded for a philosophy professor. He is very set in his way of thinking and presenting opinions other than his will not end well.,0
"Extremely long, boring and repetitive lectures... multiple people fell asleep during class. Comes across as very arrogantobnoxious and sounds like a James Bond villain. Avoid this class!",0
overall interesting class. she posts weekly discussions regarding the material given. be sure to read and study for exams! she assigns a powerpoint and paper that is worth a good chunk of your grade.,1
"Good guy, but terrible teacher. Class is start to finish lecture where he shows no energy for his subject, and merely talks in a monotone voice the whole class. I showed up every class and took notes. His online homework is absurd, takes at least 3 hours for each homework, and there is about 25 of them. Online quizzes are easy. Tests are hard!!!!!!",0
"Overall a great teacher. She offers so much extra credit its impossible not to get a good grade. The content itself is really hard, but she understands the struggles that we go through as students and is willing to talk.",1
"Professor Buck is one of the best professors I have had at NSC. He genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to pass. He provides plenty of extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. Exams can be a bit difficult, but if you show up to class, pay attention, and read the book as well you're sure to do well!",1
Dr. Feige is the best professor i've ever had. He wants us to be successful and cares about our scores. His powerpoints are okay but he explains everything in full detail. So go to class. He teaches a very hard class that prepares us for the nursing program.,1
"He's easily the best professor i've had at UT, he's so nice and caring, always willing to help. He honestly made me enjoy stats a lot. 100% recommend. there's just one homework each week, random group activities, and three exams. not too much!",1
"Oh my god, where do i start.  Its actually so funny, because she was a horrible..horrible teacher.  Not helpful!Repetitive! You actually have to show up to class, so ditching is not an option.  She is soo boring, that when class is over you think she is nuts.  Do not take her class. Even if its the last class left.  Trust the site, they are right.",0
"Dr. Ponce is wonderful! I love her smile. She teaches excellent information and plans your future career education. When I feel like quiting, I go talk to her and she motivates me to continue my career path. I love her, she is my teacher and my friend. I recommend her!",1
Her lectures are super boring and long. She sits on her desk during lab and will not walk around and help students. She's very lazy and doesn't care about her students. Don't take her if you don't have to.,0
AMAZING. Nice beard. Good smelling coffee,1
Professor seem like an overall person but when it comes to teaching she needs to be better prepared. While doing examples of new material she often makes mistakes and corrects them midway with unclear explanations of the changes. Good amount of homework on pearson while will require a code $$$ a few quzzies and tests plus final. Find other options.,0
Super perky and enthusiastic about the class.,1
He makes students life hard; very egotistical and rude.,0
Great Professor! Explains well and clear grading criteria. No surprises,1
"The class and I did not get along. I found the professor to be somewhat rude and uncaring. The course material was taught in a way that made it hard to balance his workload with other courses. Some of the readings (which there are a lot of) are lengthy and boring. Don't get me wrong- some of it was interesting, but wouldn't recommend the course.",0
I am currently in this course and it is online with zooms. Grade comes from a few quizzes and three big tests. There is also a participation grade and you must both be present and contribute to class discussion to receive full points for the day. If you do not like speaking in class do not take this. A lot of work and hard concepts.,0
"Worst professor I have ever had. She is rude to the students. She will ask your opinion then cut you off saying you are wrong. Be prepared to be criticized in this class for every question, phrase, or opinion. She only wants to hear what she wants and when. If you state a fact from the TEXTBOOK she will tell you, youre wrong. Awful, don't do it!!",0
Professor Bates makes class material very interesting and engaging with her out going personality. However you must study the material and her notes in order to receive at least B. She is still my favorite professor on campus!,1
Great dude,1
I took Psychology of Women online this semester and the amount of work Professor Zaech expects from a 100 level psychology class is absolutely ridiculous. My discussion board posts every week were pages long and it was still impossible to get 100% on my responses.,0
Do not do it...Reconsider...Read All the literature on this site and share the information with other students. This class will ruin any semester. I would take a summer class before ever taking one of her classes. Seriously!!!,0
I love Leah so much. She is an incredibly patient teacher and she loves to answer the students' questions. She knows every student's name and greets them before class starts. She is very knowledgeable about French culture and corrects us when we can improve our pronunciation. A language class is challenging but she makes it easy. 10/10 recommend.,1
"By far, Francine Dagenais is the WORST professor I've come by at UOttawa, and that's saying something. First off, if you miss more than 2 classes, she will prevent you from doing the exam. Second, her exam requires you to memorize 64 separate pieces, while the final essay is only worth 28% of the final grade. Dagenais is evil. She hates students",0
"Nelson is an outstanding teacher! She's a beautiful person, inside and out, and her goal is to help everyone understand the material/appreciate music. When giving examples of music terms, she either plays it on the piano or sings it quite well. Be sure to listen to the entire song in the listening homework, because she might trick you on the test.",1
"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",0
Hes a very funny man who deserves more than a part time position. I do recommend him for CTA103 and intro to acting as well. He does give some quizzes in class and two test for the semester. Nothing is cumulative for the end of semester exam. Very chill atmosphere. Can be annoying at times because theirs a lot of theater nerds who take his class.,1
"This professor was horrible as a professor, as a person he is rally great. He listens gives great advice and is there for you. However, in class all he does is goes over videos that he gets offline, It sounds like he doesn't know the material he teaches and his test are not what we discuss in class. Horrible class did not learn a thing.",0
"Where do I even start? Perez is AWESOME! He made writing my tech paper so easy by utilizing ""Perez's 12 Step Process"". Classes are really fun & you do most of the work in class. He will work with you extensively if you need the extra help. I really enjoyed writing my paper, learned a ton of skills & highly RECCOMEND him to everyone! ",1
"Dr. Wolff is amazing! She is so helpful and wants you to learn from her class discussions. Speak up in class and you will do just fine! She wants to help you become a better writer and she is very knowledgable in writing! She is very nice! She is a tough grader at times, but she knows specifically what she wants to see! NO EXAMS! Discussion based",1
"Worst teacher I've had in my 5 years of college, 3 years at UCD and my 2 years at FRCC. Really regret not looking the teacher up first considering all these horrible (and accurate) reviews.",0
Her accent is so thick that I barely understood half the material. She can't really teach otherwise either. Doesn't provide solutions half the time. Doesn't provide feedback. The course was hard on its own but the lack of her teaching skills made it worse.,0
"Parkhurst was pretty chill and rude at the same time. I thought I was a decent writer until I took his class. He grades your papers extremely hard. The topics you write about are pretty flexible, but I feel like if you dont write it how he views the topic; youll suffer. His class is extremely stressful! Please, save yourself.",0
Not only does he not curve but a 90% is a B+; how messed up is that? His grading scale actually makes it harder to get an A.  All of the other science classes I have taken have either the normal grading scale or they make an A 87% and above then scale off of that. He is not interested in seeing his students do well.,0
"Don't take her class!!!  She's changed from how she taught in 2013...it's not easy, she doesn't curve tests, and she said we don't need the book, but her power points are pointless and a waste of time attending her lectures except for an attendance grade, read the book and don't just study her review, it's pointless. Find another instructor.",0
"Excellent professor. Wants her to students to understand the course topics. However, Cotes grading strategy is hard to come to terms with. Double check your work! Also, a friendly tip will be: dont email her about a question you received no credit for on your exam or quiz, she will review your whole exam and maybe deduct more points.",0
"I emailed her once about conflicting information she had posted about the scheduling of a mandatory library orientation. She obviously didn't try very hard to find out which posted time was the right one, because she gave me the wrong date and I had to drive an hour to a different campus to make up for the missed meeting at my home campus. Rude!",0
"Nice, entertaining, dedicated, but not very organized or clear. Tended to play favorites in my class",1
Professor Mahallati's INTL 5530 graduate international law course requires a lot of reading. Her use of the socratic method challenged me to research topics more closely and prepare for class. Her questions were insightful and pushed me to higher levels. Course requires a lot of analytical thinking.,1
"i just dropped her class. she is completely useless. she doesn't actually TEACH. i have not learned a single thing other than she is a high class,condescending person. i have emailed her dept when she felt the need to degrade a student in front of the class. do not take her. do not waste your time.",0
"Shilpa's class is difficult, but she is a fair grader. She is also very approachable if you need help. I am taking graduate level micro economics now and it is very easy since Shilpa's intermediate microeconomics gave me a great foundation",1
She is by far one of my favorite teachers that  i have ever had. She is so worldly and intelligent and loves to share her knowledge. She is Russian and has a russian accent but that is all it is she speaks perfect english and i would assume english is her second language and she does a great job. I just love her class so much. Def recommend her.,1
"Overall, Prof. Stevens is decent. He clearly knows a ton about the subject matter and is passionate about it, but sometimes he comes off as impatient when students ask questions. The lab and project assignments are also rather vague, yet the grading rubrics are very well defined so make sure you understand what you have to do.",1
"He'll provide you with about as good a music introduction class as you can get, in a 30+ student class with both music and non-music majors. He explains the subject very clearly, is personable,  and gives fair exams. The best way to ace this class (for a non-music major) is to create memorization tricks and widgets to use during each of 4 exams.",1
"She is a good person, very interactive. But whats the point if your grade will suffer. She is very strict and uses her old exams, she doesn't give it back. She is more concerned about her looks (flips hair a thousand times and is always playing with her hair) than the knowledge. Reads from power point, doesn't add on to what she reads.",0
"Great professor, lectures are easy to follow. The textbook is only for the homework so you don't really need to buy it as long as you follow the in class powerpoints. Pretty lenient grader, Pay attention and study a little and you will get an easy A.",1
assignments are too hard!!!,0
Brilliant and very supportive professor.,1
"I'm a first-year, and doing online classes during first-year has been anything but ideal. Out of all my professors, professor Poole's lectures have been the clearest, and she has done the most to make ensure that we aren't struggling. She is a really good professor, and she posts her lectures in three videos of about 5 minutes, it's super helpful!",1
This class has mandatory attendance but the lectures are never on topic so don't expect to learn anything its basically a waste of time. There is a required textbook that he forces you to buy. Definitely not an easy A and you learn nothing except when you open the textbook. Not worth it in my opinion.,0
"This professor is HORRIBLE. If you get him, drop the class! You will thank yourself. This class is ridiculous, and the tests are so hard and have material that has never been covered before. And he blames the students when most of the class fails rather than himself. He confuses himself and students when doing problems. Avoid him like the plague.",0
"Nicest teacher ever. She was very understanding and very flexible. Homework had lots of writing and she gives a good amount of class work and projects. She is pretty clear about expectations but make sure you pay attention when she is going over projects, homework, etc. Usually accepts late work, easy A as long as you do your work.",1
He's a bit disorganised. He makes a lot of jokes and is really easy going. Assignments don't have a set due date. He just expects you to turn it in by the end of the semester.,1
This teacher was easier to work with than some of my highschool teachers.,1
"This professor is one of the worst Ive had. Professor Smith has hardly done any of the work herself and leaves it up to her Sophomore TAs without a set grading scale to grade a majority of your assignments. While its and easy A, its if she actually grades your paper in a timely manner. Im still waiting on a huge grade and its been two months.",0
Take this class if you have to take psych and its not important to your major. Easy A if you do the paper. You dont really have to do good on the paper. She scaled all of our quizzes since everyone scored so low (no one got above a 70). If you really care about psych and want to learn it. Then do not take this class because you wont learn,0
"I will never understand how such easy material can be presented through a course in such a difficult manner. Non-test takers beware, tests are worth 50% of your grade with no extra credit and webcam mandated. Every ""almost 4.0 student"" has that one class that dropped there perfect score... this is it. Proceed with caution.",0
"She is new to Gonzaga but she is young, so smart, pretty, and very engaging. Super refreshing to be able to relate to a professor. She asks ""questions of the day"" and plays music while we work. She is not the easiest grader but her feedback just makes you better. She is awesome take her class! Her class is not dull and goes by really quickly.",1
Mrs. Johnson is an all around great instructor. She is probably the nicest professor on campus! If you have to take a sociology class make sure you get Mrs. Johnson!!!,1
"Great and knowledgeable professor. Also can be a funny guy. If you ever have any questions, he's very approachable. Quizzes every class (once a week), three graded articles and a final. Quizzes are based off of the textbook, style guide and recent news events. The class wasn't hard, but if writing isn't your thing, it won't be easy.",1
"Material in the course isn't all that hard, but the way she presents it makes it more confusing than it should be. I learned more from the discussion section than lectures.",0
Completely worthless professor who does not know how to teach or keep his student's attention. Half the students are failing because he refuses to acknowledge his own errors. Grades specifically on grammar,0
"I took his class last semester, and he made me feel so dumb because i did poorly with the activities during class (which I felt like he was doing solely so he could cut down on the amount of time he was teaching). He tries really hard to appear nice but he seems to talk down to you when you don't immediately understand the material.",0
"I have never had a problem with math or any other professor, I am a mech. engineering major and needed this course. 40+ hw problems a night, study guides for exams have no relevance. Can't explain himself or the subject due to his lack of knowledge of the English language. Class started w/ 23 students, its down to 7. Please, avoid him at all costs.",0
great teacher..you must work hard but you can get an a,1
"If you show up & pay attention you can get a lot out of the class. I, however, tend to not show up a& not pay attention. All homework and tests were online, so it's pretty easy. He does NOT communicate. Although you need to be prepared to teach yourself, I still think he's a decent teacher.",0
"This is the worst professor I have ever had. His lectures are horrible! He does not present with powerpoint, photos, or makes notes of any important information. He does not give you any assignments, only quizzes (2-3) and exams (2-3) ! therefore, you have to get a perfect score in every exam & quiz to pass the class.",0
He díd a great job.  I really learned a lot in his course.,1
Falk makes his class unnecessarily difficult. He gives homework on topics that haven't even been mentioned in class until after the homework is due and these topics are not in the textbook he recommended. He runs the class like a graduate class and will spend all your time on his class. He is very understanding about life circumstances though.,0
"Hes a great professor. The material is dense if youre not stats savvy but he's willing to explain the material to you, and hes helpful one on one. There's a very large prediction project at the end of the semester and my best advice is to pick a subject you really enjoy. You wont hate the project if you pick a subject you're actually curious about.",1
she is so nice.  She would meet with me on extra days in the week to help with my papers. she tells you exactly what to do to get a good grade in her class.  I got an A.  :),1
"Mustard is the best-hands down. I don't know why so many people rate him poorly.  His lectures can be long, but he can be funny... His midterm exams and practicums are kind of hard, but if you like biology it can be easy as pie. This class weeds out the weak links, and takes them on the ""ferris wheel of death""... HAHAHA Any questions Eh? ",1
"There're 3 quizzes, 5 in lab practices, 5 assignments, and a group project. If you apply yourself, you will succeed the course. Prof Song is knowledgeable and really cares about her students. She gave off many opportunities for extra points. Personally I really enjoyed her office hours -- helped me a ton.",1
"2% chaque cours pour les travaux d'équipe en classe, mais on en a fait a peut près 5 max, donc 2% facile à chaque cours (pour un total de 20%). Il n'est pas très pédagogue. Ce que j'ai le moins aimé c'est qu'il va plus vite que ce que prévue au plan de cours et donc lorsque l'on prend un peu de retard dans les exercices c'est difficile à suivre.",0
Doesn't know what he's doing. Disorganized for every class,0
"Shes a very nice lady, but this class was a waste of time. It was like she wanted to teach a race and gender studies class, but got stuck with writing and rhetoric so she had to shoehorn it into Computers and Writing. This course did not improve my writing, lecture mostly consisted of discussing pop culture, and the final was a group project.",0
He was the highlight of my freshman year! He is encouraging and always lets you know what you should study in order to succeed in his class. He is funny yet is serious about his love of genetics. Respect this class and he will respect you!,1
"Good prof, like his style",1
"Professor West is very caring and patient. This is what kept me coming back to class. I have to admit, I struggled with the content of this course, however, Professor West was able to break it down to where everyone understood enough to get a decent grade. I highly recommend taking this class! very chill and laid back. We only had 3 test.",1
This professor is the most awful professor in this college. I totally don't understand why this college doesn't fire him. He frequently is too late to come to class and absent all the sudden. He is terrible as a professor and a business person. I am regretting to take his class. He can't care about students.,0
He didn't always talk about Chaucer but he was usually funny and entertaining.,1
"Horrible professor for PSY200. Not helpful, confusing, and boring. She isn't willing to give extra credit and her tests are impossible even if you can do the problems in class or homework. (She likes trick questions). Do yourself a favor and take someone else before you put yourself through this torture. I would of dropped the class if I could.",0
"OMG, I am 30 yrs old, and never been to college and this man is a trip. Makes you feel like you belong in the class and is extremely easy. Open book tests and 15 homework assignments! Awesome Teacher and a trip!",1
"Quizzes every 2 weeks. Group essay. 6 quizzes in total. Midterm is easy. I have a 100 in this class, make a little time every once in a while for this class and you can easily ace it",1
"Great Professor! As long as you participate in class and do the work for the class, you will pass!",1
Excellent professor! She really takes time to make sure everyone in the class is on the same page. She explains very well and she is always there to help if you need any help understanding the material. Highly recommend her!,1
Very cool and nice person!!! She's very caring and wants you to do well. She's a great math teacher and does not judge when you don't know something you should know. She doesn't care if you are on your phone during class either.,1
JP is a reasonable professor. I just wish he put all the assignments on Canvas at the beginning. I highly suggest going to class--he gives the code for some projects! He also gives critical instructions for the projects (which really should have been included in the assignment descriptions...). There are 4 online quizzes and 1 open-book final exam.,1
"You have to study well even to get B! But he tries his best to help students. Overall I liked his class, not outstanding, but excellent. His test questions and practice questions are much more difficult than the way he covers things in class. Make sure you read the power point slides and book to prepare yourself well.",1
Very good teacher. I wish I could take more classes by her.,1
Whatever you do...DO NOT TAKE HER.,0
She is terrible!I don't know what these other people are saying when they say she is willing to help because she doesn't at all!I was nothing but polite to her and she refuses to asnwer any questions without telling me to look it up myself or make me feel like an idiot.Teachers are supposed to help and guide you not tell you to look it up yourself!,0
Brooke is hands down my favorite professor I've ever had. She makes art so easy to integrate into the Common Core and other school subjects. She inspires every student in her class to want to be a creative teacher. She genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed. I wish I could take other classes with her! She's the sweetest.,1
One of the worst profs at Central...should retire. Absolutely hated his class--STAY AWAY if possible!,0
"The man does not speak a lick of English, is extremely shy when speaking in front of a lecture hall, and just reads off of his slides. He him self is a horrible educator for his lack of teaching skills. Tests are cake though. One side formula sheet you make for tests, 2 sided for final and questions come from inclass quizzes, lecture notes, and HW.",0
"She's honestly not a great professor. I took her for almost every class she taught at Siena and I had to teach myself most of the time. She talks down to you if you don;t understand stuff right away, but she's a really nice lady. Super gossipy. Be careful what you say in front of her. The whole chemistry department will know.",0
"Dr. Cutler is one of the most caring people you will ever meet. The content of her class is hard, and sometimes I needed to look up YouTube videos to find another way of explaining a topic. She is a good teacher who will slow down if you ask her to. However, she does not baby you. In order to get an A in her class you need to be self-motivated.",1
"Excellent teacher. Course structure is clear. Class is fun. Requires more than a little effort, but is totally reasonable compared to some classes. Would recommend to anyone serious about learning Italian.",1
"She is rude and clearly has issues like previously mentioned its sad that she is the only professor teaching the course. She does not make the class interesting at all and can never give a full example. She begins explaining and is at a loss for words and just says ""YOU KNOW"" but never says anything.",0
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
This class wasnt that bad. Nicole was funny in her lectures and overall a cool person. You dont need to watch the lectures just read the modules. She can be a little unorganized. Everything is open note except midterm and final. If you take this class just pray you get a good group if you dont you will be miserable. Start on the speeches early.,1
Really a horrible teacher had to drop math 112 from winter term. This class she doesn't know the material at all and student ask her if she supposed to follow the math formula in the text book and then she get mad and yells as the student. Really a rude instructor and bad at teacher math course. Please avoid taking this instructor for math.,0
"Prof. Powell is an extreme grader and does little to help you if you have issues or questions so be ready to do everything one your own. Even if you do everything right and follow all the instructions and answer every question you will get points off. For what,you will never know. You couldnt pay me to take one of his classes again. Not even nice.",0
"She may be good in person but not online. She caught a student cheating and punished the whole class by not allowing us to backtrack on the test. She would also make the test on Sundays at certain times such as from 9 am-12 pm. Also, all the negative comments have been removed for whatever reason. I did all her homework and still got an F.",0
Delivered his live lectures brilliantly despite the current situation. Go to office hours for assignment help. TAs for this course are the most helpful I have had so far. Try out all the previous years' exams if you want to ace the midterm and final. Course is not so challenging if you put effort into it. Highly recommend Pat for 2804.,1
"I took this class online Spring 2013. While Professor Grant may be a little confusing at times, he WILL help you and he will certainly respond if you simply communicate with him. If you cant communicate, expect ot be confused! Other then that, I really enjoyed his online class. Simple and straight forward! Would take him again!",1
He is extremely thorough. He makes sure that you understand every step. He is great at understanding the Philadelphia market. I appreciate his honesty. I am an adult student who wants to make a living in this area.,1
"Pooja knows her stuff, but I'm really lucky that I've taken physic before. She can't convey ideas, and even when you ask her questions, you won't learn from her. You either have to learn from friends or the textbook. The homework is rare but hard and the tests are easy, but if you don't already know physics well, everything will be hell on earth.",0
"This class is so easy if you buy the textbook. He puts the quiz questions on the McGraw website and you just need to memorize them. He gets off topic very easily but you don't really have to pay attention in class to pass. The grades consist of quizzes, participation, and a concert report. Which is also very easy.",1
100% take this class. So extremely easy and the online textbook is a really amazing learning tool. Super easy and quick grader. I took an online class but I still could feel like he truly cares about his students. The only downside to class was the textbook was very expensive.,1
"TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He made class so fun and entertaining while we were learning the depths of developmental psychology. Get ready to participate and to share things in this class, this professor makes class comfortable & easy to talk about some of our own experiences with some of the topics he covers. Hands down the best professor at EFSC.",1
"She is an AMAZING prof! Teaches all the material with patience and clarity. She is funny, entertaining and extremely knowledgeable but at times speaks very softly so you lose focus. Listen to all her lectures (they are recorded) and it's an easy A",1
"Luallen is an excellent professor and amazing lecturer. His slides are very clear and he is able to get his points across in a very concise and easy to understand way. Rarely, if ever, was I bored in class. That being said this was also one of the most challenging classes I've taken. Significant learning comes at the cost of an easy A.",1
"He gives very engaging and interesting lectures. His quizzes and exams aren't really that hard, and he gives people second chances when it comes to assignments. One would have to actively try to mess up in order to not pass this class . An easy A is not guaranteed, but actually failing with this professor is highly unlikely.",1
"very hard exam! took little bits of info from the text that you thought you'd never have to study. did bad on his exam, but amazing on prof southams. make sure you study stupid trivia.",1
"Gerard is an excellent professor. He is not a prof that just wants to hear info regurgitated - he wants critical thinking! The creative projects may seem silly at first, but the idea is to look at yourself from a new perspective, and to apply creative and critical thinking to yourself and the material. This is essential in CYC!",1
"Best math teacher i've had so far.  If you come to class and do your homework even though it is not manadotory you will get an easy A! You have to come to class to take quizes everyday, but there are only 5 points!",1
He is an awesome professor that knows his stuff. Only assigns hw when necessary but rarely (9 worksheets the whole semester). The lectures are very interesting and very detailed. He tells you what is on the test just make sure you don't cheat. I highly recommend taking his class.,1
"This class was awful! Professor Martin is not clear when speaking to the class, the whole semester no one knew what was going on. She is an extremely tough grader on essays and takes forever to give grades back. We are currently on our 3rd essay and barely got back our grades from our first essay. Lastly she does cancel class a lot.",0
Very nice professor and has super entertaining and relevant lectures. Took this class in pandemic and he handled adjustment very well. he is unresponsive to emails outside of class and will often play pre recorded lectures rather than cancelling. Tests are challenging but doable if you rewatch lectures and take notes. Overall top 5 prof hes great,1
"Mrs. Michelfelder has been one of my favorite professors. Drops lowest test grade for attendance percentage, extra credit on every test (and if you attend outside speakers), easy to follow, tests are directly from power points that are posted online, homework is completion (can always earn 100%)",1
Best teacher at SCC hands down! The guy can teach and is one of the most accomplished professors at SCC. I highly recommend you take him as a teacher if you have the opportunity.,1
"Midterm + Final. 5 hw assignments. 10 quizzes (retake as much as needed). Research Proposal, Research Presentation + Final Paper (1 per group). Lectures are optional but I'd go for it! If can't, he records lectures! He emails sometimes a bit late (1-3 days) but very accessible and caring! He picks your partners for you. Lots of extra credit!",1
Took this as an online class and it consisted of lots of videos. If you are looking for a course to take off a load take this. Midterm and final and one paper.,1
"She is very fair, very easy grader. She gets a bad rap because of her accent, but it is nothing that you can't understand as long as you pay attention.",1
"Its like the class sets you up to FAIL on the TESTS. The lecture material was VAGUE.  What was on the midterm asks for MORE DETAIL than what was lectured. A LOT wasnt even mentioned in the lecture PowerPoints at all! Class mean for the 2 quizzes & the midterm was a 68! Curves class at end, not each individual testquiz. Final is cumulative. ",0
"Nigam is confusing, she started lectures before class even was supposed to start. She gives you confusing material and basically wants you to teach it to yourself. Super heavy on HW. Exams are awful. Oh and she finds it fun to 180 her teaching style right in the middle of the semester, so you are basically so confused and screwed. Good Luck.",0
"Class was very hard to sit through. I couldn't bare it half of the time. Quizzes tend to follow a pattern of every other class, but he never specifies, and sometimes that schedule switches up on you so you really never feel confident about skipping class and running the risk of missing a quiz thats very important for your grade. Lab was easy.",0
I loved Professor Silva's class! If you do the homework you are sure to get an A. She grades everything very fast and provides comments back to you. I was very worried to take this because it was a three credits in 8 weeks but soooo worth it!,1
"I've only been in class for 1 week so far and if it wasn't for all the extra help from Tim Sether, I would of failed misserably.  He's responded to my daily emais; even within the hour.  He's also called me at home to walk me assgs. This is one instructor who really cares about his students success!  Highly recmmended to take one of his classes.",1
He is a very tough grader and attendance is mandatory. Arriving a minute or two after class begins gives you an entire absence. His tests are easy if you study. If you are taking this class because you like Shakespeare be prepared to take in a lot of visual performances and analysis not only reading. You read about a play per 2 class periods.,0
"Dr. Randy Waterman replies email very fast to yall. we took so many online classes but, we never see whoever was better than Dr. Randy Waterman.",1
This guy is almost impossible to understand at times.  Class is SOOO boring.  Tests are hard and you wonder if he ever taught what he is testing over.  Some test questions aren't even in proper english.  AVOID!!,0
Was her first semester teaching Crim Pro. Slides were very helpful. Exam wasn't bad. Essay was one of those you can never finish bc of some many issues. She was a good teacher. Would take another class with her.,1
Excellent instructor and is really good at what she does. Provides constructive feedback through (Jing) as well as very helpful supplemental material throughout the semester. Highly recommended.,1
If you are considering taking Devcomm please do yourself a favor a take this professor. She is an awesome professor and a beautiful person. Her teaching style is very good and you will learn so much from  her lectures. I had a very nice experience taking her class and learned so much. I highly recommend her to everyone.,1
"Homeworks really hard.  Don't take class unless you have to. Its not worth the headache. I disagree with the review below, I chose the labs instead of presentation.  Labs were very easy, basically just pinging and tracerts.  Tests are super hard.  I ended up with an A, but worked really hard for it. Didn't know any grades until the final.",0
"She is very nice, but too confusing and loves to go on rants.",1
She is just rude. She wouldn't even let you talk or look at classmates. She awful and not helpful at all. If you can don't take this class!!!She even yelled at me for getting the answer wrong(the way she wouldn't answer it). Run!! The worse teacher I've ever came across.,0
He's a great teacher. His tests are more than manageable if you pay attention during his review sessions. Homework on each chapter and attendance boost your grade.,1
"Mr. Freda seems to have a bad rep, but don't let him or this class scare you. You have to put in some effort and he'll notice if you do. Some test questions can be tricky, but this class is meant to make you think about the concepts. Don't skip class if you can help it... you'll be glad. I'm not a science-y person but I learned a lot of cool stuff!",1
Where do I start!!! Lets just say hes super!,1
"Dr. Marlow is super fun. He has a hard time getting through the material because he encourage class discussion. He knows how to explain things so student's understand. Though there was one time where I emailed him a question and his reply was ""it's in the syllabus"".  The syllabus is 13 pages long. Just sayin. Into to Linguistics is very interesting",1
Extremely SCATTERBRAINED! Lets you use cheat sheets during tests but not the final! Tells more stories about her family and illnesses than the actual info you need to know. Group work with a different group every time! Always changes due dates and be ready to have multiple mistakes made when grading your tests! So hard to follow! Steer Clear!!!,0
"Took her for the first online art course.  I thought she was very organized.  She is an artist but does not expect her students to be artists so her critiques are gentle,hlepful and kind.  If you didn't get an A, you just didn't do anything.  I highly recommend online course.  You only put in about 2 hours per week.",1
"Graded essays are a big deal in her class, so make sure you really pay attention to grammar!! She goes by checks, so participate, even if it's just a comment. She doesn't like people talking all at once or while she's talking. It's not that bad of a class.",1
"She is the worst professor. I got a good grade but I didn't gain any new information. The class is so boring. she thinks she deserves the noble prize. to pass the class you should study off her powerpoint, textbook, OLD TESTS, note outlines, do all of the problems in the books and the reviews. I think you'll be fine then.",0
Love him such a babe hot af great teacher,1
Tbh his teaching is not that good. He can't explain concepts well and it is confusing even to me as a student who have taken calculus before. But he is very organized in his class and test schedules. He give extra credits. Has a lot of hw to do. Tests are not too difficult. Wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't already know the materials.,0
"Great professor, he made class interesting. Show up and stay awake and you'll be fine.",1
"Straight up a god at teaching BUS170. He is extremely clear and cares about teaching his students. You learn a lot in this class and he makes all the math concepts understandable and concise. I've heard many bad things about other professors so if you have a chance, take him. Don't misunderstand me, he definitely makes you work for the grade.",1
The book works are hard if you never took a psychology class ever because it's psychology heavy. I wish we had more interactive group activities and class discussions but it's not easy to be innovative. The papers are challenging if your not a psychology major and are strictly APA format the latest version so knowing APA in advance is going to help,0
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. I cannot say it enough times. This man thrives on seeing his students fail. His tests are downright impossible. He is an incredibly tough grader as well. I took the online course and he made us come in to take an exam because he thought we were all cheating. I promise even if you did cheat you'd probably still fail. AVOIDDDDDD!,0
"Professor November was amazing. He's extremely helpful and is really nice. There are some weekly worksheets and reading but it's manageable with other responsibilities that you may have. Everything he gives you is important and goes towards big assignments so you should do them. Best professor I've ever had, I'd love to take his class again.",1
"Hands-down the worst professor I have ever had. He rambles every class, never following the syllabus. He is a really tough grader and is unwilling to discuss his grading techniques/reasons for giving you the grade he gives. If attendance wasnt absolutely mandatory I would never go because he is very disrespectful and talks down to students.",0
"If you want to pass, avoid at all costs. Plays favorites big time, and will not help students he does not like for whatever reason.",0
"Like below, nice person, god awful teacher. Although she is willing to help when needed, she's not clear on anything during class. The subject is hard enough. The first test she gave a sheet of about 200 anatomy terms to know and about 30 were on the test, its like that for every test. Waste of time studying and guessing whats on test. FRUSTRATING",0
"the most boring lectures you will ever attend, he should talk to vial about his powerpoint research. Exams=insane. homework=kill your self. i can count on spending 4-5hours doing the matlab homework each week.(1 credit course) very anal teacher. he give u exam from last year, but makes new 1 10 times harder. tests you on material he didnt cover.",1
"Dr. Hill is a fantastic teacher.  He really knows his stuff!  The tests are not hard at all if you read the material.  He tells you exactly what you need to know to pass the test.  You must attend class though, he counts off points if you miss more than 3. He is a very interesting guy, also laid back and willing to work with you if necessary.",1
"Every human being needs to take this class, Brown is very passionate about leaving the world a better place.",1
"Professor Sieber is amazing. BIOLOGY is not easy because it has a lot of material to cover, but she goes over and over the material until we understand it. Also the test are part multiple choice and part short answer, and there is ton of extra credit. Don't skip class because you would be lost. The book is needed but no the access code.",1
"The material itself is fun and I learned a lot from it. Theres no denying hes knowledgable and creative. This being said, I think he lacks a lot of empathy for his students and can be condescending or rude towards them. If you are stressed or struggling, he wont be very helpful. If not, youll probably enjoy the class and do fine",0
CARDIO CONDITIONING-SPIN CLASS. GREAT SPIN CLASS VERY CHALLENGING AND EDUCATIONAL. GREAT OVER ALL CONDITIONING ROUTINE AND HIGHLY MOTIVATING ATMOSPHERE. PROFESSOR MILBURN IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR/TRAINER AND ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE ATHLETES I HAVE SEEN IN ACTION. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER CLASSES.,1
She replaces your lowest test grade with your attendance grade so if you go to class  you can bomb one test.  Her lectures are really long and boring but all of the test information is in there so just study them a lot before a test. I thought the class was easy and the tests were not too hard if you study.   ,1
"He is extremely pretentious, does not post powerpoints, goes extremely fast in class and get's mad when someone asks for clarification. Put more effor into this class than any other ones and still ended up with a C.",0
"Robert Smith is a smart guy and knows his stuff, but his teaching strategy is to beat you down and build you up. His syllabus is very confusing and so are his tests, he is very particular about the way you answer questions. He grades papers for length and grammar, not for content, and he doesnt like double spaced papers.",0
"GREAT PROFESSOR! He has a sense of humor which makes Philosophy more interesting,not ""serious"". He has a way of explaining concepts that makes them easier to understand than just reading alone. You will need to keep up on the readings or you will be confused by his lectures. All exams will most likely be essay, but do an outline and you'll be fine!",1
Not clear AT ALL on what essays need to be written for his class. And NEVER responds to emails. Most incompetent prof.,0
". Very organized. Every week there is an essay, you submit a draft every Sunday, every Saturday you submit a process journal and a editing and grammar activity, Wednesdays you do three peer reviews and on Thursdays you do a writing review. Monday you submit a ferreting journal. You just have to participate and you get an A",1
"Lectures are long, must read, read and do research. One paper, 4 quizzes and 3 tests. Not a practical class if you are a full-time working adult and have family and home responsibilities. Must attend and read, otherwise you may fail. Only reason I passed is because I read, read, and re-read.",1
I'm glad I took all my accounting classes with him it was very easy for a pretty challenging material based class. He sometimes gives take home exams but the in class exams are open book/note anyway. I personally did not really pay attention and still got an A,1
"Dr. Mo is a cool person, but not every cool person can be a good teacher. Physics I has really simple concepts and its should be pretty easy to ace. But Dr. Mo is extremely unorganized with her teaching materials, and the problems are from all over the place. Lectures are erratic. Hard to copy everything down, and they are not available afterwards.",0
"Charles Putnam is a wonderful professor! He goes into depth on hard to understand topics, using hypothetical and relatable situations. Attendance is not mandatory however he does grade on iclicker so if you miss one of the classes that they are used, you may diminish your grade. Exams are hard but if you listen in class you will do great. 10/10.",1
"WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER MET! Don't believe these other positive reviews. Cowan is rude and disrespectful. He is negative and vicious. He does not teach art, only makes fun. I tried hard in this class and my extra work was unnoticed. DO NOT TAKE CLASSES FROM COWAN. UVU would be better off without him!",0
"I took Managerial Accounting online.  I have never seen a professor show less interest in an online class...  There were no online lectures, and the only real resource was McGraw-Hill Connect.  There is a discussion page, but it was very poorly facilitated and virtually useless.  I would not take this professor again.",0
I took for Texts and Contexts: Major Writers..A midterm and final along with about 5 essays... He is a difficult grader.  Very enthusiastic. It is impossible to read his comments on the paper so good luck learning and getting good grades,0
Ridiculous teacher. She acted like you were interrupting her if you came to her door during her office hours and was overall kinda rude.,0
"Great instructor, explains things well, she let me re do an assignment for a better grade. She definitely holds the attention of the class and is really informative. I would take another class from her most definitely.",1
"The vast majority of students seem to like Professor Russell, but for whatever my opinion counts, I feel that she lacks to proper knowledge to teach her classes. She consistently makes rather large factual mistakes and often teaches directly out of the textbooks; I would have learned more if I just read the books and never showed up to class.",0
"One of the most helpful and practical classes I have ever taken.  Kate Manski is a real pro.  Truly a lady and a scholar.  The class requires a lot of work but her feedback and comments are very helpful.  The lack of pretense, combined with her professional and well-informed instruction really make this class a worthwhile investment of your time.",1
"Wonderful professor. Gives great lectures, daily quizzes based off of these lectures. Attendance is mandatory for your grade. Really enjoyed her class!",1
"While Professor Giraud is a great and funny person, his course schedules and timetables leave something to be desired of. Through circumstance and perhaps just a lot of bad luck, the set schedule for his class is continually derailed and modified, leaving many students, including myself, confused as to what is coming next.",0
"I haven't seen a single ""funny"" thing about Prof. Gaidos. He basically calls his students idiots, Ie. Announcement he made saying most of the students posts are ""completely outlandish"". You ask him a question, and he responds in a disrespectful manner. I will pass this class because I will do the work, but I don't recommend taking him!",0
"She will hate your scripts, I tried to make the one that she would like, but I failed.  I took it with another teacher, I got an A.",0
Worst math prof I've had. Not clear in explaining the how to during lectures. Doesn't give enough time in class to work on new material and ask questions. Had to teach myself at home. Uses mathxl. YOU DONT KNOW YOUR GRADE THE ENTIRE SEMESTER AND HE WONT TELL YOU. He tells us how to calculate it but won't help or verify if it's correct.,0
"I took this course online and I would not recommend this class to anyone taking it with her . Her exams do not correspond to her powerpoint lectures online. There would be a minimum of 2-5 questions that relate to anything that she has taught us in her online lectures, thus making her exams tricky. Take her seated course instead.",0
"Being a nutrition major, I thought I was going to enjoy this ""easy"" class; boy was I wrong. This is a 4 unit class (in a qtr system) and takes more than double the time of my other 2 five unit classes combined(no exaggeration). If you like harsh grading, non-stop hw, and really hard quizestests for only 4 units(qtr system), this is ur teacher!",0
Best Philosophy teacher at QU,1
"I can't speak for his other classes, but there is no excuse for failing Math 45 with him. He is more than fair and curves exams by grading them out of one less question. (A 15 question exam is graded out of 14). He also drops your lowest test score and you get credit for homework as long as you did it, he doesn't grade on correct answers.",1
Took her for the summer course and it was a lot of fun. Quizes before class on readings but pretty straight forward and simple. Really fun professor and she definitely knows her stuff. The class was really fun just try to engage in what is being talked about and you'll be fine. As long as you go to class and try you'll have no issues with thisclass,1
Trust me. AVOID. Worst experience ever.,0
"She has student teachers grade everything and they gave terrible feedback. When talking to actual professor she did not reply for weeks, even talking to her in person was no help. Overall nice but I found her to be unprofessional, would not take her class again.",0
DO NOT TAKE GENETICS AT UIC. It is way harder than it needs to be and they make sure you don't succeed.,0
"He really cares about the students success. He has great stories that connects with the course work. If you need help, he is there to clear any doubts you may have on the course work. I will definitely take him again!",1
Just a terrible influence on anyone actually serious about writing. Does not help with writing at all. one text goes on for weeks and she will mark you down if your vision and her's are different. Tip: if she makes a note on your draft do it exactly for a good grade. her exams are pointless. Avoid taking her unless you can take class high.,0
"Just a very bad teacher, very unhelpful and doesn't care for students. Tests are ridiculously difficult for no reason. He's assessible if you make an appointmet but offers you no help.",0
"You will LIVE in your textbook. She is a loving person but the worst professor I have ever taken. Unfortunately she is just uneducated, a bad teacher andirresponsible. She DOES NOT HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING, lab or lecture. ""What does the book say?"" She simply doesn't know the material well enough toteach it the 1 time she answered me, she was wrong.",0
"Awesome professor, twin of Reid Spencer from Criminal Minds. Advisor of more than double the number of students than any other professor. Super class, which makes you understand the material better than a common lectures! He is ""Da Man""!",1
i previously had assumed that professors needed some degree of intelligence. khalsa taught me never to assume anything.,0
"Great teacher, the only problem I had was that assignments didn't get graded for an extended period of time.",1
"Overcomplicates simple material and says is available for office hours but isn't all the time. Exams aren't hard at all, but when you learn nothing all from the teacher it becomes much more difficult. prepare to teach yourself",0
"Worst teacher Ive ever take in my life. Strict on grading, no matter how hard you try he will always find some problem to lower your grade. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
"Craig is a great guy, but he did very poorly as a teacher. He spent most of class telling stories and trying to tie them in, often failing to use class time effectively. He somehow managed to narrow the scope of business ethics down until it was almost entirely about the environment. Do not take one of his classes unless you are interested in that.",0
"The class was hard, but Dr. King makes an effort to get you to understable the material as best as possible. The tests are tricky and detail specific, but not impossible if you study.",1
Loved having this class! Professor Dunham was awesome! He made everything in class easy to understand and I learned so much! He also made the class super fun! Would 100% recommend him!,1
"On top of her strong accent she talks extremely soft so you can understand anything she says. Her tests are easy, but  she makes you study also every piece of work in the chapters, expect to memorize at least a hundred slides before the midterm and final. Try to avoid taking this teacher at all costs",0
WORST professor I had at BSU. Had to leave a 3hr lecture 10 minutes early for work and she called me out in front of class. Not accepting of non traditional students. Emailed her privately about a pregnancy that I wouldve liked to keep private but she talked loudly about it immediately after class in front of everyone & asked if it was planned.,0
"I took Organic Gardening with her in the spring semester this year, and shes very good with technology so she has a lot of in-class participation activities on TopHat. Thats fine until someones internet stops working... Also a lot of what she said we would need to know for the final was not on the final. If u need an online class, ull want her.",1
"If you can, definitely take Stat 105/305 with him. His practice exams are almost identical to the real tests and he is very nice. Would highly recommend him over any other stats professor.",1
"A very smart professor with lots of intellectual qualities, yes with too much writing in her class also 3 or 4 heavy tests and like 12 lab quizzes but at the end a professor with to much knowledge in biology and zoology",1
"Its a summer writing class so its def going to seem like a ton of writing. Ive take class with her during the year too and it's also a lot, but spread over a semester doesnt feel so overwhelming! Anyhoo, she really does want you to become a good writer, so if you make an effort, she'll really help you! Also, she's really friendly and funny!",1
Monica is an amazing teacher is willing to go the extra mile to help her students! I highly recommend taking any bio you can with her! If you have questions she will always willingly answer them and explain it multiple times until you totally understand it! 10/10!!!!!!!!!!,1
"professor goldner is great, he knows his material well. books he posts are required so make sure to get the. drops lowest grade from response papers which helps a lot. very well organized class. his office hours are very helpful. definitely recommend!",1
"No passion for teaching, doesn't seem to care if students are learning anything of value. Sits at the front of class for 3 hours writing equations with very little explanation. Rocket propulsion is apparently basic chemistry and thermo all over again. Do not take this class, it's a waste of a senior elective when he's teaching it.",0
"Dude, some of these reviews are hilarious and they are all true!! She is really mean. There was probably nobody in class that liked her. She can be very judgmental and will stereotype you. The only people she seemed to be nice to were people of latin decent. I caught her rolling her eyes on a few student, particularly the white ones. Not recommende",0
"This prof deters people from linguistics. The classes were extremely boring. His slides are straight from the textbook and he lectures directly off the slides. No point in going, just read the slides and memorize the textbook. Tests obscure, irrelevant details on MC exams. Thinks way too highly of himself. ",0
Kim was a good professor. 3/4 exams (including the final exam) will be graded towards your final grade. She gives out practice exam which is useful. The laboratory for ece is horrible. Too much time consuming. My suggestion is to finish the lab and turned it in to the TA. Most likely you will get full credit by completing the labs.,1
"Swingley talks a lot about feminism in her classes. Even though it's an editing class, many times we talk about other things besides editing during the class period. I thought I was going to learn about commas, semi-colons, etc., but we only talked about how to address each gender in writing.",0
He is the most specific grader i've ever had. his lectures are good and you'll understand the concepts but his grading on tests is enough to drive you crazy. You have 4 tests and a final and one of the tests are dropped (if he didnt drop your lowest grade you wouldnt pass). try and take someone else,0
"Best professor I've had here at Texas State! As long as you did the homework you could just copy the work, we had a total of 15 quizzes and she dropped 5!  extra credit opportunity, and if you took all 15 quizzes you got extra credit as well! explains content very clear. Tests are easy as long as you study quizzes and HW. QUEEN OF PARTIAL CREDIT",1
He is a great teacher. He goes over all of the content for the exams with extra review before the exams. He lost past years exams but makes you go to him for the answer keys. He tries really hard to make the class understandable for everyone. He also makes the class fun and as exciting as he can.,1
"Kai Du is very hard to understand, and his teaching style is ridiculous. During class he'll write a few short-hand notes on the chalk board (even though there are 6 sliding dry erase boards available) and proceed to try to explain the information, which you probably wont understand, and so you MUST read and study the text book every night. GoodLuck",0
"This class is very time consuming. You must pay attention and come to class. If not you will fall behind and fail. He tries to make it clear and simple. He is very laid back. But if you email him, he only answers back half the time. Decent but yet stressful class.",1
"I took this professor a year ago in a full semester length class, and I learned absolutely nothing. He is a great guy, but cannot teach. Especially if you are not like everyone else in your class and know Spanish already. He tries to help out with grades at the end, but by then I did not even want to try. This is a great class if you are fluent tho",0
He is very partial teacher. He just gives opportunities to students who are doing research under him or whom he knows. He is very bad for others.,0
"Great teacher. Work load isn't horrible, tests aren't too hard, and she's very very helpful. Tries her best to teach you Spanish. And she's cute. No, adorable. And hot.",1
"Awful. Not an English class. Take this class if you want to debate and hate the gov't. Discuss and talk about imaginary aliens that would ""rape every orifice"" on you. The government is out to get us and everyone is racist. There was NO structure on what he expected from papers. His feedback is condescending and unhelpful. Not encouraging/inspiring.",0
Not sure why there are so many positive reviews. Your grade is entirely dependent on difficult tests which are hard to prepare for because of the way that he taught. I would definitely avoid taking an honors course with him.,0
"Most incoherent prof I have ever had, and I regret taking him. He just shows videos, can't teach. He has no degree related to what he teaches (check KPU faculty). Do not take him.",0
I love Mrs. Barclift. She is very understanding. She knows what she is talking about and is very interesting. She is more strict in this class than she is in other classes.Most people do not know how to take her outspokeness and crude humor when they first meet her she means no harm.,1
This is a french oral class and I am quite disappointed with it. Juliet is a very nice person but the oral class is not strictly formatted and there is hardly any french conversation and activities done between students to help improve their french. The course is quite boring and not worth taking. ,0
DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!! She is very unorganized . she didn't give me credit for at least of 3 of my hw assignments! she expects that you should be able to read her fingerspelling but honestly she gets lazy with it and she does skip letters. she can be nice but mostly rude! save yourself the struggle and take a different professor.,0
She reminds me of Meg from Family Guy. She is weird and awkward. She constantly goes off topic and she is an expendable professor. She will truly make you work for your two credits. Read the book. Don't take her notes because they don't help.,0
"Dr. Hale really knows his stuff, and he's kind of funny too. But the class is very hard, especially if you're not naturally a history person. The essay tests were extremely tough. However, I will say that he is big on connecting different parts of history to see the bigger picture, which is cool when you see it all coming together.",1
English 101: I will no take him again. He can't give feedback and has a very hard time explaining what he would like from you in your papers. I had to asked him for an example of a college thesis for the first 2 months. Also he takes way to long to grade paper. It took him a week to grade 8 days to grade a paper that was required to be done in 2.,0
best professor i've ever had. makes everything interesting and fun.,1
Easy A and loved his lectures. You have 1 apa paper and chapter take-home quizzes. I recommend renting the book if you want to fly through without too much effort. Definitely would take again!,1
"TAKE HER EMOTIONS CLASS DURING WINTER OR SUMMER SESSION! During those times, she lets you take the tests open book/open note. During the regular semester it's closed book/notes and there's so much information that it would be extremely difficult. When open notes, impossible not to get an A. Papers clearly explained she gives grading guide. Easy A.",1
"Professor Perkins is one of the best professors at Fordham. I took both of my theology courses with him and would take another class with him if I had the time. I really like his style of teaching &he picks texts that are relevant, and fun to read. He has interesting lectures and really cares about his students. Honestly can't recommend him enough.",1
"I do not recommend. She is a very hard teacher. As you can see, I'm not the only one to say. Test averages range from 50-60 and she does not curve. 4.0 is a 98%? Almost impossible.",0
"Dr. Branch is phenomenal. He made such a huge difference in my first semester at UNR and I am so grateful. He's a tough grader, but your writing will most definitely improve. He knows his stuff and he cares about his students--what else could you ask for? Also, he made a typically boring topic (documentary) incredibly interesting. Would take again!",1
His quirky persona makes the class very enjoyable. From day 1 he gave me a new lens to look at society through which i used in the course material as well as outside the course. Gives clear feedback and assisted me in my growth as a writer. A few papers (as usual in an English course) and a few free writes. Very approachable person and great class.,1
"He REALLY likes to ramble about lots of topics that have nothing to do with music. It was a lot of ""talking at you"". I was annoyed and didn't feel prepared for quizzes. I passed them because he posts the actual quiz on D2L for you to study from but really you can just memorize the answers. Hes real political and a ""attack/blame the government"" guy.",0
"She definitely is a character and is willing to help students, but I think she can step up on teaching. Not really organized and too much time spent on story time",0
"Avoid at all costs. Refused to answer students questions on designated exam review days, because he ""didnt know if the questions would work out"". Lectures last an average of 20 minutes",0
"Amazing teacher! I took her for an 8 week summer course and was nervous about so many speeches and tests in a short time. She is a motivator. She will help you in the direction you want the speech to go. She made the most dreaded class for most absolutely great. If you try, you will do well. ",1
"Arevelo is a terrible teacher. She has a very heavy accent which makes it difficult to understand her lecture, as well as making it easy to loose focus and interest. If you have to miss an exam the only time you can make it up is 2 days before the final(she will not budge with this even if you have a good reason). Test are very hard. DO NOT TAKE!",0
"very helpful, but kind of ""creepy"". real nice guy and really knows what he's talking about.  would highly recommend for chem lab",1
"If you are terrible at math, avoid this class at all costs! She barely knows how to speak English. Her explanations just leave you more confused. You are better off watching Youtube videos for an explanation than listening to her.",0
I would not recommend taking this class online. It is a HUGE time commitment. It will not be the kind of class that you can just blow through.,0
She is such a sweetheart. She answers every question you ask and she keeps you interested. I love when she tells us she won't tell us any stories and then she does anyway.,1
I loved Julie for research! She cares so much about us in the online format and has given us so many opportunities to practice our skills with practice quizzes and activities. She highlights the important information we need to know for tests and has been so sweet.,1
Be prepared to use the text book. All the information needed for the quizzes is in it. Be prepared to write.,1
"Great teacher! I took the combined Math 115/116 class. This class is a LOT of work and a lot of homework is assigned. Attendance is a must and you will use your book. I learned more about math in this class than any other math class. If you are serious about learning algebra, I suggest this class. Teacher is always available to help.",1
She expects her students to excel by their own efforts. Does not waste time with excuses and shoddy work. You will learn in her class if you show up and do your work. She does not play favorites and is an experienced professional. One of the few gems at Columbia College.,1
"she condescending and a showoff. i dont she realizes that some of the students are only there cause their major requires a writing intensive course. she expects ivy league work from average students. the readings are dry as the Sahara desert, its like pulling teeth. she will call you out if she knows you dont like her. she has spies everywhere!",0
"Best CRJ professor I've ever had. Not only do you learn the material, you have a great time in class and actually look forward to going. She's funny and kind yet serious when she needs to be but trust me, SHE DOES NOT PLAY so do not take advantage of her kindness; otherwise assignments are fair and tests are cake, make sure to study!",1
Pretty much just talks about himself for 3 hours. Very boring class but I would recommend you bring other homework and it can become a very nice study time. Study his study guides and you will be fine. Only 3 tests make up your grade.,1
"Very knowledgeable in English, but a very hard grader. If you do not apply yourself and/or are already an excellent writer, you will not receive an A. Very understanding and personable, I would highly recommend meeting with him 1 on 1 to discuss any problems. Challenging course, so don't take it unless you really WANT to improve you English skills.",1
"Oyamont, I know you're reading this. The only complaint I have for your class is that your lectures BARLEY cover the concepts on your study guide. I feel like this class should be offered as a hybrid class since half the time I was looking up studies on the internet more than in your lectures/my notes. Class is okay but very dull. Easy if you try.",1
"Bruce will forever be my boy. Taking his class was the only plus of my semester. Just show up, crack jokes and the information in his lectures become easier to remember which will reflect on your exams.",1
"sounds like someone who did not pass the course last Spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him. He did not even teach the Fall, 2016!",1
"this class is easy. I never showed up and almost got an A. there's lots of reading but you can skim through it and understand. I did not enjoy his class AT ALL, how much he talks about himself or off topic conversations in class is ridiculous and the reason why I stopped attending class. Basically taught myself everything I needed.",0
"Mr. Riley was a good teacher for the most part, he is nice and approachable and will listen to any questions. Bio 101 was a little hard but it is definitely possible to get an A if you work for it; some people got 95 or 100 on the tests and others got 60s. Overall, he wasnt my fav teacher ever, but hes still a good choice",1
Logic 1 - Really nice & funny guy but class was awful. He isn't very good at teaching but he tries his best to explain things to you BUT ALWAYS digresses. No quizzes. Exams have no study guides or sheets. The book is ancient and the language makes it impossible to understand. Not an easy class so unless it's ur major don't take it.,1
"I'm currently still enrolled in Hur's class; class hasn't been in for even a week, but I hope to stop anyone from taking his class. Not only is he hard to understand and condescending, he loves to hear himself talk. I work full-time and my grandfather passed a few days ago, and he interrupted class to tell me to stop yawning.   Do NOT take him.",0
I love Jason he was literally the greatest and I will miss not having him as a professor anymore.,1
"She seems to be a nice person and tries to help her students. Its just a shame that for our Calc II class she tries to get us to do more teaching than herself. I often also feel unprepared to do the homework, and she doesn't offer much guidance.",0
Due dates basically don't matter.  I honestly think you could turn in every single assignment on the day of the final exam and he probably wouldn't care.  I thought he did a great job teaching this class.  He is very helpful if you need help and gives good feedback on assignments.  I recommend his AutoCAD class,1
"If you will listen to what she tells you, it is an easy class. She often straight up tells you the important parts of tests. Her tests are not easy but if you study they are managablr. Her lab is even better, but for lab you will be in her room the entire time. Do not expect to leave early.",1
I took her class in 2013. After finishing the class I still didn't know how to say more then a few words. I learned more on my own than by taking the class. Most of the people in the class knew some French and some had French parents or lived in France. This meant the pace for was too fast for me. She did not try and slow things down.,0
Great professor. Algorithms was very interesting.,1
I wish I would have taken another professor to be perfectly honest.,0
"Do not expect full credit on anything, even when it is deserved. She is a tough teacher who treats you like professional journalists. If you are anything BUT a journalism concentrator, do not take this class anyway. Find something else. I would not recommend taking her, she doesn't teach at all. No tests or quizzes, just articles and blog project.",0
I would've liked there to be more clarity in what she expects. This class is more like an independent study than an actual class. I expected some kind of lecture but got nothing.,0
"She is a great teacher. She is not hard at all. She is very specific about what she wants and what you should expect from her class. This is an easy A if you do the class work, follow directions, read, and study. She gives out a lot of work but its very easy.  You will pass the class if you STUDY and COMPlETE YOUR WORK!! She well help if you ask :)",1
"She was very understanding in her online class and she was open-minded to situations that prevented work from being submitted in time. I didn't see her face-to-face and I don't know how she is otherwise, but she was very understanding towards me. Thumbs up for if you're taking the class online.",1
"If you want your assignments to be graded fast, they wont be. You NEED to be able to retain information from reading because half of your grade is based on study guides from the text. He is specific on his quizzes so youll need extensive notes. He seems to know what hes talking about but taking it online is extremely stressful and not worth it.",0
God Bless Dr. Rhoads. He is a great guy but awful prof. My advice to everyone in Analytical chemistry buy a chegg subscription.,0
etremely helpful and willing to go extra for the students.. fair grader! take his classes,1
"Ms. Carter was professional and consistent with her teaching and helpful qualities. She applied real life examples of her work to the lessons so that we could understand the material  rather than memorizing, which most are use to Students who had issues with her were those who thought they would get good grades and not work for it Class had several",1
Thinks she's funny,0
Dr. R challenged me to meet my potential. She is tough as nails but sharp as a swiss knife. Outstanding researcher and great fashion sense)))) Oh and she is soooo pretty)))) Definitely a role model for women in research professions,1
"Honestly one of the best professors I've had because she's not like the rest. She teaches how to care about the world around us, not how to pass a test. She's very passionate about science and will have you hooked on caring for the earth by the end of the semester. She's funny, caring , super laid back, and super flexible.",1
A great professor with a lot of experience and knowledge on the topic. You take online quizzes that are generally pretty easy if you pay attention and take notes. He also has a great sense of humor and does his best to work with you if you're struggling. Great guy!,1
"This instructor was great for the class. He really showed that he cared about us getting to the right project. After I found the project, he showed me very good pointers. A little harsh on the grading but I also missed some stuff. Clear explanations and instructions. I would take another class with him.",1
"Dr. Kenzig provides feedback on assignments, but it is vague and not helpful. The amount of work each week is overwhelming, beware if you work full time. I would not take another class with this professor as she is a lazy professor with a completely chaotic and unorganized course structure. 10/10 DO NOT recommend.",0
"Dr. Jimmerson is a fantastic teacher.  She generates interest in English.  She grades hard, though.  Her tests can be pretty difficult as well. She provides Bonus opportunities to make up for any bad grades.  I recommend her, but expect to work for your grade.",1
"I didn't really enjoy the ""old school"" format of the class with lessons on the whiteboard and all. I would have probably liked opre 3360 more. However, this class is super easy and if you show up and take good notes you will definitely get a good grade. He's also super helpful in office hours so meet up with him whenever you have questions.",1
"I had Dr. Sullivan for Human Sexuality and she was extraordinary. She spoke plainly and was easy to understand, and if you didn't do homework (which was writing two questions you had from that week's chapter) she was very understanding and willing to work with you. There's a small work load. Your final's a paper and there are no tests or quizzes.",1
"Adam Gerritsen is hands down the best professor I have ever taken at SUNY Cortland. As a senior, trust me, if you have to take a biology course, and this man's name pops up, TAKE HIM!!!",1
"Professor Gilbert was inspirational, and so good-looking too ;)",1
"Dr. Jones is by far the best English teacher I've ever had. She motivated me to write about a topic I truly care about, and was really supportive and gave great feedback throughout the semester.",1
"You enter this class thinking that you will feel better about your efforts, when in contrast you leave feeling like a idiot. He makes it out that you will succeed, but makes it near impossible to get a decent grade. VERY monotone, so I warn you DO NOT TAKE HIM",1
"Most of the work for this class was classwork and was guided by her. You don't have to buy a textbook for this class, but you will have to get TopHat, which is just as expensive. The test are open note. As long as you do something for the class, you should pass.",1
"Just take class with someone else. If you have children, a job, any other responsibilities, if you have any form of ADD/ADHD. You will fail. The amount of information your expected to absorb and retain is unreasonable for the time frame. The amount of writing is ridiculous. Lets face it, your not at Harvard its GCTCS. She doesnt act accordingly.",0
"Gray is like that grandma that you kinda avoid because she pinches your cheeks. If you don't show up to class (attendance stated not mandatory), you will miss the in class assignments and cant make them up. Her tests are easy if you glance at the power point, book, and highschool biology, Mid term is a take home test during spring break. Forum too.",0
She was horrible from beginning to end. Told us we would use txt book but she did not teach from it at all. Didnt follow syllabis or anything. Very smart smart. Treated the class like high school students. Gave take home test on material not covered in class but was found in text book.,0
Does not cover some course material in class or in his notes. If you don't have the textbook you won't know about this material and it will likely come up in an assignment or exam as a surprise to you.,0
"This teacher is BAD! NEVER TAKE A 8week course with her because i was one of her first.    She crammed 16 weeks into a 8week class every assignment + extra work the 16 week class didnt do!!!      Class is online basically and u must read book because she doesnt explain anything and makes u feel like an idiot if you ask her a question, very mean too",0
"Marshall gave engaging lectures and she is clearly passionate about literature. The midterms can be difficult, but there is a lot of extra credit so take advantage early even if you think you are fine. She is also very accessible so go to her for questions and make sure to get ahead on the cumulative essay which is also graded pretty difficulty.",1
The tests were extremely difficult had a 46.5% average. I would of had a B in the class but right before the end he said APLIA wasn't working correctly and completely dropped the homework grade causing me to drop a letter grade.,0
"This professor is extremely difficult. Genetics is a difficult class through and through but Dr. Jone's makes it ridiculously difficult. On our past test, no one made A or B and the average was a 58. She thinks we are doing well though. Do not plan on taking this class and coming out with a good grade even if you study at least a week in advance!!",0
This lady is crazy! She doesn't keep on track and often you have no idea what she is saying. She skips a lot of information and expects you to understand it for her exams. The textbook is awesome but she only uses info from her slides which often is different from the textbook. Good luck understanding her in class.,0
"Putnam is a good professor. Study guides for every chapter are very helpful. Talked a lot about morality and law and different cases, which was very interesting. Doesn't post the slides on Bb, and occasionally moves quickly, so I recommend taking notes on a laptop. He will call you out in front of everyone if you talk during his lecture.",1
I had Professor Dattolo for Spanish I and 2 and I am am glad I did. Not only did i learn so much from him but he restored my belief that there are still professors at WPU who really care. He is clear in his explanations and if you ever need extra help or advice he is always there for you. I wish more professors were like Professor Dattolo!,1
"Do not take this class unless you already know the material beforehand, He does not teach, he sits at the front and types in a bunch of code and if you are not sitting in the front row you cannot hear him. Best advise is to take this course at another college.",0
"Nice professor ,but she assigns 20+ pages to read for homework, and  gives quizzes over it the next day, she is also quiz crazy. A chapter quiz every Monday, essay quiz every Wednesday, map quiz every Friday  on 15 out of 60 places and both chapter and map quizzes are hard. Her exams are the quizzes. Don't take if you are loaded with courses.",0
"Professor Marin is such a sweet and overall wonderful person; however, she forgets what she has or has not assigned and assumes that everyone already knows ASL. Since I grew up signing, the class was an easy A, but for the students who had never taken ASL before, they barely or did not pass at all. Don't take this class if you do not know ASL!",0
"Dr. Lawrence is incredibly kind and considerate, and I think he's a good teacher. He knows what he's talking about, and he's open minded. However, this class is tough. It's a ton of work, and I feel like I missed a lot of good information from the readings because I felt rushed. I liked the content--there was just too much of it.",1
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
pire prof que j'ai eu. rend le cours très difficile volontairement. Évitez ce prof.,0
"Sarcastic and rude.  Does not care about her students and loves to kick people out of lab for any reason she can find.  Wrote up 25 students for academic dishonesty in one semester. Many of which claim was a false accusation and had to get appealed.  Doesn't grade anything on time, doesn't give good directions, and takes off points any chance given",0
"He is extremely old fashioned but also very thorough with presentations and papers. You'll learn a lot. However, if I were to take this class again I'd 100% take it from someone else. Some of his grading is a complete joke. I feel like if he decides your a B student, you'll be a B student for every paper/assignment. Very nice guy though.",0
Awful grader. Even if you got every answer right she can still take points off  for millions of reasons. She made a lot of mistakes in class but she wants you to be accurate as a machine in the meantime. In order to get a perfect score you have to split hairs on every question even if it has nothing to do with math.,0
"Yes, this class was absolutely atrocious. I tried twice; both times I got completely left in the dust. Quizzes are due in the middle of the day with arbitrary start/end times instead of at midnight, so I always missed quizzes with no make-up. Complains about students emailing her, but if you have so many students emailing you there's a PROBLEM.",0
"Professor Esposito is PHENOMENAL!!! He is extremely passionate about what he teaches, and I adore his ""pathos"" during lectures. Everyone who gave him a low rating probably didn't put in the effort to do well in the class. He is the best and I would take him again 100 times if I could. Loved this class!",1
Worst professor I have ever had at UB . I wish there were more professors teaching this course that are inspirational and encouraging to their students. If you take him be prepared to have a semester filled of stress and depression. It does not matter how much you try he will always find problems with your work and just wants more and more.,0
"Shes slow on grading, she doesnt put in all grades, she didnt put in my class midterm grade so no one knew where they stood, and the final grades were posted 3 weeks after the date they were suppose to come out. This was literally last semester FALL 2017.",0
"Professor Wood is just amazing overall! I was really indecisive at first when choosing a professor for my Comstd 2 class because I saw mixed reviews but I'm really glad I chose her. She wants you to succeed! There are 3 speeches, 3 exams, a few quizzes (about 4) and the homework is really easy. Remember to practice, practice, practice!!!!",1
I wrote previously about my first class with him and he is an amassing teacher! Very passionate. Definitely recommend taking him! ( I chose the wrong rating ) wish there were more stars to give cause he's that awesome!!!,1
I had him for College Algebra and Trigonometry and received A's for both courses. He makes it easier on us because he goes over projects and thr test review packets that are identical to the take home and in class exams. During in class exams we're able to use our notes as well. If you're going into higher maths I wouldn't recommend him.,1
I don't understand what he says half the time. He looks like he knows his stuff but he does not seem to be able to teach us the material. Disorganised. The lectures are difficult to follow.,0
Great Teacher!!!!!!! however you will have to read outside of class.  The quizzes are not hard but they are also not the same. She does know what she is talking about. Her teaching just was not for me. I am more visual and hands on.,1
"Worst professor at CBC. Felt as if I was doing fine but he did not enter grades until there was less than 2 weeks left in the quarter. Turns out, he is a stupidly hard grader, and I was not doing near as hot as I assumed. Incredibly rude in class, ridicules students for ""dumb"" questions. Lectures are meaningless garbage which do not help at all",0
"It's evident from her teaching that she's not the BEST professor, but certainly you could do worse. She's known by students to be very rude and generally unavailable. Honestly, if you take this class with her you'll pass and getting an A isn't difficult, but if you can avoid it...",0
:-/,1
"She's a great professor.  She teaches well.. quizzes aren't that bad but her exams aren't easy.. so you have to study your material really well.  But I recommend her if you want a nice, laid back teacher.  I wouldnt take Baccari or Cunningham... they are way too fast paced....",1
She is a horrible professor and shouldn't be teaching. She is a very tough grader and doesn't teach a lot in her classes. All she does is read of the powerpoint and the material on the test isn't anything we talked about in class.,0
She doesnt even teach at all. I paid 500 bucks for her to literally send out an article with a discussion and some puny quizzes. Then she gives you a bad grade because she doesnt agree on your opinion. Horrible professor and doesnt accept any late work even if you have a legit excuse. She sets her deadline at 10:00 at night. AVOID MARY LOUIS,0
DEAN DOESN'T KNOW HIS RED PINE FROM HIS SCOTCH PINE!,0
Worst teacher ever!! I did not learned a thing in his class and for that I suffered in my next English classes. If you want to learn DO NOT TAKE NORTON!,0
Her tone with the class is very awkward doesn't really connect well with her students. Quizzes are every class period. With the bad flood was forced to miss a class and wasn't allowed to make up work. Very poor teaching methods kinds jumps right in with out giving a strong foundation.,0
"I'm not crazy about his teaching style, nor do I think his powerpoint/lectures are well put together. With that said, he is a very intelligent man w/ a sense of humor. As a working paralegal he is able to tell you about how things really show down in the field. You are going to work in his class, but you come out appreciating it. I recommend.",1
"Although an absolute disaster administratively, Prof Mackenzie is one of the best lecturers I have had at McGill and also one of the most sweetest and generous. The exams were very easy if you went to class and took notes. He also provided and went through past papers that were nearly identical to the exams we had. An absolute gem!",1
"Took it online, the most work I (and the rest of the class) have ever done. Weekly, about 150 pages to read and an average 7 pages SINGLE-SPACED responses, on top of 4 projects. HORRIBLE grader. Completely not worth your time, effort, or GPA. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!",0
"I would totally take another class with Scott.  He's excellent, and I really like how he gives you free reign to do the assignments.  Make sure you at least skim the books for the quizzes; he gives at least one a week.",1
"Just overall so amazing! She's so caring and really wants to make sure that everyone understands the material. I would love to take her again! If you have the choice, make sure you choose her as your bio lab instructor.",1
"Class on policies in Canada, if you know a lot about social policies and social issues in Canada it's quite easy and rather interesting to just listen to. Tests are made to be tricky because it's multiple choice but if you do process of elimination based on what you've learned, you should have little problems. Quiz questions given beforehand.",1
Professor Zheng is so sweet and her class wasn't too difficult. For some if the projects she shows you during class so you have most of it done by then. Follow the rubric for projects and you'll be fine. Her lectures are a little dry but just copy down the notes and you should be good for the 2 exams.,1
sooo easy and she's a really nice person. very passionate about the subject matter. Can be boring alot but still recommend,1
"The start of the course is super boring but once you're past chapter 2 you'll actually want to show up to class, listen, and participate. This is a lecture (I had about 150 people) but Putnam makes sure everyone is on the same page and understands the material. When I was struggling , his office hours changed everything.",1
"You can really tell how much Dr. Eubanks enjoys World lit, when you participate in class discussions ! The class does require a lot of reading (which he provides online), but he does a pretty great job of going over analysis questions/high points of the readings in class. !!!Take notes--will help for the in-class exams!!!",1
"Read the book, don't even bother going to her class unless you're spanish or someone who is very capable of understanding english w/ a heavy spanish accent. She is a really nice lady but her accent doesn't make up for it because if you don't understand her, you're screwed. Good luck to her future students.",0
I don't understand VHDL but managed to finish all homework and project except the last part(project was divided into smaller projects). You can email or ask after class when you are stuck. I think he curved our final exam too.,1
"Dr. Whitt is great. The class moves fast. He assigns hmwk after each class but does not take it up, he reviews the hmwk @ the beginning of the next class. Quizzes are MUCH easier than the mid-term & final,he drops your lowest quiz score. Quizzes 40%, participation 5%, mid-term 25%, & comprehensive final is 30% of your grade.",1
"Stats is a nightmare but Maojoudi made it easier! A lot of homework, but it is worth it. Attendance is a must. Group quizzes once a week. Three tests. A final project. He is very passionate about teaching and is one of those teachers that wants you to finish every class understanding everything. Very sweet man. Best stats teacher at Skyline!",1
"Frank is the best. Plain and simple. One of the best professors at SUNY Potsdam. He's my advisor and he is one of the most helpful, funny, and honest people. He's a wonderful professor.",1
This lady is such a sweetheart and she teaches really good. She's probably the best instructer I've had for English in a long time. She's down to earth and you can tell she really sits down and takes the time to read your paper and help you improve on it.,1
"I have no clue why students gave him such a good rating. He is a great guy and very knowledgeable but the class is just WAY too much reading and studying to be a 100 class. Be prepared to read every night, hard test, and pop quizzes. He is also a hard grader when it comes to the assignment. He's a really cool guy but be ready to put a lot of effort",0
This is probably one of the most challenging Classes I have taken. Proffessor Robertson expects a lot out of her students. You have one big research paper throughout the whole semester and a final group project. Personally i feel like a lot of her assignments were rushed and required a lot of crunch time . But i will say I learned a lot.,0
"This guy is a massive waste of time. Not responsive to questions or emails, didn't prepare for class, (didn't even SHOW UP for the first class) and I don't think he even knows how to use his computer.",0
"Professor Sbragia is incredibly passionate about the course material, and he makes it easy to be interested in the material. By far one of my favorite professors I've had",1
"Good teacher overall, but very tough grader.  Be sure to be very attentive to grammer, APA style writing etc. She was a fast communicator and would reply to emails quickly.",1
very hard class and though grader. readings are confusing,0
This class was a breath of fresh air for a summer course.  Nice way to wind down the year.,1
Awful class Worse class I have ever taken.  She will not review tests answer questions or give examples.  doesn't appear to value students at all When we pointed out incorrect test answers she refused to give us credit for them,0
"Pat is actually a really smart teacher, when you're taking his course you will feel it cause you'll not be able to understand what's going on at the most time (maybe because I'm not smart enough). The midterm worthed a big percentage, and there're totally different things in his assignments. Anyway, happy to say goodbye :)",0
Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,0
"I got fooled by all the glowing comments. This teacher rewards the ones who does not work by extending deadlines more than once, and we who got bags under our eyes, giving everything before it was due, got nothing. Waits until you lost all of your sleep to anounce extensions. Very harsh grader. Not an iota of extra credit. Regret taking her.",0
I had her for UE this summer and learned a lot. The class was fun and she's great to have a conversation with!,1
My kind of professor. Always ready to listen and help. My only headache with the class was too many weekly assignments. I just couldn't cope attending classes and working two classes. But the professor understood my plight and worked out alternative deadlines for assignment submissions with me.,1
"Her lectures were okay, but not very logical and were extremely repetitive. I would definitely have had trouble making an outline of her main points throughout the semester. The material was interesting, though Sometimes her obsession wight he entire lecture hall being completely focused on her was obnoxious and came off as arrogant.",0
DO NOT TAKE!! Failed to communicate - took 3 weeks to answer questions regarding mid-term. Mid-term and final are essay formats. He is not organized and doesn't seem to be engaged or knowledgeable. Do yourself a favor and choose another professor.,0
While Mrs Yang is a very kind professor her ideas over group work are less than ideal. She will assign people to random groups at the beginning and at the middle point of the semester. Group work sometimes isnt bad but when you get stuck with a bad group it hurts your grade bad. The professor also did nothing as one or two groups had conflicts.,0
Slow grader,0
He is a really nice man.  Lovable old guy.  I had a really good experience in his class because he is so smart and helpful! Thank you Mr. O!!!!,1
"Erin Griffin is hands down the most incredible professor I have had.  Always helpful, extremely brilliant, and knows exactly how to articulate complex information in a way that anyone can understand.  Her exams are taken directly from her power points and she is extremely organized in lecture, and the lab.  I highly recommend this professor!",1
This class was hard only 3 tests which count for 90% of your grade. My advice for any students interested in majoring in business stay away from buiness adminstration if you are not good in certain class,0
his pre recorded lectures SAVED me for Math 1500. very clear and good explanations. wish there was more practice problems though,1
"Very nice, caring and funny. Shes easy going, chill, and very open minded to any questions you have. Youll definitely understand the homework easily if you just pay attention in class. Its College after all. She does give out a lot of homework but the good thing is, she gives you enough time to work on it before its due. Would take her again!",1
"If you enjoy being tested on material not covered in class, go ahead and take this class.  I don't so I dropped it.  Worst teacher I've ever had, if you see this mans name, get as far away from it as possible.",0
"I absolutely loved this class! Professor Nelson's lectures were the easiest to pay attention to and very well organized. And he tells you exactly what he wants on tests, quizzes, and papers which is so helpful. Also, he has a great sense of humor which always helps makes things more interesting. Take this class!!!",1
I had him for history. it only consists of 3 pop quizzes a midterm and final. it was pretty challenging. honeslty I only passed because I copied the guy next to me. I got a C in everything and I passed the class. but its my fault I should of reviewed my notes as well as the books. that is all you have to do. just review everything and you will pass,1
"Sooo hard. she clearly doesnt know how to teach, students corrected her all the time, and her tests were very hard. I even had tutoring and still failed. and she had assigned seating and in alphabetical order, what is this gradeschool? DO NOT TAKE HER, i took math 125 the next semester and got an A.",0
"Best organization of all the 12X classes I've taken. Expectations were clear, and Prof went above and beyond to help me succeed. I emailed about struggling to meet the deadlines, and he met with me over ZOOM and gave me permission to turn work in late for full credit! Course was still very demanding and moved really fast, though.",1
"If you can avoid this professor, literally do it. Her online site is beyond convoluted and she doesn't make expectations clear. If you forget to turn something in, good luck. She also responds to emails in the rudest way. Seriously don't know how she got so many good reviews. Avoid, avoid, avoid!",0
I took Ancient Western Philosophy with Prof. Shartin. I was extremely excited about the class until I had him. He is never organized and gave the exact same notes every day. Then didn't understand why 75 percent of the class failed his first quiz when none of the questions pertained to the notes he gave. Steer clear if you like organization.,0
"HARD! does not explain material very well. goes way to fast.  He is so smart that he does not understand basic questions.  SO SMART.  he is funny and a nice guy. you really need to stay on top of things, and you can go to him for help. It's just SOOO much is thrown at you, and fast.",0
Dr. Holgado is an incredible professor. If you show up to every class and you do the work and out in effort she will not let you fail. She genuinely cares about all of her students. She offers TONS of bonus points. She is also always available to help you outside of class if you need it.,1
"Some days he is hands off and lets the student ""leaders"" lead the newspaper but other days (most days) we are mindless drones just making the stories and pages the way he tells us.  He makes you dumb down your writing then talks to you like your dumb.  I want to write for the NY Times, not the press telegram, thank you!  Made me hate journalism",0
"Dr. Liu is an AMAZING professor. If you're taking COMM3353 with her, you won't regret it. Each assignment has step-by-step video instructions. She gives you feedback and if you correct, you get FULL credit. Assignments are lengthy in time so you do need to set aside time for them. Overall, love this class and appreciate Dr. Liu a lot.",1
"I was hesitant to take her class because of the poor reviews, but a friend of mine had taken the class prior and encouraged me to take it with her. She became my favorite professor! I loved her class and the discussions we had as a group. She is so funny and has so many stories from her time abroad. I definitely recommend taking her!!",1
"If you take one of his classes be prepared for class you will be called upon to answer questions.  You will be embarrassed in front of the class. Be prepared to provide supporting data for answers.  There is alot of discussion as part of this course, but I did not find it to be a supportive environment.",0
A great and fun class really helps her students get over their fear of public speaking tests are easy doesnt have time limits on speach only upto 5 minutes would take her class again.,1
"Absolutely would never recommend this class to anyone. from day 1, i struggled and went to tutoring 10 hours a week. He didn't know any of our names, he mumbles, marks people wrong for using advanced steps, tries to make his tests ""tricky"" and only gives like 7 problems a test. Doesn't look up when being talked to, or fully answer questions.",0
"Good instructor, respectful to all the students and makes sure that the requirements and materials are clear. Also easily approachable outside of class.",1
"Professor Veliz was my introduction to Computer Science, and it was a great one! He really helped me develop my skills and encaouraged me to be involved in more activities. He is really good at explaining, and accesible outside of class. His grading is also very clear and he is alwasy willing to help. If you can, take him! You will learn a lot :D",1
"He is unclear with what he wants and he grades only a few assignments, he is a very tough grader and you have to write exactly what he wants. His lectures are all over the place and lazy. He is sometimes outright rude to his students. It is possible to get an A in his class but you have to work hard and play by his rules and not get too offended.",0
very nice professor everyone likes the way he impart the class.he gives you advice of what questions would be on tests. he tell you what to study for possible questions very nice. i liked a lot his class. he won't teach for long only 2 more semesters and he will be gone so take his classes you wont regreat,1
"Love, loved her. Learned more on my 2 quarts with her than all of HS. hadnt even sat in a class in 5 yrs. Classes and assign were a breeze, aslong as you pay attention and do them.  shes just fun, engaging, has the class participate together, down to earth and has jokes. Loved her in history on films and eng 102. You wont regret her classes.",1
Her test had questions that she never discussed. Finals consisted of things she pulled out of nowhere.,0
"Be aware. He'll say that he wants you to get a ""general understanding of the concepts presented in lecture"", to focus more on the lecture than the readings, which are supposedly to ""complement the material covered in class"". What he will expect on the exam is to refer to several readings per question by both title and author and use specific terms.",0
Awesome teacher!!!! 100% would take again. Passionate about what he does and makes class interesting!! As long as you take notes you will pass!!! Gives extra credit so show up to class!!,1
Goes through slides way too fast for those of us that don't think in math. Comes across arrogant - isn't approachable. Doesn't triangulate book's explanation (especially at the end of the course when he's the author). Expects you to learn software ~and~ scripting/formatting software on your own WHILE learning the actual course.,0
"look elsewhere. bad experience, self learned entire course load.",0
"Rachael is a fantastic teacher-take any of her classes if you're passionate about public relations, she is by far the best. Very motivating and helpful.",1
Great professor. Very intelligent and easy to understand. The best advice is to READ THE BOOK!! All of her tests come straight out of the book and not from lecture. Tests are very difficult but the class is fun overall.,1
"She's really nice and she tries to involve her students into her lectures. Class participation counts but her lectures are interesting. I really enjoyed the class. Expect homework, she gives work about every class but it is nothing to the extreme.  She's a tough grader, but if you participate and do your work it will reflect in your paper grades.",1
Excellent professor. He goes to great lengths to help his students. Definitely take him if you are an EE.,1
"Do not ask a stupid question, he has very limited patience.",0
"Yonn is not only a lovely guy, but also a scholar and an intellectual. The subject matter is always interesting, and his entertaining lectures and fun personality make it all the better. You'll likely have a couple research-oriented papers and a couple quizzes/exams, and that's it. So be sure to do the work and study for tests, and you'll do well.",1
"Class was fairly interesting.  Yet, she makes test very difficult.  Most questions are okay, but she pulls out a few picky things like random stats never mentioned in class.  You will not get an A unless you can nearly memorize the book.  But she is a very good teacher and understands marketing well",1
"Not and easy A, but not the hardest class either. Work load is pretty fair, and he sometimes extends deadlines if he sees consistent work. I would take his class again. Lectures aren't super long or boring. Quizzes are open note which is really helpful. Decent class and teacher over all.",1
He's a very difficult professor.  I didn't feel he was really teaching us because I had a very hard time doing my homework because I didn't understand.,0
tough class. Dr Anikovskiy wants you to do well if you're willing to work for it.,1
"15 points/day depend on whether or not you have a discussion question and you show up. If you don't have MLA memorized, do yourself a favor. She takes off points if you don't. Wouldn't recommend her Women's Studies class. If you don't walk away hating the straight white male, you're not their definition of a feminist. Rubbed me the wrong way.",0
"Dr. Gray is the hardest teacher I have had. Her tests are nearly impossible to ace. Even if you study every day, there is no way to pass. ""A students"" are expected to skip other classes and make appointments to see her. Based on her tests and her snarky comments, she leaves her students feeling helpless, and as though they've been set up to fail.",0
"Professor Benitt spends more time discussing UFO's and Big Foot, than he does teaching Astronomy.  He is obsessed with neatness and completely irrational.  His teaching style is haphazard and confusing.  He is all over the board, which makes it hard to copy down notes. My notebook looked like a treasure with all of the arrows I had to draw.",0
She is really nice BUT she gives alot of reading. You need to read for her!!Tests are detailed and she assigns two textbooks so 3 to 4 chapters to read per week. She also has a 5 pg term paper which she does not mention at all but she still expects you to do it AND  a group project where you are assigned a chapter and have to present.,1
great professor! Her lectures are really straightforward and more interactive with students. She explains chemistry in way that you can actually understand whats going on. Her midterms and finals are based on the concepts learned in lectures/practice exams. Lecture is not mandatory but her discussions are. favorite chem professor!,1
"Terrible prof. Can't understand her English. Had to do difficult calculations, but no one in the class had a clue how to do them. No textbook use, just her lectures. Like a lot of other people,I dropped. Don't take her, and especially not for this class.",0
"Great professor, really enjoyed the class. Its not an easy A by far, but if you go to lecture and pay attention to the powerpoints (which he puts online) youll get an A. Midterm exam and research paper final for Poli-sci methods.",1
"Professor Stein is a solid choice for ENG110. I don't consider myself a great writer, but if you put the effort in, you'll get the grade you want. She isn't lecture heavy and instead uses class time to peer edit essays. Don't hand in an essay on time, no problem because she understand that this is just one of many classes you take.",1
"Such a sweet lady. She will always help you out if you need it, even if that means taking a test earlier or later. She has a very unique personality but it grows on you. Very easy class and does not require much outside work at all.",1
"Mr. Bobby is a funny, caring, and supportive guy. He wants his students to do well. He is tough because it is a tough subject. You have to do your part and be prepared by doing the homework every night. He also requires you to memorize all the formulas which may be difficult for some. In all, hes very helpful and does his best. DONT. BE. LATE.",1
"This is the most unorganized teacher I have ever taken in my life! We have (4) 4-5 page papers due within a 6 week time period. And she couldnt figure out how to work the online system for 3 of those weeks. She didnt even grade out first paper until one week before the summer term was over. If you are in unorganized student, you will not make it.",0
"Prof Harris is a wacky, fun and sweet person. Unfortunately, Her class wasn't the best to deal with. Pros and Cons: Her tests are almost impossible and her feedback consists of: study right before you go to bed and study some more. Labs are repetitive and tiring but They're an easy grade. Homework is easy and she makes it short. GET THE ATLAS!",0
Teaches nothing but theory. Does not show you how to work any problems and then that's all that's on your test!,0
"Extremely helpful, nice, and interesting. Made an otherwise dull class exciting.",1
I personally did not find the class difficult. You do have to read the material. I took the online course. She is very clear on grading. AS long as you read the material and turn on time you will get a good grade. Overall great class,1
"Bushey is HARD. You must put excessive amounts of time in practice aside from homework, to get it fast and be ready for weekly quizzes. He also changes questions unnecessarily and makes it 10x difficult sometimes. He is unfair on time for quizzes, and leaves almost no value in understanding what we are learning, b/c of how fast you must finish.",0
Marek would be easier to comprehend if he stopped taking English lessons from E.T.,0
He may be a smart man but no one can understand him.  He has not done anything to qualify him to be an entrepreneurship professor.  It's amazing that he still has a job because after four years i have not learned a single thing from this man.,0
"Test material not consistent with lecture.  Not a helpful instructor.  Told the class he would curve, and then didn't.  Very poor professor.",0
Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,0
"Assignments are not specific. Whenever I ask her a question, her response is ""refer to the assignment."" Poor grammar that makes the assignments confusing. Posts assignments in modules that are not due that week. Would not recommend this teacher to anyone. I've taught myself more about communications than she's taught me. Teacher's Rate: 0",0
"Your grade is based on one exam, weekly quizzes, recitations, and homework. The professor flies through lecture slides, but lecture recordings are posted. She makes a lot of mistakes in class and can be rude to students. We had to fight for extra credit that was in the syllabus. If you have the option, you might want to choose someone else.",0
"Professor Le gives good lectures although his accent is a little bit strong (it doesnt matter to me). He does give online homework, but not that overwhelming. Just ask if you are confused, he will clear out every problem. He always reviews before the test which is super helpful!",1
"Wonderful teacher, made a tough subject easy to understand. Pay attention and you will pass. Better than other electricity teachers on campus or so I've heard. Make your life a lot easier and take this class.",1
BORING,0
"Very specific requirements for short papers. Claims to give excellent resources but deducts points if you use the ""wrong"" resource given. Offers no guidance when you ask how you can meet her standards. The course content is easy however you will spend the semester trying to figure her ways of doing things out. She was relatively fair on discussion.",0
"She was okay in the beginning, but overtime was last minute on things. It took forever to get any grades back. Our project was started later than it needed to be. I enjoyed the group project where you work with a real company and do their marketing. My group members were great. Also Karani did not like me bc of where I live and I found that rude.",0
"Gets offended by people not coming to class in a lecture with over 200 people. This is college, people shouldn't be punished in lecture courses. She does these industry exercises randomly in lecture throughout the semester so it keeps kids coming cause they dont know when they'll happen. First lecture I've never been able to use my phone or laptop.",0
"Michael is one of my favorite professors at BU. His class has made me a better speaker and writer. He'll return any assignment to you with a *ton* of feedback, but it's because he really wants to help you improve. At the same time, he's very compassionate and respects the work you put forward. He grades most harshly on grammar and spelling.",1
I studied with this professor 11 years ago but she was the most dynamic and stimulating professor I had in undergrad.She encouraged the students to come up with ideas instead of stating all content herself and moved the lecture on by getting the students to make the logical connections leading to the arguments she was presenting in class.,1
She doesn't like you to ask questions. She seems annoyed most of the time. Lots of work in this class! Not hard but lots of a busy work. The lab is an online program that is irritating to work with. She can't get her info correct because she's a set it and forget it professor. She forgets to make course/term updates in canvas. Hard to contact her.,0
Lots of work but you can get a good grade if you work for it,1
"Dont get me wrong, shes a nice Prof as a person.",0
"This teacher is very passionate about his class. However, he is extremely unorganized and does a poor job at keeping your attention during class. He goes off about things that are irrelevant of the lecture. I would NOT recommend taking him for government",0
She can be confusing. First few weeks I had no idea what was going on. I know some people who dropped CSC altogether because they just didn't get her and some changed professors. Although I hear she is open to help.,0
"As of Fall '19 the curriculum became faster-paced, but she was able to keep her plans together and keep the class afloat. Utilizes creative review games from her high school classes, and quizzes and presentations are very clear and simple. PLENTY of collaborative review and even group quizzes at times. You get out what you put in.",1
"The most boring class I have ever taken. He lectures every class. You look around and 90% of the people are either asleep or watching Netflix. This class is nothing but abstract, liberal ideology that makes no sense. But its an easy A honestly.",0
"A real stickler when it comes to attendance and grading and doesn't forgive mistakes at all (won't even reply to emails for explanations). I accidentally turned in a wrong paper and even though he knew, didn't mention anything until giving back my grade and wouldn't accept my actual paper. Jerk. Take this class with a different professor.",0
"Hard, but I actually learned something",1
"I found Kayoung to be quite annoying, the lectures to be lengthy and stale, and the class to be very demanding for an introductory course. If this is not specific to your major, I would recommend avoiding.",0
"I think Tip may have had some stuff going on this semester, but he never grades our assignments and is not clear on instructions. The grade is mostly based on speeches and we are almost done with the semester and he has not graded any of them. The assignments he gives are long and tedious. Would not recommend this professor.",0
"I never took a class with her, but I went to a counseling meeting with her and she is pretty mean. Im a smart student, I know what I am doing, but I always check in with a counselor to make sure that I am on track. She said that I should change majors and apply to easier schools....I cant believe they let this women be a counselor, let alone teach!",0
"Overall easy class. Do your work on time. Go to class to participate in discussions. Group project throughout the whole semester, fairly simple.",1
"Hillarious guy, just a lot of on-line homework",1
Macro is difficult but his help and encouragement really made a difference for me.,1
"Most sporadic, unorganized professor ever. Not clear, changes her mind. Your grade is dependent on whether or not she likes you, emphasizes group work then will give members of the group different grades. Plays favorites. Rudest person I've ever met ",0
"Not only is McFaul strict, but he's very difficult to be around with and like to use his power to bully students in his classroom. What does annoy me and other students is his egotistical personality. When anyone tries to communicate with him, he will make his students feel stupid as he humiliates he occurs all the time In school.",0
"Doug Thiel is an awful professor. Makes you buy his book that has so many mistakes it is unreadable. Tests, papers, and discussion are based on this book. He will grade you down for the same stuff he fails to do. He is also very rude with feedback. I got an A but I cried every night lol. Save yourself.",0
"His online statistics course was super informative, and he made it easy to understand the concepts.",1
Terri is awful. Went to every single class just to get the 5 extra credit points to salvage my grade to a FREAKING D-!!!!!!!! Hardest tests. Very knowledgeable about this but refuses to share with students. Not willing to help students and talks to you like youre stupid. Doing this instead of studying for the final bc its a lost cause at this point,0
"Professor Connelly is one of my favorite professors.  Not only is he a W&L institution in his own right, but he is passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter, cares about his students, and does not assign crazy amounts of reading.  Highly recommend.",1
"Doesn't keep promises on when he will grade stuff. His notes are over 30+ pages because he gives a lot of extra flip flap about personal stuff you don't need to know. When you ask for cut and dry clarity, he still gives you a lot of flip flap. It's supposed to be an online class, yet you have to take the tests in person. The final is cumulative!!!!",0
"Professor Bibis is a great person. Helpful, understanding, sense of humor, super knowledgeable, smart, and enthusiastic about biology. I recommend him to anyone who is interested in learning Microbiology in an easy environment. I also took him for lab. The best of the best! Thank you professor.",1
"Mrs. Fox is tough, but diamonds are the hardest rock, and this one's a real gem. Stick it out and work your ass off and you'll learn so much.",1
"Take this class! Super easy! Tests are simple if you study all the notes online. Attendance is not mandatory but it is extra credit on tests. Lectures can get boring, but still a great class.",1
"She's not a bad teacher, but she's really weird and intense, she makes me uncomfortable. If you work hard you could probably manage a B+ but if you kiss her butt you can probably get an A",0
He spent the first six weeks culling the class with nearly impossible exams and grading the weekly homework with an iron fist. Things got easier the second half but by no means easy. He offers extra credit which meant me spending $70 to see a live performance so I could do even more work in this work heavy class. Extremely serious and passionate.,0
Professor Rice is very rude to students. She takes forever to grade quizzes and lab reports. She is a tough grader on both (especially lab reports). I got anxiety walking to her class because I was worried I had done something wrong and she would kick me out of lab (which she did one time because a student wore the wrong type of socks). Avoid her!,0
"Darwin is a great guy. Dry sense of humor, can be pretty dull in lectures, but he's a great guy who really cares about his students and loves the material. But for some reason, his exams are significantly harder than any of the practice problems or the text book problems. He curves which is nice, Definitely possible to get an A, but its not easy.",1
His exams are fairly predictable but he is a total male chauvanist.  Doesn't think girls have any place in geology... or the world for that matter.  avoid at all costs.  he's been around since the university opened.  hopefully he'll retire soon,0
"I took this class during winter session. So it was a 6 week accelerated course, with a lot of information to take in, in a very short period of time. She did an excellent job of covering the material so everybody could understand it, and was willing to help students personally if they were confused on anything.",1
Not nearly as easy or enjoyable as some claim.  The homeworks are rediculous and unnecessarily hard.,0
Just read from power point slides. Tests were really unfair as many questions weren't even discussed in class. Extremely vague study guide for Final exam. Would not take another class from this instructor.,0
"Do not take this Professor! She is terrible at communicating and, even as an expert in her field of Islam and Politics, is incredibly close-minded. She does not use the textbooks consistently and assigns online readings. In class, she asks specific, unimportant questions on the readings that you will not remember. she cares about her students tho.",0
This teacher does not really teach. Yes the computer exams are relatively simple however teacher not very interactive. Kind of sarcastic but not in a pleasant way. Does not really engage with students and does not respond to questions from students.,0
Very good.,1
Did not like the man,0
"A math genius, and cares about his students!!!",1
She takes attendance EVERY class! Actually paying attention is optional. Don't bother buying the book; everything is in the powerpoints she gives you. You must memorize absolutely everything in those slides though. Tests are lots of multiple choice and a few essay style Q's. Read Q's very carefully. Will have a paper and group pres at the end.,1
If you want to fail - take her,0
"Professor Peters is brand new but she is great.  She is honest and tells you exactly what she wants on assignments.  She is also understanding and will extend a deadline if people are struggling.  Very fun class because she has a great sense of humor.  Not too difficult of a grader but is crazy for APA, she can see a 1.5 inch margin a mile away.",1
Wouldnt recommend.,0
DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. Lots of readings and if you forget to read he takes points off. Only quizzes and half the stuff is not in the readings or talked about in class. One absence is 5 points off your attendance grade which makes a difference. Lectures in a socratic method; basically whatever he wants to talk about that day.,0
"Dr. Anderson is an awesome person and professor. His class grades are based on a rank system, so it's basically a competition with you and your classmates. His tests are extremely difficult. He is very knowledgeable and just a great guy. The scientific paper for lab is very difficult, but I learned so much in this course.",1
I love Kim Sunsaengnim! She is very easy to learn Korean from and makes the classroom a fun but also very memorable environment. My Korean has come to me so much faster from her class than just trying to learn by myself.,1
"Save your time and money. This was the worst chem 1 class I've ever taken. from the lectures to examples she just does for you. You don't have a chance to really Learn the material. The homework is online, not very useful and takes time. its expected you know everything before you walk through the door. You can fail, even if going everyday",0
"Dr. Hollis is a super tough grader but his lectures are clear and interesting if you like biology. He is definitely a challenge but if you really want to learn, hes a solid choice. Super nice guy in and out of class, and makes an effort to help anyone who needs it.",1
"Amazing and very easy class. Lectures are fun and you can tell he knows what he's doing, I would highly recommend him to anyone looking into criminal Justice.",1
she is awesome! its 4 exams. the first 3 exams are pretty simple but final is a little harder. she lets you take the first 3 exams twice and takes the higher grade. she gives a practice final test you can take for extra credit but none of those questions were actually on my final. & one essay on a psychologist. She cares. TAKE HER CLASS! EASY A!,1
"This class is horribly boring, it is impossible to follow the lecture becuse she is jumping all over the place and very unclear. Attendence is graded so you have to come to class. Tests are easy though, but this was literally the worst class I have ever taken at UMass.",0
really bad teacher by far the worst asl teacher I had . she is mean let me tell you that if you don't know the signs she will pick on you .,0
TAKE HIS CLASS!!! He is an amazing professor that makes class interesting and fun. He uses a lot of video clips and humor to keep you awake. Plus he's British!!,1
amazxing man with a gold heart. very helpful and clear in his teaching manner. wants his students to do well and helps with anything that u need. def take him!!!!,1
"Can't use computers during class, very hard grader on papers. Lectures teach you nothing so you'll learn the final material on your own",0
he does NOT teach but super easy A. few journals in class which he barely reads. research paper which he barely read and book review which he did read but all very easy ,0
Great teacher explains things very well. I failed math a few times before having her now I am getting 100's.,1
She is a good teacher who will make sure you know what you are doing before you go on to the next class.,1
It's a language class! IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION OR DO YOUR HOMEWORK YOU WILL FAIL. Don't blame Nadeau! She was great! She gives you all the tools you need to start learning French. I thought it would be very hard to get a grasp on the language but with her help it was very easy. If you're struggling she'll help you. She's very caring and sweet!,1
"Picks favorites. Good teacher, but loves those who are most quirky and out there. And I agree that classes are not grad level.",1
Chet is a very nice man but he doesnt stay on track with his lessons. He tends to rush through the topic of what hes teaching and doesnt necessarily provide the student with an answer to their question. Chet also makes mistakes when grading exams and often gives you a lower grade than what was deserved.,0
"Don't take him!! It's difficult to verbalise just how tedious he is-like a recording of an unfunny Mr. Rogers narrating lectures in slow-motion. Very unclear about requirements, however he spends 20 mins at the beginning of each class repeating the date of every quiz and assignment. Treats you like a child-don't get caught doodling or looking away.",0
"Professor Ray is such a harsh grader for no reason. If you want feedback good luck. The class was converted to online, and he made it 10x worse.",0
He is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is witty and funny as well as understanding. His lectures are actually interesting and he plays guitar for his classes sometimes.,1
"I took his online class, If you want to teach yourself an entire math course this is the class for you. Very little homework, Very little instruction, tests are huge! So if that's how you work great! Also I found he took points off of problems for very small things even when I would get the answer right.",0
I cannot begin to express how amazing this professor is. She was truly one of the best professors I have ever encountered. Super understanding and motivating. she makes her class fun and I actually look forward to doing her assignments. She is truly a gem. You will not regret taking her. The material is so straight forward and she is super organize,1
"One of my favorite professors by far here! He is so energetic, young and caring. He relates to everyone in the classroom and brings humanity into learning. He gives minimal work, and what he does give is so easy to finish. Not a tough grader but makes you think, which I loved. Take him if you get the chance you will not regret it!",1
"Dr. Marchetti is SO nice! She is fun in class, allows group work, and her exams do not have any surprises. She did flipped classroom when I had her and it was extremely effective. She is always available for questions too.",1
Never take class with her ever,0
"Annoying, arrogant, and generally not fun to be around.",0
"We gave 2 individual speeches and 1 group speech. The longest speech was 4-6 minutes. We had 2 tests, but you look the answer up in the book and write it down. Mr I is very understanding, but he is so respectable that you wouldn't  think of taking advantage of it. He transforms his students into public speakers. I highly recommend taking this class",1
"Amazing teacher, wants us to be interactive and enjoy the material. Only have to do worksheets and discussion boards in this class. You won't regret taking her.",1
"Elle est vraiment très gentille, ses examens sont long mais assez facile puisqu'elle n'est pas sévère dans sa correction. Elle écrit toute la matière dans ses powerpoints mais ses cours sont quand même intéressants. Elle pose des questions sur les lectures à chaque cours.",1
David puts in a lot of work/thought in this class. He seems nice but what frustrates me is that you can study for hours on end for his exams/quizzes just to end up failing. I was told that this class would be fun and informative; Lots of people loved FSCN! It's food and science? Seems like fun but trust me. Spare yourself the headache and avoid.,0
She is a tough grader.,0
"I am not done yet. He might have passed his exams and managed to be smart once, but he ain't any more. This guy can't even answer a questions without saying things like: uh emmm uhh what does the boo say. or, eh umm i don't,, uhh what do you think? I have my own opinions about discrimination but since i don't have fact i'm not going to talk about",0
"She is very intelligent about Chemistry,which is why she should NOT be teaching an intro class! She goes way too fast, does not explain stuff on a basic level, and if you ask for help she just confuses you even more. The tests are all online, which means you can google your way through,until the final (which is in class) where you fail. HARD TESTS",0
Just don't take her. I would wait a year to take the class with some other teacher. She's pretty bad. ,0
Worst professor for calc 2 DOES NOT TEACH,0
"This whole class is graded on 4 exams, case studies, and the final. Lectures are dry, heavy, and lengthy and she just reads through them. Definitely study the study guides she gives you and try to ace the case studies. She is really lenient with grades if she sees you putting in effort so actually show up to class!",1
One of the best professors I've had. Quite understanding when it comes to assignment . Have to experience this professor for yourself. Don't listen to other students that spread false rumors about him. Once you enter the classroom you'll realize that those individuals were the problem. He provides additional teaching aids to students.,1
"Albert Cervantes is a joke of a professor. Late to class, sometimes doesn't bother to show up, doesn't grade anything til last minute, gives less points for everything, and overall just a mess. Office hour is non existent as only his assistant are here to help. Probably busy with his other job but that is not a excuse to have poor teaching/ethics",0
Very nice professor. Easy A. Must take her!,1
"I really enjoyed her class, I got the feeling some people were missing her sense of humor, but if you like a little subtle wit with your learning, she's your Prof. Gave great examples, was easy to talk to and ask questions, and helping find answers. Projects are well defined before you start, she gives you a checklist of things to include.",1
"Professor Liberatore is an AMAZING instructor. I loved how straightforward her class was, every reading was useful and went along with the topic of the day. She assigns many readings but they are all worthwhile. I recommend Prof. Liberatore to all of my HAP friends, not because this class is an easy A, but because she helps you grow as a writer.",1
Interesting and patient with people asking questions in class.,1
"Weil is a terrible professor and really is not a teacher. He's a bully and gives zero feedback on papers. Watch your word count, yes he counts words and doesn't read your content of your assignments if they don't have enough word count. He's pompous and ego driven (his ego) BEWARE of this professor and do NOT take him for a class!",0
"The school changed their hesi to mandatory pass once this happened she did a complete flip. Doesn't respond to emails , has an attitude with students , very not understanding to students concerns . Not what we need right before graduation. Take someone else ",0
"Hardest class I've ever taken, but she knows her stuff. Her class took over my laugh. ",0
"This was my second time having Dr. Osborne for a class, and he was as fantastic as the first time. He is very funny and entertaining, and tries to make the texts more relatable. The only thing to watch out for with him is there will be a very intense reading schedule. Your grade will be based on two big tests, a big paper, and a few quiz grades.",1
She's not that bad but she is not the best professor. She was sick for a week and made us write a paper for attendance credit. She also had to remove 9 questions for our last exam taking away 18 points from us and just put one extra credit question to make up for it. She does not give any extra credit and wont budge on it.,0
You can tell he knows his stuff but it is kind of difficult understanding what he's teaching. Tests are difficult.,0
"Professor Meacham is the best professor at UNI. There are A LOT of assignments, although they are quite useful. She quickly responds to emails. I honestly dont like online classes. Professor Meacham makes it bearable. Her course is super organized and everything is quite clear. I would definitely take her.",1
"Great Professor, extremely caring and loves teaching. Her passion is shown through her teachings.",1
"Professor Nordlund is super laid back - not rigid and annoyingly strict at all. His lectures in memory & cognition through CSU were amazing! Easy to pay attention in class. He gave only a few tests, but had study review days for them where he'd go over all terminology on test. Uses techniques that make the material impossible to forget. So helpful",1
"Inconsistent grading.  Like seriously inconsistent.  Get's on her soapbox in class, doesn't really let anyone else talk.  Likes to talk about how busy she is, yet this is her JOB. But really, very inconsistent grading, inconsistent feedback and a lot of work with not much in return.  The college of Ag really needs to rethink this course. ",0
"Professor cares only for literal policy translation, cannot be bothered between classes by any students, is ignorant and callous to student needs. California Issued Drivers Liscence is not enough to prove your identity to him, either student ID or you're treated as an imposter.",0
"Dr. Pittman is by far one of the sweetest and most highly educated professors I've had. I have her for Comparative Religion and Cultural Geography, both good classes. Her lectures are very interesting and packed with interesting, but it's not always relevant to the online quizzes and tests. Overall, wonderful woman and professor!",1
"This guy doesn't cAre about the students, he doesn't have a heart and he will fail you if you don't pass his horrible class. Waste time, waste money he doesNt teach at all. He just read the slides. Don't take him if you wouldn't like to lose your money.",0
My favorite instructor! He's very approachable and will help you in any way.,1
"I understand both students and professors are having a hard time with COVID. But even now, this guy is still such a harsh grader and is still teaching religiously by the book, exceptions are very limited. Even if wifi is hard to come by, Zoom attendance required. Difficulty for exams and labs is ridiculous, pls cut some slack for your students.",0
Take her class! She is great!,1
Professor Russum classes are fun and you will learn something as long as you come and participate.,1
We read through slides everyday. You much read your book or the test will be difficult. She is nice and clear. The test are very hard. ,1
"This is a teacher who loves to what does and what he teaches. He will work with you, joke around and still keep a solid classroom setting.",1
"He is the best teacher ever. He is very nice and welling to help you in anyway he can. He test are not hard if you just study for it. Everything is on the study guide. He seem boring but he is an awesome person and a great teacher, I would take him again if I could. He go and beyond to help you understand it.",1
"Expect to do lots of online homework (sapling) to understand the material being presented, and self teach.",0
"I was not the biggest fan.  He speaks as if he knows everything (and occasionally makes mistakes) but when it comes to grading, he takes points off for the smallest mistakes (grammar).  Smart guy and a nice layout for projects etc though.",1
My whole life history has been my favorite subject. i never wanted to pursue a career in it but i loved it. i have always gotten A's since freshmen year of high school in history. Until her class. SHE DESTROYED MY LOVE FOR HISTORY. SHE DOES NOT TEACH. everything you learn is from the textbooks. and to top it off you have a quiz every single day.,0
"After 5 classes, he has nothing to teach. assignments are interesting but take lots of time. He only threw the homework to you and didn't give much help. I have to learn by myself or from other resources to finish the homework. I think he should find a better way to teach this course, don't read PPT.",0
"Mr. Wilson was cool. Only problem that I truly had was his lack of grading throughout the course. Since the class is based on writing, you don't really know what your grade is until the end of the semester. Fortunately, I received a B in the class, but was aiming for an A. If grades matter to you, do not take him. If not, go for it. Good luck!",0
"c:lots of hw,shes rude (says whatever comes 2 her mind+often insults people),boring b/c her teaching style is unstructured+all she does is talk and make fun of people,refuses to go over the readings in textbook+write on the board because she says that we should have learned it  already. p:allows u 2 give hw 1 day late. overall advice:dont take her!",0
"I definitely won't recommend to take his claas. He's boring, mean. He won't even let you drink water in class or put a hat on during icy weather. Your grade based on 4 exams. Pass 4 you pass the class, fail one and average on three you'll fail the class.",0
Great teacher. Makes the class really fun and interesting to listen to. He grades very fairly for writing pieces. Not super strict in grading but you do have to put effort into the work. Also gives good feedback for the essays and such. Lots of reading overall but it's manageable if you keep up.,1
Not as bad as prior comments make her seem. Its a hard class and i DO NOT recommend skipping lecture. If allowed to make not cards keep up on them and organize. Keep with it and she usually gives a little extra credit towards the end if in lecture. I got a B so if i can get a decent grade most people who at least try can too.,0
"Took his class in Spring 2020. His transition to go fully online was smooth. He truly wants to help students who need guidance or willing to put in consistent effort. He responds to email quickly & offers office time via phone. . For his papers and essays, follow EXACTLY the structure of the essay. Recommend: Grammarly to check for errors",1
"The negative comment about this teacher is simply not true. Professor Lamprey is easy going, knowledgeable, and helpful. You basically get what you put in and if you want respect, do your homework and show up to class. Easy ""A"".",1
Prof Klatke is amazing! You def need the book and you will need to read the chapters in order to pass. Her tests can be a little tricky but it's open book so not too bad. She is always willing to help and goes above and beyond for her students. The class material is a little boring but the assignments make it interesting. Take her for sure! ,1
"Seems like a nice lady when you first meet her, her teaching style is awful and if you ask for help, you have to beg. She does not let you make up missed quizzes or exempt anything. I would not suggest you take this class with her because it should've been a lot easier then she made it. GET OUT ASAP",0
"Her Intro to Physics class was fun. Goes by her notes and you won't need to by a text. I tried using the text, but realized that she provided everything you needed on her handouts. She's energetic and excited about the course she teaches. Fun class.",1
"David was a very fun Professor, made the class enjoyable. This is not a easy class, he will make you work for it. 5 Books to read, 2 Papers, 2 Quizzes and 2 Exams with multiple group discussions via smaller readings. He is a harsh grader, but will give amazing feedback on how to improve. Make the effort, easy to communicate with. Cares for students",1
"This class did not feel like an intro class. 4 exams and 3 papers, and worksheets that were basically quizzes in discussion. The material he presents was very, very heavy and a lot to process. Gives study guides for exams but it wasn't much help. Exams were tough! goodluck",0
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Do not make the same mistake I did. The book is awful, power points are pretty much the same thing as what's in the textbook. If you have trouble with math, even a little, wait to take this course with a different professor.",0
"She was always available,personable and laid back. ALl that and she's easy on the eyes, too!",1
"WARNING: INFORMATIONAL WRITING IS NOT WELCOME. As an engineering major, I write things based around hard evidence, facts, and logic. In other words, I do not like to present unproven theories as factual, because they aren't. However, she likes writing that jumps to conclusions, so if you don't write like a tabloid, you better learn how to B.S.",0
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
I would avoid taking Eric for MTH162. He gets off topic and then speeds through the lecture because he doesn't manage time very well. He assigns an excess amount of homework that you'll have a quiz on and expects it all to be done by the next class. It'll be pretty much a self-taught class. Good luck.,0
"This guy is a real genius.  He is tough, but fair.  He will make you into a better student and professional.",1
is the hardest teacher u will ever take in your life......hes boring and his lectures are boring its hard to pay attention.... he a smart guy but a smartalic... the tests ha u might as well get the drop sheet ready.....,0
"His lectures are generally very boring. I think the discussion sections by his TAs were more helpful for me. However, the textbook which was written by him is well-written and it is very helpful.",0
Amazing Woman!,1
"the best teacher around.full of wisdom.his jokes are funny and tells stories. I wish I could take more classes from him.he's a good teacher, willing to teach his students to use logic.very smart good at teaching..if you want a good teacher take Mr. James West.No doubt the one of the few good teachers out there.Take him and you'll never forget him.",1
"Zank is awesome  well spoken, great sense of humor, and incredibly knowledgeable aboutanything and everything to do about the Southern Levant. I loved the class and I think it's a great course for anyone with any interest in the Abrahamic faiths. It's important to know the history of our worldly problems and this course sets you up for just that.",1
"I loved going to this class even though it was at 8am.  She made the material exciting not lecturing on and on.  Be sure to do the extra credit, there are tons of it!  This is an easy A class and you will learn a little something too.  She gives you mulitiple chances to turn in homework and works with you if you miss a day.  I highly recommend her!",1
"Unless you are familiar with complicated high level mathematics, do not take financial economics. Math skills aquired solely from economics courses will not be helpful at all in this course.",0
Marvin is certainly the worst professor i have ever had! do not take his classes they are terrible and he is a aweful teacher. i have never rated a professor before but he is just to awful to not.,0
"Rivas allows students to teach themselves, and the lectures were almost solely driven by the class. There's a TON of reading, and what little writing needs done is easy. Since Rivas doesn't direct the class, walking into his final is a bit of a nightmare: it covers the entire semester's reading and requires you to think like someone with a PhD.",0
"Wonderful Professor, even online class is fun with Prof. Dewald! Definitely recommend to any history majors that you will enjoy any class he teaches!",1
"You will teach yourself in this course!!! If you want an easy class, do not take this course! There are three tests and you need to get 270 points total to get an A. Each weekly homework assignment takes 2-3 hours. He does tell you which problems will be on the test though and he lets you out early.",0
"Class is mandatory, if you miss class you do not receive your points for showing up so make sure you sign the attendance sheet upon class even if late sign it!! She has a bad attitude and asking a question(s) is pointless. Quizzes are kind of tough! Final project is worth whole grade, and its a group project!",0
"DO NOT TAKE HARMONY WITH HER!!! If you are a music student, it is a bad idea to learn the basic from Prof Sellers.  She is very unclear, and while she is very talented and skilled, she is unable to teach what she knows.",0
Amazing professor. Makes morning enjoyable and he is very detailed about his lessons.,1
"Krutz is the coolest professor in the SE department. He's extremely laid back and approachable, which makes him a favorite of most students. That being said, you probably won't learn much taking a course with Krutz. His class was beyond easy with little to no homework and the easiest exams I've ever taken. Take his class to have fun, not to learn.",1
"She doesn't allow tech in the classroom. If caught then a quiz will be given to the entire class. Says don't need textbook, but puts on study guide for midterm & final that you need to look at certain sections in chapters. You only get 7 things graded (2 test, 2 quizzes, 1 paper, 1 hw, and attendance) so if you don't test well don't take this prof.",0
"I found her very unhelpful and unapproachable. The few times I interacted with her she was very unpleasant to deal with, and never fully answered my questions. She is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, but lacking the teaching skills. Would not recommend taking this class.",0
"Professor Bacaner is one of my favorites that Ive ever had. His class really taught me how to suck the fat off the top of my prosperity. Also, I really enjoy his lectures about how to achieve a beautiful harmonious balance in ourselves and in society. Overall, I believe there is not a word in the English language to describe Bacaners teaching.",1
I loved professor Vlahos! He is a caring teacher that wants his students to do well.  He goes out of his way to help them succeed.  He is willing to stay after class to work on practice problems with students that are having difficulty.  He also takes time to make sure that no one is lost.,1
"Good in class. Clear, easy to understand, fun. Independent studies are horrible. No direction, no syllabus, rarely shows up to meetings. I highly recommend taking a class with him as long at it's in a group!",0
"The class has about 12 labs, run by a different TA for each week. The lectures before the labs were very dry. Make sure you read the lab manuals to complete lab reports. The final exam was extremely difficult and no one expected it. Know everything about everything if you want to do well on the final and get an A in the class.",0
"LOVE HIM. Professor Caruso is not big on grading, but rather what you learn and how you understand the material. Easy A for sure, the bulk of the grading is based on participation.",1
"Literally the worst teacher I have had at Providence College. Her lectures make no sense whatsoever because she doesn't understand what she is teaching. Her exam questions do not reflect what she has ""taught."" You will receive nothing from lecture and you will have to teach yourself everything. She will kill BIO for you if you take her.",0
"She gives more time to complete quizzes than other instructors, she NEVER has trick questions, she is fair, her lectures are engaging and have a lot of class interaction. Students MUST do 15 hours of service learning in order to pass, it is best to get it done in the first half of semester. Homework takes very little time to complete.",1
"Really nice guy! Very smart and intelligent, knows his subject, and always informed about attest news. Lectures were boing sometimes, but because of topics, not him. Assigned 5 books to read, I read 1.5, still passed, after reading reviews and some summaries. Tests are pretty easy if you show up in class, take notes, and review the material",1
Great professor! I would take another class with him in a heartbeat! Lectures are course captures so you don't really need to go but honestly he's so interesting that I go even at 9 am. His lectures are super clear and as long as you do the readings and pay attention in lecture you will be fine. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!,1
Very helpful and makes lecture extremely interesting.  Tough grader for the two paper but his class is definitely worth taking.,1
"Nice and funny professor, but a tough grader, especially on the papers. If I didnt do all her extra credit, I probably wouldnt have gotten an A-. Do all her assignments and you should pass. She can be strict when she has to be but shes also very bubbly and funny.",1
Bruh.,0
"In this professor's class for only less than four weeks into the semester. He seems knowledgeable of the subject, however is extremely impatient with students. I went to see him in his office hours and he got angry over something not being printed out. I asked him to check my work and he said ""this is garbage I don't want to see it"".",0
Very good teacher.  If you work hard in his class you will do well because he wants you to earn your degree.,1
spiteful as well.  avoid and pray he doesn't show up to your seminar talks in 401/402,0
This guy is impossible to reason with. Avoid him at ALL costs in the math department,0
"Was a nice teacher at first and had a different way of teaching that I respected because not many professors are willing to try something new to help students succeed. However this style of teaching just did not work for me, and after expressing these concerns I guess I triggered him into writing a 5 page paper about how I was a terrible person.",0
"What a horrible professor! Unorganized, ill-prepared, unfair & rude...I actually had to go to her boss about a grade b/c McClung can't figure out how to give a peer review assignment. Tried to give me a 0 b/c no one would send me a paper to review! Her boss sided with me. Grades VERY harshly & I have my doubts about if she even reads the papers!",0
"I took Professor Triggs' mental health clinical (online due to COVID) and she made it the best that it could possibly be! Online clinicals are never optimal, but she made every day so educational and her roleplaying was incredibly helpful. I wish I could have her for my remaining clinicals! She is so sweet and encouraging, but tells it like it is.",1
"Three exams (85%) 100 questions each. first two exams are noncumulative and the third exam(final) is partially cumulative. Clicker Quiz every week or so (5% of overall grade.) He gives chapter homework assignments like right before each test (easy 10%.)STUDY THE PRACTICE EXAMS, he does not change his exams much. If it is bolded on the ppt, know it.",1
"This course earned my first C in my 3 year college career.  Teacher would make us do hw and take tests before ever teaching the subject, which she thought was a hot new teaching method, so the only reason to take the class was for the weekly quizzes, because after that you would not learn anything new. Reading the book was the only way to learn.",0
Dedicated and educated professor. Engages with the classroom and has everyone participate in the lecture with discussion based activities. Really funny and very fun to have. Highly recommend taking him.,1
Talks really fast but really nice and helpful. Somewhat difficult.,1
"I had Prof. Dempster my first semester here. The class was not that difficult as long as you did the weekly reading quizzes/assignments. Compared to several of the other economics 101 facility, he is the least strict, and it is easy to do well in his class. Always available and willing to talk about assignments and the material. Highly Recommended",1
This class is so confusing had extremely hard!!! I'll probably have to retake it this course but not with her!!!!!!!!!,0
Thick accent and a bit of language barrier when she explains things but if you put in the work she wont fail you and she will try to help you get a good grade,1
"the class is easy but i just didnt like her, her teaching methods or her assingments. i felt like i was in highschool with essays like ""compare your heros"" and attendance points on the day we had a haloween party. on top of that other than some grammar we learned in highschool she didnt teach anything that improved my writting. a waste of my time",1
Mr. Baumgartner is very helpful!,1
"As a professor, she is one of the best I have ever had. Not only does she truly care for the students and what they are able to take away from her class, but she does see the effort that the students put into her class. She tries to help clean up students' pronunciation whenever possible, so that the students speak as authentic Chinese as they can.",1
Matt is a very good teacher. He is very clear and his power points are very good and easy to understand. He really does everything he can to make you succeed. He is easy going and very fair and just a really nice guy. Really enjoyed listening to his lectures. Wish he could teach every class I have to take. ,1
if that was psychlogy then i'm glad it wasnt my major...another bad class at PBU...all he did was preach every class and show movies...,0
"Great professor! Especially for all the non-science majors like myself, class was really enjoyable although online course. I loved that professor provided feedback to every single assignment. Her grading criteria is pretty straight forward. I dont think there's any reason anyone wouldnt pass this class",1
"Favourite lecture of my day. Jeff was interesting to listen to, and seemed to enjoy the content he was teaching. Doesn't care if you come to class or not, but I would recommend attending, as he really takes time to explain calculations and charts. He gets a bit miffed if you have conversations in class, so keep it to a whisper.",1
"McKenna is a real human being with a heart worn on his sleeve. I didn't really get the whole thing until after the class was long over. Then I really came to appreciate this amazing man. he is trying to get students to think for themselves, to see beyond the veil. Quite a character and about as down to earth as it gets.",1
"Littlejohn is a good prof, like someone else said here she treats you as a 'person' and not as a student. She treats everyone on an equal level, and takes her teaching material and her students very seriously. Her lectures are interesting and overall, is a good prof.",1
"Hangue park is the worst prof there is to teach ECEN 215. He is new to teaching and was so nervous for the first lecture. He tried solving a question for 30 min and tried 3 ways to solve the question and couldnt figure out how to solve it. He's terrible at explaining things. Take Mina Rahimian or John Tyler for this. Park is nice, just is confused.",0
"She does not provide study guides. She is always late to class but requires her students to always come to class and be on time. She lectures to us as if we have a degree in Biology already. Every time you ask a question her response is 'Well, what does the book say?"". She is a nice lady but a HORRIBLE professor. Please do not take her seriously.",0
Dr Ortega is really caring and nice but he made this class harder than it needed to be. He made it harder because of it being online with the whole covid thing which is super unfair. But he would give 8% on each test as extra credit since we are only graded on test. He also doesnt round up if you get an 89 you get an 89 in the class.,1
One of the best professors! He is caring to his students and is always willing to answer questions. The tests are fairly easy as long as you show up to class. You will need the book that is suggested to pass. I would take him again!,1
"Prof. Peters is tough. Yes, it is a one day a week class, but seriously, you could be DYING and she won't let you make up the weekly quizzes. She assigns way too much reading & expects you to understand & remember almost EVERYTHING for the in class discussions. She's a hard grader & when she does leave comments THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO READ. no fun:(",1
Very good professor. Assignments throughout the semester will not be difficult. Discussions are also very close to current affairs. So you can pass them easily. Choose her and you will succeed!,1
She's terrible. She sits in front of the class and does nothing. It was boring.,0
"An efficient lecturer with an almost postmodernist taste of humor. The clearly defined grading scale, the unchanging format of scantron exams and quizzes, paired with a rigorous schedule with everything planed left no surprise. A solid choice of 435 for the studious, as all were too predictable.",1
"Loved the course and the instructor. Eight assignments, but all very relevant and helpful both for the grade and for personal info.",1
"A big mistake taking this teacher. Diffucult teacher whose personality is worse than her teaching abilities...that's saying a lot. I can't say I know one student that like's her...She's rude, mean, biased, arrogant, thinks of herself as a great intellectual, and is overall full of hoarse crap. Reading and writing intensive.",0
I would not recommend any student taking his class unless you are majoring in sociology! He is a very tough grader and doesnt work well with his students.,0
Mr. Hays was by far the best teacher I have ever had! Love him!,1
great prof; very nice lady; classy and professional,1
"Heavy workload, most of which is busywork. Acts like he's trying to get feedback from students but really will end up doing what he wants anyway. Journals are horrible and he marks you down for not having enough personal reflection. Keep checking due dates because he sometimes gets them wrong in class, and if it's late he won't accept it.",0
Do not take this class. You are paying to teach yourself. The professor does not teach and his LA's teach the course instead. Each LA will give you a different answer and you will end up confused and unsure. I regret having taken this course. The class is also extremely slow and not even the professor can give you a decent answer when you ask.,0
"""Intructor First"". Never respond email. Not friendly. Not care about his student at all. Hard to get an A. Worst instuctor I ever seen. No practice exam. He only says,""the exam question is similar to your book's examples"" (I took CIS 20). Lecture is lack of organized. It is detailed but saying too much useless in class. HW are barely relate to exam",0
"You'll learn a lot. You'll work a lot, this is NOT an easy A class. If you don't like violence, cussing (C  and F word)don't take it.  Brent is a GIFTED teacher but you can learn the same thing with tame content. If you like: South Park: cuss episode, Curb your enthusiam: Denise Handicap & Tarantio movies, take it. If not, chose another teacher.",1
"Don't get me wrong this class is not hard at all. If you do all the chapter reviews, online quizzes and papers you will get an A in the class. The midterm and final is easy. I never went to class because the professor was mono tone and not engaging at all.",0
"Dr. Liszka was not only my favorite teacher for Computer Science class (Computer Security, Senior Seminar, Data Structures), but one of the most incredible human beings to teach at that school. She not only taught well, but she inspired so many students who didn't quit feel like they ""belonged"" in the Computer Science school",1
"Although he's not very clear with his instruction, he's an easy person to approach and he takes the time to clearly explain things if you ask him for help. The class is long but managable.",1
"very nice and helpful, papers aren't too frequently assigned or too long, and if she'll go over anything with you and try to help you do better the best she can",1
"Had her for litho, then I had Brian and learned how to do litho.  She didn't teach us things, like how to scrape the rollers, and what the chemistry of litho is... basically came out with an idea of the medium but not any proficiency.  not recommended.",0
"Prof. Quinlan is the sweetest professor I have ever had.  He genuinely cares about his students.  On the first day of class he said do the assignments well and get an A, just ok get an A-, and don't do them B+. He doesn't care if you show up or not, just that you're doing ok as a person. The assignments are rather tedious, but the films are great.",1
"Stoner is a funny guy but his voice will put you to sleep. BUT GOOD NEWS... he gives his students all the tests back with correct answers at the end of the year so go look on note swap and every quiz, test, and essay question are waiting for you. Bad part is attendance is a must because you have in class quizzes every day",0
Prof Hinshaw is amazing. His lectures are incredibly clear and interesting. He is fair and helpful. I tend to sleep through many of my classes but never this one!,1
"Dr. Diem is unresponsive to feedback, emails, and students' concerns. His readings are incredibly long and very repetitive. No videos, audio lectures. Just readings. Weekly quizzes are only allotted 5 mins for questions that are difficult to answer. Unclear on what he expects. 2 exams: midterm and cumulative final. The midterm was hard as heck.",0
This was a very easy online class. The basis of the class is either a quiz or journal (2 page paper about what you learned) and a discussion board every week. He gives all of the dates the assignments are due and what chapters to read for each week in the syllabus. If you keep up on the readings and do your work you will get an A.,1
Most organized online class I have ever had. This class is so interesting.,1
"Although she can be a bit unorganized and late to class, I truly enjoyed this course. If you take this class for honors, she will try her best to brainstorm ideas with you and find scales for your project.",1
"Professor Kendall was a great intro drafting teacher. He's got a lot of experience in Mechanical drafting and it shows. Very clear outline for the semester, had no problems passing the class. Looking forward to future classes with him.",1
Dr. Singer is a terrible teacher. He is extremely unkind and is respected by little to no students. You will not learn in his class. Avoid him entirely. His lectures are long and confusing and you will walk away with five pages of practically useless notes every lecture. He is not helpful if you go to his office and he'll treat you as a nuisance.,0
"Late to class, graded based on relative standing because everyone would get 40's on the exam, so you wouldn't even have a clue as to what your grade could be until after the finals are submitted. He would rant about things and lose track of time. We had a midterm a week before the final since he forgot to give one. Stay away from this professor",0
Constant lecture.  Does not ask questions.  Exams questions are very specific and its seems like hes trying to trick you.  Nice but not helpful when I stayed after class 3 times.,0
"Where do I begin! This course is SUPER HARD!! Not something you can just skim through and pass, You have to read, do your assignments, tests and pay attention in class to the guidelines.  Great teacher by far! I walked away with tons of knowledge! Hard but worth taking...",1
"Dr. Spiczak is genuinely such a smart man. That being said, he struggles interpreting the information to students in a clear and orderly manner. One - on - one he is much easier to understand, so I'd make sure to check his office hours. He's a very generous grader, the curves on his tests and overall class is favorable. ",0
My perception of the HSIM program starting to change once because of this class.  I believe it was Dr. Kulesher's first time teaching this course but it was absolutely horrible! I can't recall learning anything except from the two 60 min videos we watched.  He also assigned us a 20 pg research paper and this is not a WI class.,0
"Tons of reading, power points, and research.",0
You have to do the homework and show up on time this semester half my class dropped because it was too many papers like too many he should at least put it on the syllabus before because it would be better and gets mad that we couldnt take words from the class discussion for the mc notes he is a character mainly speak and you better be right,0
"Friendly guy who helps you so much so you basically can't fail. Offers unlimited tries on his HW assignments and always extended due dates to help us out. Class material was difficult because I just struggle with statistics but he is ALWAYS helpful in office hours! Class was two exams, easy online HW assignments, and one group project/paper.",1
"This is the most failed class in the Education department here. Her tests are 100 questions and after the first test she will sit down and say ""now you see you can't study for my test you just have to know it."" I believe she said she was retiring this year though so good luck!",0
She is one of the worst professors I've ever had. She doesn't have a lesson plan so she just babbles in french the entire time (bcs her thing is to speak french only in class). Quizzes are way too frequent. She's extremely rude and makes fun of students. Instructions are given in french and she vaguely tells us whats on the exam THE DAY BEFORE.,0
"Terrible teaching ability, nice guy, but the class was a huge frustration, I learned little and there is no lecture just presentations, he needs more organization and teaching ability, he thought he was making the class easy but was making it more difficult.",0
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
"I personally have no issue with public speaking, so I wasn't too concerned about the course but Professor Walker is one of the most empathetic and genuine professors you will ever have. A lot of students were nervous and he was very patient and kind. He gave great feedback. Make sure your phones are put away!",1
"This class is the worse I have taken during my time at this college. He will grade based on opinion, if he doesnt agree with your opinion on discussions he will fail you. I have straight As on the rest of my courses but this class I have an F and I have spent sleepless nights writing the essays for him to say he doesnt like my opinion on subject",0
"Dr. Shartin is a very nice guy, but not a very good professor. He was very unorganized. The class was pretty difficult, because of the readings, and he did not help very much. The class wasn't impossible, but very frustrating.",0
"Very easy class and the professor is cool.  I had a point where I missed a bunch of days and was really far behind but he let me turn everything in for full credit.  Really nice guy, you'll like him.",1
"I found her to be very freindly in class, but outside of class, she gave me the impression i was bothering her. work load wasn't that bad.",1
"I took his class 4 years ago and this is my hardest class. It's not because the level is so high for me, it was teaching me how much I was recognizing and understanding the world and people around me. The greatest teacher, Mr. Lawson helped to open my mind!!! I am appreciated his smart and Stubborn sides.I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON HIS CLASS..",1
I took this class online and He was extremely sweet and made all of the homeworks very easy. Be careful on the tests online though because they are tricky. Can't find answers on google. and bad test grades will kill your score. Take this class online :),1
"She is wonderful! Very helpful..and wants you to learn & understand the material. Her night class is real fun! All Bio tests are hard, if you stay on top of it & do the work your suppose to, you'll be fine. She's really nice & has a great sense of humor! I highly recommend her.",1
Very enthusiastic about the subject! 3 tests. He gives you the test to study a week in advance. No final so once you take tests you can forget the info. 2 part tests: define terms & essay. Just attend class and you will get an A!,1
"Jimmerson is a very caring and dedicated English professor. As a biology major, I hate English but I managed to get an A in the class. You have to try your hardest on everything you turn in to her because she takes off for every little error. With that being said, she does give a little bonus and is very willing to help outside of class.",1
"Had her for Business Communication.  Loved this woman.  So funny and clever.  I would most certainly call her up for resume writing because the lady knows how to ""schmooze"" her way into anything.",1
"Not a good proff!!, very hard marker if you disagree with his opinions,which happens often!",1
Love Venus he is definitely one of my favorite professors at Gordon. Such a good personality he has dark humor but he is very funny if ur into that. His work is not hard had a lot of quizzes but there easy I came to every class and did all my assignments so Im sure I will b finishing with an A. I would definitely recommend him to anybody,1
The absolute worst. Take anyone but him trust me,0
"Attending the lectures is a must. Make sure you completely understand the material in the textbook. Class avg. for each test scores was 50-60%, I think the highest score I saw posted was 82%. Didn't seem to really care that the class was struggling. I wouldn't recommend him. ",0
Good professor but short tough multiple choice questions for lecture exam,1
I took her Intensive Intermediate Spanish for Heritage Learners and it was intense! There is a lot of work that goes into this course. She is really clear in her lectures though so I learned a lot. You really have to prepare yourself and manage your time for this course. There was a group project which was easy and the final paper was easy as well.,1
There is a midterm and a final and they are mostly comprised of the quizzes. Make sure to review the outlines. The quizzes have very specific questions and little amount of time is provided. There is an assignment due every week. You have to really WORK.,0
come prepared to participate or dont bother with this Professor. He earned my respect by making himself available outside of class. He gave me solid advice and that advice is why I'm still in college.,1
"Great guy with a great sense of humor. I went into this class expecting to toil away for 10 weeks and get out with a passing grade, but November had other plans. he gave multiple chances for extra credit through attending poetry readings. He really wants to see you grow. I went from hating writing to writing poetry outside of class.",1
"Stay away from her. Grossly unprofessional. Almost her entire class is failing. Her test averages are the lowest of all sections(multiple semesters). Insults students. Actually wrote up false paperwork about a student to retaliate against him filing a a complaint with dept chair. ""A"" students go become failing students in her class.",0
"Don't be frightened by the past ratings. Kaur is very understanding, she made it a point to my class to figure out our needs in order to teach the material well. The workload was not too bad. It was just weekly readings, 3 exams, and one presentation and paper. Lectures are long but everything she discusses is important and crucial to the exams.",1
"Awesome professor who wants students to succeed she is super nice. As long as you do Homework and Quizzes you should pass the class. The only exams are midterm and final, as long as you study you should be able to pass with an A. I studying at least a week in advance.",1
Great professor. Lectures are fast-paced and carry a lot of content. The exams have a written section which tends to be the most difficult. Amazing lectures and teaches economics with real-world examples and show clips. Entertainng class.,1
"Professor Dillon is a wonderful person. She's really caring, and passionate about her subject. The only problem is she is the most unorganized person ever. All her directions are very abstract, thrown-together sentences that hardly make sense. Her syllabus is painful to read, and essay prompts are a headache. She also is not very open minded.",0
"I take online classes because I work full time and go to school full time. I spent at LEAST 20 hours a week reading 100 pages, watching 2-hour videos, and countless pages of homework WEEKLY. All of the questions that she asks are in a ""how did you interpret..."" and then she tells you that you are wrong, ALWAYS. DONT DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I have a very clear understanding of the material, because I've already taken the class, but she grades horrible. She would take off 3 points from a 5 point problem if you have the wrong sign. I hate taking this class with her.",0
"She was the worst teacher I have ever had, she is cruel and vindictive. Also now she is in charge of the entire theater department. So now I have no choice but to leave Laguardia, because she is unbearable.",0
"At first I hated this class with every fibre of my being. But honestly, once you begin to speak up more and understand her teaching method, she's one of the best professors you can have. She is more than willing to help with anything she can, and gives extensive and useful feedback. Always answers emails quickly. Does everything she can.",1
Cynthia is a bubbly and interesting teacher. She really cares about student success. Kind of a lot of difficult reading (with homework attached) but it's always talked about the next day if you don't understand it. You get points for attendance. Really liked her class!,1
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He will start lecturing about material in test 5 before you've even taken test 6 He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
"Ms. Vasquez is by far the best teacher I have ever taken. I HIGHLY recommend taking her class. She is very understanding and willing to work with you no matter what, also she is so funny and I loved going to her lectures.",1
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
"Super easy class with a good professor! Tests are listening tests and not actually normal tests, which was great. A couple of easy essays and some concerts to go to and that's it! I found the topics to be very interesting, although some people probably won't. You don't need a strong musical background to understand the material, although it helps.",1
"he's a very interesting and capable teacher, but can at times be intimidating. if you don't show willingness to learn or improve you won't get anywhere. if you have a true interest, he's a wonderful teacher. take the class into your own hands.. talk, attend class, and know your stuff. tough grader but a great teacher. good accent, and a cutie too",1
Literally worst experience of my life. Shouldve listened to people when they told me not to take him. I learned absolutely nothing in orgo,0
"Finishing up my degree at NOVA so I had to take him. He's by far the hardest Spanish professor I've ever had. Very strict/tough grader and assings a lot of homework! While he cares about his students, he could be very rude towards them during lectures. I normally did well in Spanish, but got a C with hard work. Glad I only had to take him once.",0
This teacher is very friendly. However I would not recommend taking her class. I took her class m-f it was a 50 minute class and she spent 35 minutes going over homework from the night before and only 15 on the current lecture then expected us to know what we were doing. She gives homework every day and checks it in and stamps it. Tests are VERY Ha,1
"Loves to play ""gotcha"" on questions to take away points.  Worst class!!",0
"I took her class during summer and it was an easy A. She was my counselor for a meeting today. I have never been belittled so much in my life as I was in that thirty minute meeting. I was told I will never make it to a four year college, and she gave me grief for not memorizing my student id number. I will definitely be reporting her to the school.",0
I took the professor's class online and loved it. There was weekly reading that was long but it was manageable if you kept up. The professor was very kind and responded to questions promptly. The class was fairly easy if you did your work.,1
Show up for class and do the lab assignments.  Pay attention to the lecture not just the slides.  Getting an A is possible but the tests are hard.  There was extra credit throughout the course.  Getting a B is pretty easy if you just show up and put some effort into stuff. He wants to get you ready for nursing classes.,1
"She is very detailed on the work she goes over in class, but her exams are much harder than anything she covers in class or on the homework. There are quizzes regularly, about 2-3 a week, but they aren't worth too many points. If you're going to take her, just make sure you do the homework and then some, because she's a very hard grader.",0
I made a breakthrough with prof keene . I my music is starting to click!,1
Dr. Miller is a nice guy but he does not try to help you at all. His labs are the absolute worst.,0
"I dropped 2 classes and almost got fired from my job to study and STILL did not pass. ENORMOUS amounts of homework! I highly recommend taking it with a different professor. I was warned before class began and I stuck with it. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE! I hear the professor with the last name starting with a ""J"" is phenomenal! Get out NOW!",0
"He wastes his entire class period on trying to teach life lessons instead of teaching Chemistry. Classic Hokmabadi line, ""I'm not here to teach, I tell you what you need to look for in the book."" Very rude and condescending, he wants you in his office groveling to him.",0
"Easy A, she tells you exactly what you want. She is understanding and fun",1
"Hands down best professor at Blinn. I took this class to avoid taking biology/chemistry/physics and ended up maybe changing to an ag major! Pierce has much knowledge in this field, is very caring and guiding towards students, and doesn't make non ag students feel dumb when learning about new terms. Would 10000% recommend taking this science course!",1
"He is one of the best professor I had at ASU, he teaches the material really well and is generous about assignment extension.",1
"Fairly simple material, but goes over it well. I see a lot of the reviews says he ""penalizes students for groupmates' mistakes"" - he gives group projects, but you have the opportunity to review what your groupmates do just like any other group project. He is accessible via email. Nice guy, can go on tangents that at times are ""out there""",1
"This professor is AWESOME! By far one of my favorite classes in all 4 years as a college student. He is mellow but strict. He has great conversations with the students and is very helpful and passionate for ART. If you cant draw, nobody is judging but you. There are a lot of projects, but once he turns on the music he lets your creativity flow.",1
"James Richards is one of my favorite professors so far. Makes his lectures fun and engaging. A few assignments each week, but he's more than willing to help with them and answer any questions. Made accounting fun!",1
"she rambles a lot and has trouble sticking to the topic. she also kept pushing things back forcing us to cram writing two papers in the last month of classes. we had a week and a half for our final paper because she ""forgot"" to assign it. shes really tough grader too. lots of unnecessary stress I definitely don't recommend.",0
"The course was very interesting and informative; two classes are hands-on dog training. Jamie can come off a little rough and I wouldn't expect everyone to love her on a personal level. She is set in her ways and tells a lot of personal anecdotes of limited relevance, but you can learn a lot about behavior and positive-based training.",1
"Unorganized, always late, vague, and boring. I thought the class was going to be fun, but she somehow made it miserable & unbearable. She doesnt communicate her point clearly in class or on the tests. You may think ""well thats just one persons opinion of her"", but a lot of the class felt this way so avoid this lady at all costs...you will thank me!",0
Talks too much and doesn't listen to what students have to say. He also tends to talk down to students and never gives a clear answer. His grading is straight forward. Expect multiple long emails per day.,0
"There are 4 papers, weekly discussions, and biweekly assignments over something in the book but those are easy. Galina will drive you insane, but it's not a hard class. DO THE WHOLE DISCUSSION. if you forget to reply to TWO ppl and do just 1, you still get a 0. LISTEN when she says don't turn in the full paper, turn it in a lil at a time.",1
GOod guy,1
She was the best teacher ever. She is very kind and if we ask her a question she will definitely answer your questions very clearly. She will have homework passes to get extra credits,1
"Professor Swartz is one of the best professors you will ever have. Don't get me wrong, his grading is very frustrating, but you will learn and become a better student because of him. He'll work w/ you before exams to go over concepts you don't get & spend his own time in order to help you learn. You'll be scared at first he's a god. Word, dawg",1
Professor Krafcik is not to tough on the students. She gives a reasonable amount of work and is normally energetic and sweet. YOU SHOUD TAKE HER IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!,1
He was my favorite teacher for Fall 2016. An a amazing teacher. Easy A. Gives a lot of extra credit and helps you on everything even test and quiz. i highly recommend him. i would definitely take him again.,1
"The class I took with Dwosh was a nice class once a week. The class is very easy as long as you actually try. The books he assigned were very interesting and I'm glad I got them. Nothing special about him, but he is a good professor that teaches leadership in an engaging way.",1
Amazing teacher! Anything to do with math is really hard for me to learn and understand but he is so nice and cares about the students so he always offers help and extra credit and wants to make it easy for everyone. He made psych stats painless and manageable! 10/10,1
"He is a tough lab teacher, especially when the lecture doesn't correspond to what you're doing in lab.  His tests are hard and focus on EVERYTHING that was gone over in class.  He is a nice teacher, though.",1
Great teacher. Extremely helpful and super energetic. She enjoys teaching and it shows. She doesn't like late work .  Show up to class because that's where most of her assignments are given and completed,1
"I took this class online and struggled but am not good at math at all. Professor Woulas's syllabus and criteria was straightforward and fair. 50% of your grade is from homework and quizzes that you get multiple chances on and the other 50% is on proctored tests. He also answers emails! I will take him again for my next class, for sure!",1
"She is incredibly knowledgable about the topics she lectures on, but because she has so much to share and teach, the course moves pretty quickly.  She is animated and fun, and you can really tell that she enjoys teaching.",1
Nicest person in the world. MAde class easy and fun as a freshman entering college for the first time. I would recommend her to anyone taking humanities. Easy to talk to and willing to listen.,1
"This is by far one of the coolest cats I've ever met in my life. He has the most interesting stories ever told. He doesn't really use the book, and he doesn't speak from notes-just from his experiences (which are too awesome). I'd take this class just to meet him, but the tests are very challenging. A few easy papers will pad your grade, though.",1
"The professor was pretty cool, she has great style. Sometimes she'd get a little confusing. There are 2 midterms, a final & a book review. for homework, she had us do some online assignments and there would be some in-class worksheets as well. If you miss the worksheets it affects your grade & it isn't much you can do to make them up.",1
"Just an outright amazing professor. His tests are straight forward and not hard at all. You do have to read the book, but you are in college so this should be a no brainer. Good luck",1
"SOOOOOOOOOO boring, I wanted to die with this class. Lectures are long and homework is hard and he basically never gives A+'s",0
"I really enjoyed Professor Sherwood. She was clear of the expectations, helpful, and involved. So long as you do your reading and turn your assignments in on time, you will be successful.",1
"If you have to take a class for CHM2340, don't even bother taking this professor. Most of the time you won't understand what he is saying. His Exams are TOUGH; I've studied all of the content he explained, it didn't help at all. YouTube teaches better than this guy. Attendance check on Friday be careful.",0
"Professor Tidwell was great! She truly cares about her students and wants them all to be successful. She is more than willing to assist with any questions. We did end up reading almost the entire textbook, so be prepared. Quizzes were pretty straightforward if you've read the material. Follow her grading criteria and you will do well!",1
"pat mckee=GREAT TEACHER for class strings. your grade is UP TO YOU. the entire class is practicing for the little tests. he has a list of things you will need to play, and when you do, he marks it off and to get an A, you do all of them. at the end of the term, all checked=A, missing a couple=B, missing a lot=C, missing most=D, didn't try=F easy.",1
He's a grad student--new to teaching. He knows his subject very well but cannot teach to save his life. Tests are very tough and can range from 5-7 questions max. I would personally not recommend,0
This is the best professor. He is very knowledgeable and cares for you to learn.. of course like usual you have to read and study like every other subject but he makes it so easy to learn. 100% would take him again...,1
"First, I wish you could rate 0. I hope you have a good internet connection. You will be teaching yourself through YouTube videos. The lectures are all over the place. His writing is illedgeable. He often makes mistakes in the notes. My personal favorite he skips steps by taking shortcuts, but he doesnt tell you ��. His test reviews are misleading.",0
Venkata teaches a Chemistry course for non-chem majors. The books were interesting and he is very good about responding to questions promptly.,1
"Very knowledgable in field, the lectures are quite interesting, enjoyed this class very much!",1
"This man knows his stuff.  If your really interested in photography and want to make it a career i highly recomend you take his class!  Smart man,  knows a lot about everything. His assignments are hard but thats the only way you'll learn. He can be rude and somewhat mean but thats just how he is. (He doesn't mean to be).",1
Great course!!,1
"Super-great guy that wants you to shine. Easy to understand and doesn't complicate things. One of my favorite teachers. (a funny guy, too!)",1
he doesn't really know how to teach. but he's ok because he gives good grades. plus he's not bad looking. so class is not a total waste. o' yeah he talks a lot bout turkey and flying.,0
"I like Yvonne, she's passionate about what she does, she's nice, but I don't like her teaching style. I took Exploring Photography, more like, ""history of photography"", she is way into art and film, you'll be using the darkroom for pinhole assignments and won't be learning much about your digital camera. Lectures are long and not hands on at all.",0
"I am taking her currently I will update at the end of winter, she has no idea how to use tech. STAY FAR AWAY. If I could go back I would've self taught this lang. She's adding assignments after the semester has started, 0 prep, her emails are incoherent, no talking at all to peers or her and she hardly teaches in class, it's not worth it so far.",0
"Very good. Provided a lot of real life examples. It was very helpful. But I was in a large class, and hence it is little difficult to participate, otherwise good.",1
He is a clear communicator with a well prepared structure to his lectures. Asks for class ideas a lot and gets discussions going. Definitely need to take good notes and study to do well on the tests. Full class session reviews before tests. Your expected to study and know all the material. Two papers. Good extra credit opportunities. Great teacher.,1
"Rebecca was a very nice professor, but I despised her class. With all the mundane group projects and the activities we did, I felt like I was back in elementary or middle school rather than a college class. However, while she assigned a lot of work, most of it was easy. Attendance was mandatory though, which was annoying since class was useless.",1
"Dr. LaBelle is definitely a solid choice for research methods. She can be a tough grader, but if you just sit and take time to do the assignments properly, you should be fine/pass. Her grading criteria is clear and she's accessible outside of class in her office hours to help. She's also pretty cool when you get to know her outside class.",1
Professor Walling is very passionate about his work as an anthropology teacher. He is in charge of a study abroad program in Belize for those who are interested. DO  NOT USE YOUR PHONE IN CLASS! The only exception  for this rule is if you're using your cell phone to record one of his lectures. He talks fast. I found his office hours very helpful.,1
Expect homework every week. ATTENDANCE is very important. If you come late on the day you have your weekly quiz you will not be given another chance to take your quiz. But he usually drops one quiz at end of the semester. Good professor just dont skip class this is a class you must attend or it will affect your grade.,1
Well so far the notes don't really match up with the test. Its as if he wants you to master all the info for every test. The book does not seem to help. The average for exam 1 was just above 70...most ppl I talked to made in the 50's... vary hard class lets hope it ends well...only take if you really really need to.,0
She is a tough grader and cares way too much about the assignments. She does not provide enough feedback on how to improve your grade and needs to be a little more relaxed.,0
"Bude is probably the worst person to be in charge of a whole major. Her directions are very unclear and she clearly does not know what she is doing . Her work is all OVER the place. She came in to our SL to introduce a paper, she came in with parts of her power point missing so she edited while teaching. Also her English is TERRIBLE, she needs help",0
Her grading is out of three exams only. She does give e.c. but she is very strict on the way she wants it. It's her way or the highway. The first few e.c. assignments majority of the class received no credit. Attendance is mandatory and no phones allowed. Doesn't return exams. Btw 365 is based more on marriage counseling than family psych.,0
"Literally worked so hard on an essay worth 30%, wish I took the F and got an extra couple hours of sleep. Worst TA.",0
Impossible,0
"Very clear instructor and very respectful of students and their work. Just show up to class, do the work and it won't be hard to get a good grade. The subject matter can be complex but she's always willing to help and reiterate. I learned tons and I feel like I hardly scratched the surface. Would definitely take her again.",1
If you fail this class you just didn't try. Extremely nice man and very knowledgable!! Pay attention and take good notes. They come in handy for the essays and discussions.,1
"This guy teaches a communication class and LITERALLY does not know how to communicate. He has never once responded to one of my emails, talks like a textbook and his lectures are pointless. He seriously over complicates so many things. For example, the term ""interpersonal communication"" seems confusing when he describes it.",0
"Mr. Wisla is a very educated man and knows what he is talking about but he should stick to working and not teaching students. His classes are dreadful and awkward, he does not teach enough in the time span of the class, he just says one thing and calls on half of the class to provide their opinion. It is not a class anyone looks forward to.",0
"Prof. Bannow is not a mean guy, let me get that out of the way. However, he talks down to students because he doesn't understand that a student doesn't master a concept by seeing it once. Do not ask questions, do not miss class, basically teach yourself. He ends up giving so much extra credit the class seems pointless. Not recommended at all.",0
"Father Ranieri s class was one of the hardest I took but it be made it interesting and explained the concepts perfectly. I was intimidated at first if Im honest. Participation is crucial! Brilliant man and amazing human being and as others have said he truly cares about his students. Take him, itll be an great experience.",1
"this guy is Anti African, he hates africans to death,the only Africans he deals with are the ones who will offer him stuff and make him feel superior.I cant imagine a sch will continue to have this guy teach.He deosn't know how to teach,he laugh at you when you ask him a question its becos he doesn't know.He allows certain students to retake quizes",0
"Hard to understand at times, my main problem was the lack of grading.",0
"Dr. Judson is a great professor. You can tell she truly cares about her students, and the material wasn't too difficult. Hybrid class - meet in class one day, online the other. You have to dress business casual because of it being a MKT 230(+) course. Biggest project are two case studies which require reading about 10 page cases, tests are easy.",1
This professor will not reply to your emails and never sent out emails regarding our assignments. Our class was left with nothing and his syllabus was super unclear. He cut class short due to COVID-19 but never graded any of our work; even as a I write this I dont know my grade in the course due to his poor involvement with the class.,0
"Awful teacher, gives way too vague prompts for essays and doesn't hand back graded ones until way after the next one is due, It could be months past the first essay and you still will not have it back, also assigns homeowork late at night due he next day in the morning",0
"Great teacher, real organize,  guaranteed to learn Japanese. Must have proper grammar and spelling on the quizzes if not you get partial credit. The downside would be having a quiz nearly every day.",1
"Shes the best of the best, class isnt boring its fun every time! Shes super nice, shes awesome and you wont regret taking her class.",1
"Its obvious that Mr. Mock knows a lot about government, but he makes it very difficult to learn. Its a very lecture heavy class and he doesnt give much for notes so you have to write what he says and half of what he says isnt relevant. Minimal grades, only a few tests and two papers. He also makes students feel stupid and is extremely rude.",0
I think I've learned more in IDE and in doing the NXP car project than any other class. He's definitely the best professor I've had so far. His lectures aren't boring in the slightest. The labs are a lot of work but it's worth the knowledge you gain.,1
"Pretty awful. Gets lost in his own lecture. Doesn't use notes and is just plan wrong about what he writes on the board half th time. He even calculated the final grades wrong. Really nice guy, but a horrible professor.",0
"I had her for bio lab and it was literally awful…her accent is so heavy that u cannot understand a single thing she says.I dreaded going to my lab every week bc she cant help u bc u cant understand her.Besides not being able to understand her there were no other prblms,but its just really hard to complete the lab when u have no idea what ur doing.",0
"He is terrible. The class is fairly easy, but overall he is really rude and mean. I turned in an assignment that had 2 parts. I turned in the first part and emailed him the second part because it was a picture. He then told me to submit through canvas after I had already emailed it to him. A month later, he tells me to email it to him NOW. so rude",0
She is very hard to get a hold of and if you have questions about any assignment she takes about 24 hours to respond to them. Her instructions are not very clear especially with being in an online class that makes it pretty hard to know what to do and turn in.,0
"this professor is really interested in the material but pretty monotone; sometimes i wanted to fall asleep in class! his essay topics are pretty broad but i stopped taking notes because they didn't apply to the topics. he loves what he teaches but has a hard time sharing that with the students. this class is NOT discussion based, which was sad.",1
"You don't need a textbook for the class- everything you are quizzed on comes from his written lectures. They were open note too, and the exercises you did were never too hard and he always told you how to improve. Funny guy, his notes were interesting. Take him!",1
"Not a bad professor necessarily, just INSANELY boring. Engelman doesn't put much (if any) effort into making lectures interesting. Not really a hard professor. Essays were graded very easily and tests were all multiple choice and not too hard. I wouldn't recommend due to how boring she is, but if you want an easy A/AB and can put up, go for it.",0
Dr. Houston is a fair teacher. If you don't read and study the class could be hard. Her test aren't easy. They require a lot of reading and studying. She's not as bad as these posts make her out to be. She is a very friendly professor outside the classroom but she is strictly about business when in the class. Just be prepared to work extra hard!,0
Did not actually teach anything. Just read from the textbooks with a voice that puts you to sleep. Extremely boring.,0
"Had Kraszewski back in the mid-00's(!) for Honors Lit.  Even now, I can still remember him ranting about the computer being an, ""evil Satanic contraption.""  :D  Anyway, the guy is amazing as a prof - knew 4-5 languages, and could make dull subject matter come alive.  Seriously, he is a walking wealth of knowledge, and very effective as a teacher.",1
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The program she uses is horrible. The quizes she gives are through Cengage and one wrong click on the page and you get the question wrong. You could do all of the correct steps and it will still count your answer as wrong. She is also very unhelpful, and if you email her for help, dont expect to get it.",0
"Very boring lectures. No tests but pretty difficult quizzes. She uses tophat for lectures and to ask questions, which she uses to determine attendance.",0
The professor is great. He is easy to understand and his explanations are easy to understand. H you don't need any textbooks because he gives a lot of handouts. Also his sylubus is super easy to understand and follow.,1
"Brown only cares about bodybuilding and track, so to him every other sport is irrelevant even though the class is called SPORTS PERFORMANCE. He gives a generic lecture about every other course you have to take at BSU and most of the time the information is skewed into an inaccurate and sexist view. He teaches by opinion and praises supplementation.",0
"I absolutely loved her! She really gets to know her students and honestly wants us to succeed. She will do as much as she can to make it easier, and her classes all have built-in extra credit!",1
Unclear with expectations. Expect to teach yourself most of the subject matter if it's important to your education or career. Double check HIS work...,0
"worst teacher ever. unable to understand his own slides, and makes frequent mistakes on them. don't take him!",0
"he definitely knows nothing about teaching a class!!! his class is no use at all, and the lecture is just reading from the material. never teaches anything useful, the lecture and the homework and quiz has nothing related!!! definitely do not take his class ever and ever!!!! the worst teacher in this University!!!",0
"Really interesting, keeps class from getting boring.",1
GREAT professor! Really cares about his student! His class and tests are hard! If you are not willing to put in multiple hours worth of studying or want an easy A do NOT take this class - 3 essay questioned test make up ur grade and 1 extra credit paper worth 10 points which is added lowest test grade- I learned so much! would take again!,1
"Dr. Johnson is a caring professor who is very knowledgable in her field. She organized the course extremely well during the COVID-19 crisis and transitioned us to online learning much better than other professors. Tests are based off of the textbook that she wrote, so just know that you must read and take notes thoroughly to ace exams.",1
"Most interesting coding assignments I've seen and super generous late assignment policy. Understands students struggles and is no-BS while also understanding. An incredibly knowledgeable & friendly professor. Obviously, don't piss him off. He very available--he's in the class discord. Great guy to talk to. Course is 20% scheme, 5% prolog, 75% C/C++",1
Do not take her she teaches at an advance level  and goes way too fast in lecture . If you struggle in math I suggest you find another teacher.,0
"He is a really nice guy but this class has no structure. His lectures are all over the place and he goes off on tangents that don't relate to the topic at hand and that can be confusing. There are very few grades, so there is a lot of weight on them. Grades on specificity. POOR STUDY GUIDE. Disorganized. But nice guy, just not the best teacher.",1
"I took his class because I had no other option. This professor does not help you at all and expects you to do things by yourself. He does not teach any programming expects how to calculate sum of two numbers and basic stuff. He makes alot of mistakes and says, "" I am not like other profs whk prepare their lectures at home. I do everyrhing here.""",0
"I really enjoyed this class and I really liked this professor. There were huge technical issues with the learning software we were using - the computer marked correct answers as wrong, but Dr. Ikegwuonu went above and beyond to make sure that everyone got the grades they deserved and showed a lot of leeway. Very passionate and knowledgable. ",1
"Incredibly harsh, prone to terrifying outbursts, the ""improvements"" made by her course were found to be lackluster when my next english professor graded the lessons I ""learned"" as worse than when I later switched back to my old writing style. Incredibly harsh, irritable, unforgiving. I've taken 4000 level courses with less headache. Stay away.",0
He is almost impossible to reach via email which is annoying considering the class is online. He will respond to one email which may take a few days to get a response. His class was so easy one homework a week and 3 tests for the entire semester. His only tests are easy and so is the homework. I recommend taking because of how simple the class was.,0
"Traumatizing. Graded by 2 MTs & a final, but you won't have any idea what's on them since they never appeared in lecture or the textbook. Never fully erased the chalkboard. Spoke in ""proofs"" Refused to answer questions. Assumed we knew upper div math. Averages were 50-60 (which he said was good for him). Def run if you ever see his name.",0
"He might be the worst person to gain the privilege of earning a Ph.D. This dude is so unorganized its unreal, he doesn't know what time his class is. Do not take him if you are a student that enjoys structure and a stable course schedulethe worst class I've taken in 4 years.",0
Seriously NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you're amazing at math already I don't think he did his online lectures past the first 2 weeks of school he just uploaded the notes and it was basically like a GOOD LUCK type situation you teach yourself and him really he also teaches the most confusing ways to do things he confuses himself,0
"If you are thoughtful with your responses, you will do good in this class. There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. He replies to emails quickly.",1
"Great guy, willing to talk and work things out with you. Homework is online and very easy, search all problems in google. Class is easy to follow along but he has a thick accent. Didn't use book ever. Class examples are test problems. Overall physics is a hard subject.",1
Seriously the WORST prof ever. He could care less about students during the lectures and mostly avoids answering questions. AVOID at all costs.,0
Very poor communication and doesn't make expectations clear. Thinks she is superior.,0
He takes a a long time to understand the abilities of the students he teaches. Does not understand the preparation given by the prerequisite courses and assumes a lot of material not covered by other courses. His homework is achievable but difficult. His exams are tough. Not much feedback initially but was decent by the end of the course.,0
"By far the worst prof I have ever taken. She has extreme mood swings. If she's having a great day, then class goes smoothly, if not, beware. She talks down on students. Overall, very disrespectful & rude. I would never recommend her. She screams at her students as if we are children. On top of everything, she gets off topic to talk about herself.",0
"Dr. Wang is a wonderful professor.  I have had her for all three of my Calculus classes, and enjoyed every minute of it.  The course work is very simple and not that time consuming.  I definitely recommend a person take Dr. Wang for their math courses.",1
"Incredibly easy class with clear cut grading criteria! Amazing and clear lectures: there were 8 lectures coupled with a quiz, 3 assignments that had to be done with a partner, and 1 midterm and 1 final. She provided a study guide for both exams and the week before she holds a review. I would take her again and highly recommend her to anyone!",1
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
Words cannot describe how awesome Professor Monahan is! He is the best professor I have ever had so far. Every class he cracks everyone up with his great humor and is super funny. I had no interest in business and didn't care for the material but this was still my favorite class because of him. You will not regret taking one of his courses.,1
"Monika was so disorganized. The course structure was all over the place and so last minute. 90% of students in French112 were taking for language requirements - we don't want to be doing presentations in French, we just want to pass the class! Terrible, UBC needs to reassess language requirements.. ",0
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
"Dont take her, worst prof ever. She single handedly ruined my GPA even though I put most of effort in her class.",0
"I love this guy! !  He tells it like it is!  He has a way of keeping my attention in class and keeping it funfunny.  He does have alot to say about women though,  but it's okay,  that's just how he feels.  Pretty cool, informative guy",1
"Professor Jalalvand has been a great engineer for a long time and it shows. It was an honor to be in his class and learn from him. His class is not easy, but I think that hard work and attentiveness really pays off. Lecture is a good supplement to the book which is an absolute necessity. He usually tells you what will be tested. Clear cut. ",1
"50 years ago Miracle may have been a great professor. Now, not so much. Lectures are incredibly dull and sometimes hard to follow. He frequently makes mistakes in his work. Good news is that the tests are exactly like the worksheets and homework, if you've do those, you're golden. It would take a miracle for me to sign up for his class again.",0
"This class is an easy A but I really cant stand Frazier sometimes. Hes rude and arrogant and he gets butthurt quick He doesnt like to take responsibility of his mistakes,when he does its snarky and shady. Discussions always go left because he interprets things weirdly. Quizzes have trick T/F questions but pretty easy. Exams are online though����",0
shes the nicest professor on campus. she goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands everything clearly and does everything she can to make sure everyone gets an A. she is undeserving of any bad ratings.,1
"The professor is very chill, nice to talk to. But what he did in exams is not fair. He just left us all on our own, no clear criteria of what to do in exams. Once the exam is done, he posted the actual criteria and deducted marks. If he didn't mess up the exam I would have given 5 rating :(",0
"Discrimination, no science only politics! Hater of many ethnicities, including Russian people. Hater of some religious. He was disrespectful even to his wife during the class. The worse person I have ever meet. He is not a scientist because his mind is full of political propaganda!",0
"Lipson seems like a good guy, but, quite honestly, his class was boring. 100% of classes were lectures, and there were few times for discussion or in-class assignments. He is super thoughtful though. He prepared thorough study guides for every test and they are very helpful. This is a polisci class, but lectures were more biased than I expected.",1
Fowler is totally disorganized. Class discussions are rambling and unplanned and it's not clear what you're supposed to get from them. Class is almost entirely digression. Horribly unstructured.,0
"You should only expect an A in this class if you show up to every single class and are incredibly engaged. Don't be deceived by the .5 credit: there are many writing assignments and ""Engagement activities"" over the course of the semester (standard for all dance at duke?). This class was more of an extra academic burden than a dance class for me.",0
Prof Leonard is kind but VERY STRICT when it comes to grading. Lots of real life examples. Don't forget to read before class if not you'll get lost. He doesn't really explain much of the theory and doesn't prepare you for the exams. Study on your own. He takes attendance at the beginning of the class and after the break. Wouldn't recommend him,0
"yaya she was easy but i like SOC and i ddnt learn a whole lot, that made me mad,the tests were easy, and projects were eay but i wanted to understand the material, not just sit and do group activities. id take her if you needed the class, if SOC is your major, then no way jose.",1
This lady was pregnant the whole semester and still managed to make the class fun and easy.  No kidding....this chick was still teaching like two days before going into labor!!  What a warrior!!  And was back in class like 3 days later like nothing happened!!  Amazing!!,1
"Dr.Newman is seriously THE WORST. First off, genetics has been nothing but reading outdated papers about Cystic Fibrosis. Secondly,she does NO amount of teaching. She believes that learning from peers and teaching yourself is more beneficial. Neither of which am I paying thousands of dollars for. If you can avoid having a class with her, do it.",0
"For an online class , you have to understand that learning the material is entirely up to the student and how much time is committed to the class! With that being said, Stevens does EVERYTHING she needs to do for a student to pass! She has weekly discussion forums, weekly quizzes , she puts up many helpful videos. YOU MUST COMMIT LOTS OF HOURS !!",1
I am pretty sure that Fred has lost his mind and I do not mean that in a bad way. He has a crazy smile every so often that makes me laugh and other feel uncomfortable. We are only one class in but I'm willing to bet it'll be my best class yet. He is the self proclaimed best teacher in the universe and possibly the multiverse...,1
"Very smart man, but his teaching style wasn't for me. Very strict and assigns a lot of work. You can't miss more than 3 classes or you fail. He is very passionate about Spanish and will help you, but I did feel like he could be rude to some of the students in our class. I probably won't take him again if I can.",0
"I took this class for credit, she knows nothing about the material she is trying to teach, uses a tool called j creator, which is 10 years old. Meaning we as a class were learning java from ten years ago, I currently program with a tool called eclipse, which is the modern equivalent. She is rude and not clear with her grading criteria. Dont take.",0
I started on the wrong foot as a freshman and didn't do the homework right away. If you aren't already familiar with what's being taught..... be prepared to teach it to yourself because he only teaches the people that already know it perfectly. Super confusing and definitely has his own way of doing things.,0
"i dont even know where to start. if youre reading this. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. for me she was the only option left so i was like why not? and i wholeheartedly regret it. trust me, if shes your only option, just wait till next term to take this class. its not worth it unless youre a complete math wizard god. shes the worst teacher i have ever had.",0
"I must say that Prof. Davis' class was great from Day 1.  She has a great sense of humor and made the class fun to learn. I would definitely take her class again, therefore, I would highly recommend her to anyone! I received an A+",1
"Project heavy, but all are valuable.",1
Amazing.,1
This class is SO much work. There are 3 tests and a cumulative final which is optional if you have the average you need to not take it. There is a financial report that is submitted in 2 parts which is VERY time consuming and he doesn't help you on it at all. There are hw's on MyFinanceLab for each chapter. He doesn't explain concepts very well.,0
"The content he has to teach is very difficult, and he doesn't make it any easier by assigning tons of mandatory homework every week. He does not engage class, in fact he hates when he has to stop the class to answer questions. Very difficult to approach outside of class. Exams are very difficult, know what you're doing and study hard, don't slack.",0
His lectures are slow but they are easy to understand. The tests are also not very difficult as long as you remembered what you did for the homework assignments and memorized every single definition taught in class. People typically struggle on the first test but it only counts as 15%. He also lets people do homework in groups which is very useful.,1
Very poor attitude towards students. Weighting of material on test was very unfair. Students were given the opportunity to give feedback after the test. Dr. Balshine was only willing to listen to positive comments and when anyone made a negative comment (true and valid) about something she had done she rudely shot them down and ignored this input,0
Absolutely love Professor Shapero! Don't buy the book. She provides printed material from great books or articles she has read. She loves teaching and it shows. She goes out of her way to help her students become great writers and critical thinkers. She makes you think about the written word and life in general. Highly recommended! A+ professor!,1
"This teacher is HORRIBLE. The material is useless impossible to understand. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. Unless you can read the professor's mind, you will not be able to do well in this course.",0
I feel as though this class was a complete waste of money. We got so behind because of the hurricane (3 weeks behind) and she just kept piling on more work but if we asked her to explain something she made us feel stupid. She also put is in a computer lab but we werent able to use them because she would yell at us for clicking? Why put us in there,0
"Professor Kubota has a great sense of humor and is always great fun in the classroom. However, she does get right to work and makes sure that the class learns what they need to during the lesson. Towards the end of this course it does get really fast-paced and difficult. But that has more to do with the material not really professor Kubota's fault.",1
"Very brash and unapologetic dude. Office hours are practically non-existent because he's adjunct. Physics is hard, but he puts in a lot of work to try to help students really understand the concepts instead of just the underlying math.",1
"Great professor, very helpful and gives very clear assignments, with due dates always posted at the beginning of the week, so you always know when something is due. Textbook is NEEDED! Only con is he takes forever to grade papers so it takes 2-3 weeks till you get your results.... However he replies really fast to emails, and very helpful!",1
Probably the easiest speech class you can take. I loved the course and found it extremely interesting and not difficult at all! Gentry is fabulous and a really forgiving grader. Totally recommend!,1
"Sensei Morales is one of a kind, seriously! He cares so much for all of his students which is the most important thing a professor can do, aside from making learning fun and easy esp a foreign language (WHICH HE DOES TOO!!!) 10/10 will be taking JPN 1121 with him. YOU WILL LEARN JAPANESE!",1
"This teacher is all over the place by going back & forth between the book & online & this is where she lost me in translation. I felt as if I was teaching myself & she made the subject even more boring that it is. She left me confused & frustrated with her assignments & I lost my desire to learn. I felt like a failure, so I dropped.",0
Stone cold pedagogical excellence.,1
"The only thing she's good at is clicking on the power point slides, possibly the worst teacher ever. And if you ask her a question she looks at you like you are an idiot and says ""What do you think"" the only response comes to my mind is ""If you could teach I wouldn't ask you, now would I, so WHAT DO YOU THINK?""",0
"Dr. Bailey is a tough professor. His lectures are very organized, but he goes back on his word a lot. He printed out notes for us, but he would skip slides during lecture. There are no extra credit and the test are pretty hard. I recommend doing the practice problem over and over again until you can do them in your sleep. I zoned out a lot in class",0
class makes me want to change me major.,0
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
"Laptop's are not allowed, must write power point slides. You have an online 4 exams of 100 questions and 4 quizzes of 20 questions. Notes are allowed but write everything as the quiz is still difficult. Group project and presentation at the end was hard, a lot of research and a lot of writing! Participate and do your work and you'll pass.",1
"Worst professor at Hunter. Terrible communication. No curves at all. Has these phone calls in the middle of lectures, doesn't go over anything in depth. Extremely rude to students during class. The quizzes are 10x more difficult than the reviews. The whole physics department is all over the place and this horror show of a professor is a top dog.",0
Very disorganized professor. Made a lot of errors in the tests and her slideshow presentations. Unclear grading and did not teach the material for the class very well. Relied on the textbook heavily which was very poorly written. Take this class if you wish to self learn and watch YouTube videos to learn the material. Sometimes gave out pop quizzes,0
"10/10 recommend I loved this class! He takes role every class but his class is enjoyable. 2 midterms, 5 homework assignments and a final. He gives study guides which are a list of terms from the section and you just need to memorize the definition. That is basically the test. No math or case study in this class. Only memorization. Super easy class!",1
This class was taken during covid. He has 3 tests and a final which replaces your lowest test grade. During tests you only have 1 chance to choose your answer and his questions are super specific. You need to memorize over 200 power point slides to even get a 70 in a test. He says to only know the purple words on PowerPoints but that' not enough.,0
"Quite a bit of reading outside of class, but she does a really good job of picking readings that will spark your interest. She is also a tough grader when it comes to papers, but is super willing to work with you on them if you go visit her office hours. One of my favorite classes I have taken at GU!",1
"His grading is terrible, most of the people in my class are complaining already. Honestly feels like he lacks the compassion because he marks everything off even if your answers are right. I wouldn't recommend taking him.",0
"There is a TON of reading and just as much writing to go along with the reading. It's not a class to take when you have a heavy course load, but it was one of the best classes I took. I was very reluctant because of the preconceived notions I had about WMGS courses, but I am forever grateful I had Dr. Hersh as my instructor",1
If you can learn on your own I'd recommend her otherwise if you need a walk through of the information in order to learn find another professor.,0
Easiest class I took! If you just do the assignments and show up to class you'll pass--the class is only pass/fail anyway. Professor Summers is so kind and realistic. He offered to take students on tours through the Nurse Learning Center. He also will add 10 people on the first day of class so go if you don't get in and you might have a chance!,1
"This class is the worst spanish course that I have ever taken. We have so much homework for every class and the quizzes are terrible. She is nice, but this class is not worth it. I have gotten an A in every spanish class up to this point. The quizzes have things we never even talked about and the sakai page is so unorganized.",0
"Dr. Guerriero is incredibly kind! Her passion for the subject matter is always evident.  While her class can be very boring and redundant, it is a breeze, and she makes it very easy to pass. There were 2 easy quizzes and the final, which was not cumulative and taken online.",1
"Good guy, but HE CAN'T TEACH. Makes you watch YouTube videos. His very unorganized. Course exams questions and project exams questions are so unclear. You never know what he wants you to do. He expects you to read 30-50 pages SQL code and master it by next class without clear explanations of concepts. Beware if you take him for 331",0
"Hur is hard to understand and will definitely push your drive and knowledge. Don't take him for an easy grade, you will definitely have to work to receive an A or B.",0
"Are you kidding me?  This class is awful!  He rambles on about nothing, and grades very arbitrarily on his exams and quizzes.  He won't cover material in the class and expects you to read it (he assigns SO MUCH).  There is no way you can keep up with everything.  Plays favorites and if he can't remember your name your grade is screwed.",0
Prof Hofreiter was one of the best professors I have had so far. She's caring and understanding but she's honest and blunt. She doesn't give a lot of homework but if you do it all she notices. She just has 3 main papers and she gives a straight forward promt. she also makes sure you have feedback and learn from it. oh and she's halarious,1
"He is the best!  You'll probably hate him in the beginning, but after the first half of chem110 he turns into such a nice guy!  I was having problems understanding some of the material in che111, and he actually offered to sit down with me and help me understand the material.  He saved my semester!  Sometimes he grades really hard though...",1
"Tries so hard but I do not understand him...can't explain, but really nice guy",1
"Nice guy. In this class pay very close attention to his opinions, that will be how you are graded. He talks A LOT about his own education so it doesn't hurt to seem impressed. Overall, I'm glad this class is over.",1
stay away from harry,0
"Professor Aviles-Santiago was extremely helpful over the semester. The class was fun and interesting, he was flexible with assignments and went out of his way to help me succeed in this course. I would definitely take a class from him again. ",1
"I think she's the worst teacher at the J School for first-year students. I know she has good reviews for her upper-level courses, but it didn't go well when I had her for a 100-level class. She expects you to know things you haven't been taught yet. Her tests are also pretty difficult because she focuses on very obscure sections of the textbook.",0
The worst professor I have ever had. She does nothing but read word for word off a PowerPoint than grades your papers on layout not content. I haven't learned anything from her other than they let anyone teach.,0
would only recommend this class if you really enjoy journalism and I mean really enjoy it. The professor is very demanding of how he wants things done and there is a ton of writing for this class,0
"I had her for Trusts and estates. Just meh... I heard good things about her and she was okay but I wasn't super impressed. She is to the point, which I like, but then sometimes doesn't actually answer your question or tries to make you feel stupid for asking something.",0
I was so excited to take this class but it's definitely hard to take online. We didn't have scheduled meeting times (but there were office hours). My only issue is that it was hard to follow and understand what was going on. You really need to live by the syllabus. Not hard once you figure everything out.,1
He didn't make us do anything too stressful,1
Very timid teacher. Does not know how to stick up for himself or just plain doesn't care. Reads off the power point slides and is extremely boring to listen to and watch. Homework is very important and he gives no lenience. I work with computers and I would never recommend someone to him who doesn't know how to use computers already.,0
Professor Cramer is a saint among men. He's very understanding when it comes to unforeseen situations sometimes plague students and late assignments. By far one of my favorite professors at Suffolk.,1
Fantastic for lecture.  Slide handouts are 90% of test material.  Will be taking for Physiology this semester!,1
"Nolan was an excellent PSYCH professor.  You really need to attend class, as her PPTs are bare boned and she teaches in more of a lecture style.  Tests are a little challenging - just study and you'll do fine!",1
Don't do it. Just DON'T,0
Worst professor I ever took this semester I'm failing her course at the moment and I don't know if I could still pass! Very disorganized and difficult to pass I will never take her again!!,0
She doesn't make it easy to approach her or ask questions. Condescending remarks are in every lecture. She keeps you the whole class time and rambles. There is no acknowledgement for effort. I'm considering dropping this class which would stop me from graduating this semester. I'm a 3.8 GPA student and have never failed a test until now.,0
"Mr. Landrum is a very great teacher, he hates phones, so dont use them in class. He has many pop quizzes, so read all the stories he assign. His test arent really hard at all, but he have to essay questions on the test that you really have to study for. The multiple choice and matching is very easy, if you went to class and took the notes.",1
Felizzi is the best professor I have had at MU. He is a fair grader and takes an interest in getting to know his students. He is very personable and always found time to answer my questions or help with providing useful feedback on my papers. If you have the opportunity to take him do it. You will be glad you did.,1
She's very knowledgeable about the subject of biology.  The textbook and her lectures also give you a strong foundation for the subject.,1
"Professor France is amazing! She is a very lenient professor and gives a very manageable workload. She is very clear on her instructions for assignments and if there is something that is unclear, email her. She is very attentive to her emails and responds within 24 hours. If I needed to take more English courses, I'd take her.",1
Dr. Johnston is one of the lab TA's for this course and she is so lovely and caring for her students. She also teaches a forensic anthropology course at OSU. She'll respect you if you respect her.,1
"He is a nice guy, but admits the first day that he is monotoned and prepares us for a boring course.  His quizzes are hard for the pure fact that there is so much material to cover for a 10 question quiz.  He isn't helpful outside of class and is very hard to get ahold of. DONT TAKE. Take learning!!!!",0
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
"Dr. Cochrane is a great professor! She will repeat notes, is very helpful with answering questions etc.  She really wants class participation, so do not be afraid to voice your opinion.  The class is interesting and fairly easy.  Two exams and three papers. I would take another one of her classes.",1
"Unprepared, unclear, unavailable.",0
"If you take this class just know you will need to read and watch a couple of films. You will have to do homework twice a week based on the readings and the films. However, he only gives you 2 exam (midterm and final) and one short paper. If you have any questions you can e-mail Professor Pfeifer and he will respond right away. Easy A if you read.",1
"Mrs. Johnson is very nice and wants her students to succeed.  Notes are printed off of blackboard and the tests are based off of these notes.  The only marginally hard part of the class is typing up the Sociological journal which is due mid-semester.  After the journal is finished, just study your notes and the tests are a breeze.",1
He was a new teacher so I will give him that. He made his tests way too long and still did not curve. Maybe next semester will be better. Labs are very difficult but if you put a lot of effort into them and get help from the TA you will do well on them. He is a very good lecturer regardless of how hard the class is. ,1
"I took ma151, 152, and two semesters of physics with this man and he is ""the bomb."" We have class parties for physics which entail the hw assignment of bringing food and jokes. He will work with you until you understand whatever it is you don't get. Plus he is a kind grader. If you try you get some credit no matter what. He is truly fabulous.",1
Hes very good at his job! I had a blast with him even though I ended up missing an entire week of class. He emailed me making sure I was okay and I was there to finish the semester! Would recommend! Just stay off your darn phones!,1
"This class was not at all what I expected.  The tests were completely random and hard, but at least he scaled them. Lectures are hard to sit through for 1hr and 20 min",0
The course material is not soo difficult but he makes it so with his choppy explanations. Only grades tests. Does gives around 20pts extra credit for every test; which makes up for his teaching ability. He does the 1st extra credit in class. 1 day I know he gave 5pts EC just for coming.I hardly learned anything but got a B in the class.,1
Dr. Portaro is awesome! She is super nice and wants to help her students. She speaks clearly and always teaches interesting topics. She's a fair grader as well. ,1
"I love Dr. H! She is by far my favorite professor at WKU. Her classes are well constructed, promote learning, and interesting. She's informative and responds quickly with questions. Even if you're not interested in Anth she makes it so if you try (which you should be doing) you can pass.",1
All you have to do is take notes from the powerpoint lecture and then he'll give you a take home test at the end of every week. His tests are not hard if you take notes. He will interact with the class by asking questions and sometimes tell stories. He also has an extra credit question every day if you're on time. There is only 1 APA paper due.,1
"Professor Krusko is an excellent teacher.  She is clear, helpful, and that makes the material very easy to understand. She is very learned in the Anthropology field, and it is no wonder that she is the department head.",1
I feel bad.. but she's a pretty bad teacher. I'm taking her now and I'm so excited for December to come around.. She assigns an assload of busy work just because.. she's really vague and an over all poor teacher. She will discuss essays and she's actually pretty helpful about that.. but that's pretty much it.,0
No interest In teaching and not available outside class . Always speaks about his child and his new car ! I won't recommend this instructor .,0
"By far the most unorganized class I have been apart of at NC State. He only communicates through email, he lost student's assignments multiple times. I felt like I was taught nothing and had to figure it out on my own. He is a nice guy and a genius in AutoCAD but I just did not enjoy him as a teacher. You will probably get a high grade in the class",0
"Her expectations are unrealistic. It took myself and my fiance tag-teaming this course to get through it, my fiance is a teacher. Every week there are 6 writing assignments. There were so many links to so many different sources of information. It was absolutely ridiculous. If you are going back to school as an adult, you dont have time for this...",0
I don't know if it is the class or the teacher but this was the most boring class I have ever taken. He did not have any material to teach us so instead he would make us do weekly reading responses then we would spend 2 HOURS going over them in class. Biggest waste of time.,0
"Honestly and sincerely one of the most rude professors I've ever had. His teaching assistant, Kelly Budesa is just as bad. He had 'okay' insight but it felt as if they were only teaching because they needed to. In no way did it seem like they wanted to teach the course and if you asked them, they'd probably admit it. One of the worse profs I've had",0
"I took Psychology 100 online, fast track, with professor Dudley. He is an easy grader when it comes to the discussion boards and written assignments and he provides great feedback. Although it was online, you can tell he cares about his students. You need to read the textbook to get a good grade on the exams since there are no study guides.",1
"This class is extremely easy. All the homework is online and you can do it as many times as you would like. The actual class time is a lot of youtube and reading the vocabulary words in the specific chapter, so not very helpful. You really have to teach yourself. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy.",0
I took prof Rice for lecture and I say just try and avoid her at all costs if you can. She is sarcastic and does not care about you passing at all. Again AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU CAN.,0
"She did not give advance warning in class about the quizzes - she said the students had to continously check on-line for the quizzes.  She unexpectedly gave a test one day earlier than previously announced in class, which was totally unfair and unreasonable. Her lectures are worthless. She has a heavy Russian accent, and is hard to understand.",0
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
"Took his hybrid class tests are difficult and attendance is not required since they are online. However, tests are important and are based on the overall grade of class. A research paper 6 pages and online discussions is also the assignments in class. ",0
4 week class. 2 tests (m/c & t/f 70 to 75 questions in 60 minutes). 1 cumulative final on all 16 chapters (75 questions m/c & t/f in 60 minutes) Assignments are pretty easy. 1 20q quiz per chapter & 2 to 4 assignments for each chapter (takes 1-3 hrs a day). 5 to 6 chapters per week all assignments & quizzes due on Sunday. Can work at your own pace.,1
"She explained simple things in really confusing ways, genetics was easy, but she explained everything out of order with no good explanations of anything. She also gives two ten minute breaks in lecture then speeds through all the material to the point where you can barely write fast enough let alone understand the material.",0
"Fontenot is a fair instructor that is concerned with his students actually learning the material. I have personally taken him for Java, C++, and for Data Structures. If you engage, pay attention, and put in the work, you will get a good grade. There's often a moderately heavy workload, so procrastinate or slack off and you're not gonna do well.",1
"Nice person but ridiculously hard teacher. He enjoys making the class harder than it should be - his tests are worded poorly and many times have multiple answers underneath each question, making you second guess yourself even if you know the material. I have a degree and this was my last class prior to grad school with a 3.5 GPA. Take ANYONE else.",0
"Ok wow I can't stand how she talks, so boring, and her online quizzes are pointless. Also, her whole participation grade is CRAP because its only if you show up or not. So if you're deathly ill for two weeks she'll give you a Zero... so basically you can show up and sleep in class and get a 20/20 she friggin sucks... i will never take her again",0
clearly he is writing his own feedback on here. sitting in front won't help. going to innovation lab or slc was only way I could understand it. not helpful. kept saying right... like everyone one understood what he head just said and the room sat there confused and shaking heads as he kept talking... get ready to hear him talk nonstop...,0
"Very interesting class to fulfill elective requirements. Textbook is used and must be read to get full participation points and for the exams. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final. Lectures are worth attending and cover topics for the exams/quizzes. A good amount of reading outside of class, but not unmanageable. Professor is wonderful and helpful",1
most terrible teacher up and left mid semester cause she got a job in another province.,0
"I took intro stats and although Velleman is known for ""taking the math out of stats"" the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences. And he's super approachable. If you study, you'll do well. When he says he's taking the math out, he just means you don't have to do rote calculations; you THINK and logic it",1
I took his class for second semester even after reading the comments and I strongly recommend not taking his class. First off there's no leniency and doesn't even communicate properly on what's gonna be on the midterm. His lectures online looks like chicken scratch and its unreadable.,0
I absolutely loved this class. I took the composition I early finish and it was by far the most interesting class Ive taken. The topics on the papers were very interesting and pretty broad so I was able to chose what I wanted to write. Discussions every week that was from a reading or video.,1
"Non accurate prof. Tells you one thing but screws you over for it. Not the best prof in scad, should just leave.",0
"Your grade for the class relies heavily on 4 exams, no extra credit offered, and very few assignments to buffer a poor grade on an exam",0
Blanton is super boring. He is a nice person but a horrible professor. He will try to make jokes; you will not laugh. Half the class is spent on him trying to figure out the computer. Not the worst class but you must be disciplined; it's easy to fall asleep.,0
"The midterm research paper and final count for like your whole grade, so the other stuff barely  matters! She is VERY broad on what will be on the tests, and most are short answer ques. & essay. Teacher is not friendly or helpful at all!!!",0
She did a better job in this class.,1
She is very enthusiastic in teaching. the book is required and you got to make sure that you have taken ACC110 before taking this class and ITS A MUST!!& you must know the CASH FLOW STATEMENT!! She is reasonable with the grading as long you pass the midterm and final you will pass the class even if your quizzes and exams are low. ,1
Great professor. Still remember him 8 years after taking the class.  Put it all together for me.  Very clear,1
"it wasnt my favorite class  aren was fine but not my favorite professor. lectures were boring but i made it through the class just fine while barely doing the readings, so take that as you will!",1
one of the easy lab professors (lab professors here either give you 3-5 hours worth homework  a week or 15-30 minutes of homework. he's one of the 15-30 minute guys). take him. easy A but you'll still learn something.,1
"HILARIOUS and nice! You have to show up to class and semi know the books he assigns. He grades papers really easy. You have to be willing to talk because he expects students to lead the discussions. The final is a bit challenging; the questions are hard but I'm pretty sure he curves it. Just show up, talk about the readings and you'll get an A.",1
"Dr. Keeling is a very demanding teacher and does not and will not give you extra help / accommodation when you need it. He expects everything his way or you'll get a 0, while preaching ""grades don't matter."" If you miss a class or show up a fraction of a second late, he'll passive aggressively call you out on it and make you feel terrible.",0
"Bruh I feel so played...I thought our average was low enough for her to change the grading scale, but apparently she didn't. Her class is easy enough to get a B, but you need to barely miss anything to get an A. Her tests are too tedious to get a solid A. Try to avoid her, but she isn't the worst. She's a nice and caring person though",0
Don't take her class! was super excited to learn HTML but was slowly ruined by this prof. She signaled me out to always answer questions I didn't know and wouldn't take that as an answer. She's not helpful and I just learned HTML on my own time because it was easier than learning from her. This course would be good if there was a different prof...,0
"Loved her class on Race and Poetry. She is one of the most hands on professors at a big school that I've ever had. Just show up to class prepared, make sure to read the poems and participate in class and you'll do fine. If you need help she's always happy to meet with you and work on papers or concepts. She doesn't tolerate apathy.",1
By far the worst teacher. dont expect to get more than 70 percent on the essays. Will literally mark you down for the smallest things. ,0
very tough grader. She knows the material but doesn't know how to teach it to the students at all. Not very helpful when it comes to exams. Her exams are impossible to pass with a a decent grade.,0
"WORST DAMN TEACHER EVER!
 Not only can she not stay focused during class, she needs to ask for a copy of the syllabus just to see when her own assignments are due.
 
 Worst of all she is just a mean lady.",0
"Don't be prepared to learn much. He takes too long to explain things that you should have learned in high school, which gives very little time to dig into new material",0
GREAT professor. Explains how to adjust in a very clear and concise manner.,1
"Edward gives interesting and detailed lectures that I found entertaining and educational. He enjoys discussion, which represents a decent chunk of class time. Unfortunately, his quiz's fall into the History Teacher trap of nitpicky detail. Note to Ed: Discussion is great! Asking how many pounds of meat/fish Fredrick Douglass was rationed is silly.",1
Really nice and truly cares about every student.,1
"Even if you do exactly what he wants, word by word, you will not get an A. He refuses to give out 100% and can never be reached in time. His lectures have NOTHING to do with anything you do in class, but since attendance is mandatory, it is a waste of time. There are projects back to back with no clear grading criteria and hundreds of assignments.",0
This is a hard class but he is always available for help.,1
"Dr. G as he likes to be called is actually a nice guy. However, he fails to even come close to being an average professor. He doesn't grade any homework. The tests are on a completely different level than what he teaches. The study guides will not prep you for a single test. If you need help don't ask him as he can't see why you don't understand.",0
"His class covered the most basic grammar, and then he grades ridiculously hard on papers. Lots of threats at students, not a likable person at all. I learned absolutely nothing, and I went to every class. I wish I had skipped them all or not taken the class. His only advice is to use Grammarly or the writing center instead of actually helping.",0
"Jill is a wonderful professor who truly cares about her students. The class is extremely difficult and dense, but she makes it fun and is there for you. I had a very difficult time learning to ""think like a nurse"" in this first semester, but really started to get it by the end of the term! Would definitely take her again.",1
"Dr. Du definitely your choice for this class! He starts tough, at least looks like, but he gives a lot curves on the exams after he found out the average is not that high. Class time is the most important personally speaking, he gives a lot using the class time. Plus review session and practice questions for each exam are must!",1
"Great guy, wants everyone to do well but at the same time makes sure you improve your writing.  I have never had a prof. that improved my writing as much as him!! Its not an easy A but if you put your time in and show interest you will do well.",1
"Cares more about how you present your work then what you present. Spent a large amount of time covering Chicago style, and tells us we'll get 10% off an essay for missing periods in the footnotes. Quizzes are easy, read to participate, and get ready to be bored at his slow style. Grades toughly for not following the instructions *exactly* as typed.",0
I learned a lot from this class. She was a very tough grader but gives good feedback for you to improve. I really did not like her at first but she's very intelligent and knows what she's talking about. Her class can be very boring because it lasts the full 2.5 hrs but she asks discussion questions so we can be involved and time goes faster.,1
Her exams are hard,0
"She is okay, with the exception of talking/teaching WAY to fast for me. She moves from one thing to the next so quick. So much material to be covered in such a short time. she does post the notes from class. energetic, morning person for sure!",1
Professor List was amazing. I wish he could teach all of my classes. He is very patient and super funny.,1
"Make sure to study the notes. If you understand the theory you will do well. He is very helpful and welcoming, but you need to be familiar with what you are wanting help with or he will talk over your head.",1
"Professor Morris was my lab professor for a 4 credit CSNP lecture/lab class. As far as lab assignments went, he was a very gracious and forgiving grader. Our lab classes were guided, so attendance wasn't required . Morris was still there every day, giving help to anyone who needed it. He always had all the right answers, great professor.",1
"Very time restricted exams online, has habit of not unlocking assignments on time",0
Easiest class ever,1
Class is really easy and self-explanatory. Attendance is mandatory so just do other work in this class. There's 3 midterms & 1 final all multiple choice/true or false questions with some extra credit questions hidden in the test. You don't need to pay attention in class to get an A. Follow all instructions & study night before. Textbook not needed,0
i took building construction with him online. its like he wasnt even there. he never talked to us about anything. we just did the assignments and got no feedback. this was my 1st online class and i never want to take another 1. i had no motivation to log on from my house and i was always late with everything. he gave everyone As onthe paper though.,0
"Scheduled another prof. and got Nicastro. If you want to get yelled at and feel stupid for an entire physics lab take Nicastro. As the chair of the department, he was teaching a very low level physics lab and was taking it wayyy too seriously.",0
"Gives totaly subjective quests that r impossible 2 find specific answers 2, yet she wants u to somehow manufacture multiple citations frm the text 2 support ur position. Don't think she even reads the Bb responses b/c she repeatedly gives canned responses that ""you need to summarize and give personal examples"" even when they've already been given.",0
I loved Professor Smith's class. All of the work she had us do was extremely beneficial and not just busy work. I always left her class feeling motivated and inspired. She truly cared about all of her students.,1
Great professor. Tough grader but fair. Everything is in syllabus.,1
Worst professor ever. No one should ever take him. Couldn't teach to save his life. He doesn't even know how to use the technology at hand ie basic computer or projector. Only teaches for him to understand and no one else. Avoid like the plague. If you have no choice get outside help asap.,0
"he can be rude and if you don't understand something and ask a question, he often makes it more confusing for you. he randomly leaves the classroom (daily, MULTIPLE times per class period). the labs make no sense unless you've already taken classes before. he makes it way harder to understand then he should for a gen ed course.",0
"He is running capstone this year. He is terrible. Poor communication and organizational skills. We met maybe 4 times over both semesters, excluding our progress presentations, which went terribly. He told groups their projects weren't difficult enough, despite having already approved them. Just goes to show he didn't read the proposals.",0
Did not learn much,0
He is good in teaching. But don't use proper material for studies.,1
"Must complete all of the reading, making a reading outline will be useful, contrary to common belief also review lecture notes before exams because they parallel the readings and will be referred to on the exams, very helpful and willing to engage in discussion.",1
"Sophomore biology seminar; He is great! Inspirational, helpful, and generous. He doesn't have everything in on time and doesn't expect you to either - life happens. If something is a little late it's no big deal he understands. Doesn't stress over citation details (you can worry about that for Senior Sem!). He gives solid constructive feedback.",1
"love love love Labelle. Amazing professor. Lectures are inspirational and actually teach. Exams are straight forward, and study guides are provided. Will offer feedback on assignments. REALLY understands her subject research. Very smart professor and love attending her class. Definitely will take her in the future. ",1
Prof. Tortolani is the best professor to get for Italian. She tells you exactly what are going to be on the quizzes and gives you a good study guide for the midterm and final. She is very helpful if you go to her and wants her students to pass. If you can get a professor for Italian get Prof. Tortolani.,1
"Walks around and disappears for periods during class. Need help? Try not to, she has a hard time focusing and giving advice on how to improve a project. Not much help when learning things on the wheel which happens at the end. Gives suggestions for how she would complete a project even if it isn't the best way.",0
"If you don't know how to use the camera or Premiere, she'll say to watch YouTube or read the manuals instead of teaching. Every film is an art film that needs a political or psychological undertone. You have a week and a half to do all the filming and editing for a project, show it for rough cut, and then reshoot and edit the whole thing in 2 days.",0
Non responsive to emails or outside help. Does not follow her own syllabus. Extremely test heavy with 100+ questions each.,0
This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend.,0
"Professor Reznitskaya is very intelligent, therefore, she expects a lot from her students. Her class isn't extremely hard but it involves a lot of reading and a lot of work.",0
"Mr Wickert is truly an angel, I am the worst when it came to writing papers I would always get C's or lower on papers in high school but with his help I passed his class with an A so that said's a lot about his teaching skills. I took him for 101 & 102 I always enjoyed coming to his class he is the BEST. I've learned a lot just show up.",1
overall the material is great but unfortunately this guy does not have the ability to provide an example and clarification to the class. Hw is copy and paste which he will provide to you and during the exam he doesn't care whether you're cheating or not as long as your near the average or above the average you'll be guaranteed an B past exams need,0
"Do NOT take this professor. I don't care if you have to wait a semester; it is not worth it. You will not have a good time with this guy, even if you think you are an awesome student. No study guides, just burns through formulas with very little explanation, no curve, no extra credit, easy to fail tests, and is kind of condescending.",0
"I've never met a prof who specifies using a (TERRIBLE) template for submitting assignments and refuses to let students add/remove space after questions. There's not enough space and all she can say is ""you can format it to fit"". These are equations we're talking about, NOT a resume. Assignments are also not on the actual content ""taught"". Horrible.",0
"Nice guy, open to meet with you after class to go over your assignments. A little boring and monotone voice, but he tries his best considering the dry material A lot of group activities Marks hard",1
There really isnt a problem with Anita. There are just too many assignments. I felt like I was in graduate school. I say take this class at a trade school for 100 bucks I think there are also free programs for medical terminology. Im retaking the class for free and transferring the credit over. Way too many papers and discussions a week,0
"Shes so sweet! She is very nice and can is able to help you with whatever questions you have. However, she is kind of unclear about the tasks, and the homework/classwork is extremely easy. ",1
Okay let's begin. 1. She uploads the notes (if you're lucky... up to a week after they were covered in class) but without the pictures which she tests you on. 2. Not one soul on the planet can memorize every archaeological site in the world to put it on a map! 3. can't hear you! 4. memorize ALL of your notes for exams or you're screwed!!!!,0
"He is no help at all and is just awful, don't know how he has a teaching license.",0
When it comes to tests this guy does not know what he is doing. His review sheets have little to nothing to do with his tests.,0
He's super funny and very interactive. there's not a lot of work at all if you just pay attention during lectures and listen to the music at home then it'll be a very easy class for.,1
"He will overload you with information so be prepared to pick which one u can use and which one not. He confuses himself a lot so prepare to teach yourself. Go ahead of the class if you're able because sometimes he makes you turn in a lot of homework at once. If you want to get a B or an A, put a lot of effort into this class.",0
Rick Is by far the most relaxed professor I have had so far in my time hear.He is the type of guy that you could just hang out with and knock a few back. Cool dude and fun course.,1
"She is very nice and tried to provide as many examples as possible for better understanding the material, reading before the lecture are encouraged since her accents it's a bit strong therefore you may not understand all her lecturer. Also, she is a good marker too, willing to give you extra credit if you can show her that you are participate",1
"Dr. Searfoss thinks she is the only one that is right. I never want to talk in this class because she never accepts anyone's answers, even though everyone is just giving their analysis of a reading. I am not sure why she even wants the class to participate when no one is right but her. I would not recommend her if you want to feel respected.",0
"Don't take S&P with Palmer, he makes it unnecessarily difficult. Much of your grade is 2 tests, which are ridiculously hard. He didn't give us any hints on what's on them, saying everything in the chapters is ""fair game"" so I spent hours memorizing like 170 concepts to be tested over 20 of them. It is the hardest and worst class I've ever taken.",1
"I was recommended by other people to take this class, and that was the worst mistake ever, this professor doesn't introduce topics he goes over a topic once and thats it, maybe touching back on it before the test but again only once. He isn't clear, the hw isn't helpful, he never goes over hw so you don't know if you did it right, bad class.",0
Dr. Kaminski is definitely one of the better teachers. If you're a computer science major you're probably going to have her eventually. She's unavoidable. But that's not a bad thing. Her classes are tough and her homework assignments are specific and detailed. Just follow instructions carefully and you'll be fine.,1
He is nice to look at but not really saying much.  His lectures are boring as he mainly is reciting book material and doesn't care much about student's opinions or input.  Asks lots of rhetorical questions not really wanting answers.  Overall good eye candy.,1
Overall not a great help. Would not recommend to friends.,0
"Professor Fitzgerald was usually a couple minutes late to lecture, read straight off her powerpoint and her tests were a bit difficult. Its hard (for me at least) to learn from a professor who just reads from slides.",1
"Professor Jaja was always available after class when I had questions that needed to be answered. You need to pay attention in class and study a lot. Its not an easy A , but if you work for it and asked questions you will do fine. She is very kind and approachable if you are respectful to her as usually expected by any professor.",1
"The professor is very nice, helpful, and provides feedback but instructions are always unclear. Make sure to clarify everything otherwise you will be stuck. Pretty easy but boring class as long as you attend class, do the work and work with your group.",1
"Prof. Ams is among the worst teachers I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach. He just stands in front of the room and talks at the class. He draws rxn mechanisms, but I don't feel like he ever explains why things are happening the way they are. I would not recommend Ams to anyone. I am certainly going to avoid his classes from now on.",0
"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",0
"I loved this class, I love the theories he taught, In fact I still know them. I hate the fact that his Exams are THEORY BASED though. What good theories only for engineers. What good is to memorize with very little applications. Its easy to pass his class. But hard to get A because he takes of A LOT of points for little things. Like wrong sign, -20",0
"One of the worst professors I ever had. She is unorganized, messes up on quizzes a lot. + She is really rude and doesn't not listen to what you have to say esp during these times. She claims its bc she been a professor for 30 years and your just slacking off. she never answered my emails either and when she did she yelled at me. do NOT take her.",0
Useless.  Unpleasant.,0
"Funny professor,very kind, but being very strict with attendance.  Only lectures, no need for participation. Always write all important points and definitions on the blackboard, clearly and orderly. Quizzes and tests are usually about some items mentioned on the blackboard,  not difficult if you understand and  memorize them. Worth to try.  ",1
"King's class is based on attendance, so show up and you will be sure to receive a B. She is also very group orientated, meaning that over half the class is group projects/graded. This class is very focused on the now, so current events.",1
"He is funny but you can't deny his holier-than-thou attitude. He used to disregard me in office hours and participation because he genuinely enjoys humiliating a student who volunteers to contribute in class. Also I once asked him to review my bugged code and he scuffed at me ""your attempt isn't good enough for a rudimentary problem"" So opinionated",0
"She is a very underatanding, relatable professor. She is big in your individual science field notebook, she assigns videos that are easy to understand so that you can add these notes into your notebook. She assigns month projects that are unique and fun! I recommend her!",1
"I greatly regret taking this class. I paid for the course, I purchased the work designed by MYMATHLAB, yet, I couldn't even get help, no response to emails, totally ignored, want an easy way to make money doing absolutely nothing. You got me this time, you won't get another dime of my hard earn money. I was on my own, shame shame .",0
terrible professor ever. Tons of reading and she asked you to do a lot of stupid things in class. You cannot learn anything from her class. Had to drop her class. Not recommended.,0
"She is the most horrible instructor I have ever had in my life!  She does't respond to emails, doesn't update d2l, doesn't grade assignments promptly, grading system is a joke, she grades and gives grades on however she wants, and she's not punctual herself but expects that from us.  Literally she makes you read the whole book. hardly lectures",0
"At first the content seemed to be way over my head but after a few classes i loved it!  if you give it a chance and really try to understand what the articles are saying, you will be so much more enlightened on English as a whole.  Rivas did an amazing job at teaching this subject and is very helpful.",1
Do not take this professors online class he will not teach you anything. If you have experience in code you should be able to get a good grade but don't expect to learn much at all.,0
"Dr. Weston is a nice and fair professor who understands students and goes out of her way to ensure student success. She is a great lecturer, and extremely accessible. She is also pleasant. However, the workload and pace is horrendous for this class. I would suggest taking it by itself. It is the hardest class that I have had at ASU, so far.",1
"Do NOT take Milligan. Her lectures are super boring with no clear examples or visuals. Her midterms are extremely difficult and she does not curve any of the tests. By far the worse professor i have ever had. Also, makes you read a ton of unnecessary articles. ",0
Pretty simple class. Memorization is key. You probably won't use your book much unless you do bonus assignments. She's very nice and reasonable.,1
I took college alg with him a few yrs back and wanted to take business cal with him. his lectures were great. tests are similar to homeworks. do the homework and youll be ok. he reviewed and gave many examples in class. his explanations were clear. helped us organize in study groups that help a lot. took him for two courses. highly recommend him!!!,1
"Syllabus: 4 fifty-question multiple choice exams, 1 (optional) final. Going to lecture isn't required since all the notes are online. I didn't get much out of lectures because Lutfi seemed pretty unorganized.",0
She sometimes didn't respond to my emails and didn't give us enough information. Pushed the 3rd test and final so close together at the end of the semester. Spend most of your time trying to pass the frustrating mathxl questions,0
this course requires a great amount of effort and work. every class you are graded based upon your participation. lots of homework. Tough grader on the writing assignments. I am not sure that anyone received a grade higher than a B+ in my class.,1
"Biggest gripe is a lot of reading and review for few questions, and those questions are vague and easily mixed up. Retaining 75 pages worth of reading on a very broad topic such as communication, and quiz/test questions are barely about main points or topics. Would not recommend this teacher for this class.",0
easiest class i have taken so far at wake tech. yea she goes through powerpoint slides really fast but that doesnt even matter. her study guides are the EXACT same questions & answers that are on her test. first test i got a 98 & my lowest test grade was a 96 all semester. memorize the study guide & u got an easy A. i LOVED her!!,1
"Horrible professor, doesn't teach you a thing. Powerpoints are 500 slides of garbage, and he give you an exam on the first seven chapters the second week of school. And expect an exam every 2 weeks after that",0
She is va very tough grader!,0
"She posts all her notes, but dont rely on these as theyre vague and she expands so much more in class. There is a lot of memorization for the tests. I found she was a generous marker on the tests though. I enjoyed her lectures and she always responded very quickly and thoroughly to emails. Overall great prof!",1
"I absolutely loved him, fav professor at ucr by far!! hes so passionate and makes lecture fun. Extremely down to earth guy. Just do your readings and you should be fine. he clearly states midterm/final prompts in advance and you get a notecard to write whatever you want for them!!",1
This class is very difficult.The work never ends. We never get out of class early.Think twice about taking this.,0
Professor Ortiz really knows ELL inside out and she is a great networking connection. She is clear and stern in what she wants which is awesome. She commands respect and takes the class in the direction it is supposed to be going. She also assigns  super useful reading resources for ELL teaching in both book and article formats. ,1
"Dr. Harvey will make you work but her practice tests and office hours clear everything up. Do the extra problems in the book when you can, and do practice tests before the test- you will do grea. I really appreciate that she takes the time to explain anything I get confused on at office hours. She had practice questions in class, which helped lots.",1
"She is such a nice lady, she even bought us donuts on exam day!! There is reading assigned to be done before each class but interesting so not too bad. She wants to hear your feedback and wants her students to do well. Grade is pretty much just 2 exams which are straightforward and clicker quizzes which are super easy! She also offers extra credit",1
Hoffman is really hard for biochem. I know students here are saying good things about him which I agree with. He's not a bad guy just rushes through lecture and his exams are only thing that your grade will be based on. Whole class wants extra credit but Hoffman don't care.,0
An absolute waste of time.  Do yourself a huge favor and drop whatever class you're taking with him and wait until someone else teaches it.,0
"This guy can't teach worth crap. If I learned anything in this class it was from the TA, because Dr. Feldman managed to make the most simple concepts extremely difficult to understand. He also has some sort of anxiety disorder. He was always on-edge and his mannerisms were super distracting. If you struggle with math, do not take this professor.",0
"This is a course where you have to interact with the Professor often, it is difficult because the Proffesor can sometimes be very rude/condescending. I did get a good mark for the course, however I found the Proff's attitude extremely unnecessary. There was a lot of interesting material to learn, but I would not retake the course with her.",0
"I thought that i would really enjoy sociology going into this class, but ended up hating it. She made us watch 2 in class movies which i thought were a waste of time.1st exam was awful and she was very defensive when the class tried to talk to her. Also, in class assignments, so make sure to go.I had a 3.8 last quarter, and got a B- in this class.",1
Excellent teacher.  Always helpful.  Wish he taught more classes.,1
"took over for our physic teacher half way through the semester because he was ill. Completely changed the lesson plan. skipped 5 chapters of learning because we left off at chapter 11 before spring break and came back on chapter 16... and then tested us over 11-15. Nice lady, but her homework and lesson plan could use some work",0
He is one of the worst teachers I have had and his class is extremely hard.,0
"Overall: Very poor lecture, requires time to teach yourself. Lecture: Verbally teaches math, lacks organization, a lot of side talk. Homework: will assign problems that he didnt lecture on (uses textbook). Tests: Mostly basic problems, do the study guide. He is nice, kind, and funny. If you already know math and dont need any help, take him.",0
"Such a nice prof! Wants to make sure everyone understands things and caters the course to the level of the students. I'm usually terrified of participating in class, but she made such a comfortable environment that I wasn't afraid to make mistakes or ask questions.",1
"This class is a mess... He had no idea how to teach Unity and also was confused every class, his TA even more. He was also late to every class, cutting class time by 20 mins on average. If you actually wish to learn game dev, skip ASU & learn it from another school or online. CPI111 was already bad, but CPI211 isn't even a class, but it is an ez A.",0
"She is nice, but she is EXTREMELY ""loopy.""  She forgets things all the time and even changed her teaching topic mid-sentence into something totally unrelated! It's pretty scary. It can be very frustrating. If you have other options for piano, I would strongly consider them.",0
Best professor I had ever had. would take him again. Explain class well and always give personal experience in the field he worked. I learn a lot from him. good professor. I personally recommend it to you!!!,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!! Such a mean professor i have ever had. Her tests are VERY HARD. She gives you questions from all-over places. Also, she grades your papers based on your grammar, apa style, word count, etc. She thinks it is a composition class. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING HER CLASS UNLESS IF ENGLISH COMP IS YOUR FAVORITE!",0
Dr. Montes-Jordan was the most difficult professor to understand. He has a very thick Latin accent of some kind. There is a ton of material covered and you have to know it well to ace a test. Thankfully theres EC for tests. His lectures are long and painful. Perhaps he's a great teacher for aspiring med students but not for A.A degree students.,0
"She missed a field trip and made the students do it again to make up the work. She talked about herself a lot, too. Generally speaking, I found that the best way to learn the subject was to ignore her. The class itself was easy (especially since she has 60-79% as a C, with A and B being normal), but not because of her teaching by any means.",0
"Amy was GREAT! There was a lot of writing to do in this class, so be ready for it. The teacher really cares and wants you to do well. Just keep up and turn in your work and you will do fine.",1
"Not present during any of the lectures, very hands off, didn't really provide any support. When I was struggling, I was told to try and rely on outside sources aside from lectures and the book. Single assignments would end up taking 4-5 hours because none of it was thoroughly explained in the lectures. Midterm and Final had questions not covered.",0
"Prof. Maojoudi was a good teacher, he taught at a fast pace that was hard to learn, but he made sure we understood by asking us if we had questions . The examples he used were great and is related to real life. His quizzes were ok, but his exams were hard. There is a 2 page essay and homework that you would have to do every week. Great experience.",1
"I took his online course. He never gave me my essay grades back, and every time I emailed him, he NEVER emailed me back. I got one email from him the entire class. H wasn't helpful at all, you pretty much had to be on his level to understand everything 10/10 would not recommend this teacher.",0
Very cool teacher! Tests aren't too hard and she's very helpful. Her notes are all over the place though and it's hard to focus.,1
"This man loves science too much for his own good. He will spend an entire class period going over something that he loves but will not be tested on, yet will only briefly mention something that makes up 25% of the test. Be prepared to study every small bit of the chapter as he grills you on the smallest details of the readings and lectures.",0
He would have us read every chapter from his book and had quizzes each week which was over the book but you had no clue what the questions were going to be. His questions were hard to understand bc you wouldn't know what he would want out of it (like statements). More you spend the better your grade! He is a hard grader. STAY AWAY.,0
Rest 430 is basically one 10-12 page paper. Dr. Johnson is very helpful and made this course easy and good to take. We only met 5 times over the whole  semester and its easy to make a good grade in there.,1
"Worst class I ever took in college. PLEASE FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE. This class is a waste of time and money. She has no reviews, the practice quizzes have nothing to do with the real quizzes, and she deducts points off your labs for no reason.",0
"Great professor that offers clear guidance, good feedback, and more concerned with the content of a paper or essay.  Would not hesitate to take another class with this professor!",1
"Do not come into this class thinking you will be debating ideas. YOU WILL NOT! You are not allowed to express your personal thoughts or beliefs in this Ethics class, Confusing!",0
"Loved this class! I originally didn't want to take critical thinking, but he made the class very enjoyable! Overall, very easy class. There are only two exams and weekly assignments, and he gives out extra credit.",1
Professor Bratcher is probably one of my favorite professors I've taken at HCC. He is so understanding and really listens to his students and takes what they say into consideration. Im excited to take another one of his classes and I would so recommend anyone I know to take his class.,1
"This Professor wants to prove he is smarter than everyone else. He tries to make questions tricky, add questions on material you haven't studied yet, and when you ask for help his reply is always ""read your syllabus"". Just so he can say he did not lie to you, to purposely make you fail!!!",0
Is a decent lecturer but falls short. She is often forgetful of meetings with students and student's names. She is a very tough grader without providing specific or helpful feedback. Often gives group marks which are not a proper reflection of individual students. Allows personal affairs to interfere with projects (trouble in family? bad mark).,0
"Brilliant and smart man! He gives alot of reading but what do you expect for a lit class. MUST READ because participation is ALOT in class. If you participate, you will do great but it is really awkward when no one reads, he gets really mad when no one participates. Expects you to know your stuff so DO NOT try to b.s. your way through the class!!!",1
"Might be the worst teacher I have ever had.  This is by far the most difficult class I've ever taken and it is only because of the professor.  Looking back at the semester, a fish could teach better than she could.  She assigns ungodly amounts of homework and does little to help us understand the material.  Outside help is the only way to  do well.",0
"this professor is easy going. lecture is from textbook. homework mostly are easy, a few hard. exams are from the easy problems of homework. some exams problems are direct ""repeat"" of homework. ",1
Great professor. Really cares about the material and is passionate. He makes it interesting to learn about (as much as he can). Tests can be difficult if you dont study and take notes. Assignments are once a week and fairly straightforward and not very difficult. Overall good class and excellent professor.,1
"So unclear, like Jesus. How are you a math teacher?",0
Dr. McLaughlin is a nice guy but the critical thinking class is useless in my opinion. He assigns 8 homework assignments that are worth next to nothing point wise. He expects you to participate in class daily & deducts points if you dont. The midterm was decent but the final was ridiculously stupid and worth 35 points of your grade. Never had a C!,1
"shes amazing! i have taken spch 2 other times b4 her class and failed but not with her. shes just an awesome teacher. she kept me intrigued all semester. her speeches are easy, there's 4 of them. she understands mistakes occur so that makes it less stressful when giving speeches. totally recommend her!!",1
Absolutely do NOT recommend!!! I took AP Calculus in high school and passed the class but after taking his class I failed the final and now have to retake the course. His tests and quizzes were unreasonably difficult and I basically had to reteach myself calculus. He just rants about Newton and physics without actually teaching anything. Stay Away!,0
Will Valley believes in pedagogical learning through experience and discussion. The LFS core courses are designed to shape students into interdisciplinary learners that do more than simply regurgitate information -- but rather to learn to prepare for uncertainty in the field. Lots of guest lectures. Group grading sucks but amazing prof.,1
"She is such a sweet lady and a great professor. She goes out of her way to help you if you ask for it and genuinely cares. There is a lot of reading required for the class but you'll spend the majority of the class discussing it. There are reading quizzes, a midterm, final and a few papers but if you do the reading you'll be fine.",1
Randy is a great guy and wants to further our futures art. Super cool and nice guy! Wants you to succeed and helps you with your project ideas if need be.,1
Professor Fan is an amazing professor! She repeats herself a lot but it's to make sure that you understand what she's teaching and it's LIKELY that the things she repeats are going to be on the exams. HW is easy. She offers study guides so do them! Offers 4% of extra credit. Not a tough grader when it comes to the case study.,1
"Lecture class. I couldn't bare it and by the time the semester was over, I was ready to pull my hair out. One of those classes where you either have to study hours upon hours or walk into class not studying at all in order to ace the tests. Extra credit paper bumped me up an entire letter grade. Sweet guy as a whole, just an extremely boring class.",0
"Very Unorganized. Contradicts himself and the textbook. I would only recommend taking him if you also have to take Pathopysiology. You will be better prepared for that class. Otherwise, avoid him at all costs. DStudents are required to learn much more than other sections. Take Mr. Bill.",0
Professor Love makes you work for your grade but it very helpful and supportive. This class is not supposed to be easy but its okay because you are learning useful info for the future.,1
Very rude and slow,0
This class was not a easy one. There were a lot of assignments that were not explained well on the syllabus. He also changes assignments  with little direction or notice. You will do well to get to know him to understand his expectations. Also he will work with you if you ask.,1
If you don't understand math Professor Trower is your man. He can bring down math like science. I would highly recommend him to anyone. He understands math like no one I've ever seen. I would give him an A+,1
"He's awesome! Would definitely take again. Super nice, gives clear criteria. Cornell notes are really annoying, but you can use notes on the weekly group quizzes (which are easy too). I learned a lot in this course, even thought I'm not a computer science major or anything. Focus is on Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint.",1
"Professor Kumari's online class is extremely easy. I didn't do any of the 3 discussion boards (4 discussion boards in 1) and I missed 1 of 3 tests (not proctored, aced 1 and failed the other) and ended the class with a B. Read the material, do all of the homework, practice homework, and quizzes and you are golden :D",1
Not such a great experience. Dont recommend,0
"Not a good prof.  Materials she teaches in class have nothing to do with Management Info Systems.  You will learn nothing in her class.  She will give you directions on how she wants assignments done, then she will still punish you anyway regardless.  Very unnecessarily cruel and evil prof.  Shame.",0
Walker was an excellent professor. I enjoyed every minute of his class and didn't complain about it being at 9:30 in the morning because i was actually looking forward to it.,1
"Professor Con was a very sweet lady but she was very hard to understand and was quite confusing at times, I sat at the front of the class and still had trouble writing down notes, because we would turn them in for a grade. When it cam to SIMNET, did everything she asked of me and at the end of the semester she failed me.  I wouldn't recommend her.",0
"Great time in this intro class. A few people were in the wrong class since CIS111 is actually the beginner class, not 110. Confusing much? We learned a lot and the Excel section is a great introduction to it's many uses. There was extra credit and bonuses for getting all of the assignments done on time. She wasn't easy by any means, you earn it. ",1
"She's funny, witty & caring like a mom, but is a hard grader. I think she's allergic to grades 85 and up. Class is not boring but limited to Canadian culture. Knows the course she's teaching but more on the Canadian field. She's not racist but sometimes her emotions are biased to side more with the white (caucasian) students. Loves group work.",1
Great course. Viewed policy and social issues from intersectional perspective. Worked in groups online and my group was proud of the work. Taking the course changed my view on some social policies.,1
"If you stay on top of things, it's an easy A. A few tests and a group project at the end. She gives clear instructions and is ready to help along the way with any questions or issues you may have.",1
"I hated this class so much, I withdrew. I have never withdrawn from a class before. He did the same thing every class- talked in his boring, single paced voice from start to finish. I took notes all class, every class. I would read the chapters and go over by notes and still fail. He was a tough grader & very specific about ONE PAGE papers.",0
Don't take this professor. TERRIBLE. If you're not strong in math you will fail. Expects you to know how to do everything and moves way too fast when doing example problems. If you have a question on how to do something she will tell you that you should already know it from previous classes or to read the text book or watch the videos (unhelpful),0
"He's sorta funny sometimes, the quizzes are alright. But dang does he suck as a teacher. You learn crap most of the time and he's super unclear about what he wants during the speeches. If you miss the smallest thing he'll drop you like 2 letter grades NO MATTER how good your speech was.",0
"it seems like you have aton of assignments, but dont worry, you can revise all of them as many times as you want before the final portfolio. if you placed directly into this course you will do great. if you did good in high school writing, you will do just fine in here. do your work and you will do fine!",1
"There are no real math classes at NAU unless you take Falk. He is the only reason I'm still at this school. I don't understand the other reviews, I mean would you rather him assign the toddler exercises that appear in most books?",1
"This guy teaches for himself and not students. The class is devoted to his repetitive life stories. My class literally had to teach themselves. Leave during class he takes points off tests! How? He just decides to make questions on YOUR test worth less!!  O yeah, and he doesn't round up grades--I got a 79%. very unorganized for an accountant.",0
Maybe he is a better teacher in person but I have learned very little from this online course. Some problems are explained through videos but many of the videos are extremely confusing and unhelpful. Plus $80 for mandatory WebAssign membership even though the point of City College is to be free/cheap and accessible to all. Worst online course imo,0
"I have learned so much from this professor! She does an amazing job at making sure we all understand the chapters. Plus, she has experience so her occasional stories are always interesting. She also goes over the midterm and final study guides with us to help us study. She is very sweet and I enjoyed the class very much. ",1
He was a great professor. Easy class although you do have to write a few papers and you can't skimp on work.,1
"Professor Whitney is a very good professor and I highly recommend her. Sure, she goes off task a bit but in the end if you read and follow your notes you will make a good grade. Other than that she will help you with anything regarding psychology you need even after you're done with her class. One of my favorite teachers I've had at HCC.",1
"Fourth semester is never easy, come ready to learn. Almost ALL questions on the exam correlate directly to lecture. Pay attention to what she emphasizes. Use the textbook if you need more understanding but rewatching the VOPP is everything you need to know. A LOT of extra points for doing articles r/t content we were covering. Good luck!",1
"First and foremost, it takes months to have assignments graded.  You'll think you understand everything in class only to have quite a surprise after tests.  Not always approachable or accessible.  Overall I was disappointed with Shelome.",0
"Don't listen to the person who rated her a 4.0. Thats a good one, lol. If you really want to know how she is, she will grade you on stuff that contradicts what her rubric says.",0
"Stephaine Crockett is awesome! I would recommend her to anyone for the intro class. She is very specific on what she wants for each assignment and will help you with any questions you have (especially apa formatted papers) She is real and honest about the conseling world. Great class, good discussions, fun assignments and never a dull moment!",1
"As I started the class, the syllabus was not clear, you have to call her and talk for at least five minutes every week to talk about how you are doing in the class, but i didn't know that at first. She LOCKED me out of the class until i called her but she wasn't available for like 3 days so i had 3 assignments that were late that i couldn't do.",0
Really great teacher and easy to do well if you follow directions and stay on top of your work.,1
Heyborne is great. Loves the subject he teaches so he teaches it clearly. Always willing to answer questions and help students out. Class requires some work and study but not bad as long as you go to class everyday.,1
"I'd recommend taking Lorie for a science credit. She is very understanding and is very helpful in class and outside of class. If you are ever confused about something just ask! Also, she is pretty good with Zoom.",1
"She is a really nice person if you're nice to her... she loved me but still graded me hard so if you think being friends with her is going to help you you're wrong!!! You just have to actually do the work, kind of a pain sometimes",0
Awesome Teacher!  Very accessible for help outside of class!  Tests cover a lot of material.  Lectures can be a little rushed at times.  But she will always stay after to explain further.  Very good teacher!  Take her class if there's anyway possible.,1
"Leila is probably one of the worst professors I have ever had. I did not learn anything from this course really, I had to go home and teach myself. I will try to stay out of any course she teaches from now on.",0
"DON'T TAKE HIM. Supposed to be an easy A class and he makes it so unnecessarily hard. He rambles on in class about info that isn't even pertinent to the test. Tests are 10 essay questions that are worded in the worst possible way. You HAVE to read the textbook bc you don't learn anything from him, and even then good luck getting a passing grade.",0
"It's very disappointing that  EWU continues to employ this professor. He is extremely unprofessional, he even takes pictures of all students on his personal phone without asking permission. If at all possible, take statistics from another professor! He sets you up to fail so work hard and you can pass, the math is extremely easy.",0
"He is an awful professor, the whole lecture is just gibberish. He doesn't even know what he's talking about, and won't answer a simple question even if asked multiple times. He gives his students no encouragement to even come back to class. He makes Composition the worst class ever took. I wouldn't advise selecting him as a professor at all.",0
"I love Dr. Anderson. He's such a caring and kind professor. He always calls himself the most ignorant person in the room and he tells us to channel our inner Socrates so that we aren't afraid to ask questions. He understands that what we're learning can be hard and he makes it clear that he's here to help. Latin is a lot of work though, esp. Latin2",1
I loved this class! You will have one powerpoint presentation to present. Study from her lectures and participate in the labs by completing all assignments and you will pass. Dont skip labs! You don't need the book. She is very caring and willing to help you in any way possible. Take her for all science classes if possible!,1
"Not the nicest teacher AT ALL, and her class is not that easy. If you pay attention and re-work your notes, you'll find the tests are just like lecture. Quizzes helped my grade tremendously so pay attention during class because you will have pop-quizzes at the end and those are your only quiz grades. Challenging but do-able.",0
Terrible Professor,0
"She is not a good teacher. She is very knowledgeable about physics, but she is not a good teacher. I have gone to her office hours, and she is a really nice person; however, she is a HORRIBLE teacher.",0
"He's a hard grader,  but really cares about his students and offers extra credit. Great person, just a hard class",1
"Professor Fritch is amazing. Whether you are in the class or online, she has a way of capturing your attention about things you would not ordinarily think about. Her online class is layed out better than most online classes. There is not much homework as long as you stay on top of the assignments. They're simple, just do them and you get an easy A.",1
"Harsh grading and takes a while to grade. Wont know youre in a bad situation until she puts the grade in, and its too late to try and fix it. Wouldnt recommend",0
"Dr. Dubovskiy is a great professor. He's hilarious, thorough, and passionate about math. The real question is whether or not you'll understand any of his jokes through that accent. He doesn't give as much feedback on his grading quizzes as I would like. MA124 is definitely a class you'll have to work in, but he himself is willing to help you.",1
I love this teacher. That bieng said - she is very hard. Her class is not for the weak or those who do not want to do any work. That bieng said...Im praying that i pass her class. If i don't I know that - it will be because I didn't man up and rise to the challenge.,1
It really doesn't get much better than Mark. Knows his stuff; his dialogue is clear; even his choice of words seems chosen to avoid any kind of confusion. The assignments and tests are relevant and you leave each course knowing something useful.,1
Sinha seems fine until you take your first midterm and realize that you know absolutely nothing. She goes through the slides at 60mph and barely gives students a chance to see it. Her clicker questions are challenging and sometimes don't even make sense. I would not recommend.,0
The online class 'Intro to Islamic Civilization' was an absolute mess; quiz questions were from material not yet covered or material that was never covered and the prof tries way too hard to be funny. I really feel that I learned almost nothing from this class and online the prof does not look as hot as some have previously posted,0
One of the worst classes and professors on campus. His teaching is absolutely pathetic. I recommend noone to take him as a professor.,0
Only a few teachers make me really understand Math. And he was one of them! He takes the time to really teach and if we are confused he is patient with us students and explains the material. Average homework; not too much but not easy either. Such a great teacher! Just show up and study your notes for test!,1
This teacher lacks a teaching skills. He's so narrow and thinking that you will answer according to what his instructions without even teaching. Lol! It's funny that I never got criticize by all my previous professors and he's the first one to think that I'm not trying my best. I wish I I found this rating site earlier.,0
Horrible professor. Might as well just be a full online class! i just found the class unorganized  and felt lost throughout the class. thankfully i passed.,0
"He's a pretty bad prof. Doesn't explain anything well, expect to be confused in class and abuse your economics friends for help. Econ is hard to get a good prof for so he may be one of the better ones , as sad as it may seem.",0
"So here is the deal with David. He tells you exactly how to get an A during the first day of class. You show up, take notes on the things he repeats, do your blogs and wikis and understand the books enough to write a little on them. This class could not be easier but he leaves the grade up to you.",1
Overall tough and unfair grader. Would not take again.,0
"This is literally the nicest teacher I've ever had! He helps out students SO MUCH even when they're completely undeserving. I mean he will let you make up the written compositions (which there's only three of, and he grades them so easily). If you want an EASY A take this class!!",1
"I avoid Misurda at every chance I get, you will not find me willingly taking his class. All his lectures are monotoned, without use of examples or direction. Projects are extremely hard, no structure to the course and lack of examples in class. TA's are more helpful at explaining concepts then the teacher. No piazza even tho class is online.",0
Fun personality to be around in class. Very unclear grading criteria and hard to follow in lecture.,0
"The homework software for AME204 is one of the most frustrating things I've ever dealt with. Professor Boloury is also not the best lecturer, as he lulls a lot of people to sleep.",0
"If you are considering taking her class online, dont. Completely unorganized, changes deadlines on assignments and tests all the time. Unclear instructions about everything. She takes a whole month to reply to your email, or doesnt email you back at all. The semester ends this week, and barely any grades are in. Just avoid this class if you can.",0
He was not a part of the class at all. He did not answer questions and did not provide any feedback other than the final grade. He was very inconsistent and showed little concern for the class. He should not be able to teach.,0
"I am going to school to become an actor and this woman is the best instructor I have ever had. She is full of life and passion. She is always there for us, she pushes us, and encourages us to give 100% at all times. Not to mention, she is one of the most inspiring people I've ever met as well. Honestly, one couldn't ask for a better teacher!",1
This professor is doing nonsense thing! She asked me to rewrite my essay twice just because she didn't tell want I need to achieve at once! Now I have less than a week to write a final essay! It is killing me!,0
Save yourself the struggle and take Ryba. She uses his material anyways except Ryba is much clearer and actually knows how to explain the topics well. Take her only if for some reason you have to retake the course and you know half of the material already.,0
"Prof Zaitsev is a great teacher. 4 tests, he drops the lowest. Do not miss his labs. I didnt have time to read the book, just learnt the lectures ( he gives printouts ).Micro is not easy, dont expect him to explain everything. You ll have a lot of memorization to do.  Do your work- you ll get an A. ",1
He is awesome!! I would take him again if I could!! Makes it so much fun yet still teaches! Homework is basically extra credit on test and extra credit you can earn up to 15 points and its just going to theater shows or chior concerts. Hes so awesome anyone is lucky to take him hes so cool and a great teacher overall. He cares alot,1
"I have had Dr. Brown for TEC 110, TEC 211, TEC 217, and TEC 317. He is by far my favorite teacher. He is very easy to understand, funny, and knows how to get you prepared for the real world.",1
"There are four tests, of which he will drop one. The class of 70 students averaged 61% on the final three tests. The professor is loud, and sometimes inappropriate. While it is apparent he knows the material well, he does a poor job conveying that knowledge to his students. An obstacle to overcome, not an introduction to the subject. Avoid!",0
"Lovely person, okay teacher. She assigns a LOT of homework usually short papers and exercises and you're expected to pair up and speak French with someone every class. Nonetheless, she's fair if you put in the work, you get a good grade, and if you slack off, she notices.",1
"Have to start this review by saying that this prof. is SO passive aggressive. Will make class optional, but guilt you into being there if you so choose to skip. Not to mention, the material is difficult to begin with. I, personally, found this professor sometimes snarky and difficult to converse with. He is quick to shut people down.",0
"Professor White responds to my emails with questions with ""no problem."" and my inquiries as to why I got a grade and how I can do better with, ""keep doing the work and maybe that will help."" Don't expect her to communicate with you, she also sends these replies 5 days to a week later. Exams require lockdown browser. Some coursework on quizlet.",0
"I had to drop this class. I don't know Spanish, so it was even harder. The tests were impossible (completely in Spanish, even the instructions). Even people who do know Spanish failed his tests. He doesn't give any extra credit, even if you beg. *DO NOT TAKE*",0
"I hope that someone reports this guy, he shouldn't be aloud to teach with the way he talk to his students.",0
"Mrs. Lusk-Stern honestly made Psychology not all that exciting to me. It wasn't that she was a bad teacher and she is very nice and understanding, but her lectures feel useless and like they go on forever. Most of the lectures she gave only barely touched on the actual test, however she gives you very useful reviews so definitely USE them.",0
Can't quite put it into words. Professor Danae Martinez is wildly unselfish.,1
"Always asks for questions and offers help. Very patient! He is younger, so that may be why is more encouraging and excited about math. Very good! Only downfall to this class is that he only grades tests (5 incl final) and assigns homework but it's optional and don't get credit for doing it. Gave reviews  b4 tests but definitely need to study!",1
"A Wonderful teacher! I could not have asked for a more patient and enthusiastic professor. I recommend that anyone interested in a foreign language, take her course!",1
"so far, not impressed",0
"Really easy to talk to, and super nice guy. And, he's had a solid background teaching mathematics in China(?) and also some part in Europe(?) Also very passionate about his field as demonstrated in the interesting, and funny stories he ties into the lectures related to math.",1
"He gives NO feedback on projects or assignments.  Online tests do not show answers so you don't know which questions you missed and which you got right.  His grading scale is 95% and higher A, 85-94% B, etc.  He just won post-secondary business teacher of the year, so he is full of himself.  You don't learn in this class because he doesn't teach.",0
"Professor K gives great lectures that involve real life situations. Gives study guides for exams, so do them and you'll pass just fine. Attendance is mandatory. No paper just a few hw assignments and two midterms and final. Would take another class for sure.",1
"Not my cup of tea. Assigned a ton of reading, expected really high level in class essays. I say stay away from her.",0
"She's not a bad teacher exactly, but she isn't clear on what she wants. She does cancel class sometimes and isn't specific about what answers she wants on exams. I think I'm doing well in the class, but she's very hot and cold depending on the day. There are only a few writing assignments, but the exams are difficult. Participate and it's fine!",0
"Honestly the best math teacher I have ever had. For Statistics she either handed out note outlines or we printed them out. They helped a ton. However, she can be a tough grader and will take off for small details.",1
"Sometimes unclear, but boring class.",0
"I took him for CEE 202 and it was awful. He isn't very helpful, and doesn't post his notes online. The online website we used (WileyPlus) was a hot mess. His tests were also really hard if you've never taken a probability course before. Overall, a very bad experience.",0
Took Gene for a 3 hour course and it was hard to stay awake. His tests are straight from the lectures but very difficult. Hardest criminal justice teacher i've taken at UCF and i just completed my minor.,0
She is very energetic so you won't get bored in class. She genuinely loves the material and cares about her students. She was very helpful when we didn't understand things and even bring in extra material to help us understand things better. The class was tough but if you need to take it take it with her!,1
"Erin is a good professor who wants her students to do well. Plus her tests are all multiple choice. You'll still have to study, but it's easier than any written tests I've had. My only complaints are that there is a LOT of info to go through in Micro (not her fault) and the class moves fast, and she has a valley girl voice (you get used to it).",1
"Very energetic, knows her stuff, extremely helpful, and nice.",1
I really enjoyed her class. She is very nice and understanding. Take notes during lecture but she explains everything well and answer any questions you have with no hesitation. Had about 2 papers and presentations. Quick readings every week with 5 question quizzes (hold on to them) A lot of fun in class discussions. Would definitely take her again,1
Easy class..show up to class take the quiz and write your papers. Easy A,1
worse class I've ever taken. Lab reports take forever to be graded and she take points off for every little thing wrong. get out of this class if you can ,0
"He clearly knows what he's talking about, but I wouldn't suggest ever taking his class. I've never had anyone rip apart my writing like this guy. Got mostly Cs on essays even with office hour help. Not to sound conceited, but every prof I've ever had has praised my writing and he hated everything I did. Unless you have no other choice, AVOID.",0
"Not only was he hard to understand and the homework/Accounting CD thing useless, according to his grading scale I should have gotten and A but he gave me a B. I tried emailing him/calling him MULTIPLE times (I'm a transfer), but he never responded. The material is easy but the professor is useless.",0
"I had Swift for both in person and online courses. He is really great but is better in person. The lecture videos are insightful. He isn't easy and expects a lot. Go to his office hours, he is very helpful and friendly.",1
"LMG is the best. She sends a kind reminder after each class to let you know what went on during class if you missed. Homeworks are easy points. Hardest thing in the class is the test, but study some and you should be alright. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
Worst instructor ever. Assignments submitted thru link-received confirmation-she emailed me one week later stating my work was not submitted. This happened more than once.I turned in final assignment twice in error-and was told I never turned it in. When I resubmitted..both assignments were there. She's impossible! Slow and unorganized.,0
"Solid professor, fair grader, and always willing to go through the complex proofs.",1
"One of the worst at GV. She's very smart and knowledgeable, but she has no clue how to teach. She goes over everything once and expects you to master it. The tests are hard and there is little time to write the paper. She laughed in my face once when I asked a question. She made SPSS more confusing than it actually is. 1/5th of my class dropped out",0
"I dont know about anyone but if you need a sign to take this class this is it. This is a piece of cake class. Honestly easy A. No paper just quizzes, an exam, and discussion board posts every two weeks. However, if you want to learn i wouldnt take this class as i basically learned nothing.",1
"Kendra is a wonderful instructor. She's always positive, gives great feedback, and is more than willing to meet with you outside class for extra guidance. Plus, she's very engaging in class, which is a rare thing to come by. Terrific experience in grad level poetry workshop. Would love to take her every semester.",1
Super clear syllabus! The discussions and term paper really made you think and wanted you to go into details. Midterm and final were open ended questions as well. Completely doable!!! Take him for sure!,1
"Absolutely hated this class.  He is horribly inefficient and unorganized and he babbles to himself in lecture.  He has you complete these little quizzes in lecture to check attendance, but he barely covers half of the stuff on the page.  His antics in lecture aren't funny either; it is just plain annoying.",0
Derek is an extremely personable professor. He also graduated from UE so he consistently maintains a difficulty level on par with other courses. He is also very helpful and will do his best to answer any questions you have.,1
"I wish I knew of this site before taking this teacher.  She is often late for class,  late returning assignments, totally off schedule, lecture has very little to do with English or readings.  Not very personable. Loses your assignments, extremely disorganized. i would not recommend her.",0
"very supportive, clear explanations when requested, probing questions, good organization, pleasure to work with",1
She's late every. single. day. and keeps you late. every. single. day.,0
This professor sucks all he did was use the Cubs his baseball team as an example which some of us dont watch or know any baseball. The redos are stupid instead of your grade going up it goes down like wow whats the point dont take this professor.,0
"She is very stern and means business, but she is willing to help you in anyway possible.  She really wants you to do well and if you put in the effort you will.  I would love to take another class by her again!!!!",1
"She was an okay prof, in terms of teaching I would never take her again. She reads of the powerpoint without properly explaining and a lot of times her review slides DO NOT MATCH HER EXAMS! she teaches something else and gives us review on something else. There are quizzes to boost your mark but doesn't really do anything.",0
"Très long et plate, en plus de ça il n'est pas claire!",0
"His lectures are long, maybe because of his monotone voice? But honestly do the homework, follow along, and he's very helpful during office hours. He also curves grades and gives extra credit for the final.",1
"Papers are required over and over again, until I don't even know what to say anymore. Nor sure what she expects students to write on papers! Tests and quizzes are tricky!",0
"He kept the class very interesting with his personal accounts of trips he has taken, relevant music and cultural discussions, and was very funny and knowledgable all around.  He even brought in Pre-Columbian chocolate for us to try.  Go to class, participate, do your work, and you will probably get an A. He really is a great professor.",1
"Terrible teacher, mean, angry, does not care about his students; I don't know why he ever became a teacher. Have to study a lot and use the textbook.  DONT take him you will regret it",0
"Very willing to help, exceptional ability to explain. Great professor.",1
"Kato sensei is great! I agree with the most recent review. She's cool and caring and she was always available to talk to, ask questions and go over work. The class atmosphere was good, everyone made friends and we learned at a steady pace. Tests were always fair. The beginning can be a bit hard if you have never learned any Hiragana, but it was ok!",1
"Just take his class to listen to his lectures.  The man's voice is like chocolate rubbed in your ear.  Loves having discussions about abstract (and thus, often difficult to follow for some) topics, but in the end you'll certainly broaden your intellectual horizons. Highly recommended.",1
Prof. Talbert is an amazing professor. I loved his class. Lectures are usually are 2 times a week and I always came out feeling like I had learned something new. His lectures feel more like chapters in a story instead of a collection of names and dates like a lot of history lectures,1
"Best ASL teacher at Mesa hands down! Comments about being too tough are totally invalid, It's ASL 4 and everyone taking it SHOULD be expected to actually know ASL. Over all the classes teaches a lot about how to actually use the language instead of using meaningless words. Very helpfull!",1
"Stay away from this ""professor"" if you haven't had any education regarding Computer sci prior to enrolling this course. Secondly, get ready to put in the work, literally, you're going to depend more on the book, and other resources before the prof. To conclude, this instructor is unwilling or unable to adapt to provide proper teaching. Good luck.",0
Dr. Currier was an excellent teacher! I would really recommend her for this class. She wants you to succeed and she makes the class more interesting and manageable.,1
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
"Don't ask questions unless you like looking stupid in public and being mocked.  His examples in class are all explained in the text making attendance pointless, but he grades on it.   The online homework bites, and his hints don't help.",0
"started MAT-106 and was excited  bc of his high rating. However, if you are not great at algebra, he won't slow down for you.  I was completely lost. 1st class  was told I need to get up to speed. 2nd class was told he does not teach algebra in this class and I have to already know it.  I had to drop , I was lost after only 2 classes",0
"He is a very nice man, will help you if you seek it. However, if chemistry is not your strong suit, take a different professor. He does not provide powerpoints, he just does a bunch of problems on the board and messes up a lot and confuses things.",0
"Pretty great professor. Likes his subject and gets excited about different aspects of it. Some of the things he get excited about are pretty nerdy, but that just makes him funnier. He tries to push you to understand certain subject matter that he knows you will need in future classes. Always available in person or via E-mail if you need help.",1
"Gets off topic a lot, but won't test you (usually) on what you don't cover. I've had four classes with him at this point and if you don't mind tangentially relevant storytelling being tied into the lecture and a quirky sense of humor then he's pretty alright. Nice guy, and was willing to grant extensions for papers, he'll help if you need it.",1
"Dr. Blackaby is awesome! He really knows his stuff and presents all of it in a clear way that makes sense. Instead of focusing on all the boring elements that a typical OT class does he really cares that the student is able to look at a passage and comprehend and apply it. Also he is from Canada, plays hockey, and does every outdoors thing ever.",1
He rambles about things in class for 3 hours about things that are not relevant to the course material at all. Tests are entirely based off of memorizing sentences from the textbook. Very poor communication during class and often loses focus which makes him hard to follow.,0
"I have her now and I want out. She's nasty with her students and gives a tremendous amount of ""busy work"".",0
Effectively trys to provide a top tier level of ACC at a local regional level.  He has high expectations for his students.,1
"Dr. Pekarske was an awful teacher.  If you want to get a good grade (I somehow ended up with an A), your papers need to have very little information, a lot of fluff, a lot of questions, and you need to figure out how she likes stuff written.  She canceled class a lot which was nice, but there are definitely much better english 100 teachers at UMBC.",0
puts history into perspective. extremely helpful. just do the assigned papers and you should be fine!,1
"When you take this course, you have to pay an arm and a leg to access a website called Mindtap which is basically the entire class. If you don't do well on those, good luck to you. His lectures are a total waste of time and only go over the very basics of what we're learning, while all the math and in-depth concepts are 100% on you to learn.",0
I love his class but I am very bad with math. I took statistics because I needed the credit for my major and I refuse to take calculus. His lectures are hard to understand if you havent taken anything statistics similar prior to the class. Tests are basically the review so study the review! Homework is very easy EOO. Pay attention and STUDY!!,1
"I don't even know what's going on in the class 95% of the time. He supposedly teaching us data structures but yet he never writes a single line of code in the class. What's going on? He has this code which is all from the textbook, and he ""teaches"" us with that. Assigmts/exams are difficult, and don't get me started on the vids he makes us watch...",0
Most examples are from text. Test questions based on homework and notes. Review midterms before final.,0
Not a very good class!! 2 months teaching and 1 month homing!!,0
"Ruder was an okay teacher. My one complaint is that he graded the 2nd half of our project the day that the 3rd part was due, which was not helpful at all. It's like a teacher handing back your rough draft the day the final one is due, and then complaining later that you didn't make any corrections. He is a good teacher, just needs to grade better.",0
"Pire proff que j'ai eu a l'université!!!! Si tu vas au cour ta un point de participation par cour (10 %) il explique vraiment mal. Melange les conceptsn, ne repond pas bien au question, parle toujours de son facebook pis d'écologie (voiture hybride)... Avec ce prof c'est comme si vous suivez un cour a distance!!!!!",0
"I have never worked this hard for a C in my life I am in the tutoring center often, I do all the homework I actively participate in class. She goes to fast in her lectures, Gets frustrated when you don't get it. Simply tells you she is moving on leaving you confused. She just doesn't care and makes no attempt to hide it.",0
"This course was taught by an awful TA. Unfair grading and little help. If you have the chance, just take Physics at a community college. It's insane that UMB charges students so much money, just to be ""taught"" by graduate students who are grumpy because they miss lunch during 11am lab and do not care about the students.",0
"Professor Dendy was amazing! Truly learned a lot in her class. There is a lot of work to be done in this class, but she tries to help as much as she can. it can become overwhelming but as long as you do the work you'll be fine.",1
"Get as much time necessary with this professor when writing your memos--midterm memorandum included.  She is not sympathetic and she is redundant as much as she is ambiguous.  The class is boring, but follow the text book to a ""T"" and you should be fine.",0
"Worst professor I have ever had. Notes are not easy to follow, her lecture style is terrible, she can't stand when students ask questions about the extremely dense material, all tests are fill in. The text book was easier to follow than her notes, she is terrible at answering emails and grades extremely harshly. Coming from a straight A student.",0
"Great Chem teacher, but cannot help himself from talking about politics, which he knows nothing about.",0
"We seriously made a student group chat to try and figure out her assignments. I don't know of a single one who made perfect scores from her. To clarify, I've seriously won an international Scholastic medal for my writing. And still never succeeded in her class. Her prompts are weird, she never grades, she overloads assignments, she's late to upload",0
She responds fast to emails and provide great feedback about an assignment.. She knows what she's talking about and I took her every semester while taking my BS in criminal justice. Keep up the great work !! ),1
"Hands down, best accounting professor. Her lectures are very self explanatory & if you get lost or don't understand don't be afraid to ask questions she is glad to go over it. Has extra credit opportunities throughout semester. Overall a great professor, has a passion for accounting and if you put in the work and time you will pass the class.",1
Overall he is a easy teacher. I was worried about taking stats but this was an easy A. He gives extra credit for participation. We only took three tests and one final exam. His tests are exactly as the study guide. You don't have to listen to his lectures because he basically goes over the book. He has an accent but you get used to it. Take him!,1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
"The only reason students take Dr. Jones for genetics is because she is the only one who teaches genetics (most of the times). Nobody I have ever met has anything good to say for her at all. Her arrogance is all over her face, the way she talks, and the way she answers your questions. Why do I need to buy Tophat when I just spent $250 buying books?",0
What do you do after a political career? Teach at a college! This class will have you staring at the clock. The minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days. There are opportunities to meet members of the political community and the guest speakers are intriguing. Other than that it's an easy A without much learning. #whygottocollegeagain?,0
"Unorganized- does not follow the syllabus, Tons of HW -so you will never see the day of light. I've taken many online courses and this one was the worst. Does not teach anything. 3 Tests- first one 50 questions; test 2- 75 questions; final 100 Q; weekly discussions and must respond to others; must turn in 10 750 word essays.",0
"I had him for Integrated English and he was okay. He is very nice but very unorganized and will call on you during class to ask you questions. He gives out at least seven different papers per class time which means, A LOT of homework. He will let you turn homework and major assignments in late and will give you take home tests with study guides.",0
"Awesome dude. Definitely have to attend the lectures AND read the online TB if you want an A, but it's not very difficult if you keep up with them. Passionate about his field and is very good at expressing and explaining that passion. Some EC but you can certainly get an A without it.",1
"There was so much busy work for such a stupid class. We had two major assignments for the semester, one she only gave us a week to complete it in. Her instructions were unclear and if you didn't give her exactly what she wanted, she'd give you an awful grade. Also - Don't buy the book. I haven't used it once. Waste of $80. Waste of a class.",0
"Tons of notes..doesn't really relate to the book though, and he uses an online code for homework, which is very difficult to understand. His office hours stink, and he doesnt like staying after class to help..wouldnt take him again thats for sure.",0
"The best teacher/professor I've had to this point, he makes history fun and easy to understand with his absolutely stunning and electrifying lectures! And surely, this professor rating website is a Monumental Moment in Media History? Grading wise, just pay attention and take notes, and you'll be fine. Highly recommend, great experience overall!",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. Joyal.  His lectured kept me very captivated and he was extremely crystal in explaining details and would be very fluent in the topics discussed.Very easy to approach in office hours but best to ask him in lecture if you can visit him in his office.  Very long tests, make sure to listen carefully in lectures and you'll be good",1
"He offers a lot of extra credit, but I did not learn in class. Basically taught myself everything I understood in that class. Final exam replaces the 2 lowest test scores.... even if you did better on your exams compared to your final. really dumb idea but i wouldn't take him again",0
"She gives 4 photography projects in total. 2 are projects that require you to choose between 2 topics, 1 requires you to go to an photography exhibition and discuss it, and the final project allows you to choose the topic. She's also lenient in terms of what she allows for the projects and is very kind. Best of all, she appreciates all work.",1
Very nice teacher. She does power points along with worksheets and outlines. She goes out of her way to make sure you understand. I highly recommend her.,1
"Cathy is great. Her lectures and powerpoints aren't the best, but she gets you the information you need in order to pass. Her character shines bright, and she truly wants each student to succeed. She can be a space-cadet sometimes and needs to be reminded of things. But overall a good professor.",1
"Overall, Prof. Ehinger is a great prof. I took her at FSU and the exams are fairly straight forward. If you fully understand all the HW and quizzes then you should do fine on the exams. Don't be afraid to reach out to her as she is always looking to help her students.",1
"The only way to not pass this class is if you don't do the work. The lectures are laid out and she goes through them thoroughly with opportunity for questions. She responds promptly to emails and gives feedback. There are group projects involved, but again just do the work. She is very helpful.",1
"Dr. Bouzouita is extremely good at what she does. Please don't listen to what these other comments say. She has study guides which replicates many of the problems she has on the exams. If you study, you will be fine. Finance isn't the easiest class in the world, but Dr. B does a fine job teaching the course.",1
"Taught myself the whole course, so thank goodness the online textbook worked. Teachers expect their students to be ready, but this teacher was late to class and gave poor (sometimes incorrect) feedback.",0
"took this course for a history major and dropped it for all the homework you have to do. a paper is due everyday, two research papers(5-8pgs), and one 12-15pg paper as well as a mid term and a final.  i droppped because i couldn't do this class and keep up with the others.  ridiculous work load.",0
"I had to take two classes with this teacher. The first semester all he gave us were two reading assignments with papers, providing little to help your grade if done poorly on them. Also his comments on papers are confusing and not helpful. With this teacher, be prepared to use sources such as smartthinking to help you and to work hard without help.",0
Such a sweet teacher. Just do your assignments and pass. Not much else to do.,1
"She was a great professor and clear in her instruction! Even with the online format, she managed to utilize Canvas well when it was really new and integrate a well-fit learning experience! Sometimes reading and note-taking was heavy but nothing that was out of the ordinary. Would definitely have her as a professor again!",1
Shes only given out one A in her entire career of teaching is her story on syllabus day. I don't know why I stayed enrolled but wish I wouldn't of. The classes are boring and a lot of reading. She has no enthusiasm as a teacher and drills you with homework and papers.,0
"He assigns 5 papers, each about 3-5 pages, a final project (5 pages max), and 4 exams. The papers were alright and I'm sure he didn't even read them, just automatic 100, so I don't know why he makes us do the work. The exams are multiple choice but you have to read the book, even if you do they're really specific and only gave us 1:20 for 50 questi",0
I would highly recommend for anyone to take his class. He is very clear on what he wants to see on essays and he is easy to talk to. This class is very easy because he makes it easy. He is very strict in attendance and being on time.,1
"I don't understand how he grades the tests, but it is so confusing every time I received my grade. Never told you the formate of term tests and exams. Although marks assigned on each question (multiple choice) are equally weighted, the level of difficulty has not matched the marks.",0
"Luallen is a superstar. You will learn *everything* there is to know in EC11 if you take his class. You'll only get a B+ because his tests are so hard, but if you care about learning the material then you need to take his class. He's also just an awesome guy, and he's great at helping you out if you get stuck - he really cares about his students.",1
"difficult for a first year fall semester course, but she's a great prof",1
Ms. Con is a great teacher and she is extremely easy! You only have to go to class for like 2 weeks and then after that she'll tell you that you don't have to come anymore. TAKE HER!!!!,1
She is a good at accounting but not necessarily teaching but she can be rude sometimes especially if you're late or aren't showing up. I would not take again.,1
"Le pire prof que jai jamais u. Des examens qui ont aucun rapport, difficile pour rien !! Un examen cest faire pour tester la compréhension las pour faire couler le cours aux étudients. Plus jamais ce prof.",0
"Dont come to class with high hopes like I did. EXTREMELY unorganized. Uses Kirsten/Jarvis material & jumbles up the day before test as a last minute revision. Constantly says the wrong thing and when you call her out because it effected your grade she said Ohp, sorry. Promised to help with final grade. She lied and actually made grade worse!",0
He likes to make lots of jokes and make fun of his students which is cool because we take him as a joke as well. His class is stupid easy. If you do the bare minimum you'll pass with 100% He canceled class often and would end class after 30 minutes. Little to no hw throughout the semester. You can tell he's not passionate about teaching anymore.,0
Caring. Helpful. Friendly. Easy grader. Gives multiple practice sets that pretty much is the actual exam. Holds extra review sessions on Sundays before Monday exams.,1
"One very sweet woman. I felt guilty on the days I would miss class, when I was there she would always end the class with ""Thank you for being here"" D': . By the end of the semester there was a handful of people that would attend. -.- Her lectures are more like stories and she really does make you feel as if you are there. An easy class (:",1
DOES NOT TEACH. All he does is hand out notes and worksheets. The w/s are fill in missing code but he has it completed displayed on the projector. the w/s are only worth 30pts. tests are hard and home work is moderately difficult. YOU MUST TEACH YOUR SELF. ONE OF THE WORST TEACHERS I HAVE EVER HAD! The book is bad too. Good Luck u need it! >:(,0
"too much assignments and too much quiz, she gave a unclear grading criteria to judge your paper, I promise, she is the worst English professor.",0
I took this class online for public speaking. I hate making speeches but was able to make it through with it for this class. The amount of work given was normal. She also gives opportunities for extra credit. They are a bit time consuming but worth it! I never had a problem with receiving a response when needed.,1
"I am still in this class right now. He is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. I was really sick and e-mailed him, he never responded back to me. Now I am behind by like 3 assignment and I missed one day. He is horrible at communication. He doesn't seem to care about the students even though he says he does. I would give him 05 if I could.D:",0
"I blame Margo, but I also blame the class. The theories she teaches are dated. If she's to teach them, it should be with a critical eye... she just explains them with these lengthy lists of examples. And, yes, her voice is really annoying.",0
Knows his stuff but does not do a very good job teaching it. He is willing to repeatedly go over same things until most students understand. Tough papers and exams. Hard grader.,0
Very nice,1
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN. materials he teaches doesn't make sense.,0
gives us extra credit with helps alot.,1
"She's very nice, and the homework is incredibly easy. But she's incredibly unclear about what she wantsexpects, which can lead to missing a deadline because she wasn't clear about the deadline, and she refuses to take late work (except of course when she doesn't). Nice, but not a college-level teacher. Lots of youtube music videos and an easy book",0
"Definitely a fantastic professor. only set back is that he is extremely politically biased, which can make class uncomfortable for those with different views than his. Other than that, he's a total grammar nut and will drill you with grammar and style rules during free time in class. Took him for 2 classes.",1
Great instructor,1
He is a good teacher his lectures are easy to follow and for the test as long as you do your hw and study you will do well in the class.,1
"Lim gives up to 10+ hrs/week of homework. Very hard grader and does not give partial credit. Tests are full of trick qustions. She is extremely uninspiring, and if you ask for help, she is very condescending. Also, dont buy the books for this class. The solidworks book is used for 3 weeks and can be borrowed at the library. The C++ book is unused.",0
She's very sweet and very animated. Don't take her class though if you have an attitude against strong accents because she's too nice and doesn't need bad vibes in her class. I took the once a week class and it can get a little boring but she's great.,1
This was the most difficult introductory class I've ever taken. I was lucky to pass. She cares a lot about her students but doesn't really know how to explain things or teach complex topics to people who are new to Chemistry.,1
"Dr. Bartl is hard, but you learn so much from even taking just one of his classes.",1
"Took a subject I was expecting to hate and made it quite interesting. He's a huge dork, but I loved his teaching style. He does go off on tangents, as someone said, but they usually relate to the topic in some way that shows its practical use.",1
He is probably the easiest IS 310 professor at this school. He gives you exam questions during his review sessions so you must go. Plus he gives you a cheat sheet. Make sure you study/look up his review questions. They'll help you on the exam!!! THIS IS A MUST!!! I can't stress this enough. Plus he accepts late homework.,1
By far without a doubt the worse professor I've ever had. She changes her grading rubric weekly. I am convinced she comes up with her own rules of the English language and grades your papers based on that. Avoid her at all costs.,0
"By far the worst professor that I have ever had. She never responds to emails, but those rare times that she does, she wont even answer your questions. Shes never taught .. just gives the work. She makes it hard to learn, and wont help even if you're begging for help. You're really on your own. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. YOU'LL BE SET UP FOR FAILURE!",0
"Thorough and passionate with a clear presentation that includes super helpful demonstrations with manipulatives to enhance understanding.   Hes a demanding professor and tough grader but if you came to learn, learn you will and then some.",1
I took her class online and she would not help. I advise you to NOT take this class online unless you really know accounting.,0
"Mr. Velasco is a really nice teacher. Participation counts in his class, but it just feels like everyone is discussing ideas nothing drastic. He is really understanding and just use the study guides to prepare for the tests.",1
Didn't use the textbook for the class but the way she explains stuff without really explaining stuff makes a textbook necessary. The homework is impossible because she doesn't teach half the stuff we need to do it and when I asked her when are we going over this or that concept in class that we need on hw she says we have to learn it on our own.,0
I was in the recent summer 105 course as well....and I have to say that I learned a lot.  I could tell by some of the other peoples comments during class breaks that they really didn't want to be there and they thought this was going to be a easy community college A. I have had lots of wonderful professors at NCC including this one. I will miss NCC,1
He is one of the best prof i have ever seen . He always make the content easy for students to understand and if you pay attention to the class 90 percent work is done there. He gives lots of example and makes sure his students have the clear idea of what he tries convey through the lecture . Responds to the email very quickly . Very helpful.,1
"Very smart man, definitely has considerable knowledge in terms of sound reinforcement. However, his tests are unnecessarily difficult  and most of the questions on the test don't pertain the textbook, lectures, or study guides he hands out. I would not recommenced taking this class if you have no experience working with sounds systems.",0
She is really disorganized so the syllabus is mostly useless. No one ever knows what the assignments are or their requirements or when they're due. A lot of class time is wasted and she doesn't usually seem prepared or to know what's going on. She also never answers email. However some of the activities are fun and she is a pretty fair grader.,0
"This was my first time taking accounting and he made it so easy to understand. I would definitely take him again! Class is not mandatory, but his lectures are easy to follow and making learning accounting very straight forward. He is an amazing professor!",1
... ... Boring ... ... A+ ... ... That is it ... ...,0
"Best Professor I've had at UMUC. Real world teaching, he tells it like it is.",1
"Dennis is a respected artist, but should not be teaching. He shows up 15 minutes late everyday and sometimes takes attendance sometimes doesn't. He gives everyone a B as long as you show up and try. He tells you to watch videos on the internet if you want clarification on anything. He plays on his IPad all class long. No demonstrations ever.",0
By far best professor I have ever had. She holds you accountable and will make you work for it however in reality just pushes you to be a better student. LOVE HER,1
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. All her exam questions are trick questions; since her grammar is poor to begin with, this makes getting an A very hard. Put of a class of 60+, we averaged one or two A's per exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",0
"Many people ended up dropping from this class for a number of reasons. Some of those reasons being very unclear grading criteria, as well as having an unreasonable way of grading many assignments, and just being very unpersonable and hard to approach.",0
"Do not take this class if not necessary. I got the lowest grade so far from it. It is an interesting class, but exams and the research project are super hard. I learned a lot about psychology, and also learned that I am not that kind of superman who can handle all kind of classes.",1
I hated this class. Dr. Chisholm took 6 weeks to grade a 1 page double spaced assignment worth 300 hundred points and the same amount of time for a 2 page single spaced assignment worth 500 points. Has unrealistic expectations for the Doc. analysis. He wastes time in class with useless information. Wouldnt recommend,0
This professor is spastic and overworked. She does not reply to e mails and has no office hours. Her lectures offer no help on how to teach science and she is often side tracked with off topic stories. She grades hard on senseless things like reflections. Her assignments are not clearly defined. The class was not relevant. I was disappointed.,0
"He was my advisor and happy to say that he's also someone I email every so often to say ""hi."" His classes were very hands-on, engaging discussion, and use of multimedia. Always willing to help, always available and is an asset to RSC!",1
"I wouldn't recommend taking his class during the summer. Really fast paced. Tests were every week. Note cards allowed. However, no extra credit and no lowest test grade drop. Clear grading criteria and does get back to you as soon as he can. Tests are worth 70% of your grade.",0
"Shamane is a great professor. My class only used the textbook twice, but it's not required. Some writing activities from the books are used for some assignments. She is a little intimidating at first but is a good instructor that will push you to become a better writer.",1
"Definitely made the class interesting. Incorporates a good blend of modern and historical philosophy. The only thing that's a bit concerning is that he was really slow at grading sometimes. He hasn't graded anything from November (about a month ago), but I'm hoping he'll get it taken care of before the end of the semester in a few weeks.",1
He manly focused on showing documentaries that relate to the readings during class. He didn't lecture very much since the videos took the entire class period. There were a few writing assignments that were pretty easy to do and all the tests and quizzes were given through canvas. I didn't really read the books for the later half of the semester :/,1
"Great guy. We got along really well. He was very straightforward, except about the book. DONT BUY THE BOOK. Only buy the sim net thing. You can skip class, and just show up for the tests. Slack, laid back. I wish he would talk with the class a little more. His jokes are cheesy. But you cant help but laugh. I enjoyed his good energy.",1
"He just talks and talks, no textbook needed in this class but you will have no idea what is he talking about. There isn't any references in the book, since oh yeah we don't have a book! If you see him in his office, be prepare that it will take at least half an hour, even if you only have a quick question. He will not stop talking!",0
Best professor ever !! She is a great human being. You will utilize your textbook- so make sure u buy it.,1
"Professor Lulejian interacts with the class and is very helpful. There were a couple of things I didn't like about the class: First, the tests seemed like they are setup to confuse you. Second, you aren't able to see what you got wrong on the tests, so you can't fix your errors for the exams. Other than that, it was a good class.",1
"If you can understand what he is saying, you'll wish you didn't.",0
I was worried that this class will be strict with style and content like the CSE classes but this wasn't too bad. Mike does a good job at lecturing but I felt rushed with some of the topics (probably because the snow canceled a couple of classes). I didn't like the group project though because my group didn't do work but overall the class is good,1
"Great guy, just not a good teacher. Lectures were almost impossible to follow. He did more examples as the semester went on but still not enough. Exams are pretty difficult (averages were around 50%) but he curves strongly so that the average is around a B-. He does want you to do well. Just can't explain material well enough. Self taught myself.",0
Don't take this class unless you like learning while competing in Marvel Themed Chemistry Cosplay. He encourages students to dress up and connect chemistry to comic book heroes. He gives extra credit for non-store bought costumes when you wear them to class.,0
Prof LaTurner has many great stories and a clear understanding of his subject. I loved coming to his class because his lectures were so interesting. Lots of online quizzes (mostly found on quizlet). In class lectures are far better than online. Online class youll basically learn the same things without the inspirational lectures.,1
"You will learn in this class, not just regurgitate historical facts from a textbook. But, this means it requires hard work. Hale has students read primary sources, examine artwork, listen to music, and discuss the time period being taught. His essay exams require you to think critically about historical events, forming and supporting an argument.",1
"I just took this class for fall 2020 semester. It was really easy. Lots of reading along with easy assignments. He also provides the reading so you dont have to worry about purchasing a book. He gives many opportunities for students who may fall behind, as well as giving extra credit. Definitely easy class. Do the work and youll pass with an A.",1
MS. GARCIA WAS A EXCELLENT TEACHER AND HAD A GREAT CONNECTION WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF HER STUDENTS. SHE WAS VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE WHEN IT CAME TO GRADING PAPERS. I WOULD RECCOMMEND ANYBODY TAKING A CLASS SHE IS TEACHING.,1
"Definitely, do the packets he hands out even though they are ""optional"". Most of the questions are on the tests. Also, no word banks so learn your definitions. STUDY FOR TESTS.",1
"Professor Swift assigns a LOT of homework, but only collects a portion of it using Gradescope. I did terrible on the first exam because I only did what was collected. I started work all the the problems in his ""Recommended Homework"". Almost all Exam 2 and Final came from these problems. He is very fair if you have done the work.",1
"Love this professor! Dr Ferreira is smart, funny and gives great feedback. She wants students to succeed, and explains all literature and assignments in great detail to make sure it's understandable.",1
"Way too demanding for a 100 GE Course. Professor Van Sky gives you about 5-6 lecture videos to watch a week, a discussion board to post, current events/news, and a quiz. She also assigns coursework during exam week as well.",0
Do not hesitate. Take Dr. Hunt! Easily bets professor I have had!,1
"Although I took this class during the summer for three hours at night three days a week, she made it super fun and easy. She's based off of group work and interaction so be prepared to speak your mind in that class. She's very approachable and passionate about her career. And I can't forget the awesome snackfeasts we would have every class. ",1
-No cellphones allowed -Participation matters in class -1 final exam is online -No Textbook -Takes role/attendence,1
Come to class and pay attention and you'll pass. It's just that simple. The homework was never overly difficult since he does a lot of work in class with you. He's pretty funny and very helpful.,1
"WORST CLASS EVER TAKEN! This teacher gives NO feedback and does NOT respond to emails; he says to allow up to 5 DAYS to respond to an email?! He should not be allowed to get away with that for an online class. Very hard to communicate with. His assignments are confusing and not clear. I would never take him again, waste of money and time.",0
I recently failed Intermediate Algebra in the fall but and had to retake it in the spring. Mr. Duham is amazing! His teaching is great and makes it easy to learn and understand. His grading is not harsh and he wants his students to succeed. I would recommend him to anyone who struggles with math. He is funny and cares about what he does.,1
"Copies incorrectly prepared notes incorrectly onto the whiteboard. If you're in his class, your best bet is to sit in both his lectures and another professor.",0
She's inexperienced and it shows. She doesn't know how to give a good writing assignment or run a class. Her grading process is absolutely nuts!!,0
"Dean was OK. Going to lecture is important, often boring but just go. No cum. final which is clutch. Boring and not super useful, but we made it folks.",0
"This is one of the easiest and funniest classes I have taken at college.  He is pretty lenient. Show up for class and participate and  you are guaranteed an A.  I highly recommend this class not only because its fun, but you really do learn a variety of self defense like getting out of grabs and other cool stuff. ",1
"Yea, what the guy below said. Stay away from professor nemat. he's ignorant, and he doesn't care about students learning. Everybody literally cheated, and he doesn't even know it. Dumb old dude.",0
"During her lectures, she would speak unclearly and move at her own pace. Yes she waited a few seconds, but always hurries to the next problem. At the end of the day, I would have to go home, view examples from the mylabsplus, and teach myself. She is very cooperative and polite though when you are speaking one on one with her.",0
Gets angry and annoyed when asked questions or advice to understand something which makes me avoid asking questions altogether. Uses different notations in lectures compared to textbooks which is confusing as homework is assigned from the textbook exercises. Overall i would avoid her courses and take up the same course taught by other instructors.,0
"horrible teacher. if she doesn't like you( your grade will suffer. being forced to listen to the non-sense she spits is not worth 3 credits. plus she was the dumbest person in the room but it gets worse,boring classes, biased teacher,unorganized,dont take",0
She never posts her slides online until after the mid term so you need to be in class to take notes. There a periodical assignments she gives you but I haven't gotten any of them back yet I am unsure if I'm doing them right. I've tried emailing her for guidance countless times but she doesn't answer emails. Frustrating prof. Try another for SOC111,0
"She grades more on English than the content of the class. You write a paper including all of the information needed but she doesn't like your delivery you get a D automatically. She doesn't care if you have other classes, she gave 2 papers in a week, one over a move the other over a book. Her discussion board posts requirements are also ridiculous.",0
"You need to read a lot by yourself. His grading most on lecture quizzes, but just be careful. And lab quizzes are not hard.",0
"This class is very difficult if you are not used to this particular style of teaching. Very textbook heavy, no power points. Little instruction given on what to expect for the exams,",0
"I liked Rachel a lot. She is very sweet and treats everyone with respect. She allows everyone to share their own opinions on each topic. The class had homework due almost every day, but only 4 quizzes, which were all open notes. Definitely would recommend taking this class with Rachel.",1
Very hard to understand. And moves very fast. She tries to cram a week worth in one class.,0
Awesome teacher! Very respected man in his department and he cares!,1
"She is very knowledgeable and helpful regarding the material.  The problem is she is very inconsistent, and does not follow her syllabus regarding when assignments are due or when to expect an exams. She also loaded on a lot of work that was not in the syllabus near the end of the semester.",0
"If you are a weak math student, do not take this course with Ostry. His lectures are boring and not interactive. He does not provide assignments to keep you on track throughout the semester, and the text is hard to understand without supplemental material. As many people before have said, take it with Amsel.",0
"Doesn't teach. Just regurgitates. She is very unclear at what she wants and makes last minute decisions in terms of exams and content. She leaves the student wondering what to study for, when in reality, the only way to pass is to have the ENTIRE book memorized. When the class average was 60%, she blamed us for not studying enough.",0
"I was very excited to have Rachael as a teacher due to all the good things people say about her. However, she is completely unorganized, expects participation but doesn't give engaging lectures or ask good questions and then blames it on the students. BUT 505 is insanely easy course with her.",0
No exams Weekly 500-word essays 2000-word final paper 20 minute weekly discussion videos Clear expectations,1
She is an OK professor. She is way too uptight about attendance. She does not allow one to leave early without it going on record because she is afraid one of the staff members will ask why the student is not in class. She makes the class seem really fun on the first day but then gets very dull once everyone is settled in. ,1
"Horrible professor, lecture heavy, homework is one attempt, chapter test one attempt, rude, arrogant, never available, 3 tests and no extra credit",0
"She was alright..but did come off to be a lil smart with her attitude..but she dont play about her students failing.,..she makes sure that you know what you are doing..and understand..",1
"He's a young, down to earth dude who understands what it's like to be a student. His teaching style is straight forward. If you do the homework, do the quizzes, and study you should be fine for the test. He makes you work for a good grade though.",1
"Professor Yearwood is a very good person, very funny and caring, he lets you use your notes in the exams, you grade yourself based on the test, you have a lot of practice tests, you can do your work at your own place, ask him whatever you want, he will always help you. Easy A if you show up and do your work. You won't regret taking his class",1
"He is very opinionated, unorganized and annoying at times. But he seems to know his stuff. I took the class in the summer and its very difficult. He skips sections and veers off on other topics that have nothing to do with the course.. If you want to pass you have to read the book; the entire book. Front to back. Cover to cover.",0
I had this professor for Calc. She was a very nice person but has no idea how to teach. Unless you are already very good at calculus and can teach yourself I definitly would not reccomend her.  She also gives alot of homework but never explains it until the day it is due.,0
Lectures are pretty boring. Makes you read 8 historical books and you have to write essays comparing them. Must go to recitation and depending on your TA you can get an easy a. I didnt read any books only used spark notes and got an A-. If your TA sucks quickly change to a better one,1
I took two classes with her before and  I am taking another class with her in fall. She is so nice and relaxed and grades very fair. Some of the reading's are long but she explains and brings in things I am interested in. I like philosophy and her accent.,1
"Everything we learn is unusefull for accounting, he teache things that he like, not what we have to learn",0
AWESOME PROFESSOR!! He is amazing!  He teaches with such clarity and helps you to understand Microbiology without any fears.  He makes sure that you understand the material and makes you appreciate the course without it just being a required course. I wish the rest of his students would give reviews because he is a GEM! I wish hetaught more courses,1
"She's the only teacher for the class at LSC Mont. So if you can go to another campus do so, don't take it from her. Very disorganised and rarely helpful. The final was the most work I'd done in the class and they hardest thing.",0
"I got an A from this class from determination alone. He gives you extra credit on some tests (if you correct them) but other than that, nada. After the second day absent, you lose points. And he has this ridiculous grading system where he replaces the lowest test score (say an 80) with your final (say a 50), regardless of score. Hated it.",0
"almost nothing but powerpoints, very difficult to understand, doesn't explain things well and skips a lot of material, overall too difficult to follow if you want to seriously learn in depth about databases. You are better of learning on your own.",0
"Not only did I think I would dread public speaking but at 7:30 am on Monday which is my one day off?  However, I will say I am so glad I took his class. I rarely looked at the time in his class because he made it interesting to be there. He allows you to pick your speech topics, making the possibilities endless. Mr. Carter really inspired me!",1
"She's really sweet, It's hard to pay attention in class because you have a computer in front of you. But she's really helpful if you have any questions or If you want her to check your projects. It's a plus if you have her once a week, you only have to go every other week!! Deff take her class",1
"One of the easiest classes I have ever taken. If you are a native English speaker without learning disabilities you have no excuse for not getting an A. I took this class along with C++ programming over the summer and spent more time playing video games than studying, it's that easy.",1
"Eric is a nice enough guy but he makes all of the students go up to the white board and do problems. Not only is this juvenile, almost mid school like, he does not give us time to write things down in our notes, because we are ALWAYS up at the board. He also, constantly makes technical errors constantly.",0
"Took CMST&210 online for comm requirement. First half of the quarter  tons of homework, expect an ""assessment"" (about 2 pages) and a chapter review (5 long-answer questions) per week in addition to various other assignments. Second half is partner project and group project. I highly recommend renting the digital text from amazon if you take this.",0
"She is teaching in Rutgers now and although Logic on its own is quite annoying, I still managed to learn quite well. She is a very easy grader and gives opportunities for retakes. Also available outside of class. Her lectures can be a little boring but her class is an easier one if you pay attention.",1
"The course covers a lot a material, so you have to go to class and spend a lot of time reviewing the PowerPoints. The teacher is organized, which helps. Plus, exams are straightforward.",1
"I have loved History my entire life. Taking this class made me doubt that love on multiple occasions. There is way too much reading for a gen ed. I had to spend more time on this class than I did on the rest, lowering my overall grade. He also seems to think we're all below average students. And I'm pretty sure History is more than Social Mobility.",0
"She might know her stuff, but she builds herself up a lot. She has a high, squeaky voice that's too loud and hard to take for an entire class. Professor Brenan is a much better teacher (Bus 107 and 108).",0
"Amazing prof, one of the best I've ever had! Helps in detail if you ask.",1
"I dont remember what section I took with her, but she knows her stuff she is awesome dont listen to these two bad comments she is awesome! You have to read you have to do the work otherwise she will call you out on it, but do the work ask questions in class and pay attention and its worth it i have learned so much in this class",1
"Dr. H is the best professor I've had so far at WKU! Her lectures are clear and contain everything you need to know for her tests, which ARE hard.  She has a great sense of humor and makes lectures interesting, and as long as you go to class [like you're supposed to] and actually enjoy learning with an open mind, the class will be very rewarding.",1
"Dr. Weil is a great professor and assignments are very easy. With the exception of mid term and finals, its only a discussion post each week and module 3 and 6 there is a case study. Great professor and very caring!!! Responds to any questions within 24 hours and very helpful! TAKE HIM!!! EASY A!! ",1
"warning, does a lot of activities in class to get students talking, but it is also completely expected when taking a language course. Be ready to be open and participate !",1
I would take this great professor again.,1
"She is a great professor. Took her for both lab and lecture. Wish she went over the models a little more for lab though. She gives many quizzes, homeworks, etc. so there is room for your grade to be higher since it is based off more than just test. Also offers a bit fo extra credit.",1
"Teacher is knowledgeable on the topic of microeconomics, but her ""english second language"" accent can be distracting. Class was hard for me, but then again my interest in the subject is zero. All quizes are online, but final is in class. Two group projects to present to class throughout semester. Overall, meh.",0
HES THE WORST TEACHER EVER AND VERY DISRESPECTFUL,0
"Well, the class in itself was easy. She was very hard to understand, would not give good feedback or review tests. Would not recommend. Even though I got a B, the class was more self taught than taught by a professor.",0
"Prof. Elliott is super.  She has interesting and engaging discussions and keeps them moving, mostly (occasionally they drag but rarely).  She is a hard grader, but you will have ample opportunities to discuss your paper with her.  Her office always seems to be open.  She's great.  Take a class from her!",1
"She is great. She is young so she gets us. Ex. she does not use I-clickers because the things they are dumb. Her lectures are mainly concepts so if you understand concepts you can pass pretty easily. She studies how people learn chemistry, so, her methods of teaching are pretty good. Only down side is discussion you get worksheets that are graded.",1
"He is very helpful, and make sure that you understand before moving to another problem.  He does have early morning meeting it wouldn't be best to take in the morning.  If he miss a lot of classes he still give you the material even though he haven't went over anything.",1
"Dr. Wane may be relatively new to Armstrong, but she is one of the most knowledgable professors on the campus. She has changed my perspective on the world immensely. Of course, it is an English class which means reading, but she breaks it into chunks. I highly recommend Dr. Wane so much that I plan on taking her again as soon as possible.",1
"To pass Hunsche's class you need to learn the material. She gives you lots of ways to do that. Homework, take home quizzes and puzzles during class to help you recall the material. You will have online homework every week. She really knows how to break down the material in little bits so you can understand it better.",1
She gave good feedback and connected with her students. I hate english but she helped push me forward,1
Mr. Ross is an amazing professor. He is very accesible during office hours and at answering emails. He explains content very well and cares about his students. Extra credit on exams. Homework can be long and tedious but that is just the nature of the course. If effort is given you will get an A or B.,1
Wasted class time on random presentations and then would tell us to read 7 chapters for the exam. When I took the exam that material was not on it.I felt I was wasting my time in her agonizing 3 hour class. Weekly assignments and annoying group project. I still don't know where I stand in the class and I graduate in 2 weeks. Please do not take her.,0
"She has favorites, and most of the time they are girls, and it well be extremely clear when you're the only person to have your hand up and get completely ignored. Not sure how you can get on her ""badside"", but if are you're going to notice the difference in grading.",1
Not helpful at all and disliked answering questions when clarification was needed after she rushed through the test related information,0
"Great teacher. Humble and not full of himself and very helpful to his students both in and outside of class, I highly recommend him.",1
"Do not take this class if you don't like politics. He is very dry when giving the lecture as it is easy to fall asleep or not pay attention. His grading criteria is mostly based on tests which he makes extremely difficult. The exams are short answer, multiple choice and essay. He also hardly gives extra credit and doesn't care about his students",0
She's a nice person but I feel like she doesn't explain well. She just rushes through lectures and doesn't give thorough examples. She makes a lot of mistakes in her lectures and it confuses you. A lot of ppl did not do well on her tests! I wonder why.....  Don't take her.,0
"KNOWS A LOT, GET TO KNOW HIM, GO TO HIS OFFICE, CHAT WITH HIM, YOU WILL LEARN AND ENJOY HIS CLASS, HE WILL HELP YOU ANYTIME BUT YOU NEED TO COME TO HIM, USES POWERPOINTS AND PUTS THEM ON BLACKBOARD, LEARN SOME DEFINITIONS AND COMMON SENSE AND YOU WILL BE GOOD",1
"I do appreciate how he has great experience in international business, and it shows, but that's all he talks about. Himself. The stories are real world applications and that's great, but when it comes to midterm and final time, you have to teach yourself everything he did not have time to cover as he talked about himself all class.",0
He is not there to teach his students. He doesn't really cares if you pass the class. Horrible instructor!,0
"AWFUL. He does experiments that are absolutely not related to anything that's on the test or homework. His lectures are also not related. He told us there would be HW through chapter 6 and added 5 more chapters at the last minute. 17 students in class, 2 dropped, more than half got a D or F and more than 5 said they would retake the course...",0
"Big oof. Probably one of the hardest classes to sit through ever. The class isn't hard, and the tests are super easy, BUT GOD AWFUL BORING. The problem with Mrs. Ayers is that she repeats herself many MANY times during lectures. She also likes to go off on tangents about personal life, etc. She's not a horrible teacher, but she's not a great one.",0
"When I first took this course the set up of his website was confusing. There will be times where you'll need to email him. He will reply, but he'll have an attitude in the email, so if you like rude professors take him. I felt like I learned nothing after this course. I'm usually an A student too.",0
"Not really a class that is worth taking. I took this class because all the other English professors were full and this teacher was open. Now I know why. My two other friends taking English 1A at the moment don't even have finals, one of them is going to a breakfast with his class. For the amount of work we do, and the grade we get, not worth.",0
"Professor was very unorganized. Syllabus was changed but not updated, so class didnt know when anything was due or what was expected of assignments because she changes them without notifying the class. Very hard to contact. Does not use e-mail often. Lots of reading, long lectures where she gets distracted and talks of everything but the material.",0
Took him Spring 2020. Absolutely the worst professor Ive ever had. Refuses to accept that theres more than one way to do math. Uses a lot of steinfield references and requires you to use them. Makes you feel stupid for asking simple questions and grins! Never again.,0
He may know his stuff but there are much better teachers out there. Be prepared to struggle on your own as you will get little or no actual teaching. He grades based on if he like you or not and had no rapport with the student. I had to basically self study and there was little or no help. TA are not much help either.,0
"While Professor Culter is pretty okay at exposing things in class, she is awful at giving good examples in her online video lectures. She expects you to know the material (which is fine) but doesnt explain how she gets certain numbers and where they came from. Half the class dropped out after the third chem lab. Do NOT have her as your professor!",0
Awesome teacher!! Professor Gordon does a great job of making sure everyone understands the material. She's funny and keeps class entertaining. Would definitely take her class again!,1
He is very accessible and his letters are always interesting and helpful. Every part of each assignment is reiterated over and over again so it's very hard to be confused in this class. All of the class content is organized and available on the course website.,1
This was one of the worst teachers I have had. He is very cocky and makes you feel stupid when you talk to him. I would not reccommend this teacher at all.,0
"She is kind of uptight, but I think she just didn't like our class because everyone was so disrespectful. Kind of boring, I once fell asleep on total accident! Just study the notes and it's not hard at all. Gives pop quizzes and in class assignments that you cant make up, so go to class!",1
Professor Mark was an extremely hard professor. He would always give us busy work and then walk out of the class. He is not very helpful. I am a B student and I am really struggling to pass this course. I would advise taking another professor if you can.,0
She always gives so many homework questions and she takes them up as part of your points with your quiz grades. There are quizzes at the beginning of almost every class and she only gives 10 minutes for them. She takes off points for the SMALLEST & STUPIDEST things. She will be the reason you'll fail the class or drop out if you're not on top of it,0
"horrible teaching ethics. not precise,not clear, expectations too high and can not comprehend her expectations,speech/diction is a distraction. if you don't like Lord of the RINGS and that kind of reading, you are going to do bad in grades",0
"I want to say that Shaokang knows two languages better than I ever will. That being said, being a native Chinese speaker, he does not have a thorough enough understanding of English to properly teach a class without most of the students getting lost along the way. There's also no textbook so good luck trying to teach yourself.",0
"Margo is an horrifying prof. I've never been so incredibly bored in an anthropology class before. Literally reads off the slides, no new information is given, speaks ONLY about Brazil- in fact my class mate and I have taken to rolling our eyes every time she mentions Brazil, which means our eyes are CONSTANTLY ROLLING. AVOID THIS PROF.",0
"She was very nice, gave a couple days off, as long as you do the assignment with proper instruction you will be fine!",1
"Grades reasonably well, gives great feedback for the group project. Group project isn't too difficult as it is broken up into pieces throughout the course. Tests were the most difficult portion of the class.",1
Teaches very very fast... Skips simple steps assuming you already know so its easy to get lost.. look for another teacher!!!,0
"Terrible professor, it's sad too. She isn't very good at teaching and explaining. If you're not one to study and work REALLY HARD then this class isn't for you. DON'T TAKE HER.",0
"Dr. Kunz can be dry and lectures can be boring, but he knows this. Really sweet and wants you to do well. Would take him again!",1
"She's a very nice person but terrible professor. All we ever did was critiques, which are important, however she has given us hardly any instruction and is very harsh when it comes to critiquing.",0
I study for this class at least two hours each night and still get test scores in the 60's and my scores are in the top 25%. My normal test scores are typically in the 90's. His handouts are not current and don't match the text material. It is difficult to cross between his handouts and text material.,0
This Man can't teach. He lets his emotions show and get the best of him. His handwriting is terrible and he doesn't really teach. All he talks about is the projects you have to do. If you just want a basic high school teacher his your guy. But if you are trying to be enlightened his not your guy.,0
"The WORST professor I've ever taken classes with in my life. Not only does she NOT teach the material at all, she forces you to learn the class yourself through textbooks&makes significant typos on the exams. Worse with online classes, goes to breakout rooms every 2 seconds. Won't teach you the material.I would recommend you avoid her at all costs.",0
Mr. Walling was an excellent teacher. Lots of hands on experience in his career. Interesting. Class participation & homework completion is a must. Hes an awesome teacher. Understanding. Gives extra credit. Would take again.,1
If you take this class make sure this is the only class you take that semester. That's how difficult this class is! If you are working a full time job and have several classes this is not a class to take. Her assignments disappear after mid night even though she saids the assignment is due next class. Gives so much work even on test days.,0
She will provide a vast amount of resources for you to do well on the exam. She will help prepare you a lot with your lab practicals and I felt very prepared by it. She will tell you exactly what you need to know and there are no curveballs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
"Hw is myPhysicsLab, each time u get a Q wrong, it decreases your %. He will drop for attendance. Class time consists of 90% group work, before it was 100% lecture. Also, you need to read the chapter and take a reading quiz before each class on canvas imo they're hard. I wish he would go over worksheets in class more. You can use equations on test!",0
Mr. Kraft is an amazing english teacher. I loved being in his class. He allows his students to ask questions and doesn't mind helping you if you have any problems. I thought his class was fun and very knowledeable. Great teacher don't miss out. I have him now for 202.,1
"Her lectures are very helpful and understandable. Makes the subject very easy to understand. If you study examples from lectures and the practice exams, you should be good for the midterms and final. Got a B+ because I did not study the material for the first midterm well and failed that exam.",1
Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,0
Her personality is just like her last name );( No sense of humor; no personality. Lectures were long and unclear; exams were ambiguous.  Unwarned  quizzes; no curve; no extra credit; tough grader. DO NOT TAKE HER! Avoid as all cost.,0
"Johns keepin it real in the classroom all the time, big mans got big tings for students around campus and from a far. i have lots of respect for mans and aspire to get a Phd. see ya next year pal",1
"Meyers cemented my choice to be an English major. She is incredibly insightful and cares to learn about contemporary opinions regarding the aged works we cover. The midterms and papers are straightforward and we are prepared adequately for them. Don't miss any readings, take good notes and you'll get the A. Best professor for the material!!!",1
"Incredibly rude, isnt willing to work with you. Class consists of writing consecutive notes, there is no explanation that goes with it.",0
"I loved this class and the teacher! The material was great, but going to the class was boring. The professor and the textbook made the class! I learned so much and always laughed during her classes.",1
She was really cool i liked the way she talked.  She helped go over a lot of things with me and good to talk with,1
"I have taken two classes with Ambassador Hare during my studies at BU. He is by far my favorite professor at BU. Although he assigns a substantial amount of reading, they are relevant and interesting. Highly recommend any class with him.",1
"Totally incompetent.  Will spend 10 minutes giving an example, only to realize she did the whole thing wrong and have to go back and re-do it.  Totally useless topic and I can't believe people actually devote their lives to studying it.",0
Very helpful - just ask for help!,1
"This professor may be ok in person but DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS It is so hard I literally can't get over a 70 on her quizzes. She gives no extra credit, and is not helpful at all!!!",0
"Software based class that can be buggy if you don't know what your doing. He always helps when he can in class. He grades you like you were an employee and expects work to be as good as if he were going to present it in front of a client, so yeah he can tare you work apart sometimes but it wont be any different than in the workforce.",1
I took this class during the online quarantine time. And I was scared to take math online. You work on your own time and theres no mandatory zoom. The discussion videos were so fun to listen and so informative. I hate math but Professor Silva made it really easy and helpful. You dont need a textbook.,1
"She's the worst prof I've had. Sweet but cannot teach. My friend and I compared assignments and we'd have the same answers but one of us would be wrong and the other right. Expectations were unclear, lectures boring, extremely unorganized and if you ask for clarification, she just repeats herself. You have to teach yourself. I don't recommend her.",0
He may not be the best professor of physics but he is extremely helpful. He scales the grades and does quizzes as a group work together. The clicker questions help to notify that you are attending class.,1
"Very nice professor.  Professional, concise.",1
Lenient about due dates. Very helpful if you take the time to ask questions. She’s a great professor and enthusiastic about what she teaches. Tests are difficult.,1
"Mrs. Warden is every freshman's nightmare. She manages to make ENGL 1010/ 1020 so unnecessarily difficult by her impossible ""grading"" rubric. You can do everything she tells you and she'll still take off points with no explanation. If you aren't clear about what to do, she'll simply say ""I already told you"". Her emails are unprofessional and rude.",0
"Peggy only wishes for her students to succeed and find happiness.  Her classroom format is weekly journals, some classroom presentation, but most importantly, getting to know your classmates. The homework might not be what you get out of her class though.  She has guest speakers, and other projects designed to help you figure out career goals.",1
"Super nice, easy to talk to and reach. Gives video feedback for major assignments, always willing to talk about the subject more. Course theme is print vs. digital: a bit boomer but still fun. Textbook is flawless and fun. Make sure that you have good grammar, or else your grades will feel it! If you can get excited about the topic you'll do great.",1
"Knows his stuff, but is a very poor lecturer for intro. Takes a very long time to say very little.  The bulk of his slides are of very little value and does not explain complicated concepts very well.",0
"Great professor, great guy! Dr. Cogan loves sharing his knowledge on cinema. He teaches Irish cinema, Eastern European, and Japanese cinema.",1
"Very hard to understand, seems like she doesn't know what she is doing. Always is asking her students for help on things when she should know. I wouldn't not recommend her class!",0
Do not take for Easy A. I've learned more about this subject than any other class taken. This is due to the amount of practice required to grasp the subject. The 'attitude' referenced before is more than likely due to students assuming they'll receive an easy A. This would frustrate me as well. I recommend this class to anyone seeking a challenge.,1
"Really nice teacher. Class can be boring seeing as he reads off the powerpoint, but he will be helpful if you have any questions. He is a CPA so he is knowledgeable in the material, just has no teaching skills. Tests & assignments are simple, class is a breeze! Easy A!",1
Burke is great!  He is always willing to help you if you need it.  If you do the work you will go good. ,1
"great prof. really shows that he cares about each individual, highly recommend!!!!",1
"He's a great teacher who definitely knows the subject. Anything he lectures about is fair game to be on the exam so take good notes. His lectures are structured based on students' questions, so come prepared to ask something or he won't lecture. Grades very generously on the lab portion and overall is very willing to help you with any questions",1
"She seems really sweet and tries her best. But honestly, the quizzes were the most difficult thing to do. There's not enough time for the amount of questions she gives on them. Midterm and Exam were draining to say the least. The course is already difficult enough, but I at least passed, not very satisfied with it though.",0
He is a professor that doesn't care for his student's grades. He gives the same assignment multiple times and is not specific with what he wants so he will take off unnecessary points just because he feels like it. Wouldn't recommend taking him. Also makes you buy textbook and we NEVER used it.,0
"Professor RIckerson is an expert in her field. She is very passionate about her subject and it shows in her lectures. Her lectures can be very long sometimes, but most of them are very intriguing. Since parts of the test are visual, it is important that you attend class. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone interested in her class.",1
"Very nice professor. He really likes this subject. ME on the other hand find it pretty long, and boring. It is an easy class, and he really puts an effort into it. Lots of writing to do. one group project",1
"LOVE her. Just take her. She has an amazing personality and keeps class fun and engaging. She made me love writing and not hate research. She guides you through all the major assignments, if you pay attention and try you will for sure get an A, but I wouldn't just do it for the grade. The content you take home is what really added value for me.",1
Great Professor !! You will learn a lot of interesting things in his classes. Take all of them lol,1
This class is awful. He lectures for an hour straight and shows videos. The test are hard and there aren't very many of them. There is no graded homework. I do not like his lecture style or anthropology. I would avoid if you are not interest in this major. You can get a diversity requirement somewhere else.,0
"Without a doubt, the worst professor I've ever had the privilege of being ""taught"" by. Graded our single paper for the class harshly,  taking off points for my ""poor grammar"" (note: I'm an English major on the Dean's List) and advising grammatical rules that haven't been acceptable to use since 5th grade. Save yourself and don't take this class. ",0
"She is an intimiating women. She is a great teacher. If you are serious about being in the medical field, take her.",1
"Don't, I repeat, Don't take him. He doesn't care if everyone in his class is failing. He even told us that in a recorded zoom session. He flat out doesn't care. He treats this class like a MBA class--which it isn't. There is an absurd amount of reading and test/quiz over that each week-- 68 class average-RUN!",0
"What a class. We just finished reading the book Epidemic (EBOLA)-unreal. He started the class talking about pygmalian; he expects us to perform better than we think we can. Loved this course. We learned more about our country and the world that any other course I've taken at WSU. One of the best courses. Recommend. Thank you, Dr. Alderete",1
The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,0
"Professor Endlich is amazing, she's bubbly and really excited about her work, that makes you want to be excited as well, the work is tough but as long as you follow instructions and turn everything in on time you'll easily get an A... 1010 would take this class again if I had to. ",1
He gets life and especialy the life of a student. He does accept late papers but just because he wants you to learn. He is very easy to talk to and very helpful. Take him.,1
He was an excellent professor and really cares about his students. His office hours are great and he understands situations and helps out when it comes to emailing him. His class has several quizzes and homework and his tests are straight forward.,1
"Let me be blunt, if you do not put in work, you will not pass. Mrs. Prasad is one of the most AMAZING professors I've ever had. You must be able to teach yourself (no text book we use K-Learn) but Mrs. Prasad explains things thoroughly, is fast paced but she will take the time to make sure you understand. Put in the effort and you'll easily pass.",1
I took Queen for the Writing 39C & English 11 combo. He is hands down the most caring and understanding professor I have ever taken a course under. He really goes out his way to meet up with every student severals time throughout the quarter to get to know them and address any concerns. 10/10 would recommend. Easy A as long as you do all the work.,1
She is a very tough grader and her requirements are ambiguous; you are never really sure what she is looking for. The class overall is boring and way too much work for a 2 credit hour course. Her interactions with students is unpleasant and can be downright rude! I will be sure to never take a class with her again!,0
"Prof. Gier is definitely caring and a great professor! His lectures were on point, he goes through everything you need for the test. He also shows interesting videos and gives real life examples of the theory you learn, which really helps. As long as you read and do your work, his class is an easy A and you'll learn a lot!",1
"I love love love Connie! She is such a good teacher, from the moment we started the class I knew I had made the right choice. She helps people overcome stage fright and makes the classroom an overall relaxed, comfortable place to improve your speaking skills.",1
"This class was difficult to take in a regular setting but even MORE difficult to take online after the COVID crisis. This professor made it extremely difficult to access his recorded lectures to a point where I had to drop. I understand COVID was an unforeseeable event; however, professors should be more accommodating and ease stress off students.",0
"Awesome teacher! I am taking him again this semester for MGF2107. Class is pretty straight forward. Uses mymathlab for the whole semester so textbook not required. He opens all tests and assignments from day one including final. Always responds quickly to emails, gives a recommended schedule to follow that is helpful and curves tests.",1
"Rambles on and doesn't make sure her students fully understand the material. Never know what's going on  the class and the notes do not help me. No personality and class is overall extremely boring. I use to love history and wanted to major in it. After taking this history class with Professor Piel, she has completely changed my mind about history.",0
"Very nice man and great teacher! He is not the best lecturer in the world, but gives the most fair tests I've ever taken and lets you do corrections on them, which no other department besides Math lets you do. You can tell he cares about his job.",1
Best teacher I have had at Calhoun. She takes the time to individually help students and is very knowledgeable about the classes she teaches. Also funny and pleasant to be around.,1
"Survey of Modern Math is a course that strikes most mathematics majors confused. Upon first glance, it would seem all the classes math majors take prior do not really prepare students for survey. However, Professor Mynard makes it accessible, affordable (he produces his own text), and clear as to why it is important for a math major.",1
"I took Alex for Business Calculus and have only one this to say about the woman: I love HER as much as she loves CATS (that's a hell of a lot, people).",1
"Wow, Kubota is something else.  She is a tough teacher, but she keeps it entertaining.  I love going to class, but she makes it easy to skip because of daily homework and boring ""practice with partners"".  She also has a funny lazy eye :). but she's a good teacher, I signed up to have her next semester!",1
I Loved this class. The professor was so helpful. I like that he is specific in what he wants. Easy A if you follow directions and read the materials.,1
"Seems to be a nice person and a decent prof. However the course is extremely disorganized. All lectures are prerecorded which automatically restricts access to the prof. Very little time in class to work with group members which limits the quality of your research project. For a 1st/2nd year research methods course, maybe. Capstone course? Please.",0
"Jesilow was amazing. He's really clear in his lectures and you can tell he knows what he's talking about. He's really funny and blunt so that's always fun in a crim class. The tests are pretty easy (34 lectures & 14 readings), but you have to read. Super easy B class but you have to work for that A. ",1
Worst teacher ever.,0
"Honestly, it went from DOWN to UGLY. It started weak and could have ended pretty bad. I didn't think college teachers would go on every single class talking about their family, their weekends, their nephews and how they're queen of a subject when they can't even help you right and can't answer their own quizzes. Just read the BOOK and take NOTES!",0
"Professor Perez is a solid instructor. She can be a little snappy sometimes, but she means well. She's tough on attendance and gives minimal but easy hmwk assignments. She also gives extra credit opportunities. Her exams are all info from the slides she lectures in class. Show up, take notes, ask questions (when needed) and you'll do fine.",1
"The worst teacher I have had in my college career.  I am not the best at math, and immediately sought out help for the class.  She repeats the same information over and over again in lecture, barely making it through half of what is required.  Went to office hours for help and she insulted my intelligence for not understanding. She is rude, no help",0
"This guy is awesome! Go to class and you'll be golden. The tests are pretty easy, just learn the material when he teaches it to you and it'll be super easy!",1
"Professor Wu is not boring, rather very interesting and easy to listen to. He knows how to keep your attention and I liked his style of teaching. Every point counts in this class, so make sure to do well on the online quizzes just in case you need those points to boost your grade. Oh & try ur best to attend all classes. I would def. recommend him.",1
He completely contradicts his feed back he gave previously. He will waste most if not all of class time lecturing on what is very hard to understand how it relates to architecture. His grades the same to a person who showed up to class each day and with each assignment and someone who barely showed up and only turned in the final for each project,0
"Ms. O'Donnell is tough and does not let anyone skate through her class. I dreaded this class and heard horror stories. But if you pay attention, apply yourself and make a concerted effort you can pass with a very good grade.",1
"Erika is energetic, accessible, intelligent, and well spoken. She knows her materials and is the best at conveying it. She makes class more fun than any class I've ever had while still getting the materials through to you. She also creates a very, very friendly classroom environment making it very comfortable to present. Take her!!",1
"Professor Biermann is a nice man, he is funny, and can go off topic on funny subjects. However his lectures do not really do anything, he relies mainly on you reading the book, if you are someone like me who learns more when the professor explains things and actually TEACHES you, then prof Biermann is not your man. Also his movie selection sucks!",0
Alex could have taught MATH 0240 better than the professor if given the chance. Her classes were clear and organized and she gives really good examples of problems to help you get feel for what quizzes and exams (should) be like. She's always willing to go over concepts again and meet outside of class if you cant make it to her office hours.,1
"On a scale of 1-10, I would give her a -0.1. I would go lower but there's not an option to do that. ",0
Super impressive. I suck at accounting and yet he teaches in a way to help us. He is extremely patient and is willing to help you out when ever you need it.,1
"Exams were worth 70% of the whole grade, which made it feel like doing your homework, (which there was a lot of) did not matter. If you got a bad grade on one of your exams, it tanks your grade and it's tough hard to get it back up. On top of this, he went through the topics really fast, which made it hard to understand.",0
"One of the most thought provoking classes I have ever taken.  Prof McConnell is not the most interesting teacher but by the time you leave the class, you're sure to be a better writer.",1
"Easy A, but the class is taught like a high school class. You have to show up to lecture and do worksheets. There is a lot of busy work.",0
"I did more work outside of this class than all of my other classes combined. We had two textbooks. One for our weekly 500-word blogs + two 250-word comments on other people's blogs, and the other textbook for the online tests. Do not think that just because you get to use the textbook the tests are easy. No. Very difficult to take lecture notes.",0
"Best professor at SJSU! His class was interesting, and he brought a TON of real world examples, and learning exercises into the lectures. Instead of just making us memorize formulas, he showed what they actually mean in the real world, and how to apply them in our professional and personal lives. He also gave 4 east extra credit assignments!",1
I cant speak for her in class teaching but for the online course I took with her she was completely unhelpful. Youre expected to teach yourself the material and there were no reviews for 4/5 exams... including the cumulative final.,0
"Sara is a very nice person at heart, but as a teacher I think it is hard to have her. Her grading system is very confusing and doesn't allow for students to keep track, and she makes the class very lecture heavy, which often leads to boredom from students. There is definitely a way to make the class more interesting. Wonderful person, not teacher.",0
She is very caring and always willing to help you out if you need help. Her lectures are also very interesting and engaging. I would highly recommend!!,1
"I started this ACCT class with the very helpful Professor Hegner. She had to leave halfway through the semester at which point Professor Skelly took over. He has wonderful stories that relate to economics and politics, both are not helpful to the number crunching of accounting. He writes illegible on the board and speaks in a low monotone voice.",0
"This professor is just as hard as Mary Allen, another a&p professor at North Harris. She knows the materials and explains them well. I just don't like her aloofness. In class, she is funny with lectures; but outside of class, she is  totally opposite. So unapproachable.  She doesn't show much interest in answering questions.",1
"Nice guy, lousy teacher. Get ready to fly through powerpoints, watch a bunch of JMP tutorials, and do random assignments and busywork.",0
"Previous reviews aren't fair! She is passionate about the material, treat her with respect (as you should with your professors), she'll respect you back. Be a mature adult and pay attention in class and you'll be fine. Midterm coming up and she's organizing a class study guide where she will make sure we include everything. Also funny and caring!",1
"most classes, he came off as very rude in regards to how he communicates. talks over you and -- which can make the classroom setting unsettled. aside from that, do your work and show up to class, and your grade for that class should be fair.",0
"Professor Kuhlman is very nice and listens to the students. His lectures are horrible. He just reads off a script or textbook. If you don't understand he will clarify for you but, what are we paying for?Funny teacher but not worth the money. There's no challenge in the class, if you need an easy A then its your class.",0
I was told by Mike that I should consider changing my major and he was insanely harsh in his grading. He never encouraged me or worked with me and everything I did was wrong. Ive had 3000+ level classes that were easier.,0
Great Instructor!,1
Her lectures are very interesting but not really that helpful for exam preparation. She basically expects you to learn everything by yourself so she's able to talk about the extra things that ultimately are unimportant. She never explains how to do questions but only goes through the answers because she expected you to learn it yourself.,1
Took Mrs. V for MTH 1. Great instructor!! Quizzes almost every class session only cause she wants to make sure you understand the material. Must past the final with a 70% or higher and finish all homework online on my math lab to pass the class. (Pass/Fail class). I would take her all the way up to Precal if I could. Awesome instructor.,1
"He is by far one of the worst professors at Macomb. No extra credit, no help with homework, not willing to answer questions that expand on his lecture. He stopped giving feedback on homework after several students hadn't done theirs, so he took it out on everyone. No one can keep up with his workload. I ended up dropping and trying again.",0
Amazing professor who cares about students especially considering that math isn't my subject at all. She makes sure to help and support you with your work especially when you're putting effort into it.,1
"Class grade is a total of four paper.  After you receive the syllabus, you honestly do not even need to show up because he posts the paper questions on his blackboard site. All information gained in the class is from the two textbooks. No structure in the class or even powerpoints. Very harder grader on papers. Says one thing but wants another",0
"Hands down favorite professor. She taught me so much and got me interested in the news and political events. She has her views on things and she is willing to fight for them. Gives lots of extra credit, gives attendance points, she gives you outlines for each chapter so learn the outline and skim the chapters in the book. You'll  get an A.",1
"She is a good teacher, but her grading methods can either make you or break you. She grades you on your participation in class she make sure you talk. Her book analysis' are pretty easy and she has several readings throughout the semester. Her test are hard if you don't take good notes.",1
"REC4011 was an amazing class. Professor Hanley is an excellent professor and he really cares about his students and what he teaches. There are no required textbooks, all the readings are provided by Dr. Hanley.   There is an observation assignment in which you have to go out and complete on your own. No final exam, just a paper due.  Enjoy!",1
WORST PROFESSOR and very arrogant... No student should have to deal with a professor like this! ,0
Literally like my mom at school. She is so sweet. Her tests are fair. Her office is always open with candy and great conversation!,1
"This instructor is the only reason this class was difficult. The rubric was barely followed, if at all sometimes. She will mark you down for random things without reason, and for things I've never had issues with before. She finished grading all my milestone papers within 15-30 minutes.  Nothing was ever clear, making this class terrible.",0
"Kind of a picky grader on tests, but if you really want to learn, take him, you can learn a ton about stats. Super easy going, great at explaining.",1
"I honestly don't understand how he got good reviews. He is a very tough grader who can be very rude and mean depending on his mood. His exam is 85% of the total grade and I was never able to finish them (I studied a lot). I never missed his class or hw and still got B-. Even I take the same class again, I don't think I'll be able to do better",0
"It's true that she is sweet, but what's best about her is her ability to teach. I learned the core aspects of essay writing in her class. She goes over everything she expects and has great exercises for the class. I owe the A I received on my midterm for English 1A to Professor Fujimoto whom I took for English 111.",1
"Funny enough, I took this class because of the rave reviews I saw on here. The reality of it? This instructor hardly respond to e-mails or discussions, it takes around 4 hours to listen to a lecture, study the material, and take a quiz, and in addition, you don't get much time to complete quizzes. Very time consuming, I would not recommend...",0
Kinda didn't seem like he cared much and just wanted us out of there plus he didn't explain well.,0
He is easy to go with ,1
Fun Class! Quick pace. Lots of info. Read what he puts on blackboard,1
"Had Professor Abdo for both Professional writing and advanced prof writing. She's an amazing teacher, probably one of the best at UTSA. She's kinda of a hard grader, but you'll def leave the class room with more knowledge than you came in with!",1
"this professor is not bad just doesnt answer ?s clearly and makes you feel stupid sometimes for asking even when she says do you have any ?s. also after emailing her my work to check for accuracy she still took points off. so ask her to check entire hw. if you read the book,do the hw and show up, easy A. ps: know how to use excel b4 taking class.",1
"Fowler is a very smart individual with lots to say even if its not clear what she wants you to take away from lecture. I agree that the fall 04 final was a total ****. I went in with a B+ and came out with a C+, ouch.",1
"Max makes some good jokes in class but he is hard to approach for help. He'll make you feel really dumb when you're asking for help. He doesn't use a textbook or post any practice questions. There is no clear guideline for tests, the average for the midterm was 23% curved to 46%. He calls on you in class and gets mad when no one answers him.",0
Very helpful and understanding,1
"He was very chill at first, said that he only uses 2 hours out of 3 hours maximum, and does not require textbooks. And I thought he was a good professor. After a few classes, I saw how lazy he was. He posts another prof's notes on blackboard and expects you to read it before class, and in class he barely teaches. He's very lazy.",0
"I'm taking her currently will update end of winter: she signs too quickly to understand, she doesnt understand tech (to an extreme level-it affects you), her emails are incoherent, 0 prep she's still adding assignments 2 weeks in, the syllabus is not being followed, she is NOT worth it. 2/3 of the class dropped the first week, AVOID HER.",0
"Very nice and friendly, obviously knows her work but assumes the class does too. She rushes through everything she teaches and expects the class to understand. Gets frustrated if you ask questions during class. Very very difficult exams,  they are super long and you never have enough time to finish. Shes good with office hours but thats it.",0
"Is Occupational Therapy Coordinator.  Classes, labs and assignments are relevant & practical - no busywork.  Communicates her expectations consisely. Approachable. Good sense of humor, too.",1
"Dr. Szto does not accept late assignments. I was in his mental health course and did not feel that he prioritized the mental health of students. Found he was condescending to classmates and I who had meetings with him. Since I had the ability to choose which extra social work course I wanted to take, I wish I had taken a different class.",0
"Great teacher, the curve is very generous, if you go to class you'll have no problem understanding any content presented in the class.",1
Get ready to fail this class. No matter what you do. No matter if you study 24 hours a day. At the end you will not pass the class. Really tough grader and very confusing. tons of homework and quizzes. you will get crazy of studying. Please Please Please do not take a class with him because you wont get good grades nor understand mathematics.,0
"Worst class ever, respect yourself and choose a different professor",0
I am a smart person and I had a really hard time with his style of teaching. I 100 percent respect him but he doesn't work for me. Be ready for really hard test questions..,0
SOOO BORING! This class is a joke. If you passed the 2nd grade you don't need this class. It focuses on critical thinking. Do not take her unless you like to sleep in class.,0
"Wonderful professor. Extremely helpful and clear when talking. He makes a lot of great jokes, which makes class fun. Would take another course taught by him in a second.",1
"Very sweet woman, caring, and puts her students at ease.",1
"I took this class by mistake. The school signed me up for this coarse that i don't even need. He doesn't speak clearly, he is to fast, a lot of people dropped this Friday and Saturday class. He is not understanding at all, and he does not comprehend very well. He says mean things to students like oh well you don;t pass not my problem. Fire him!",0
"He seems to be a very nice man outside of the classroom, but once in class he is incredibly condescending. He does not listen to his students needs. His comments on papers often left students feeling embarrassed and upset. I went to office hours with him but left feeling worse about my paper. Honestly one of my worst experiences with a professor.",0
"I don't usually do things like this, but the nightmare that is this professor must be taken seriously. Honestly, I have never seen any professor with a closer mind. the guy is truly a betrayal of all that academia stands for. Classes are incoherent, insipid, and most of all, anti-intellectual. Stay away as far as possible.",0
"He is a nice guy, but the class is impossible unless you are already a biology pro. He talks crazy fast and covers about 5 chapters each class. No assignments or anything in the grade book, just 4 really hard tests. He also doesn't give extra credit or round grades.",0
"Dr. R's Phil 124 introduces students to Indian philosophy and mysticism by examining the American teacher Daya Mata's encounters and experiences with the Kriya yoga tradition, talks on meditation by Indian and Western exponents, and topics such as reincarnation. Confucianism, Daoism, and Zen Buddhism (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) are included.",1
"WORST TEACHER AT NASHVILLE STATE! Doesn't enter grades at all, claims he only gives a final grade and you are suppose to keep up with your own grades to know if your're passing. Takes the fun out of art! Does the same thing every single class!!! He talks with terrible language and bad body language and uses profanity, which is so unnecessary!",0
"What Morales should do is go to the dean and ask the dean about the people that Javier beat out for the job.  Then, he should ask the dean to contact those people to replace Javier.  He is that bad!  He is also a picky grader.  If he likes you, you'll get a A.  If he dosen't like, you will not get an A.",0
do not recommend her to anybody,0
One of the best professors I ever had. His classes are interesting and helpful. He always make sure that he communicates effectively. Bruce is awesome! :),1
Cannot seem to get anything organized and is so hard to follow.  Last exam he gave us a calculations chart he never explained to us how to do these in class. Always messes up adding up exam grades so you have to get it fixed.  No grades posted on class site so no one knows where they stand in the class.  Do not take this professor--its a mess!,0
"Professor F-M is amazing. I liked his class and I hate any English class. There were discussion posts, a few papers, and a group project. I thought it would be difficult, but he is a really good teacher. He is not a harsh grader, is very understanding, gives good feedback, and the readings were enjoyable. I really recommend taking him 100000%",1
"Brian McNamara is a fair and reasonable professor in Computer Science.  Although the class I took with him was online, I found him to be available whenever I had questions.",1
"Lovely lady. Nice, patient - no complaints. If you are falling behind - send email - keep her informed and you'll be fine. As for course content - all sections teach same material - she may have input, but she and others teach what is decided by chair and others. Take her! you wont regret it...",1
I took this class on webct and the questions were challenging but in the end he really helped me out. He answers emails ans returns phone calls not a bad professor.,1
"Easy A. For a sociology teacher he seems ignorant based on how he talks about women, other cultures, and gay people. Not politically correct. He also allows people to talk, text, come in late, have more than 6 absences, he does not want you to fail. If your a weak student this class is made for you. If you are a good student this class is annoting.",1
This teacher is more frustrating than interesting. He repeats himself often and purposely leaves assignments very open ended. He has an interesting way of teaching and really drives home the actually skill of communication but doesn't offer any prep for the book work. You'll pass if you can think and manage yourself well... But if you're expecting and easy A this is not it.,0
"She explains things once to the entire class clearly, if you were not paying attention while she was speaking she does not like to re-explain things. I liked her style of teaching and talking with students.",1
She can be over-the-top w/her echo &choral responses(vocab words I learned from her) She was the only teacher to EVER push me to work hard &do more than expected. I respect the way she didn’t grade work bc it kept me working hard. She was the ONLY prof who taught me how to teach. My future students will thank her bc she taught me everything I know.,1
She is the worst professor I ever had. She is very rude.,0
"Dr. Wood is an amazing professor. She is very knowledgable and is willing to help anybody that is willing to help themselves. She is also somebody that you can talk to about personal issues. Her classes are weighted very test heavy, 70% to 75%. However, if you pay attention and put in the time and effort an A in the class is definitely achievable.",1
"She's a very nice lady and answers questions well but she seems to forget that our class is only 50 minutes long and, therefore, tries to pack everything she can in at the last minute.",1
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
This was a great class with a great professor. Sigal makes history of colonial Latin America really interesting. Pay attention to lecture in order to do well on the papers and the final.,1
For a new professor Ostrowski does a fine job. She has a bit of an accent and can have trouble with some English words and may not know all the questions we ask but she does have the answers the next day or at any office hours. Lab is fun and easy although she can be tough at grading at times. Tests are easy as long as you go through all the slides,1
Lectures were confusing and long winded. He is a nice person and tries hard to convey the information however he loses the students in the process. I have been to every class and still do not know what we have been doing. I literally put in random numbers on the homework assignments and do that until I get the correct answer. There is no hope. ,1
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"She always seemed super bored in lecture and sometimes wouldn't even know what she was teaching us or how to answer a student's question. She was not good at explaining concepts and once we got past the basics, it got really confusing. The midterm had stuff we never learned and I don't think she even graded our finals.",0
"She's merciless with her deadlines. I had a family member taken to a hospital on a life threatening emergency during the semester, and when I asked for an extension on the assignment, I got nothing but a big F as in F You.  Stay away",0
"Inconsistent grading, poor communication with students, no examples of expected work, too many projects not enough time",0
"very unorganized, and i hate group projects, and in this class everything is a group project",0
GREAT TEACHER!!!,1
Worst Teacher ever.... boring lectures.,0
"Professor Goldman was pretty dull and her class seemed to go on forever. She was relatively easy, but does not offer extra credit anymore, besides on the tests. You have to read four books, which are not worth your time, but you have to write papers over them. Overall I would've rather taken a more interesting class, but it was an easy A.",1
"I can't say I really learned much in this class, but the assignments were a breeze and attendance wasn't mandatory.",1
You will get a B! But this guy is a a chode and  he thinks he is smart when he is not. You will not use any of it in real life and this class should be cut from teacher ed. ,0

"Professor Fetter is one of the worst professors I have had at Butler. He is a great person and a very enthusiastic teacher but does not efficiently provide students with the material and teaching skills necessary to do well in class. He records notes and puts them online, which are just as confusing. Do not take him or Marketing Analytics (MK 384).",0
"She's really nice, I took Women's studies with her. Keep in mind, you have to do lots of reading and writing...",1
"She is a nice lady, but that's about as good as it gets for this review. This class was very disorganized. The TAs made a complete mess of the ""project."" If you really want to learn OS, I would hold out for another professor.",0
"Very, very good professor. This guy is the professional you want teaching you- he's got a million years working at the federal courts- who else do you want to learn from?",1
"No homework. Don't buy textbook. Took him for 307 and 308, write down EVERYTHING from his slides. Study your notes and course pack before every exam. He only has 3 grades  3 exams so study a lot. The math is very simple but the multiple choice and T/F is fairly difficult. Definitely not an easy A but doable, and at least he's (sorta) funny.",1
"This Professor is epic. Instead of memorizing bunch of scientific names, he wants you to learn how to think and apply the practical knowledge. He is a true modern science Professor. He is very patient, polite, has a sense of humor, and intelligent. His lab is more like a club rather than a class. It is very entertaining.",1
"Get ready to write down lots and lots and lots of lecture notes, he doesn't make them available online, honestly never seen a teacher do this before, and then he tells us if you don't study the lecture notes you're not gonna pass, also made us buy the book for $80 in the beginning of the year, never used it once",0
"I'm so sad this is my last class to take with her :( AMAZING professor! I was fortunate to have taken her for BIO 1 AND 2. She makes lectures interesting, she's super funny and helpful. She has the greatest personality.I've never seen her in a bad mood! Shes very respected by her students. Dont hold back on taking her, Her classes fill up QUICK!",1
"I had him for 3 classes- 135, 136, & 137. As long as you do the work and participate a bit, you'll get a good grade. He gives a lot of leeway because he considers writer to be ""artists."" Inspiring and knows his craft. One of the coolest teachers I had at Palomar.",1
"Very Smart anf knows EVERYTHING!!! seriously. Trust me an A in her class is an A at Harvard! She command the very best out of her students, so you either do well or fail, and most fail. She my favorite professor at Morehouse.",1
I've never seen a prof put less work in teaching a class and actually being prof than Gord has. He only really taught in the first month and then it was all independent study from then. Don't expect him to give you any hints on tests and make sure to read!! Our midterm was Ch. 1-8 of the textbook (200+ pages) with no further guidelines.,0
He is the best! Taken him for multiple classes and I would highly recommend him. He listens to the needs of the class and is really accommodating if you have issues with course content or deadlines. He's highly approachable and very knowledgable in what he teaches. ,1
I did not enjoy taking her. She was confusing in her lectures and assigned way to much work. I never understood an assignment and always had to look up what she supposedly taught us. I do not recommend. ,0
"Dr. Zhao is an awesome professor. He states what will be on the tests and doesn't add any unnecessary fluff into the lecture. He posts really simple study guides for each test and if you do them, you shouldn't get anything below a B- on an exam. Exams are straight forward and relatively easy. He makes chem awesome after organic. Lots of online HW",1
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0
Probably one of the most difficult professors I've had. Didn't grade anything until the very last week of the semester and her office hours were never available. Everything was given vague and hard to understand instructions. She was very sweet but I don't think online learning is suited for her. I'm not even sure what my grade is in the class.,0
"Hellquist is the best. Every class was extremely interesting, the videos we watch in class/the ones he posts online will get you interested in topics you didn't even know you'd enjoy. Learned more in this class than all my college classes combined. Take it!",1
"Chandra is the worst professor I have ever had at umb. Physics is a difficult subject to begin with and 90% of the class are not physics majors yet his expectations for us are ridiculously high. 2 midterm and a final, midterms consist of 2 questions, so if you get one question wrong you fail. Endless amounts of homework not even related to lecture.",0
Nice guy but terrible teacher. Learned absolutely nothing from this class and after being a deans list student for 1 1/2 this man was the first to prevent me making it. Quizzes and test are nearly impossible and this class will hurt your GPA. You've been warned! Normally don't leave reviews but I don't want anyone to suffer.,0
I hate to not say nice things about people so I will just say Dr. O'leary makes it non-stressful to go through these classes. Having been out of his classes for a few years now I have relearned everything he did not teach us. Unfortunately you can learn semiconductor devices much better on Google than with Dr. Oleary.,0
This course needs to be revamped prof anikovsky needs to learn to teach stuff more throughly and test stuff that he actually taught us. literally buddy goes and tests on stuff he skipped in 10 min and is amazed that we did so bad. I am so happy to be done with this course.,0
Disorganized and does not teach in class,0
"It sounds like a certain student just needed a lot of hand holding and is angry it wasn't handed to her. If the program is so flawed, why are the majority of students doing excellent. Be an adult, take responsibility for your own failure, don't blame the program. Prof Waller has been nothing but helpful to me btw",1
"Shes definitely not the most organized or on top of things (which is fair given how busy she is) but her class is very interesting. She has great experience in public health and her lectures are interesting. She wants you to learn and is very straight up with her expectations. If you reach out about an extension or extra credit, she is willing.",1
"She's completely unorganized. Too much work for no grade. She has cancelled class 3 weeks in a row for personal reasons or to go to festivities. We have written up to 4 drafts so far, NONE have been graded only critiqued. Also, has insulted many students including myself claiming "" it is clear English is my second language"". Overall terrible prof. ",0
"She may be the worst English Professor I have ever had. She has horrible communication skills, disorganized, and unreliable. I emailed her several times to send me a Zoom code to attend class and she never did so. At the end of the semester, she had not graded a single assignment all semester. There are better English professors so do NOT take her!",0
"He is a good professor! He is really funny and often makes jokes during class. I especially like how he gives you a note packet, instead of saying look at the book.",1
