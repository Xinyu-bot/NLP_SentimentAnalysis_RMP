"Ratana tries his best & I respect that, but he still falls way short of being an effective professor for 229. This was his first time teaching 229 so I can only hope this was a result of inexperience of teaching this course. His lectures are unclear, unorganized, & he made frequent mistakes. He also posted our full names next to our grades & IDs",0
"Listen. This professor has a decent enough rating on here, so maybe he used to be better; however, whatever he is doing now is NOT WORKING. There are about 10 students in the class left because everyone has already dropped. He's disorganized, forgetful, and will actually make you feel like an idiot in front of everyone for asking questions. AVOID!!",0
Ms. Feagin knows a lot about American history but I feel that she tries to cram too many activities into one semester.,0
Super great guy whos passionate about the material and wants to see younger people learn. Only problem I had was that his exams were a pretty hard but if you set aside a few hours for each one you should be fine. Definitely take him if you have the chance!,1
Not my favourite prof for a course that requires clear explanations. His slides are very detailed and he tries to engage the class but he's not an interesting lecturer. His assignments seem straight forward until he tries to explain how to complete them; very vague and confusing instructions which makes them harder than they should be.,0
Listen to me! If you are planning on taking her class RUN! as far away as possible you wont pass. She is the worst professor at Valencia. You will not learn you will write 8 papers every Wednesday. And her test is hard even the multiple choice but majority of her test is open answer and all she talks about is giraffes! Online work kills you! RUN,0
"Honestly don't even know where to start with this guy. He's unorganized, rude, boring, and seems inadequate for the position. During lectures, you can't help but notice how it seems like he has not clue what he is talking about and that observation is proven when someone in the class asks him a question or to elaborate more. Stay away!",0
"Take his class if you want challenge. He knows his thing but he is a tough grader, he grades every single homework and didn't accept the only late homework that I accidentally forget to do. Tests are hard and didn't give partial credits on tests so I screwed up really badly. (could get a B with partial credit but get a D) try to avoid him.",0
"Honestly a nice prof but a terribly run class. He tests you on the most random things and the majority of his test questions are trick questions that there is no way to study or prepare for. That being said you can do well in the class without really studying or even knowing much, just use common sense. The lab portion of this class was terrible.",0
"I literally love Julie. She is so passionate about what she does so her lectures are almost enjoyable and very interesting. She engages with the class a lot and drops major hints about test questions. Her tests are easy if you take notes and listen, but that's easy to do in her class. Overall, I would take every class she taught!",1
(Online) I would recommend if you take this class you should take Prof. Fritch. Lessons are clear and she is helpful. Sometimes you may have several assignments due at once but there is plenty of time to work ahead to get them done. The are web projects that include designing your own web pages. Good Online professor.,1
"Psy216 was not what I was expecting, long boring lectures consisting of slides and that's all. I know why students are acting like millenials when the teacher just reads from her slides and doesn't do much more but expect you to know the material she makes so mundane. I took this class expecting a teacher not a robot. I give this class B. Boring",1
"He's honestly the nicest man, and he really cares about the students. He understands that people have different views on things, but I mean, come on guys, he's a priest. Of course he's going to teach from a Christian viewpoint. His lectures are actually very interesting and he's funny on top of that. Definitely would take his class again.",1
"Ask a simple question, get a complicated answer to three questions you didn't ask. Avoids answering questions so he doesn't have to admit not knowing.",0
HE IS SOOOOO AWSOME HE MAKES SURE TO EXPLAIN SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EMAILS ARE ANSWERED RIGHT AWAY BUT DONT LET HIM SEE YOU TEXTING BECAUSE THAT GETS HIM REALLY MAD OVERAL HE IS ONE IN A MILLION,1
"He is ok. Slightly insane and makes ridiculous comments to try and keep everyone awake. Tests are all multiple choice, but really difficult. Its also hard cause 3 exams grades make up your final grade (with one short/easy essay option for extra credit) Boring class but he tries.",1
He loves to hear himself talk. He will repeat himself 100 times but nothing he says relates to what we're actually learning. You have to teach yourself everything in this class and pretty much memorize the book or you will not pass. I barely received a C and I've always been a A student. He seems like a nice guy but he is a terrible professor.,0
You should watch how fast this guy writes! It's amazing. Smart.,1
I have taken this class elsewhere as an undergrad. At SFSU I took this at a graduate level expecting further depth. Was disappointed in the quality of the material. The instructor has experience in image processing but clearly is behind the curve in AI and pattern analysis. Not worth my time or money. ,0
"He is a funny guy. He tries kinda too hard. He will kick you out for being on your phone. This man is a savage he does not care. He doesn't like to be disrespected. He goes in depth and uses solid examples. He gives you all the questions before the exam. Failing is pretty hard, just hope you have a good TA.",1
"He was okay, seemed a little distracted at times, but he knew his stuff. He was mostly helpful in the office hours and his lectures were usually enjoyable.",1
"Laroche is highly confusing, lacks clarity and doesn't try to help, even in office hours. Her online classes will have you chasing your tail and pulling your hair out. Avoid at all costs.",0
"This man is a gem! He respects all opinions and lets people be heard. His classes are fairly stress free, but he gives asignments that make you think and appreciate the art of teaching. He is a great insructor and I encourage you to take his courses. You will enjoy the experience!!",1
"Mr. Humphrey is amazing! His lectures are informative and entertaining. His study guides are very accurate and if you take good notes and participate, you should absolutely pass! My class was converted to online halfway through the semester, but Mr. Humphrey remained positive and rewrote the syllabus to allow full credit. 100% recommendation!",1
Extremely disorganized class. The content is difficult and she makes it more so. The TAs open lab hours are the only way I can try to understand the content or the assignments. Lectures are taken from previous quarters so dont make any sense. Very hostile whenever I tried to clarify things with her. Essays and quizzes every week.,0
"Honestly he's a good professor but he reads off the power point then explains it. To be honest it should be an online course considering our quizzes are online and PP and only meet for the trips, pointless to be an actual class. There is NO homework or midterm which makes it even more important to do good on the 2 trip papers, quizzes & Final!",1
"Do not take him. Do EVERYTHING you can to avoid his World Civ gen ed class. His expectations are absolutely ridiculous, and his tests are impossible. I've been in a number of times to his office hours and he is NOT helpful. If its between not having enough credits, and taking his class, take the less credits. Avoid him for a gen ed class.",0
1 of the best teachers i've had. loved his powerpoints. he didnt just read frm the slide & they were entertaining w/ pics. he was very funny & nice. wanted his students to pass the class w/ an A or B.  Tests were not that hard. Def recommend him for Animal Behavior.,1
ten out of ten would never take a class with her again. she prides herself on failing pretty much every student on their first essay and takes forever to hand back the essays. she can be very rude and tough on students by calling them out and then humiliating them. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS IT IS REQUIRED FOR YOUR MAJOR.,0
"She's not bad, but really boring lecturer. You have to remember all the readings though, and she takes off for every little thing on exams. Nice person, but boring. Tests aren't bad if you really know about everything she says in class. You need to go to class to do well in the class. ",0
"I picked her due to great reviews, BUT that may only be in class. DO NOT take her online! Had her for Summer 2. Only 4 assignments w/ a low grading scale (15,20,20,20)- No room for human error. Doesn't care to give a good feedback even when asked. Non-existent. Not her problem. I'd never take her again! I've had way better online class experience",0
"I would definitely take him again. Great professor, makes lectures interesting. Will take the time to help you. Exams aren't too difficult and he makes sure you are very well prepared before taking them. I would highly recommend taking him over all of the other professors.",1
"Great teacher, lessons were a lot of fun. Dr Turnbull is very funny and personable. I just passed my Part 1 Board Exam and I knew several answers from anatomy because of this guys references.",1
"Marty's portion of Econ 1051 was a breeze. While she occasionally rushes through lectures, she's insightful and incredibly helpful, both in and out of the classroom. I look forward to taking a class with her again, if the opportunity presents itself. She and her co-instructor Dr. Chikhladze complement each other well.",1
"If you attend and pay attention on his lecture, you'll find no trouble of getting through the course. All of his lectures are 95% base on real life experience and text book use is very minor except for some necessary table requires to do home works. Otherwise, study all his notes and pass the class just a piece of cake.",1
"He is generally a great teacher. He is good at teaching, helpful, and he knows his staff. On the other hand, he is also an easy marker. So basically, you learn a lot from his class and achieve a high grade at the same time. It just can't get any better than this~",1
"Jon is a God in the theatre department. Everybody worships him. However, he gives everyone the same grade (B+) regardless of input.",1
There's a lot of writing for this class for it not being a writing intensive class. It's hard to focus on when you are a full time student.,0
I've never been more frustrated in an online class.,0
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR; TURN BACK NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!  STAY AWAY!!  DO NOT ENTER!!!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,0
By far one of the worst professors I've ever had. Easy class yet I found myself having to bend over backward just to get an A. Marks you down for no reason. Creates her own grading criteria. I had to email her before every assignment to ask exactly what she was looking for us to do as she never follows the rubric that is provided. It was stressful.,0
Razzaghi does not know how to teach a class. Makes mistakes. Book is required but answers in the back are wrong. His tests are ridiculous to the point where he didnt count a quiz bc half the class failed it! He rushes in lectures and assigns homework we didnt even learn. He has no extra credit and takes 6-8-10 pts off of answers wrong.. DO NOT TAKE,0
"Sociology 16 was a breeze. Much of the material was informative and intuitive. The class atmosphere was okay. The class projects / presentations were easy, not a big deal. This is a college class. Caveat - if you don't study from the book, you'll most likely receive an C on the exams. Buddy-up with someone and you'll do fine",1
"Loved, loved the class. She is there for you, great lectures, would take her again. She is highly recommendable. Take her class.",1
"Really good professor who takes his time to explain anything youre struggling with. He tries to make time for group work, and is available outside of class times for additional help if needed. Can be pretty picky about notation on turned in assignments but nothing that cant be fixed. Gave worksheets before tests which were very helpful as well.",1
"Professor Donato is the worst professor I've ever had at Bentley or elsewhere. Most lectures in class end up not being related properly to assignments and exams. take home exams can take 6+ hours to complete, prompts for assignments are crazy vague, and he will give mediocre grades for exemplary work. Bad professor makes a good course bad DONT TAKE",0
"Just don't. She made the class WAY more difficult than what it should have been. She went on the most random tangents I've ever heard, fussed at a student who was two minutes late and told them not to knock on the door if they wanted to enter (I know right?), and was just overall a little off. A plus is that she was always available if you needed.",0
Ms. Jackson is THE BEST PROFESSOR AT GCC. I had a fear of taking this class but she really makes it easier and by the end you will become a better speaker. Her class is like one big family. I absolutely loved it. If you need com225 TAKE IT WITH MS JACKSON. you wont regrett it. Shes seriously one of the best teachers I've EVER had.,1
"Dr. Vutha is an amazing professor. He is very accessible outside lectures and genuinely cares about your success. Do the homework, utilize office hours to ask questions, and the class will go well, thanks to Dr. Vutha.",1
"TERRIBLE professor.  You must do all the readings or she wont even teach.  No one in the class ever read so you would keep skipping things.  Other people say she is good in other classes, but this one is horrible.  Never take this class.  She tests on the most random facts from the reading.  She is clearly the worst prof I've had at the U",0
"Granted, I'm already not that good at math, but I've always passed math classes with at least B's. This class is very online based. You have about 3 different types of online assignments. I missed 1 homework assignment online and my overall class average went from a 78 to a 53 and he wouldn't let me take it for a late grade. Good luck",0
"I loved the readings for this class and the paper assignments had a nice amount of freedom, often allowing students to choose between multiple readings. Feedback on papers was always extremely helpful and on point. Grading felt fair. Reading was manageable to light. Class discussions sadly got stale rather quickly and I wish there was more variety.",1
"I HATE her with a passion. All year i submitted my assignments through copy and paste in the drop box online. One time she asked for attachment and out of force of habit i copied and pasted. She said that my work was not worth reading because I didnt ""follow directions."" Hours of work on that assignment and I have a fat ZERO to show for it",0
"I am warning u all now....this class is not a joke. If u love Anthropology, then take it. She is very passionate and intelligent but there is TONS of work. Like way more than 300 levels. Tons and tons of useless work. Tough readings. Don't take unless u absolutely have to. U will regret it",0
"He is a really nice guy, but his accent truly makes understand everything difficult, its an easy A, but class is worse than watching paint dry",0
She was the best Biology teacher I have ever had. She had a way of really making things clear and interesting.,1
"Started to realize towards the end of the semester that her explanations for otherwise simple concepts were quite convoluted and confusing. Chem 206 also has one of the most tedious components ever devised for a course. Final exam did not reflect posted past finals, very unfair. Overall: brilliant prof who means well, but a frustrating class.",0
"Professor Stevens is a good prof.. He gives good informational lectures, and shows how the material presented is applicable to the industry. The class itself is going to be challenging regardless who you take. If you'd like good feedback and explanations, then he's your guy. He can be intimidating at times, but overall he cares about the students.",1
Pretty good prof.  Knows her stuff and tries to hold fairly deep dicussions in class.  Be ready to read for her b/c she assigns half a novel each week.  Tests are a joke b/c grading is very easy.  Take her if you can take 3 hour classes.  Sometimes boring,1
Difficult and confusing explantions.  Only 3 tests leave little room for error.,0
"Dr. Corsi is the absolute best! He discusses each books main themes in class that you need to know for the exam. Even though the class is pretty much an A if you go, it's still a great chance to discuss your views on Italian literature and have a good laugh.",1
Worst teacher I have ever had at Augusta State!!!! Does not teach!! All he talks about is football when he should be discussing math. The sample tests look NOTHING like the actual test!! I took him because this site said he was good!!He doesnt answer email and never has office hours!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU WANT TO FAIL!!!!!,0
"Hw is myPhysicsLab, each time u get a Q wrong, it decreases your %. He will drop for attendance. Class time consists of 90% group work, before it was 100% lecture. Also, you need to read the chapter and take a reading quiz before each class on canvas imo they're hard. I wish he would go over worksheets in class more. You can use equations on test!",0
"This woman is THE BEST teacher at JSU!!! She is only rude or blunt to you if you ask stupid questions or act up in class. I'm taking every possible class with her! There is a good bit of paperwork in this class, but it is very helpful and pretty easy. I loved this class and I love Mrs. Barclift!!!",1
he lost my paper and gave me a bad grade,0
"He teaches from PowerPoint slides, extremely monotone. Gives homework but its not mandatory. If you struggle with math, I wouldn't suggest this professor his style of teaching isn't a very effective one. Unfortunately if you go to Armstrong campus he's the only professor who teaches Survey of Calc.",0
"Mrs. McGee is THE best professor I have had! She gives great lectures, and despite the fact that she may go on tangents, they're typically some way or fashion related to her lecture, and if they aren't, they're great mood lighteners. She also does not require a textbook, and her tests and quizzes are directly from her lectures. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!",1
VERY VERY VERY hard. But a great teacher,1
"Nina is an absolute sweetheart and such a kind approachable human being, but she has this 'crazy lefty' side of her that I didn't like. She literally gave us an article that claimed New Caledonians are smarter than Europeans (idk who she's trolling with that one). She also sometimes spews political comments here and there, but overall, she's sweet.",1
"Athar is a great guy, but terrible teacher. I don't want to be mean, but his accent is very hard to understand. He just hands out packets in class and expects you to teach yourself. He answers questions, but doesn't explain answers. His reviews for the exams are also lackluster.",0
"One of the best teachers at the school.  Amazing discussions and interesting projects that are very doable.  Tests were all take home and straight from the readings and notes.  Great teacher, DEFINITELY TAKE HIM.",1
"He REALLY likes to ramble about lots of topics that have nothing to do with music. It was a lot of ""talking at you"". I was annoyed and didn't feel prepared for quizzes. I passed them because he posts the actual quiz on D2L for you to study from but really you can just memorize the answers. Hes real political and a ""attack/blame the government"" guy.",0
Worst online teacher. Im a 4.0 student and he grades DQs super hard.,0
I hated this professors teaching style the lectures do not help with the tests.Even reading the book didnt help on the test because the test had small details that you wouldnt think were important because they were not covered in class. The first day of class he told us not to complain to the head of the department because he wouldnt do anything.,0
I love Professor Allison so so dearly. I recently had him for EDUC230 and honestly it was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. You can tell he loves what he's doing and it makes class so enjoyable for everyone there. His little warm-ups are always super fun and adorable. Highly recommend him as a professor!,1
"I took a business law class, which is darn near as complex as the human body, and it wasnt nearly an awful experience as this class, from an online stand point. Tests have nothing to do with lecture material. 10+ homework assignments in a week plus a discussion forum. No real contact with teacher. dr.s note if you miss an assignment?!?",0
"She knows her material, but not how to teach or grade it. She grades on page space filled rather than quality of content with notes and will give normal scantron tests at home with confusing questions on material not covered in class at all.",0
"Prof Hasheminia is among the best Professors at SF-state. He knows what he talks about and clearly communicates the subject matter. If you want to do well in his class, you SHOULD NOT miss any lectures.",1
"Good teacher, helped with resume.  Classwork was not hard, tests were not easy but in all if you attend class and listen to the lectures you will pass the class.  He is a great teacher with a good heart.",1
She is very thorough in her teaching. I had her for writing and grammar and would love to take her for comp1. She really makes sure that you are prepared for comp1 english. She is very interactive in class lots of group exercises that are very helpful with learning writing and grammar!,1
"DO not take her online course. You have to buy an expensive, confusing online textbook to use for the 100 question midterm and final. Wasn't helpful when I emailed questions, wouldn't take again.",0
"Great, Great Teacher. The Comp sci dept is the best. KC is easy going and fun to be with. sometimes she gets a little over the top but you leard to deal with it. She loves everybody and will take walk ins anytime of the day in her office.",1
He is the best professor at ONU.  I love Prof. Gerber!,1
"This class was good to fill core requirements and boost GPA. no attendance taken in lectures. slides are posted online so you don't really have to go to class, only drawback is the videos he plays in some lectures which are important for tests and response papers. ",1
"she requires many books that you have to order online because some are not available in book stores. Although i highly recommend to not buy all books she does not even use them, also her syllabus was not clear on her grading, i got a 74 and she gave me a D which dropped my GPA by a lot unfortunately. I thought as all professors a D was 69 or 70",0
"Do not take him if you would like to learn anything about Java. Although coding experience is not required for CIS 162, the only people in class who had any idea what was going on were those already familiar with programming. Although he encourages collaborating on projects (making it easy to share code) that doesnt help during exams.",0
"May be a former department chair and may have experience, but he was not a helpful professor. First day of class, he did not mention computers as his interests, and his lectures were really vague. His slides were not specific, did not have any real terms or code, and he had analogies and examples that made the concepts harder to understand.",0
"Nice, funny, super interesting lectures, but exams are a total guessing game.  However, everyone is pretty lost and he does his own sort of curve.  The project is extremely tedious and kind of disorganized. His disorganization is what makes it difficult, not the material.",0
He is a good lecturer and is well-suited to teach the course material,1
"This course doesn't need to be this difficult! She complicates everything she covered in class. Yes, there's a seating chart with assigned seats. Everything about her and her class was over the top hard. Take this class with someone else at another school. The math department at UNT is awful and rude.",0
"Professor Sulfaro is one of the nicest people I have ever met, however it does not make up for her abilities as a professor. I worked extremely hard in this class and I would say I am a good student and it was a MIRACLE I got a B in the class. Her lectures are so boring and there are not many grades in the class. Take a different professor.",0
not so great,0
"You can be the best student and study hard, and youll probably still fail the tests and quizzes. He puts random things on there, some irrelevant, some not even learned. At that point you have to give a lucky guess. He has a major attitude and hes not engaged and helpful with students. Avoid is possible, youll save yourself a ton of stress.",0
He's a really nice guy but doesn't always seem to understand questions.  Homework is minimal.,1
"Incredibly easy class with clear cut grading criteria! Amazing and clear lectures: there were 8 lectures coupled with a quiz, 3 assignments that had to be done with a partner, and 1 midterm and 1 final. She provided a study guide for both exams and the week before she holds a review. I would take her again and highly recommend her to anyone!",1
"One frustrating thing about the class is he takes off points for absences. Class content is easy. The exams are a little hard to study for because there is no study guide and questions are open-ended. But if you don't get an A, it's your own fault.",1
Dr. Ponce is an amazing woman!  She is a great counselor and cares about her students!  She will motivate and help you achieve your dreams.,1
"You learn more in your sleep than you do in this class. This man doesn't know what is on his homework, and can barely do it. Expect to correct him at least three times a class on how to do middle school algebra. Spends most the lecture telling you how the equation originated and not how to do the homework.",0
"Mr. Solmon is a good professor. Show up early for class, he closes the door at the time class is supposed to start. Do your work and pay attention. He is a very intelligent man and is willing to help if you show that you care. I am taking him for MATH 1830 next semester.",1
Went over everything in class. Had many homework assignments and each were 5 problems. Gave study guides.,1
Mr. Horan is a starigh OG. Says what he wants and teaches you everything,1
"Worst professor I've ever had; doesn't know how to teach; you will learn nothing from him. Just stands in front of the class and mumbles incrompehensibly. The class is so useless; less than 20 usually show up out of 140. He is also very mean and not willing to help students either. If you have to take this class, please find a different professor.",0
"He's a very decent teacher, but..
 When the class did well on a test, he made the next one harder to ""challenge"" us. Thanks man.
 And he applied baseball cards as an analogy for accounting to computer programmers. This caused some confusion and many blank stares.",1
"He's a stand-up comedian (hillarious), and has a genuine love and knowledge of literature. He is obsessed with Virginia Woolf and should be considered a Woolf (if not Bloomsbury) expert! If you don't enjoy prof. P's class, check your pulse.",1
"Dr. Ramey is a very good lecturer and really knows his stuff. He doesn't say attendance is mandatory but you have in-class assignment every class for credit. Show up, do the readings, and study the night before each test and you should get an A. Highly recommended.",1
He gives extra credit but its so minuscule that it doesn't help. His lectures are confusing and hard to follow. He gets confused doing his own practice problems.,0
"Essay prompts are pretty ridiculous but not impossible to get done. In-class presentations do not help in any way, but she seems to think they do. Journal Entries aren't entirely difficult, just a waste of time and unnecessary. Not bad, but I would NEVER take her class again. Terrible teacher.",0
if you can't make it because you didn't even try.,1
Best professor and extremely helpful in all areas of the courses he teaches. He specializes in ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENT so if you are looking for something other than this obviously you go to someone who specializes in that subject area.,1
Tammy is such a sweet and fun teacher! Attendance was mandatory but the classes were fun and easy. Tests were done in groups and there were assignments due Tuesdays and Thursdays based on the chapters that were discussed in class groups but they were the same 5 questions. ,1
"Hands down one of the best Profs at CCNY. Her lectures are amazing and she really tried her best to make sure every student understood the material. Go to her office hours because it's really helpful. She gave amazing feedback on my essays, which further enabled me to do better on any other upcoming essay. I highly recommend you take her!",1
"Was a decent prof, however, was very easily distracted during lectures.  Says ""Um"" alot which can be annoying.  Moderate effort will get you a B.  Labs are an easy A if your TA is not a tightwad. Homework is an easy A if you know how to use Google.  Tests require synthesis of knowledge, not discussion of knowledge taught in class.",0
"He said he was retiring. Not too bad, just ended up with multiple things to work on at once. Can have an online quiz and reading, a paper, and research for another project all going at once for just one class.",1
"This is an amazing class and Paul Young is an amazing professor. He is funny and keeps class engaging. He gives class time to letting students get to know each other and network which is awesome. He teaches so much useful information in class that makes you feel so smart about the music industry. Loved this class, 10/10 would recommend.",1
"He is super smart and this class is very difficult regardless of the professor, however Dr. Norris might have given the most fair exams I have ever experienced The study guides are KEY fill them out email them to him & you will pass this class with a good grade. Go to class. Go to office hours, ask him what it is he wants! Don't buy the book",1
She is awesome! :],1
"Had her when she was at UIC. Yes, she is beautiful. I hope she reads this. But, she is a wonderful teacher. Brilliant. Loves sour skittles, and i think martinis or cosmos. And cheese. Ask her about the kid who wrote about Ovaltine. :) Highly reccomend. This chik can really teach!",1
"If you're really good at grammar and writing, it's an easy A as long as you do everything assigned. Her lectures are very drawn out and she takes up most of the class time going over the textbook which she expects you to read and prepare for before class.",1
"I hope that someone reports this guy, he shouldn't be aloud to teach with the way he talk to his students.",0
Class was terrible he gave way to much work for a unv seminar,0
"Great modern dance class! Have to show up and try, but a lot of fun! Looked forward to every class.",1
This class is based on a workbook that Professor Garland made herself. It is basically a lot of reflection work so I don't feel that it was a difficult class at all.,1
This professor is very nice and professional. He goes over many homework problems which is great but sometimes skips some of the work or doesn't explain what he did so students ask many questions and sometimes leaving us confused. The material is hard as it is already but he does offer help outside of class. He also curves the grade that helps alot,0
I enjoyed this class very much! I am going to take ENG 112 next semester. If you need to take ENG 111 BLANKENSHIP IS A MUST. Helps students when asked questions. Provides great feedback on essays. Midterm is a research paper that you do in two class periods and is there to assist. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (:,1
"Might be a tough subject, but he teaches it pretty well.  A straight forward guy.",1
Really a good teacher that challenges you to put your best foot forward even though I made a D. I think Mrs. Elise is a great teacher my problem was timing on the exit exam I struggled and I'm still struggling,1
Her bb page is atrocious to navigate. All assignments given are quizzes. Videos of instruction on class outdated And of terrible quality. No makeups. Extremely harsh at grading. Ive spent weeks studying and she will still mark down the slightest errors. I put more time into this class just to get nothing for grades. Many students also did poorly.,0
"This instructor is terrible.  She expects you to know everything, which is impossible.  Print outs are useless because they only list general terms with no information so you never know what your surposed know. Has good intentions, but not a good teachers.  Lots of essay questions, be prepared if taking this class.",0
"Oh my god, never dealt with such a arrogant human being in my life, avoid at all cost..",0
"He's pretty redundant. Not much of a help, pretty much just a burned out bum.",0
Prof Welsh's course was one of the most enjoyable  I have ever taken.His interesting and well presented  lectures  made it easy to remember the material. His tests were not difficult  at all. He is also  a fair grader.,1
I definitely do NOT reccomend this professor. his quizzes had nothing to do with the material learned in class and his loud teaching style makes it hard to comprehend,0
I'll honestly never take a class with this professor again. She is rude and if you ever correct her so other students don't get behind from the mistake... she gets super hateful. And if you opt out of training sessions (even when she says that's ok) she will ridicule you because you didn't go if you get one thing wrong. The work load wasn't bad tho,0
"If you aren't majoring in Stats, and it comes easily to you, or even if you like teaching yourself, Prof. Jinn is fine. He's (sorta not really) funny, and there isn't much work. If you need to use Stats anytime after 215 however, I would NOT take this professor",0
"His tests are tough, make sure you really study. His lectures contained a lot of material, and were live one day and recorded the other of the week. He took forever to respond to emails with questions. His weekly homework assignments were challenging. The lab reports are challenging, make sure you get a good group.",0
"Cool, funny guy. Very willing to help. Might have to do one presentation about a recent art movement. Tests are pretty easy: multiple choice; plus, there is a section that requires identification of famous art pieces. Pay attention to lectures slides because he makes the class fun with informational videos. Knowledgeable of modern art scene",1
"Dr. Vivian is tough yet, passionate about what she teaches. Her tests are really difficult so you really have to read those textbooks. Overall, fair Prof.",1
"Great guy. Wants you to learn and comprehend the material, not just memorize. His lectures are pretty funny and entertaining. He made me like Chemistry!!",1
Expects you to know everything. Difficult to understand and knows most of the class does not get it and still does not try to make us understand. If asked a question he will only repeat himself and make you look dumb. Horrible Prof.,0
"class was hard because homework was all online so he doesnt even grade anything. 3 chances online to get it right but if you have no clue as to what you are doing wrong then you cant get it right and there is no partial credit. terrible class terrible teacher, I even had a tutor and went to him for extra help and he gave me a D. terrible professor!",0
Her class is only graded by 3 things. Awful grader even if you go to office hours. Avoid at all costs,0
"MA structures this class in a way that if you want a good grade, it will consume your entire semester. I can't think of the last time I wasn't swamped and worried about what accounting homework I should be doing. She makes things seem more complicated than they are because she knows the material so well. Expect at least 20 hours of homework a week.",0
She is absolutely horrible. Very unclear on what she would like done. Also very rude. She waits till last minute to tell you exactly what you need done. Would not recommend taking her class!,0
She is awesome !!,1
Great guy! He was really excited about the readings and you could tell he loved what he was doing which made the class fun. I would highly recommend taking his class!,1
"first day of class when i walked in and saw her i thought to myself ""oh man she looks like one of those crazy mean strict professors"" but i was totally wrong. Although the class can be hard and there's a lot of homework, she makes the class fun and before you even know it its time to get out.",1
"Gives an outline each class with underlined terms. On the exam, there will be an essay (100 pts) and 8 ID's  (underlined terms from outlines) & you need to choose 4/8 to elaborate on (100 pts) These 8 ID's could be any of the 40-50 terms from the outlines. Miss notes? you won't have enough info on ID's. Doesnt give any clues which ID's are on exam.",0
Tough grader!,0
Worst teacher ever. does not teach or help you. highly recommend a different teacher,0
"This is the worst professor ever. I have never had so many assignments for one course, and they are all due at the same time, they aren't spread out. She will tell you to use tons of sources while also telling you to make up info. She never grades and then gets behind.  And once she gets to it she's a crazy hard grader. Never ever take this class.",0
"Blake goes out of the way to make sure his students succeed, always willing to work with students if he sees that you are putting in the effort. It's okay to miss a day or two, but if you slack off for a while it will take a lot of work to catch back up. Good lectures and a great instructor. Definitely recommend taking him at least once.",1
"Dude's a walking meme, love it.",1
"Incredible teacher, doesn't take any crap from students but expects great things of his students. attendance not mandatory but if you miss lectures it's gonna be rough. Curves heavily, tests are fairly specific. Holds office hours on weekends which really shows he goes the extra mile. Humorous lecturer.",1
"No textbook! Let me just say, this guy doesn't have a negative bone in his body. (At least in a classroom environment) He is light-hearted, energetic, and truly cares. He presents problems in a way that actually has use in real life. I always dreaded conversions, however, we tackled the subject within the first week! Bro. Relieved my math anxiety!!",1
Good class. The lecture part was interesting. Can be a hard grader but fair. Always willing to help.,1
"She's just alright. The class isn't that hard, but she's not the greatest teacher. All she does is read off her powerpoint and doesn't teach very well. The case studies are pointless, but not that hard. I didn't learn very much from this class.",0
"If there's one piece of advice I could give anyone it would be to NEVER take this professor. I went to tutors and learned through them, however he gave me no credit on several problems because they weren't his way and he doesn't give partial credit on anything! Unless you're a genius in calc do not take him, he isn't worth the stress.",0
"HARD teacher b/c hes hard to understand, if u ask him a question, he answers it, but ur still left wondering what the heck he just said, he does smile occasionally,but OCCASIONALLY. I know somewhere down hes a reall nice guy im sure. if u take his lab, u have to know everything, same with his exams, KNOW EVERYTHING, hes been teaching for a while no",0
"I had him for I.O. This is a class you must take notes for. He is hard but very clear on what he wants, and will help you.",1
"She really thinks she is an intellectual, and will hold it over anyone who doesn't meet her standards. Snobby and unpleasant to learn from. Demeaning. She needs to work on her personal issues and know when to leave them at the door. There are better teachers at BCC.",0
"In this class all, we have to do too many papers. The outlines are not well explained enough and I hate the fact that he believes his course is adequate. As a whole, it is amazing to have an Indigenous member as a prof, but I think the course needs to be updated just a bit!",0
Didn't help! she expected us to know everything overnight,0
"Well, I have been in VC for 5 semesters but I have never rated any professor but this time she made me do it because she is not a good professor as I was told about her. I will never take with her again, also I don't recommend anyone to take with her unless (if you want to work harder than your ability to expect a grade b or maybe less).",0
"Madame Celli is the best french teacher that I have ever had. She is engaging, makes learning fun, challenges you, and is genuinely one of the nicest people. You can tell that she cares about her students a great deal. I recommend taking any class that you can with her!",1
"On reviews of your stories, tears you a new **** with criticisim, then doesn't tell you how to fix problems.",0
"Great Class, Great Professor",1
"He is old school. He is very personable, but not the best instructor. His test are ridiculously hard, but he grades on such a steep curve that I received a 100% on a test that I missed over 25 questions. I learned enough about the economy to say it wasn't a waste to attend his classes. I would recommend him.",0
This teacher should retire.  It is almost as if she doesn't really like students. Checking off with her in lab was painful. Very frustrating and unnecessarily unkind.,0
"Great Teacher! I loved his class! Straight forward with you and plays no tricks on tests and quizzes. Study your notes because his tests and quizzes comes right from them, you dont really use the textbook at all.  Overall, good class, just stay on top of your work and youll be good to go!",1
great sensei,1
"Dr. Fein is a knowledgeable professor who really wants his students to learn. However, he has very high expectations, and he can be too demanding sometimes.",1
"She is very strict with her grading on the homework assignments, so even minor errors can drop your score significantly. Her lectures were all PowerPoints and she didnt really explain how to actually code a program very well. Labs often took way longer than expected, and required work outside of class.",0
My discussion section's gpa average was around 2.6 and it's not even organic chemistry yet. She definitely needs learn when to curve,0
"Don't recommend. Since it is a one credit class, it contains too much reading and there is a Final. Besides, the Lecture is too long that it lasts  for about 3 hours, and on SUNDAY!",0
"Kathy was a great professor. In class, we discussed real-life topics that were relevant and interesting. There were quite a few assignments and quizzes along with journals due every few weeks all of which were very easy. It doesn't matter if you miss a few things because she offers tons of extra credit and points just for showing up to class.",1
Dr. Bellantoni is clearly passionate about the subject of Anthropology and it is shown in his lectures. Many found his lectures to be very inspiring and on multiple occasions we clapped at the end of a lecture. The tests are not too hard as long as you study the powerpoints and reading materials.,1
She is an easy teacher and entertaining. She posts all her power points and gives study guides for tests. If you use those you will do well on tests.  You have to come to class because she does in class assignments that you can't make up if you're not there.   If you're looking for an easy class this is a good one.,1
"Good teacher, Can get boring, But that's any teacher. Online quizzes don't forget them, they are worth 150points you have 4 tests, he follows the syllabus to a tee.",1
She is nice enough but does not explain things well and talks down to you. This is a hard enough class so the professor should be able to explain things clearly so that everyone can understand and has a chance to do well.,0
"Simha is very knowledgeable about SAP and really cares about his students. His class consists of lecture (50+ powerpoint slides/lecture), bi-weekly quizzes (Low weight doesn't affect grade too much), SAP configuration assignments (walks you through step by step), and a final exam (take home) where you have to fix config. errors in the system.",1
My first semester at Wayne State and Professor Reyes was so far one of the best professors Ive had yet.,1
"Probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken. You get discussion assignments per chapter, along with quizzes per chapter. Quizzes are straight forward. We had 2 groups projects, 2 major exams worth 100pts each, again pretty easy and straightforward. She gives feedback on assignments which is great because it allows you to correct any mistakes.",1
"STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY! She is THE most disorganized professor I've ever had. It is currently November & she has yet to grade a SINGLE paper or discussion board post for the ENTIRE semester. Last week's REQUIRED reading totaled 170 pgs, yet the syllabus (which she's changed 3 times) says to only expect 50 pgs a week. She's so out of touch.",0
"The BEST hands down!! Take her class, don't take anyone else, unless her class is full, better yet, wait for her class to be open. She is great & a breeze!!!! Take this online if you can. She is amazing! Easy A",1
Dr hauck was very clear in lecture and encouraged interactions outside of class in group sessions (even on Sunday afternoons). An A is very very possibly with Dr Hauck if you review notes outside of class before quizzes and exams.,1
Bender is far too intelligent to be teaching this easy level of a class. He thinks that the students will all understand the material at the same capacity he understands it and uses examples that are completely irrelevant to the concepts being learned. The lectures are all over the place and it is hard to keep track of what he is teaching when.,0
You should not take HUMAN101 as an online course because you will not have enough time to absorb the material covered. La-turner had no problem letting the students know that he did not like teaching this class online. I think if I had of physically attended the lectures I would've enjoyed it.,0
If you have her as your prof please drop that course. It's the best advice I can give you. The midterm avg for our whole class was below 50%,0
"He was fun, entertaining, and kept the class interested. He was also incredibly helpful to those who struggled. He even took the entire class out to dinner for study time, in preparation to the final exam. That was the best, because everyone felt at ease to ask questions. He is a great teacher.",1
"He is extremely rude, and does not show any intent of having the students best interests. He does not answer questions in any helpful manor. He even snapped at students during the semester, raised his voice multiple times, and is generally an unwelcoming professor. He was the only one available so I had no choice unfortunately.",0
"Wonderful teacher! She takes attendance, but you have 4 skips. There is homework every night, but takes less than 20 minutes to do. She gives a lot of partial credit, which really helps your grade. Tests are pretty easy as long as you study. She was very friendly and lectures were very active and not boring.",1
"By far one of the best profs I've had. MUST GO TO LECTURE. Everything that he goes through in his lecture is important and it will show up on tests. The lab portion is like a free 15% so make sure to go to lab and work hard on your poster. His slides are mostly pictures and few words, make sure to write down what he says. no textbook ",1
He is a great guy. He is class is super easy but this is not enough! If you want to learn something from his class you need to read the book by yourself.,1
"I didn't think I would like Philosophy, but this prof. made each lecture quite interesting. He assigns a one page essay every week (which you only have to do 8 total throughout the semester) and gives you 2 chances to turn one in each week. There's only a midterm and final exam and he gives you a study guide for both. I enjoyed this class a lot.",1
LOVED HIM! he is hilarious and tells you things that just make you drop your jaw by how funny it is. Makes class fun and helps out as much as you need him to. Very great teacher!,1
"Professor Bowlin is the laziest teacher ive ever had. She hasnt taught us anything in class, she just has the students continually present powerpoints to do her job for her. In the other class i have with her, she just sits on the podium and reads from the book the whole class while she told us to buy it cause we ""need it"" I would avoid her",0
"He is a good prof and he is very passionate about the subject, the Baby Human series he showed in the class was hilarious. The assigned reading was too long and I think the TA was not fair in grading the papers, I almost spent 30 hours on the last paper and got a B-! I guess he is not going to teach any classes any more.",0
I wouldn't recommend her. she's a hard grader & doesn't exactly explain the prompts much. class is mandatory & one time I was late by 5mins & she counted me absent. I was annoyed about it because I really was trying & I always showed up to class. it was a flex so you were only able to miss twice. she's not very understanding & cancels class a lot.,1
"History has always been my worst subject but Wells makes me love it!! He is super cool and laid back. He repeats what he says so you have enough time to write things down. He cares about your grades. He will work with you. He is so kind. I would take him over and over again if I could. The test comes from the notes, no tricks.",1
"Father Ranieri cares for his students and is incredibly knowledgeable. He isn't the toughest grader in the world, but make sure you put meaningful though and effort into your work.",1
"Doesn't really tolerate excuses, even if they're beyond student control, like internet connectivity. Quizzes are okay if you do the readings but lectures are long and boring. During online lecture, a student's mic accidentally turned on and the professor became irrationally angry and waited for the student to explain themselves. Just avoid.",0
This class was one of the most disorganized classes I have ever been in.  She tells you one thing and does another or marks in another way.  I don't recomend this class to anyone.,0
horrible.,0
"I'm an easy student, homework and essays don't bother me. Most of his reviews state that his class is lecture based so if you pay attention you'll be fine. So I'm not really sure why he did not make a single lecture or even a PowerPoint for our online class due to Covid. Simply did not teach and was condescending with all feedback.",0
"His slides are pretty heavy, lots of information on them will be needed for your final project! He has pop quizzes at least once a week and takes attendance that will have an affect on your final grade. His grading rubric is very complicated to understand, make sure to go over it multiple times before starting your papers. Also strict on grammar.",1
"His lecture exams are horrible each multiple choice question is 3 pts so if you get 3 wrong you are already 90%  I am really disappointed taking his class I just did not have any choice he was the only one listed for bio 242. Boring lectures not helpful for exams. His study guide is useless, don't spend your money and time.",0
Professor Henderson is very monotone during lectures and does not put any lectures on blackboard. He only gives an outline for topics that will be on the exams and the exams are all application based. Exams are very hard to study for unless you go see him personally or see one of his assistants.,0
"I took Hollist for Contemporary World Literature and I loved it. As long as you are willing to work hard and participate in class, you will learn a lot. We had to read 5 novels throughout the semester, so it is essential to budget your time. Hollist is very intelligent and our class discussions were always compelling. Highly recommended.",1
"She did not know how to use the software. I would have been better off taking this class online. I have 7+ years experience with Photoshop, and even when I completed an assignment in it's entirety, following every direction to a T, I would get an 8 /10 sometimes. I think she disliked me because the class met twice a week and I would only attend one",0
She's fantastic!!!! She's always there to help with anything!,1
"I would not recommend taking Veenstra as a photo teacher, despite her experience in NY she always brags about. Very unorganized, takes the entire class time (3 hours) to explain one thing, and you will not receive a SINGLE grade until the end of the semester. I would find another prof for photo, unless you want to be confused the whole semester.",0
She helped me a lot on my papers out of class.  I learned a lot from the comments on my papers.,1
"Renee Curry was an amazing professor. She is a very personable, and it is clear that she loves what she teaches. Weekly quizzes on the readings are standard, they are not that difficult. Offers plenty of opportunities for extra credit in class so if you skip you may miss out. Only five writing assignments total, which are all pretty simple.",1
"Care about your GPA? Don't take professor Haidar's class. He grades awfully, it is his way or the highway. There were many occasions where I or my peers would get a correct answer and show work, but he didn't like it, so he marked it wrong. He knows the material, just doesn't know how to teach or communicate concepts to the students.",0
"Easily the worst professor I've had. Doesnt explain things well, just monologues without making much sense. Class is dependent on doing well on the 3 tests, with homework barely making any contribution to your grade. Teaches straight out of powerpoint, rarely taking time to do problems on the board. Youtube is more helpful than going to class",0
Prof. Burg is so sweet and kind. She truly wants her students to do well. Get to know her and visit her outside of class. Must study for exams cause they are not easy.,1
"The reading is interesting, but Professor Blumreich goes off topic a lot. She wants participation but leaves very little room for it. She talks a lot about Christianity and assumes everyone in class is Christian/was Christian at some point. I dont know anything about Jesus, can we talk about the reading? She seems nice, but class is frustrating.",1
"I took archaeology out of a general interest for the field and prof. brown didnt disappoint, he does alot of full class lectures but keeps them interesting using physical as well as digital examples and honestly I never fell asleep in his class so they must've been interesting lectures. I would definitely take another ANT class again and recommend.",1
"Dr. Wells is a pretty awesome dude. He is a very smart professor, funny and quirky, and dedicated to teaching. He tells you everything you will learn at the beginning of the semester, and by the end you just have to prove you've learned it with a portfolio of work. I'm not normally good at math, but Dr. Wells made it enjoyable and I learned a ton.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN HE IS BY THE FAR WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER TAKEN,0
WOULD NOT recommend Eric.,0
The group project for this class is very time consuming. That's just the way it's run for everyone though. He's a very good professor and a pretty funny guy.,1
"He does a good job, is helpful, and easy to get along with.  He expects the students to carry their own wieght.  I guess that must make him bad.",1
"Awesome, awesome, awesome teacher. She's super knowledgeable and encouraging. Just be sure to only take her classes (or any language classes, for that matter) if you are completely dedicated from day 1!",1
Ever have that teacher that thought that they were an english major even though they literally knew nothing? Ever have a teacher that tries to make a class that is completely useless seem important? Well this is exhibit A. ,0
"I've never had a problem in math until I took him. He doesn't answer emails, and like many have said, very vague and passive-aggressive when you ask for help. He requires way too much for a 100 level math. You have online quizzes and homework, tests every couple of weeks, worksheets, and SLOs. Should be a 4 credit class. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"Complete space case.  If you want to learn, don't choose this professor...",0
"""Tests are tough"" is the understatement of the year. This prof calls on you in class when you don't raise your hand and when you're visibly struggling to find the answer. Her lectures are unhelpful, her tests are impossible, and she expects everyone to understand the material before even learning it. Going to ask her for help is a nightmare. Awful.",0
"keeps no records, will screw you over if your not his favorite",0
"Awesome professor and warm individual inside and outside of class.  If you make the effort to get to know him it will mean wonders to your outlook as a developing scientist.  DO come to class, DO ask questions, and DO attend the student lead study sessions.  They help a mil for exams.",1
"Aced the class, but he's a terrible teacher. You don't learn anything. The class is basically one big tangent, and the grading is a bit random too. Got a perfect score on the final w/ spark notes.",0
Dr. Henderson-King was one of my favorite profs at GV and I think her capstone is the best! The reading is totally doable and she even leaves 1 whole month dedicated to the students picking their own material. Her capstone theme is totally relevant and I learned the most in this class than any other at GV! She is super flexible and caring.,1
"Amusing British accent, makes odd/funny comments.  Text really not needed.  Big curve for tests, but they are pretty tough.  Very willing to go through anything in office hours, does not treat you like an idiot if you do not know something.",1
"Professor Xing is a great professor. Organic chemistry is a tough subject, however it didn't seem as bad as people say. If you pay attention in class, study, and do the homework assignments, you will do well in the course. You should definitely take her. ",1
"The absolute worst professor I have ever encountered. Granted I got a A in the course, she would change due dates left and right! She also would just randomly cancel class. One of my biggest peeves was how I sent her an email 1 week into the semester, and I received a reply two whole months late (sometimes i wouldn't' receive a reply at all).",0
"This professor is by far the worst human I have come across in my 19 years on this planet. She has no teaching ability and I am fairly certain I learn more in my sleep than I do in her lectures. She docks marks for memorizing the information because she wants you to ""think deeper."" Justifies giving marks like 5.332. Please UBC, find a new professor",0
"Easy class to get an A in, however, she is extremely unclear in every single assignment she gives. Only have to write two papers the entire semester, but one of them is a group research paper which sucked. She is very wishy washy, and boring, try and get a different professor.",0
"AMAZING! Explains topics in simple terms and is willing to repeat for the class. He is SO very helpful if there are personal concerns and generally wants to see each and every student succeed. His exams are fair and although the subject matter is bland, he keeps lectures engaging and light! TAKE HIM YOU WON'T REGRET IT",1
"The study guide for the final had 68 terms & 16 of them were on the final and we had to choose 12 to give ""short answer"" on, being 3-5 sentences! Knowing who, what, where, when, why, and historical significance. Only 15 of the terms were on the exam, one of them being a term that was not on the study guide. There are no way to know grades thru enti",0
"I originally took this class to make sure I wouldn't fall below full-time student status. I was glad I did. She made food almost every week. We would have occasional guest speakers who were interesting. The readings she gave were a little dry, but also captivating once you got into them. Easy fun class.",1
Paul is HILARIOUS! but his teaching could do some work... He is an amazing person but isn't very clear when describing the projects and giving you help..,0
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!!  I am a straight ""A student who is struggling to keep my grade up.  He has a 1 week, three assignments rule, original posts must be made within 3 days plus 3 additional on 3 separate days will give you a 79/100 he expects you to go above the ""required"" in order to get a good grade.  I emailed and got a rude response.",0
"Lots of homework. Curves heavily. Didn't finish parts 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b of the project and bombed the midterm and final leaving me with a 62% but I still snuck in with a C. Would def take again",1
This professor is not truly professor I think she bought her degree. She avoids teaching because she does not know. I think she is getting old and start losing her mind but she still comes to FGCU. Avoid this old hag and take it with someone else,0
"I took Stats after being out of school for 10 years almost. Mr. huff does an amazing job of explaining the material and spending the time needed to see others succeed. Study is necessary, but he gives you all the tools you need! Great professor! Highly recommend.",1
"Don't waste your money or time, unless you can  teach yourself or have help at home. He doesn't answer your questions when being asked. The only thing I did like is that the test were the same as the  homework.",0
"Better than most of the other psychology professors at GV. She offers help in class and out. You have to read for every exam, but she helps by highlighting the important points in her power points. She is always clear about what is going to be on the test. She sweet funny and wants you to do well. Keeps things interesting ",1
she is passionate about sociology but it was difficult to share any opinion that wasn't what we were supposed to think. i got through it fine but wish we had the chance to be open in the classroom with different opinions.,0
"Dr Lorimer is incredibly sharp. The Museum Methods class may seem like an easy A, but she pushes you to go beyond the minimum effort. ",1
"Life-changing.  Hegel can make even the most astute students want to tear their hair out.  Professor Holt makes Hegel not only understandable but enjoyable.  His proficiency in German Idealism is remarkable considering his age, and his teaching method is very Socratic and thorough.  A must for any student of philosophy - highly recommended!",1
"funny guy, easy grader, answers all of your questions, sometimes struggles with technology but he is old haha, if you take notes and pay attention in class his tests are a breeze, always gives you a week for the take home test and an extra page of notes for tests, take home test is very similar to the in-class test, definitely recommend to others!!",1
"Dr. Costanza taught a hybrid course this semester. Overall the class went well. There were pretty much 2 assignments each week, which were not too difficult: Posting on the discussion board/replying to 2 other students and taking an open note/book quiz. The quiz questions come straight off the Powerpoint slides and the discussion questions. Easy.",1
"Poor communicator.Lectures in a very dull way using clips from dated,uninteresting films. Participation makes up 24% of the overall grade for the class yet Kuefler provides no focus for discussion merely asking the class for ""thoughts"".Kuefler has also accused a student of using their phone in class when they were not and didn't admit his error.",0
"The tests are very detail intensive and a little bit ridiculous to study for, but if you put in the right amount of effort, you can get the grade you want.  You do actually have to try, but reading isn't crucial. Really interesting class, but you definitely have to try. Gives extra credit, but not worth a lot.",1
"Take this class and you'll be sorry. He pulls up the book online, throws it up on the projector, and reads directly out of it for the whole class period. While he's doing that he explains how the book is meant for mathematicians, not students. His grading system seems completely random and will give you 0 on a question almost randomly. Do not take.",0
"Very nice guy, cares about students and wants to teach. Lots of reading but they're well picked for what the lectures are about. Tests aren't bad. He'll really encourage participation. Great choice for an introductory class",1
"He is a terrible professor. He's too caught up in all of the other things he does on campus to give a care about his actual classes. His material doesn't flow class to class, and his questions on exams don't come from lecture or book. Plus he left the country during finals week. Very frustrating professor.",0
This is a great class all you have to do is be involved and you will actually enjoy it and good results,1
"If you take this class, you better be prepared to spend around half of class every day practicing speaking Japanese out loud with other students. Participation is expected, and it greatly pays off.",1
"P.D.J. is terrible, he screwed up my grade and gave me a C when i had earned an A and after 3 months he finally returned an email saying he had changed it, overall this class has very little, if anything to do with engineering and makes me wonder how this was even a class, he didnt even know what we were going to do in our sylabus, steer clear!",0
"She's really nice, I took Women's studies with her. Keep in mind, you have to do lots of reading and writing...",1
Its very hard to get an A on his essays even a B. He takes attendance everyday. He's a very nice prof very caring.,1
TBH students should get paid for taking this class. Class is boring and tests are hard.,0
"Exams are very tricky. The ""study questions"" in the slideshows don't help very much and have almost nothing to do with the exams.",0
"Very easy going, but that could be bad if you are not able to keep up with material.  Good lectures but poor in practice.  Regardless, I was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time.",0
clearly he is writing his own feedback on here. sitting in front won't help. going to innovation lab or slc was only way I could understand it. not helpful. kept saying right... like everyone one understood what he head just said and the room sat there confused and shaking heads as he kept talking... get ready to hear him talk nonstop...,0
"Doc can be a very confusing professor because he teaches us information from his research findings that often varies from what you would find on the internet or in the textbook (he doesn't write his own book). For example, he told us the number of NCAA teams participating in D1 athletics, but both the textbook and the NCAA's website had different #",0
"For an online class , you have to understand that learning the material is entirely up to the student and how much time is committed to the class! With that being said, Stevens does EVERYTHING she needs to do for a student to pass! She has weekly discussion forums, weekly quizzes , she puts up many helpful videos. YOU MUST COMMIT LOTS OF HOURS !!",1
Hes really good at explaining the concepts so everyone understands. You have to show up for class other wise nothing will make sense. He does clicker questions everyday too. I really do like the way he teaches and he makes it easy to learn,1
He is an nice man but not a very talented in the teaching department.I learned very quickly just to read out of the book and to show up for Friday quizzes.that's right he does a quiz every Friday and they don't help on the test. All in all you are stuck taking him for organic because oc only offers him.,0
a lot of group work,1
"His class is very easy if you show up and look over your notes at least once. He is a very good, straightforward teacher. He doesn't hand out A's, but it is not hard to get. We have quizzes every day in this class, but he drops the lowest 4. If you miss a class, you fall way too far behind to catch up without extra help. Perfect amount of homework.",1
Hard grader.  Often goes off on a tangent and wastes class time.  Would not recommend.,0
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
This class isnt hard but she gives essays back to back & grades tough.,0
This was by far the hardest class I have taken here at GV. She absolutely sucked as a professor. Her reading each night was way above our abilities with all our other school work. She didn't care that you were in other classes. She always had quizzes and expected too much out of you. I definitely would switch or drop her class if you have her.,0
"This class was created by Dr. Martin but the TA was the actual teacher. This class is first and foremost a statistics and economics class that has very little to do with sports. It's just the same math problems we hate put into the context of sports. If you love stats and econ, go for it. If you like sports, you might wanna steer clear.",0
She is an awesome professor who is always willing to help and who makes the class interesting.  She cares about her students and to such an extent that she reminds me of Ms. Honey from the book Matilda.,1
"Georgi was an unmotivational, unclear and dreadful instructor. He often got frustrated with the class when they did not understand lecture content. Practice Midterms are provided however, the level of difficulty is no where near the difficulty of the actual midterm. Therefore, students are blindsided as to what they need to prepare for. Avoid.",0
"Probably the worst professor I've ever had the pleasure of having for a lab. This is the type of teacher that will make people HATE the subject if they never took it. Labs are incredibly frustrating, with excessive amount of work both on and off lab times, and the plethora of typos in the worksheets doesn't help either. Do yourself a favor and SKIP",0
"She is one of the best online teachers had. It was my first online class so I was pretty nervous. But she made the online class a breeze! Her lectures are easy to sit through, and she gives good information. She is very helpful if you have questions, and is super nice! She knows her stuff, and is just an amazing prof all around. Take her!",1
"would rather take 3 classes of biology and do a ton of research papers than to take this teacher again, can't explain the material well enough and doesn't give tests that are relevant to the classes point of material covered, students beware...",0
"Martin Burg was the worst professor I have ever had at GVSU. He expected us to be all knowing and marked down everything he could. He told me I should study harder and spend more time studying when I went to him but I had a tutor, study group, and studied more than any other class. He only cares about his flies. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! He ruined me.",0
This professor will keep you entertained with his stories alone. He has many stories that pertain to what you're learning in class. Great professor!,1
DO NOT TAKE STARK! One of the worst professors I've ever had. Unwilling to help on papers which he expects way too much. He is rude and a narcissist.,0
"Mr. Ivey is a wonderful professor. i have taken many of his classes and have enjoyed them. I am not a math star by any means and I got an A in a math class with him as my instructor. He is funny, sarcastic, good sense of humor. He is very clear and concise. I will keep taking his classes till I cant anymore.",1
"Doesn't really reflect on the chapters, talks about life and situations but none of its on the test.",0
He is a rude person who uses words to hurt you if you don't understand the material making you feel dumb. when the course is very hard if you dont understand it with difficulty math involved. He slams his hands on tables and doesn't help you if you dont understand sometihng.,0
"I was very apprehensive about taking Dr. Sleem because I heard that he was very mean and hard.  I was very surprised because even though he wasn't easy, he was far from mean.  He was very helpful and patient.  You have to study to keep up.  Enjoyed his class.",1
Dr. E is definitely one of the best professors in the chemical engineering department. He's really laid back and extremely fair as far as grading is concerned. The textbooks for this class are a MUST so you'll know how to do the excel quizzes. He's the reason I stayed a chemical engineering major.,1
My conscious counter has definitely been increased from this class,1
DO NOT TAKE. She replies to concerns but Im warning you to not take this course with her. Honestly the hardest Ive ever taken and constantly felt stressed. Does not give you more time to finish work and does not give any considerations at all. Had to pay for 2 platforms which is really pricey! Just dont take it and do yourself a favor!,0
Lectures can get boring. He doesn't take attendances but gives pop quizzes sometimes. Gives study guides before exams. Exams aren't open-book so you actually have to study to ace. ,1
"Tanoukhi's lectures provide no clarity on the philosophical readings, and really neglect the assigned literature. Her slides are huge block quotes without page numbers--which she does not put online--and her exams are quote IDs of author, title and date. She also loves to waste class time with bizarre stretching or trying to learn names. ",0
"Mr. K was fantastic! You can tell he is passionate about art, drawing, and composition. His lectures are filled with rich descriptions of textures or moods to inspire us as we draw. His feedback is thoughtful, honest, and encouraging. If you are someone who's just there for the grade and you don't care about the spirit of art, he may annoy you.",1
"Took him for animal science, awesome instructor, very knowledgeable and funny. Kept lectures interesting.",1
"Terrible. All she does is go over the extensive reading in lecture, she's pretentious and the class is useless, no application to anything.",0
Roopa does not provide as much help as other professors do. She dont lecture enough and many students were failing/failed her course. Do not take her unless you want to fail.,0
"If you have an opportunity to take any other instructor for this course, do it at all costs.  Mr. Roberts doesn't respond to emails and if he does, he doesn't address your questions, forcing you to ask again.  He is of no help with questions about the content of the course.  I am a straight A student and this course about killed me.",0
Super dry and boring lectures. Must go to lectures however because she does not post slides and will test the specifics from lecture and the readings. Know all of the definitions. Tons of reading.,0
"HE IS A GREAT PERSON! HE IS AMAZING, I RESPECT HIM SO MUCH! TAKE HIS CLASS, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET!",1
"Bob is a brilliant teacher but grades somewhat hard. Because of him, my writing improved tenfold last semester. You should try and register for one of his classes",1
This class was difficult and easy at the same time. Only tests are midterms and final exams. You are graded off of 3 essays which he grades very difficult on. Tests and midterms are all writing definitions and essay questions. Every other day are just lectures the whole class period.,1
"Josh is amazing: very clear & very helpful. The subject can be a little dry sometimes, but his passion for it makes it interesting! Weekly readings & responses, 2 papers, 2 exams: worth taking & would take him again!",1
"Her class is a bit boring for the 2 hour and 45 minute TOSS class, but she really does care and she yearns for her students to be interested in what she has to say. The course load is pretty minimal compared to other TOSS classes, and the textbook readings are short and sweet. All that she goes over is relevant and useful.",1
"He is honesty the worst professor I have ever had. I'm not kidding, ever person in his class failed. He should realize that he needs to change something about his teaching style. He does not go over anything, nor did he tell anyone what to study. His tests were extremely hard and he used very confusing wording.",0
"Awesome class, awesome teacher!",1
"Sonja is so bloody kind. Really, I've met some nice people, but she's the most genuine person I've ever known.",1
"Worst Professor I've ever had. Might be a smart guy, but he is a horrible professor. Doesn't explain ANYTHING in great detail. Just says you should know it ""intuitively"". It'll be a disgrace if he is allowed to teach at SMU again next year.",0
"The workload was ridiculous. We had multiple assignments every night between wamap and excel. Lecture was over excel only and did not cover traditional statistics methods. Wamap assignments were formatted for the traditional method that she did NOT teach. To get get help with them, you had to research on your own or go to tutoring sessions.",0
Lizzie Brock is one of the best English teachers I've ever had. She is very caring and understanding and makes sure you are working to the best of your ability. She also gives one on one time for those who need it. She really want you to learn the material and pass.,1
"Don't let your advisor tell you that this is an easy substitute for a math class. THIS IS HARDDD. Very lecture heavy and Professor Pestana is really hard to follow at times, he also kind of talks slow but even then he's hard to follow because he's just everywhere and is kind of a tough grader. He also says BONK a lot and I love it.",1
"Very nice man, if you attend all classes, pay attention, & take notes then he's really nice to you & will help if you go to his office. However he's terrible at explaining things clearly, homeworks are hard to do & are 30% of your final grade, so getting A's in your tests is nothing if you make less than perfect 100s on your hws -_- Easy tests thou",0
"I am a medieval studies student. Proff taylor is a hard teacher because he expects alot out of his students.  To the writer who stated that medieval studies is not relevant,i would like to say that medievalists have a passion for what they do and passion doesn't have anything to do with practicality",1
"Professor Battani is an amazing professor! I took Soc 101 online with him. The class structure is so organized and great, and his lectures he posts on line (they are short videos, not to worry!) are very helpful. There is a decent amount of reading, but if you stay on track, you will do great! The textbooks were honestly super interesting, too.",1
This class has mandatory attendance but the lectures are never on topic so don't expect to learn anything its basically a waste of time. There is a required textbook that he forces you to buy. Definitely not an easy A and you learn nothing except when you open the textbook. Not worth it in my opinion.,0
"I took her online class and loved it. I thought she was extremely thorough in everything. Her exams were extremely difficult... it seemed however that it was weighed because I ended up getting an A in the class when it should have been a B (per the points). Regardless of the difficulty of her tests, it is all for a reason and she is a great prof.",1
worst professor ive ever had. definitely dont take her unless you want to hate your life. i regret taking her class and wish i took either a different professor with it or just a different class overall,0
Professor Pool is an awesome teacher. I love being in her choir. Definately helps me with my singing.,1
I dropped the class on the first day because he doesn't let you wear a hat.,0
"She gives zero directions and everyone was completely lost throughout the semester, hardest grader ever, she will tell you she wants something down a particular way, but when you give her what she wants, there is always something wrong with it.",0
"This guy is awesome. He understands that the majority of students take the class for pre-recs,so he tries to keep the work minimal. The tests are really easy if you study. He actually gets to know his students and is the only prof I have had that learned names. He's pretty funny as well. You can tell he loves what he teaches. I will miss his class.",1
"2/2 (Only to find out on the day of presenting that sharing our ideas was optional). And lastly, has ignored every single one of my emails. So for those who are in the film program and want a laid-back professor, then take his classes. But for those who want to learn and have a better experience, then youre better off picking someone else.",0
Very knowledgable and entertaining speaker.  He made coming to class fun.  A very memorable professor... I took this class in the spring of 1980 and still remember it and especially Mr. Hallman.,1
Bring this guy back.  Students in his class learn a ton.,1
She is a very picky one and you definately know you earn your grade. She a nice ladie too.,1
"First of all, she is a very sweet woman. Her heart is genuine, but her teaching skills are inadequate. Her spelling and grammar are both atrocious, on top of her very thick accent. A majority of the time, we have no clue what she is saying. When you can understand, it's usually her far-fetched opinion and if you don't agree with her, you're wrong.",0
"I just feel so hopeless in this class. He told us to watch nine hours of lectures by the first class period, and it never got better. The tests are harder than the homework, the homework has no due date so it's hard to know how far I've fallen behind, and there are no grades besides the tests so if you fail anything, you're basically done.",0
Dr. Hermann was very helpful. His class was straight forward and I would take it again.,1
"Sammy is a good person! He can talk fast while giving lecture and the slides are longer than they should be sometimes. Overrall, if you take good notes and study them you will do fine.",1
"Julie Hess was great with replying to e-mails or phone calls. Since this was an online class, everything was done online, using Thinkwell. The online instructor Edward Burger is incredibly nerdy and his cheesy sense of humor can grow to be obnoxious. Because there's few tests, they're heavily weighted toward your final grade.",1
"He seems so nice at first but grading is very harsh, answers to the CM Exerc can be correct but if its not what he is looking for, well too bad he aint giving you a point! Class was via Zoom,he requires cameras and mics at all times for attendance. I dropped after two weeks,it was too much work. PLEASE dont take this class, there are other options!",0
"Dr. Lim is a very nice guy, but a very mediocre professor. He never derived a problem from scratch for us and instead just scrolled through his notes which looked like alphabet soup. We all had to teach ourselves by doing the homework and reading the notes. Many grades were saved because he leaked the final while we took it, invalidating it.",0
"Professor Rouse cares about students passing his class he goes beyond the call of duty to make sure students pass. No question is dumb with Prof Rouse. He sees who is working hard and who is not. Lots of homework and lot of handouts.. If you do the homework and work on the hand outs you will pass his class. Math 53 is HARD but passed with a ""B"".",1
"Great teacher! Very enthusiastic about teaching special education! Easy class. Take good notes and you'll be fine, test questions come right from lecture and he tells you what to expect on test",1
"Best English teacher I have ever had. Took it because I had to, and loved every minute of it. Engaging, funny, energetic, enthusiastic teacher. Goes out of his way to help everyone individually. Competent, makes the material a blast, and an all around really fun class with a great teacher. Simply cannot say enough good things about this teacher.",1
Professor Slamet seems nice on the outside but grades so hard and doesnt care about you or what grade you get.,0
Instruction was awkward. Bo reads directly from the slides offering vague answers to students' questions. Online homework is tedious and time consuming offering little explaination.  Two group projects were riddled with busy work.  Weekly posts for online discussion forum was insightful for financial current events.  Final exam held in class.,0
"I was skeptical due to her previous ratings but she this has been such an easy class IF you put in the effort. She may lock all the assignments but gives you step my step instructions (Mon read, Tue , read, Wed, discussion) The class was organized but you have to do the readings to pass her exams.",1
"I really enjoyed this class. The assignments were all very valuable and she was awesome to you if you visited her in her office, lots of info. Make sure you go to all classes though, and if possible take notes once in a while cause it makes the final exam A LOT easier!",1
Debate coach. The cheese. They rock but make sure youre keeping up with homework and your debate stuff or else you will feel it.,1
"Prof Corker is a nice person, and an easy going prof but she is very unclear on what she expects in papers and she is a very harsh grader. She grades hard, and her tests are hard (there are only 2, but no matter what you study it's difficult). She is an extremely slow grader, and I didn't see what I got on several papers (past semester grader)",1
"I had to drop this class half way through the semester, I did all of the readings, joined a study group and still failed both exams. It was very discouraging. I think she is nice and has good intentions, but her grading is much too harsh and so are her expectations.",0
"Cares a lot and wants you to learn. It takes a lot of studying to get an A since most people have zero programming experience prior to this class, but just read and PRACTICE it! His notes help but you could probably learn everything through the book, plus 2 pop quizzes.",1
Fabulous teacher. Enough said. Highly recommended.,1
"I took econ at another school, was failing, and withdrew from the class. With Battista I have 97%. She makes econ really interesting - somehow it is my favorite class. She tells you EVERYTHING you need to know, if you attend class (100% necessary with her), take notes, and do ALL the homework, I don't know why you wouldn't get an A.",1
Absolutely awful! Avoid at all costs. She's a terrible instructor. You have been warned! she doesn't teach. Host study sessions but gets aggravated if you ask a question and says you should have learned that in undergraduate accounting. Literally the worst professor I've ever had.,0
"She is a nice lady, but that's about as good as it gets for this review. This class was very disorganized. The TAs made a complete mess of the ""project."" If you really want to learn OS, I would hold out for another professor.",0
Extensive amount of homework for a mandatory class for all students. Take any other teacher if you're given the chance. 3 papers throughout the semester which count for most of the grade so put the effort in to those. If you miss more than two classes without a legitimate excuse you fail.,0
"Dr. Wallace is the best STEM prof you could ask for. Explains concepts really well and clearly cares about his students. The class itself isn't that bad. Exams are more difficult than problems in class, but they aren't too much of a stretch. The final was really hard though, so don't let it catch you off guard! Also no curve, so don't count on it",1
"He is really funny and kind. He cares about students and wants to make sure everyone understands what he is teaching. The essay we wrote was content-heavy, yet, he made himself available and encouraged asking him for help.",1
"It's not a difficult class.  He is definatly an odd ball, but he tries to be entertaining.  Go to class and read the notes he prints out for you.  Lots of extra credit opportunities.  You'll get atleast a 'B'",1
Treats students like high schoolers in terms of teaching but grades difficultly,0
Really easy class. she tries to add things in to the class to make it more complicated but we never end up doing any of the things she says. some really easy quizzes. easy homework. easy projects.. Just read your notes and you will do fine. SUPER EASY!! she is just all over the wall...,0
"Bob is so much fun and definitely one of the best professors I've had in all of college. A great guy with a lot of charisma, you'll love this professor no doubt in my mind.",1
"It is an online class.  It is only for those who are willing to work.  The reading is informative and the test easy IF you read.  The group work goes well if you have a good group and participate.  If you don't participate, the group will give you a bad grade.  If you're somewhat intelligent you'll do well.  If you aren't, you're out of luck.",1
"I took her online class and it was like we didn't even HAVE a teacher. She assigned the homework. Never really helped or returned emails. While she was teaching the class she graded maybe four assignments. (She just gave us all full points for turning them in.) Unless you like to learn straight from the book, don't take her; she's an awful teacher.",0
"One of my favorite professors I've ever had! He teaches super clear, provides awesome, detailed study guides, but you have to show up to class. It's a pretty fast paced course, so paying attention is necessary. He is a great guy and makes an accounting class a lot better than it sounds.",1
"Great teacher, such a pal",1
He really cares about his student and he guides you through he work and he always review before a quiz or test,1
Very rude and not an approachable person. He makes you feel not smart when you ask a question. His online homework assignments are difficult and so are his tests. I do not recommend.,0
Hes a South American Brit. Super funny. Great lectures. Lots of knowledge about different cultures and regions. 10/10 recommend.,1
Was a great class. It was a great introduction to the financial services industry and a great way to learn about finance as an underclassman. Current event pop quizzes weren't bad and tests weren't bad either. I definitely recommend taking this class.,1
"She didnt teach. No lectures, PowerPoints, & rarely communicated and this is an online class. All the assignments were on Connect & you basically had to teach yourself & read the text to learn. The midterm & final were proctored & you arent able to use any notes, the textbook, or search engines unlike the hw. Avoid her if you can, hard for GenEd.",0
"Awesome instructor! I took his 100W course and loved it. I don't know how his other courses go, but I would highly recommend this one to anyone having to take the upper GE writing course.",1
"She is really funny, but often crosses the line. She has a hard time staying on topic, but is receptive to student feedback. She also down plays how hard the course is,so when students do poorly, they are shocked. She could use some social grace training. But nice lady overall.",0
My writing got better. Good class.,1
"Very thorough in her teaching. Commands the attention of the class and introduces law students to the importance of preparation and research.  Not very fair. Favors men by far. Retains a large percentage of final grade for subjective grading (class participation), of which the favoritism factors in.",1
Lovely professor. Easy to talk to. ,1
"He is a tough grader. Expect papers, and group projects. He grades your participation, so if you don't speak up, you'll see it reflected on your grade. The text book is a must. He uses every second of class, so arrive on time. He is a nice guy, just a tough teacher to have.",1
Professor Lange is the most entertaining professor i have ever had. Always saying the hilarouis things in class . Not a difficult class if you keep up with the online sam projects. Lectures are pointless to go to besides the lab.,1
The most boring professor I have ever taken. He is also like 70 and barely can use technology. He is also super paranoid about people using phones and laptops in class. He can be rude and annoying. Talks on and on about stuff that won't ever be on any tests.,0
I'm loving this class! Putting in the work and getting A's. Great teacher I have actually learned new concepts!,1
"Her concern for all of us truly makes me feel like she actually cares about the human beings we are. The way she teaches this class, audio lectures coupled with her personality toward me, made all the difference in completing this course.",1
"Overall she a good teacher, but she typical college professor. very boring and dull. she very nice, but the way she teach is confusing.",0
Had the class with Dr. C and Dr. Ferenbaugh and thought they were bothe good.  Spent lots of time outside class helping me with homework and conceps.  Did have to read the book.  Dr. C was fun and had great examples from Africa.  Showed a great video on Cane Toads for one class.,1
"She seems to know what she is talking about however she does not tolerate any talking during class, even whispering. She will call you out even if you are discussing the class. She also will never let you out of class early and will get upset when people begin to pack up. Avoid her!",0
Worst teacher I have ever had at UNLV. Half the time his lessons are confusing and make very little sense. He constantly confuses himself and makes mistakes on the simplest problems. He seems to take pleasure out of humiliating students. I would not recommend this class to ANYONE.,0
"Dr. Richards is the best Prof in the PLS department. Can not say enough about him. Incredibly nice guy. Two or three 40 question multiple choice exams. A super fun debate, and a mock supreme court oral argument. No pressure at all, very laid back. One of two papers as well. TAKE HIM IF YOU CAN!",1
"The class is both lecture and textbook oriented, you need to do the reading and go to the lectures if you want to pass. There is not really any homework assignments other then the reading, which makes it a test heavy class.",1
"Rick is great at creating a stressful and demotivating working environment. Students are not allowed to talk to each other during class. Armed only with 28-year-old articles he printed off and cannot cite, youre left to teach yourself most of the material in the class. Rick only speaks to students to criticize work or answers to lecture questions.",0
"Way too much work for a 2 credit class. 2 midterm essays, as well as a final project and other assignments. He is a very tough grader on essays, which I wouldn't expect from a 2 credit class. He doesn't give helpful feedback. I wouldn't recommend this class or the professor. Lots of reading and work, too much for a 2 credit",0
Not a good experience at all.,0
Although I did enjoy his lecture I think he is kind of rude at times and a bit arrogant with his comments.  He hardly looks at you in the eyes and that is kind of strange considering he is an Interpersonal Communications teacher.  Grades fair and assignments are cool.,1
"Professor Cotter is amazing. He makes his lectures so interesting by using real life stories and job examples. I would take him again in a heartbeat. His class is based off of three tests, and he always says to trust the book before his lectures, so be prepared to read the book. Overall I really enjoyed his class.",1
Don't waist your time.,0
"Dr. Costanza varies his lecture material and explanation based on his interests, but expects the student to write in-depth papers on each topic every week. Tough quizzes that are weighted to info or details NOT discussed in class. Costanza's rigid ultra-conservative Christianity can be uncomfortable. On plus side, class is repetitive tasks and easy",0
"Awful! Wouldnt recommend to anyone. No help outside of class. Has an agenda and wont slow down to help students. Knows her content but isnt there to teach, just there to collect a pay check.",0
"This is a horrible teacher. She is very unclear about assignments, and hardly replies to emails. I emailed her asking for more clarity on our essay, she never replied. If she doesn't like your writing, she will let you know in the margins. She believes white men are terrible, very melodramatic, seems to be very religious, also against certain races",0
She was really nice,1
Hands down the best professor on campus. He makes class fun and he's laid back. He's very willing to help his students.,1
This is by far the worst prof Ive ever had! She can not project her voice and cant explain math concepts in a clear way. When the class tries to seek help from other students she gets mad at us for helping... This wouldnt be a problem if she could actually teach.,0
Love Kathy! She actually cares about her students and is very understanding. Offers a lot of extra credit. The classes are pretty repetitive but not hard. Book used for weekly online quizzes.,1
Very confusing and not interesting at all even if you like the subject. Avoid him if you can. Worst teacher I have had in my 4 years. Does not answer your questions at all and won't explain anything.,0
"Dr. Lapp focuses on teaching the principals behind what you are learning, and often does ""math labs"" so that you can make the discoveries about things for yourself. Go to class, do the homework, and he is readily available for any help you may need, take advantage of his office hours!!!!",1
Outstanding intro to homeland security.  Comprehensive course material supported by a top professor who valued student input while providing outstanding feedback.  Good course but a brisk workload throughout the semester.  Professor was very flexible on due dates--he's very familiar with the real world.,1
She knows stats in and out and can teach it really well.  She expects you do know it really well too and due to that she can be a very strict and picky grader.  She has an open door policy - stop by and she'll give you all the help you need.  Expect to work really hard and do all the extra credit opportunities because she doesn't curve anything.,1
"He is genuine and very passionate about his field. He is one of those professors that can keep the class interesting by relating topics to relevant issues. He is a tough grader, ask him if you have any questions but always answers his email. His main goal is to teach you the information but he does look out for your best interest. Would take again.",1
"At the beginning of the semester we only had quizzes on recitation day (Thursdays) but further. into the semester he made them on random days and often more than once a week. They aren't very hard quizzes and you can work together with the people around you. But you HAVE to go to class bc what the excuse, you can't make it up. SUPER boring lectures",0
The epitome of a red chili pepper!,1
"Keeps interest! The every day schedule is about 45 minute lecture and the rest is what ever video you're watching that day accompanied with a 5 question sheet about the video.    He truely knows AND CARES about his stuff, so he rarely uses the book. And listen because he repeats test material. PLENTY of extra credit and time to turn in your work.",1
Very rude and slow,0
"Daria is a very slow and boring prof, You do not need to attend her classes because her 3 hour lectures are her taking up 4 question from the in class demo questions that is given at the end of every chapter. The midterm was easy but the final was hard. I learned nothing in the classes.",0
"Larry Miller, WOW. This was and is my favorite teacher I've ever had. I had him for BIO&241 and BIO&242. Begins class by asking if anyone has any questions and doesn't begin class until every question is answered. Actually gets back to you if he doesn't know the answer to one of your questions. If you actually want to learn, TAKE LARRY MILLER!",1
She is a very tough grader and her requirements are ambiguous; you are never really sure what she is looking for. The class overall is boring and way too much work for a 2 credit hour course. Her interactions with students is unpleasant and can be downright rude! I will be sure to never take a class with her again!,0
"Not a professor to take a class from - she does not teach, so much as read to you from the book. An internet course would be better than this - no in class benefit. Tests are not made by her - downloaded from somewhere... Nice lady, but NOT a teacher.",0
"I would definitely recommend this professor for CHM 102. Professor Baum made this class exceptionally easy, and as long as you do your online assignments its an easy A. He also allows test corrections for half points back on all exams. He rarely takes attendance, but showing up will definitely make tests easier. Great professor overall!",1
"He was nice and attempted to make lecture easier by putting the context of the text in a funny way to remember, but exams were somewhat hard.  Gives you like 10 questions in a sectiona and says chose 7, but you know only 5. Think he would be better as a nonlecture hall prof. Engl205 in Sharp 130 was not a good idea.",0
I passed this class without learning anything. Prof does not respond to emails in under a week and takes weeks to a month to post grades. This coupled with errors and unclear information in chapter notes etc makes it seem like she doesn't know enough to teach or simply doesn't care about her online classes. I am disappointed that I paid for this.,1
"As long as you stay on top of weekly assignments and read the textbook this class is easy. Prompts for assignments are clear and if you need to contact the professor she always responds quickly. 10 discussions, 6 papers, and 6 quizzes.",1
Awesome teacher!The best online course ever.Mr.Narin and his TA respond to emails immediately.The textbook is very easy and clear.The online quizzes and tests were not timed and contained only material that just have been covered.You simply can't try hard and be dropped or fail this class. I higly recommend this class.,1
Explains things very well,1
"Professor Waller is a fantastic professor!!  She is helpful and fun and wants you to get it.  I loved having her be the constant professor during my 2 years while class professors changed every 8-16 weeks.  Looking back, I'd say she was one of my favorite and most encouraging professors in the whole program!  Thanks Professor Waller!",1
TAKE HIS CLASS!!! He is an amazing professor that makes class interesting and fun. He uses a lot of video clips and humor to keep you awake. Plus he's British!!,1
Worse professor I have taken at FAU. This is a graduate course and out of all the professors I've had he is the worse one! There are 2 tests throughout the course--midterm and final and are worth 50% of your grade. He also has quizzes but is worth 1-2% and a research paper. The exams are taken in respondus lockdown w/ webcam. WORSE CLASS EVER!!!,0
I've had Dr. Lin for 3 psych classes and I loved them all. She is a wonderful professor and she is adorable! Her lectures are very interesting and the course work is too. There is a lot of work but it is totally manageable.,1
"He would rant about random things that had nothing to do with class. He has his ""lunch bunch"" that is very creepy and unprofessional. Not a good professor but I did learn a lot from the class just from the readings. Never from his lectures.",0
"Speaks very fast, very unorganized. Will have you with three books open flipping pages simultaneously. Misspeaks a lot so you get confused easily. Get the code and the course pack, do not get the text book even though he says you need it.",0
Not clear when explaining. Assigns redundant code modifications (that are nearly impossible to read) for nearly all the assignments. Grades more ruthlessly after drop date. Extremely picky when checking homework; don't expect much partial credit.,0
"Lecture's are long and she often doesn't reference painting she is analysing, often does not proceed in a coherent way, quite messy",0
"it wasnt bad , reviews on articles almost every week and a final paper . follow his inst- on paper. APA STYLE GOT AN A  I WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND - NOT EASY , BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO . Dont be absent and do your work . nice guy love him , very smart",1
"Did not learn much, discussions where not helpful and were off topic, wish I could have gotten more out of this class.",0
"Lamore was a fine professor in the beginning. his grading though is the worst. firstly he grades to perfection basically. I already struggle writing papers, the best I got them was a C, and even when I rewrite them he grades things that I fixed. plus his lectures are so boring, I was also in a support class and it was 3 hours of lectures.",0
Prof Gray is so sweet! She was my TA for this class. You can tell she's really passionate about what she's teaching and really wants to interact with all of her students. She's really knowledgeable about all of the material as well. She is always available for outside help or just to talk. She was a pretty easy grader and just wants the best for us,1
"obviously intelligent, possibly hides behind an incredible sense of humor, witty, has a keen eye for detail, respectful even when using derogatory statements, so applause for that.",1
"He knows what he's talking about and is super nice. But his classes are unorganized so you never really know what to expect form lecture. You're really only graded by map quizzes, two exams, and one group project. We're over the halfway point in the semester and he hasn't assigned the groups he said he'd assign week 2. He's fine.",1
"This was a horrible class and professor. She is not a good teacher, is very disorganized and is an embarrassment to the profession. I do not think her students learn anything productive.",0
David is an amazing teacher as well a cool person.  His lessons are all from experience and he tells real life stories.  His test are a little hard but he gives you everything you need to know for them.  I highly recommend taking a class from him especially if you are thinking about owning your own business someday.,1
"Great class and professor, took the in class portion tho most work is still completed on line. tests are straight forward from what you learn, ",1
worst BUAD prof.,0
An amazing lecturer that does a phenomenal job at engaging with students. He always gives some back story on the material which makes the concepts much more interesting. Really knows his stuff and is very approachable.,1
Doesn't care about teaching and cancelled 3 weeks worth of class. He then proceeded to have make up classes during the weekend which most students couldn't make. He got mad at the students that couldn't show up and would get mad when asked for help then would insult the school. Grades have been due and our class haven't gotten it yet.,0
super easy class. His lectures are really boring online and you really only need to watch and take notes for the 3rd test the first 2 are heavily textbook and you can just look at the slides instead of watching the videos. Homeworks are really annoying but still easy. great gpa booster class.,1
I took this class over the summer in the 8 week course I was able to retain good information. I would take this instructor again.,1
"Professor Misra is a great person. Hes very friendly and nice. However, that doesnt help you earn an A. He has a heavy accent so for me I hard time understanding the lectures. Thank God for the other students in the class because together we taught eachother the material to be able to pass. I managed to get a B (only by the grace of God).",0
"Probably one of the smartest guys I've ever had talk to me, but probably the worst professor. Lectures cover zero of the material on tests and web assign so might as well not go to class honestly, and everyone in the Chem Success Center will know you're his student when you ask them one of his questions on an exam review FROM A DIFFERENT CLASS.",0
"Mostly had test and group work was considered to be a grade. She also didn't offer reviews for her class and was just expected to know all of the chapters. I would say her lectures were good, but I feel as they didn't cover everything in the chapters/tests.",0
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
I took the English 319 class online and it was very difficult!! I failed the class and have an A/B average in all other classes. There was so much work and it was very difficult and time consuming! Seemed like way more work than allowed for the 10 weeks. Also you had to go on campus to take the exams. Make sure your schedule allows for that.,0
"this class is actually insane. I have taken 200, and 300 level online psychology classes so I figured why not take an easy 100 level class online. DON'T DO IT. This professor expects work from graduate students and will never ever give you full credit. One comment she gave me was ""You need to cite all of your work, regardless if it is an opinion.""",0
This is a great filler class to have when you have a busy schedule. Everything was due on Sunday night. Battani is very kind and caring. Lots of writing for discussions and essays but it was manageable. Also a lot of online tests which were easy and had no time limit. some of the questions were tricky though so its nice he gives 2 attempts,1
"Take Physiological Mechanisms- its the ideal class for any pre-med trying to actually learn more about medicine. The entire class revolves around studying case studies and determining a presented patient's diagnosis given their symptoms. Everyone does one of their own case study presentations. No exams, just participate and ace your presentation.",1
"Dr. Konen is a really nice professor that makes the lectures easy to listen to and the environment easy to be in. Attendance is non-mandatory but if you want to pass the tests, which I found to be very difficult, you need to attend the lectures and take notes. He rarely assigned homework but it was easy and I found his study guides useful.",1
Did not learn anything throughout the whole semester.,0
Smartest teacher I've had,1
"Easy class, but boring. It's basically more detailed Linear Algebra 1. Attendance is required but you won't really learn in class since he goes over alot of irrelevant topics. The tests are take home and you have a whole week to work on them. 40% of the grade is attendance+hw and he gives you a 100 as long as you put in some effort. Def recommend",1
"This is one of the best teachers I have had in college. She is by far the most helpful if you are having issues. She will work with you and is understanding if you miss an assignment, just talk to her. She does tend to get off track a lot but in the end we learn the material and have a good time while doing it. She can be strict if someone acts out",1
"She is one of the worst professors I've had. First of all you have to listen closely to what she is saying because of her accent, and she HATES when you ask questions. Has a very dry personality and can be very rude and not understanding. She gives extremely hard and confusing tests or quizzes. If you aren't good at this subject don't get her!!",0
"I love this professor. Her lectures are clear and engaging. She obviously cares for her students and what she teaches. The guidelines for the papers are pretty strict, but exams are reasonable. Definitely show up to lectures and do the readings.",1
"One of the sweetest professors. I took his 299 class last year and am currently enrolled in his Grammar 309 course this semester. He's not the easiest professor, he expects a lot of self-learning out of his students and quizzes heavily. Although, he is incredibly flexible and willing to help through office hours! Highly recommended! ",1
"Professor Leung was fantastic. He cares more about learning than grades, and it shows. He is my first professor that allowed me to actually keep graded quizzes for review. He requires dedication, but if he sees you trying, he will help you. He is also really fun to be around, which helps when you have to be in his class at least 4 hours a week.",1
"Brian is awesome! I enjoyed his class because of his teaching style, his energy, his little motivational speeches, his rants, and his sense of humor. You're only graded on three exams, a paper, and a presentation based on your paper. So just show up to class (on time), do the readings, and be respectful and you should be fine in this class!",1
Hameed is one of few teachers who actually cares about each individual student passing.  So he helps alot in office hours and even meets you when he is busy.  But he takes you through hell and back before you can pass his class.  Over 10 hrs of HW a week.,1
"Roe is awesome, but you shouldn't take his class.  The lectures were interesting, but had a hard time staying awake.  You will never know when his notes are something you should know.  only grades: 2 tough exams that you don't review and a huge vague research essay that the class won't prepare you for.  Won't read email, can't use internet research",0
"Absolutely my fav professor! He is such a funny, genuine, and great professor! Also gives great lectures!",1
"Talks to each of his students as if we're Chem majors. Impossible to keep up with, curbs his tests, is much better in lab than in lecture. HORRIBLE in lecture.",0
To do well in the course you'll need to put in a lot of time memorizing the information and pay attention during lecture.,1
"Great class to take in an election year. Dr. Swint knows his stuff and has a good interactive style of teaching. The reviewer below must have been disappointed with their grade, because no one I talk to in that class felt that way at all. Gives you a choice of group project or individual research paper. Takes attendance.",1
"I looved this class. It's easy, but I still learned a LOT! There are about three problems of homework every week, and the tests are also simple. He truly cares about students' progress and will go to great lengths to make sure his explanations are clear as possible. If you want to really learn Italian, you have take it with il professore Sbragia!",1
"One of my fav profs at Fordham. SO smart. Wasn't looking forward to taking this cause I'm not religious but she taught the Old Testament as stories, not religion so it was very interesting. 8 one page papers throughout but super easy. Actually made me enjoy the Bible which I wasn't expecting. She always held my attention and is so kind and caring.",1
"Took him for Math114 and after only having 80% on my webassigns, I ended up getting an A-. The tests are easy, and you generally only show up to class to get help with webassigns. ",1
"It was a hostile learning environment. I was treated like an idiot whenever I participated. It led me to start skipping. I liked the world politics content, but it didnt have to be torture learning it.",0
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
Professor Miller is one of my favorite professors. You can tell her passion for the CJ system by the way she talks about her career as police officer. Her stories are always very interesting and she adds them into each lecture. It makes it fun and interesting to hear about her time as a dedicated police officer. There is not much work at all!!!,1
"The hardest professor you could possibly have for any math course. Do not take this class unless you belong in courses taught at Carnegie Mellon or MIT. Incredibly difficult problems for homework and calls us ""greedy"" when we tell him we want to actually understand everything about the homework.",0
"Literally the best teacher I have had. Supported me through class and beyond. Is passionate about both learning and teaching how biology can cure some of the most difficult health problems. Her class is designed so that you can learn which ever way is easiest for you, tests are fair yet tough, and you have chances to recover from a poor grade.",1
"Dee is a very nice lady, but her tests are ROUGH. You really have to work to get a good grade in the class, even if you go to class and are interested in the course material.",1
Fantastic personality! So funny! Makes coming to class exciting and interesting. There is never a dull moment. She makes you actually enjoy what you're doing. Best professor I have had thus far.,1
"LOVED Mr. Allen. He gets a bad rap from people that don't do their work, but if you do your work and go to class then you will easily make an A. The test are straightforward and reflect what we do in class. Really like that he gives us worksheets to do outside of class, and will occasionally give extra credit to those that completed. Take him!!",1
"Truly an unnecessarily tough grader. During the corona virus crisis she did not lower her expectations of us, and additionally stated during class time that she would spend less time grading our work and would give us fewer comments on how to improve. Though through her words she acted sympathetic to her students, her actions spoke otherwise.",0
She's very helpful and you get to choose which production you want to do or just do shop hours. For me I did props for this fall's production of M. Courage and I gained experience from it. Lacey's there for most of the rehearsals to help out fixing props and all that. Totally recommend it if you're missing semester units. :),1
"I have her now and I want out. She's nasty with her students and gives a tremendous amount of ""busy work"".",0
She is a great prof.  I would highly recommend taking Griffin for bio 160 if you can.,1
"I get really good grades, but this class was extremely hard. Her lectures on powerpoint are not clear. She jumps around from slide to slide w/o telling you what chapter she's on. She goes very fast in lecture and it is impossible to take notes. Erases everything after talking about it. Doesn't answer emails for help. Class test avg is in 50's.",0
"Heed these warnings, for they are all true. She even stated in our class that she is not fond of teaching and no longer wants to do it. Doesn't answer emails. She does not give grading criteria for big projects, and then grades very hard. I even lost points for being ""too concise"" on a big project. Is that even possible?",0
"Like someone else said, show-up and try, and you'll pass. You also learn some pretty cool ninja skillz.",1
Avoid him total jerk,0
"May seem nice at first and then you realize that she only wants you to agree with her when she poses a in class discussion question, and can in fact be quite rude to students! I felt like she was a bit bias and unprofessional at times. Don't really recommend this class or prof if you don't like how profs are vague when they give a lecture.",0
"Dr. Hahn is a lovely person, but a difficult professor. She is very enthusiastic, but she moves fast and often doesn't explain things thoroughly. You will have to put in a LOT of work and energy outside of class if you want to do well.",1
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
"I don't know how Professor Hower has such high ratings on here... Just to highlight a few things, she's very unorganized, class gets cancelled a lot, lectures are just her reading off of the screen and not really explaining how to work through the problems, and she gets very off topic for majority of the time during lectures. Would not recommend.",0
"Dr. Yang is an amazing professor! She is good at telling you where you messed up and need to improve, but also, she will tell you where you are doing well. Her tests and quizzes are hard, but honestly, if anyone else taught this class it would be ten times worse. She is one of the best professors I've had so far!",1
"Not a professor i would want to take for Math 201. Very out of it and always did things that wouldn't help someone out as a teacher. She made a lot of problems harder then what they were. She would teach you different ways and you had to use those ways! Study Study Study if you haver her, tests are killer!",0
one of the worst teachers at cape fear. hard to understand and is basically a self taught class. cannot teach a lick. unclear of assignments and embarrasses you if you ask a question,0
She is not willing to discuss any matter and doesn't go as in depth as she expects on her exams,0
"I would not recommend buying the textbook for this class. He does not really follow the syllabus because he goes on tangents and gets very far behind. If you attend class, the answers to the test are all in his lectures. There are 3 tests and he gives you a very helpful study guide.",1
"Intelligent, smart, inspirational, and an overall great person. She really wants her students to learn and do well. She is very accessible if you are in need of extra help. Quizzes every Monday that boost your grade if you review your notes and read the assigned readings. Her tests are simple and straight forward. Def have to read and study though",1
"FANTASTIC PROF. The most organized prof I have ever seen. Very passionate about Cog Psyc. The toughest part of his class is it is only out of 100 points. So you have to be very careful on how many points you get docked on EVERY assignment and test. The test are tricky, just go over ALL notes and the readings. Overall, LOVED Prof Sa fantastic prof",1
"Unless you are already a philosopher, you will not understand his material. 3 exams, that's it. He doesn't post slides, so you have to go to class to sit through his very confusing lectures and attempt to write everything down for the minute each slide is up. He is rude and won't help you whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and don't take this class.",0
Awesome teacher! So experienced and knowledgable. He seems to love teaching and that makes his class great! LOTS of reading. Go to class or you won't pass. I learned a lot and he's so fun and entertaining.,1
"Not my cup of tea, graded negatively on discussion boards that did not align with her train of thought. I love to learn but being forced to see things one way is not learning. Not being able to share my thoughts on why I feel or believe a certain way was unfair. Glad it's over and never looking back.",0
If you go to class and take notes the class is fairly easy. The study guides are a outline to the test which makes it super helpful when studying. Rarely used the book unless I missed a class or used with the study guide. The assignments can be lengthy but the topics were interesting and we only had 4 assignments. Would recommend for an easy A.,1
"Dr. Weiner is a tough guy to figure out. He can be totally charming and kind, but with the flip of a switch, he can be a real ass.I got stellar grades in his class with the exception of one grade and he failed me because I didnt ask him about the status of my grade (even though it was all on blackboard). Stay as far away from his class as possible",0
"I dreaded going to her classes every week. She is very intimidating and demanding. The only good thing is attendance isn't being marked, but she will know if you skip class and calls you out on it. Readings were just long and boring academic articles. She seems to think she's better than she really is.",0
"Please do yourself a favor and do not take a class from this guy. Unless youve already taken the class you wont understand a thing. The lectures are clear enough, but he goes off on long tangents about unnecessary problems. Outside of the lecture, you will be completely lost. Tests are nigh impossible, and quizzes contribute way too much. Dont.",0
"Boring,but he knows his stuff.Tests are rough and he emphasizes using calculus to derive formulas even though calculus is not a requirement for the class! It's BS, and when i told him I'm weak in calculus he said ""you better learn before the next exam"" Exams are rough 3 during semester and one cumulative final",0
"She is rude and clearly has issues like previously mentioned its sad that she is the only professor teaching the course. She does not make the class interesting at all and can never give a full example. She begins explaining and is at a loss for words and just says ""YOU KNOW"" but never says anything.",0
"professor gaffin is very inexperience with what he does, he gives no study objective. so then you rarely know what is going to be on the exam. even though he tell us what is going to be on the exam during lectures, but the time you take your exam it is nothing that he said was actually going to onbe definitely a class where you have to work for it",0
I LOVE HIM! Everyone loves him! He is the McDreamy of professors. He knows how to explain the material in many ways that every student can understand. He cares about the students understanding on the material. He wrote the prefect text book that can be followed easily for organic chemistry. He is by far the best professor I have ever taken. AMAZING,1
"Lotssssss of reading, but Quizzes and assignments aren't too difficult",0
"One of the smartest, most engaging guys I've ever met. Quite a bit of reading, but it's worth it because the discussions he leads are so dense and informative. Fair grader. Responsive to what the class finds interesting and brings out the most in your ideas. You'll come out of his class smarter, and it's a genuine honor to have worked with him.",1
Seriously NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you're amazing at math already I don't think he did his online lectures past the first 2 weeks of school he just uploaded the notes and it was basically like a GOOD LUCK type situation you teach yourself and him really he also teaches the most confusing ways to do things he confuses himself,0
"His lectures are confusing if you are new to this (non-EE student here) and are full of jargon. Says that ""it's not a programming class"", but you definitely need some coding experience. Go in during his office hours, he is much more helpful and also very friendly. Gave us the option to skip the final (he'd take an average of the first two tests).",1
I thought Michelle Hunt was an amazing professor. She's so friendly and enthusiastic about anatomy. She is very helpful and cares about the success of her students. Her tests are tough so be sure to pay attention in class. If you're struggling  with a concept in the class don't hesitate to go to her office hours or email her.,1
She is very good at explaining things if you do not understand. She gives pretty quick responses for the emails. I highly recommend her for Anatomy and Physiology.,1
"This class met once a week for about 3 hours or so. He spent each time playing music while talking over it trying to describe which genre the music belongs to but Its incredibly hard to memorize which genre a song aligns to when he talks over it the whole time. Some of his teachings are outdated and when you try to correct him, he gets mad",0
He's a nice guy but he's never replied to any of my emails. He always goes over the hour and fifteen minutes on ridiculous tangents. I've been in this class for 7 weeks and I've only learned about nuclear weapons because that's all he's talked about. The lectures are absolutely impossible to follow,0
"If you are interested in CJ or something related, it'll be your loss if you graduate without ever taking a class with Kathy. I have taken 2 classes with her. My capstone and CJ 420. Both were great experiences.",1
"Arts and crafts for babies was the most difficult course I have taken at MacEwan university. I took Gerard's class becasue I heard he was inspirational and it would be a GPA boost, but instead I just found myself up at 2am gluing googly eyes into a scrapbook in order to explain my life story to my classmates in picture format the next day.",0
terrible professor. doesnt help students with feedback or instruction for lab reports. would never take again,0
"The class is difficult not because the professor is bad, but because the material is challenging. That being said, the quality of lectures is very good, lots of study materials and it is defiantly possible to do well with effort. Do not blow off problem sets and be ready to form study groups. Exams are hard, but doable. Very good honors class.",1
"Often late or didn't show up to class.  I sent in a paper asking for help weeks early, got no feedback, and ended up getting a B on the paper.  Took forever to grade despite claiming she'll get everything back within a week.  Only returned one item (a quiz) within that time span.  Did not help at all.",0
DON'T TAKE HERE SHE WILL GIVE YOU A F FOR EVERYTHING DON'T HELP YOU AT ALL DON'T TAKE HER RUN NOW,0
"Overall good, chill, helpful teacher. Textbook is a must, but I just used the one on reserve in the library. There's a decent amount of reading each week, not too difficult though. As long as you do the homework, participate, miss very minimal classes, you'll get an A",1
"I read the book 3 times, yet the test had no questions from the book. The second test was word for word from quizlet, but the 3rd test had none from quizlet. I have no idea where she gets her questions or what exactly she wants us to know. Difficult is not even the word for her confusing expectations.",0
"Wow what a Great Professor he really goes the extra mile to help you learn about genetics, get you involved in lectures, and make sure you learned something at the end of the day. Don't buy the book you won't need it he tests straight from old exams and lecture material. Between zip-line mitosis and rubber chicken  feather genetics Best Class ever!",1
Worst professor I have ever experienced. Tests were nothing that he talked about in lecture or the homework. Nothing ever made sense and didn't explain anything. Avoid him!!! So many people fail his class because its SO hard,0
"Dr. Aktas is a professor who will not teach you if you do not understand the material. Do not take his class, I have a 3.8 GPA and have not been able to pass either of the exams we have taken. He is difficult to understand and doesn't actually teach his class. If you have him for physics 2 you will teach yourself.",0
"I'm not sure about the course IRL but online it was terrible. The entire course was automated (all assignments, quizzes, and lectures were uploaded from the start) and the only way we could contact our teacher was through email. Lectures were missing information so the class basically came down to reading the textbook and then doing the quizzes",0
"DON'T TAKE HIM. Supposed to be an easy A class and he makes it so unnecessarily hard. He rambles on in class about info that isn't even pertinent to the test. Tests are 10 essay questions that are worded in the worst possible way. You HAVE to read the textbook bc you don't learn anything from him, and even then good luck getting a passing grade.",0
"This was the WORST college professor I have had in my life. I have been in school for years. I am currently going back to further my education. He made sexiest jokes (that weren't even funny), not allowed to drink water, can't wear a hat (not even in the winter), if he sees your phone, he will take your final grade down by one whole letter grade.",0
I wouldn't recommend him if you aren't naturally good at math. Nobody attends class because going isn't very beneficial (I also had him at 8 am). I taught myself all the material and ended up doing pretty well. Go to class every Friday and study and you should be fine. Be prepared to teach yourself though.,0
"A great professor who really enjoys teaching and encourages students to participate and add to the class. Easy going professor, helps you a lot. Exams are good, not too hard and not too easy. Take notes , listen to what he has to say and remember to read the book. If you do, you will pass with a good grade.",1
Kenny is crazy but knows everything. He's got a mouth but is one the most respected people at Delaware. He gets sidetracked often but still gets through all material. Great guy.,1
Can give tough assignments but a very knowledgeable teacher.  Very caring and interested in student and success.  Makes you work but you learn from an expert.,1
"The textbook is completely unnecessary and doesn't tie to lectures. Slides are of simple graphics that are explained poorly, and presentations have no organization whatsoever. Prof seems like a nice guy, but the complete and total lack of objectives, concepts, and structure makes this class nearly impossible.",0
I took his CSIS 115 online and it's a straight forward class.  You have an assignment or two due at the end of everyweek.  Teacher is easy to work with.  Would highly reccommend!!,1
"Professor Bender is a very intelligent man. Although his class is difficult, you will be very grateful you took it with him. I studied quite a bit for this class so be ready to take good notes and read your text book for extra clarification. Ignore all of the obnoxious ""DO NOT TAKE HIM"" comments. If you are willing to work, you will succeed.",0
This is probably one of the most challenging Classes I have taken. Proffessor Robertson expects a lot out of her students. You have one big research paper throughout the whole semester and a final group project. Personally i feel like a lot of her assignments were rushed and required a lot of crunch time . But i will say I learned a lot.,0
"Truly a terrible teacher. She is a very bias grader, holds grudges for unknown reasons, constantly contradicts herself and offers no helpful criticism or guidance. Hard to believe gets paid to do what she does. My advice: stay far away",0
"Clear about what she wants from the semester and sticks to it! I'm not big on political history but she makes it worth listening. Also, go to office hours and talk to her! She is super understanding, so stay on her good side!",1
"For my first graduate course this professor made everything easy. Clear directions for assignments and answers emails quickly. She was not too involved in discussion boards, but still made her presence known by commenting on a few posts. Offered resubmissions and extra credit. Overall easy class of you do the work. APA understanding is critical.",1
"Participation is a huge part in grading. There are always in class exercises from the textbook so if you have any questions about the chapter, she will cover it in class. You can tell she's passionate about the subject and she gets excited about the material. She is the right amount of tough and she gives great feedback. She's always happy to help.",1
"Although the weekly readings and quizzes are sometimes difficult, it is all very interesting and the grades are curved. I scored as low as 50% on some of the quizzes, but still made an A in the course. Mr. Cochran is very understanding about making up quizzes and likes to have discussions during his lectures.",1
"This class is hard because Tammie makes it hard. She penalizes students for being unprofessional, but if she makes the same mistake all she says is ""I'm sorry."" She struggles with controlling her attitude when she is unsatisfied. She will have you stressed out about ""to be"" and phrasal verbs rather than the assignments, but even they are stressful.",0
Tests are too long to complete in the allotted time. She gets off topic easily. Lectures are boring and hard to follow and her feedback is unclear and always needs further clarification. I would not recommend this professor to anyone.,0
"Attendance for this class is mandatory, but as long as you attend this course is very easy. This is because your grade consists of attendance, weekly homework, and a project at the end of the semester. Overall a really enjoyable course with interesting content.",1
Took this prof during the fall break mini.  He was arrogant & wanted us to debate him to correct the grades. He wasn't using the new bk or pwrpts & hadn't adjusted his lectures to accommodate the new bk.  He told us he didn't care what we put in the evaluation because he had signed his contract for the next 18 months. AVOID HIM OR BRING TYLENOL!!,0
"Dr. Pearson is an expert in her field. The class is challenging, especially for those with no background in linguistics, and the material is dense. However, she is more than willing to make time to help you improve. Do not come in expecting to study literature. ",1
Jen is a great prof as long as you're not the type of student that never comes to class or isn't respectful. She can be blunt but is genuinely very kind if you show her you're ready to learn. She creates a safe and fun learning environment and her anecdotes are really funny/helpful. Would definitely recommend for anyone into Creative Writing.,1
"I ended up having to drop this class. During the lectures he would continually get off topic and when I would ask a question, it wouldn't get answered properly. He would assign us 200-400 problems a week of online homework, which I was never able to complete, even after spending five days a week in the learning lab. I would not recommend taking him",0
"Teacher required 7 fully typed lab reports.  Honestly spent more time typing these up than anything else.  Tests are a combination of multiple choice theory, short answer, and calculation problems.  Lots of pop quizzes sometimes the day before a section test.  The book also has almost no answers to practice problems.  W/o youtube i would've failed.",0
Dr Wilson is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She requires that your life solely revolve around her class. She assigned 400 question LearnSmarts due in 48 hours. She gives only 20 minutes for a 20 question quiz. She refuses to answer questions in class and calls you unprofessional for asking questions. She cannot explain things at all.,0
"Good teacher.  He retaught me Pre-Algebra and Intermediate Algebra.  Very interactive with the students.  Very fair grader.  Just do the the HW & you will be fine.  PS bring back the ""giving points"" it made the class fun.",1
"professor thomas, does not offer extra office hours for help. her lectures are all power point. She does not teach she just talks about it and rushes through it. When you ask questions she makes you feel dumb about it. would not recommend her",0
She doesn't try to trick you on tests. What you learn is what you need to know,1
"Easily my favorite professor so far. His lectures are well organized, he speaks in a way that keeps you engaged and awake. I would love to take another one of his classes. He does not post lectures online so you have to show up and take notes. His test questions are analytical and challenging but study and read. 2 tests and 3 quizzes",1
"At first I hated this class with every fibre of my being. But honestly, once you begin to speak up more and understand her teaching method, she's one of the best professors you can have. She is more than willing to help with anything she can, and gives extensive and useful feedback. Always answers emails quickly. Does everything she can.",1
Lectures are hard to pay attention to b/c kinda boring. Tests were hard considering the class basically failed. NO CURVE. Iclickers so class is mandatory.,0
Much too hard for math phobics.,0
Ortiz was my favorite professor prior to this semester. He has gotten so disorganized. returns work way to late. makes promises to complete stuff but doesnt follow through. HE reuses the same tests for all his classes but only changes 2 questions. You can never dispute anything in his class because he is never wrong. dates and facts outdate,0
This guy is nice but he sucks as a teacher.  His grading is unclear and you only have a few assignments that take up your entire grade.  Literally EVERY CLASS he would lecture the ENTIRE TIME.  The only thing he ever did was talk and talk and it was so boring it was unreal.  DONT TAKE.  ,0
"She's obsessed with Ireland.  That's all she talks about in the spring semester, before her annual trip.  If you have a problem in the class, go outside and grab a stick. You'll get more assistance from it.",0
"Sincerely hope no-one ever has to get this prof ever again. He is quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  Refuses to actually help students, belittles students, and is very sarcastic.  He should, without question, be fired.",0
Jerk... I had him over 10 years ago... good to see he hasn't changed. at least he didn't totally kill my love for math (since I'm a math teacher now),0
"Awesome teacher. Had him for Landforms, and then took Weather and Climate strictly because he was teaching it too. Always available for questions, and concerns. Great sense of humor... okay so some of his jokes are pretty horrible, but he tries, and that's what makes it funny.  The earring was pretty sweet too.",1
"Surprised to read some of these bad reviews. I took his online class, and enjoyed it. The two journal reviews take time, but I thought he graded fair. Two quizzes a week, but they are not difficult if you have your book beside you. He likes a lot of detail in the discussions, but the topics were all interesting. Didn't think it was too much work.",1
Mike does not like his students. He acts as though students are idiotic unless they know what he is thinking and he is incredibly disorganized. He has no idea what he wants from his papers and gives grades seemingly randomly. He has ruined my love for literature this class. Discussions are bland and boring and he gets annoyed easily.,0
"Some people have posted that he's full of himself or that he's pompous, but the man can recite paragraphs of Shakespeare flawlessly, not to mention passages of Ancient Greek. He knows his stuff and he's wonderful at teaching it. If you knew as much as he did, you'd have reason to get on a high horse, too. Basically, the man is a genius.",1
"He's a really cool teacher, he'll talk about pretty much everything. He's really layed back and relaxed. He's pretty funny too.",1
This class will help you to become more aware of your work and thinking habits. There will be homework due every class but it shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes. She really cares about her students and honesty is really important to her. She's a very understanding professor who will work with you. Definitely take her if you can!,1
"hard grader, hard to understand, always adds more things to do for a paper when you are halfway done or done, so then you have to go back and add all the things he now wants you to do. ALL about the details, details, and more details. All you do is write papers the entire semester. Occasional quizzes and exercises.",0
"Well what can I say , I honestly think he could use some lecture time . If you come to class just know that you are coming for the clicker points and that is it, there will be no lectures you are on your own in this class and the sample exam have nothing to do with the real exams given. Good luck ",0
"This prof is mediocre at best. He drones on and on about only vaguely related topics to class material and it feels like he just yells at us to read random books that he likes. He isn't the worst prof I've had at WSU, but he definitely isn't the best. I find it very strange how many awesome reviews he has saying almost the exact same thing. Hmmm...",0
Overall he was so rude and unprofessional.. he was literally horrible and known through the school and student body as so. I wish I was able to take the class with someone else.,0
He is like a German Morgan Freeman! His voice is awesome! ,1
"She's Great Clear and to the point, breaks material down so you understand, stresses what pts you'll need  to no for test mutiple choice & matching only Gives realistic examples and has a Great sense of Humor She's so AWESOME that I'm taking her again for BI 152 Easy A as long as YOU apply Yourself",1
Glenn was an AMAZING teacher... def recommend it. Always available and understanding. Easy homework and tests. LOTS of homework...,1
"Quiz every week (VERY EASY), midterm/final (VERY easy), 2 discussion posts, 1 group project/powerpoint. Group project is fairly easy, answer 8 questions in group of 6. He is an easy grader - meet the required word count and you will pass. Overall a very easy class. Do the simple work and get an A.",1
He's a good professor. Very helpful and enthusiastic and passionate about what he does. But lectures are a little boring and uninteresting. Quizzes are very tough and the grading as well.,1
"Terrible prof. Do not take her courses. In class, attendance is mandatory. Online, the final is worth so much and a mandatory pass that the work all semester feels meaningless. She is a very nice person, but inconsistent with her level of understanding to certain situations. She doesn't teach, just summarizes what we are expected to learn ourselves",0
"There is a lot of work associated with this class, but it is all geared to help you prepare for a career and help you find a major for when you transfer to a 4 year institution. The textbook is frequently used. Dr. Laughlin is good at explaining things, and what is expected of you. She also has a great personality, and makes class itself fun.",1
"I wish he taught more classes!!! Great instructor! Really seems to enjoy teaching. Weird sense of humor, but over all a great guy.",1
"Didn't really learn anything in this class and the webpostings and miniprojects become a pain. Only graded on completion of assignment, and only other grade is the huge project at the end of the semester which is a pain, but you are allowed to turn it in over and over until you get the grade you want!",0
"Engelhardt knows his stuff. If you participate in class, it'll help your odds. However, you NEED to study a lot to do well on exams. (6-8 hours for a typical exam is fair for his class). His practice exams will take you by surprise compared to the actual exams. So ask questions, and you might just be successful. Exams have HUGE curves (10-20%).",0
"He is infatuated with China. Both the class and material are boring. During class he just walks around, barking his lecture material at students. There are three presentations, one midterm, one final and a group research paper. For the exams, there are a lot of opinionated essays and fill-in-the-blanks you have to memorize and write.",0
"This class was very interesting. Prof cornish taught this class well, good subject matter, not boring at all. Hes a good prof, gives good feedback. Lectures can be a bit long at times. Do some of the reading and go to most classes and you should be fine. Easy grader on papers and assignments. Overall nice and helpful guy.",1
An excellent educator.,1
"Well she's an amazing teacher if you don't need visual examples, not just words. Other than that, she does grad hard, she's messed up a couple of times while grading (Check your tests), she's nice but when they're idiots that constantly talk in class like it's high school she doesn't do anything except tell them to be quiet.Iwishshedmakethemleave.",1
"Very clear and organized. Handouts are very helpful when studying. Lots of material covered, but prof makes it easier to understand. In class short answer midterm and final.",1
"She is very fun, laid back, and genuinly cares about her students.  She was a great prof. to have for one of my first classes in college.",1
Shes really rude to her students well at lest the ones who dont know anything about ASL . I did 3 DLAs truin them in on time and she did not give me credit for it . Really rude as well . Dont take her . The book is over 100 in addition you have to pay an other 25 + do the DLA,0
"Ellen's lectures are so clear, they make the textbook totally unnecessary. The assignments are fun, and she is flexible about working solo on the project. I learned a lot.",1
Prof. Lane had one of the most straight-forward classes I've had. She makes sure to walk you through/thoroughly explain every assignment before making you do it on your own. She also gives unlimited tries on quizzes and assessments so there is no excuse for bad grades. Do your work and you are guaranteed a good grade.,1
"I hate the lab from his TA, seems like they are going to fail all students",0
"Easy, fun and interesting class that's completely self-guided & self-paced, you just complete all 5 open-book exams (the only things graded & the lowest of the 5 is dropped) by a certain date 10 weeks into the semester. You can spend very little time on it and get an A, but if you actually want to learn the stuff you'll spend lots of time reading!",1
"Top notch. Lectures clear, concise. Helpful in class. Communicates via e-mail too. Have a question? Ask away! Avoid missing class, each day is 5 hours. What you learn is applied practically (lab). Read supplied online book to supplement class. First few class days feel long, but feel shorter thereafter. Pursue if you have a passion for networking!!",1
"If you aren't very good at math I definitely don't recommend him. He talks very quietly and writes small on the chalkboard. He was constantly corrected by students and always having to look-up equations we were supposed to memorize. His tests are hard, although he does provide a study guide. I am halfway through his class and worried I won't pass.",0
"She has favorites, and most of the time they are girls, and it well be extremely clear when you're the only person to have your hand up and get completely ignored. Not sure how you can get on her ""badside"", but if are you're going to notice the difference in grading.",1
"Hard to believe she is still at UBC and teaching! I have nothing good to say about this instructor. She is late all the time, confused with work expectations, disorganized, never hands back assignments. I know that she is not a native French speaker, but sometimes it's really hard to understand her French. Never ever!",0
Anytime you are assigned a paper good luck. He is not clear at all on what to do for your paper is too vague about everything. He also only uses emails and the only way to know how you are doing in the class is by asking him directly. I have had him as a professor twice and this class is the worst of y experiences.,0
Very tough grader. She will fail you for very little things such as format. I would not take the class again. There are weekly blog posts and quotes on top of essays and readings. She does offer help outside of class and she does offer extra credit which is good. I would say around half the people dropped her class by the last drop date.,0
"Extreme asian (possibly Chinese) accent. I really did try to listen hard and take it all in, but honestly someone who is this unclear in the english language should NOT be lecturing in english...It really is not fair to the students. She seems knowledgeable, I'm not questioning that, but save yourself the trouble of needing a translator",0
"I took him as a breadth requirement thinking it would be easy, but it definitely wasn't. The lectures are painfully boring, doesn't make his lectures or notes available online, and he doesn't even have a gradebook online. Nice guy but unbelievably borin.",1
He is just the cutest and i felt bad about how miserable the class was. I could barely keep my eyes open. Everyone creates google docs for the current topic and textbook exams so attendance is pointless except for clicker points. It's an easy A for a gen ed if youre willing to listen to an old guy in an array of hawaiian shirts read online articles,1
"This professor made things way too easy. His class wasn't challenging in the least. We hardly did labs and were dismissed early most of the time. Lectures were alright; he's good at simplifying complicated subjects. However, I didn't even spend one second studying for this class and I got an A. That's how easy it was!",0
"She is the worst. I cant belive that anyone has actually said that they have liked her on here. This class sucks. She makes you feel dumb. You have a new paper to do probably every week. Her assignments are never clear and shes confusing. Shes also a nut. Save yourself, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",0
By far the best/hardest class i have every taken at UD.  Ackerman's class will always you to growth as a student and individual... The material is extremely interesting and at the end of the day the hard work was worth EVERYTHING.  You'd be missing out of a REAL college course if you didnt take a psyc class with him.  Nothing else like his classes.,1
Professor Hanna was awesome. I really enjoyed taking his class and listening to him speak. He has so much knowledge on the content he is talking about. You will have essays every week and discussions but if you do your work and make sure your work is cited correctly you cannot fail. He is very laid back and helpful. I would take his class again.,1
I took this class as one of my English program requirements and I want to take the rest of my classes with him. We only had two papers for the quarter and a small midterm paper. It is easy to get by doing just the reading for your essay and he is very helpful in giving you feedback before you turn in your paper.,1
She is nice throughout the semester but does not give any updates about grades. At the end of the semester she basically gives you what she wants you to have. No matter how well you actually did on assignments. She gave our entire class a letter grade below what we actually had because she felt like it. Take her at your own risk!,0
Take someone else if you can,0
"Mrs. Romani was great! I had her for CPR. She doesn't waste time and gets right down to the skills. Plenty of time to practice. It was actually a fun course! Man, she knows her stuff too. Take her for the weekend CPR class.",1
"Dr. Dudley is an all around friendly person! Don't be afraid to speak up if you have questions. He wants you to understand! You want an A in this class? Do all the quizzes and reach 100% ( gives you opportunity to rise grade), do the small assignments, do the extra credit and at least get a 75 % on all the exams. You will get that A still!",1
"Overall great prof, but he is not always clear when he's teaching. He's very helpful though and is willing to answer any/all questions. Although his material is quite difficult, he made it fun. I definitely recommend him.",1
"Honestly, one of my favorite professors at Ferris. His lectures initially seem a little unorthodox and rambling, but the information all ties in together for the test. He's one of the few professor that I recommend to other students. Great Professor!",1
"People complain that he's hard, but this class is so much easier than chem111L/110L.  Just do what he tells you with regards to your writing, and you'll be fine.  Ask him questions when you're confused.  He's definitely more relaxed in this lab, since he knows most of us, so get to know him; he's a nice guy.",1
"Dr. B is a caring professor. Computational Biology is his research area so he has a passion when coming into the class. For all of the machine learning algorithms he goes over, he does an excellent job of bringing the level of difficulty to a manageable level with simple explanations. Would take him for everything if I could.",1
"This was a hard class and I was struggling with some family health issues which put me behind.  Dr. Cyd was patient and understanding.  She motivated me to ""keep calm and carry on,"" while giving me attainable goals and practical suggestions.  She expected and encouraged quality work.   I learned a lot more than I had expected.",1
He is very hard to understand. Nice man but he is sort of socially awkward and mumbles quite a bit so it is hard to understand his lectures. The coursepack for the class is confusing.,1
"She never graded fair, not even when you completely understood the miserable material she preached. No discussion, 25 minutes per quiz for like 3-4 pages (SAT anyone?). Gives you a word and asks you to write and she can end up stating ""add more detail"" and giving u little credit for it. Wrote her textbook and shakes her jaw in disbelief whenspoken",0
"In my opinion, Professor Webb was great. He gave us all the tools we needed to succeed and for the midterm/final he was very specific on everything we needed to know.",1
"This teacher uses positive reinforcement to help students feel comfortable. I get nervous when I sign and she helped me overcome that. Enjoyable class, learned a bunch.",1
"Professor Hulsey, is NOT someone i would recommend to my worst enemy. She gives ALOT of grades so its not impossible to make a good grade. But class is useless because she just rambles about things she 'thinks' we struggle with. Needless to say, it is absolutely no help. Class is useless to go to, test average around 50-60, and she's no help.",0
"Attendance is mandatory. His teaching style is boring, honestly I'm not learning much from his lectures.",0
"My experience in Marcels class was probably the worst Ive experienced. Marcel does not care about his students. He only comes to class to receive his pay check and when he shows up, hes often late. Do yourself a favour, dont enroll in his class",0
Dreaded this class everyday that i had it. Couldn't wait to be done. This teacher takes alot of pleasure out of insulting kids on thier work and pointing out thier mistakes. He emails you late at night and gives you 50 pages of crap to read for a quiz the next day. Dont think he's an awful guy but dont take this if not serious about graphic design,0
Great Lecturer. One of the few teachers that could make me pay attention during the whole class. Exams are easy and he only tests you on relevant topic. Uses easy languague and makes class very interesting.,1
Professor Rizzella is amazing. I had her for stats and she makes math intersting. She tells stories and does more than lecture. There are a lot of assignments which is good because if tests are not your thing you have a lot of other ways to get a good grade. She's one of the best professors on campp,1
Best English professor. She helps you when you need help. Gives you feedback on what to improve and believes in you! The lessons and essays were easy. I enjoyed the class a lot.,1
"Great professor. I learned a lot from him. He cares for his students and does a great job presenting the notes. If you study the notes and do well on all HW's, it should be an easy BA. 3 midterms and 1 final. Yes he has an accent, but he's more than willing to help if you ask. Take him if he's an option for you. ",1
"Warren is rude, unorganized, and not very bright. Her lectures consist of stories about her family. Our class time is done and she says ""Oh! We are out of time. We will talk about our topic next time."" Yet halfway through the semester when it was time to take the midterm, we still hadn't gotten to any of the material. Cannot stress how rude she is.",0
"No tests/quizzes that were not take home. He is really up to date with whats going on with celebrities/movies/etc. has unique perspectives and is an all around nice and understanding guy. The online tests can be slightly tricky to find the specific answer, but not too bad. All notes are online. Would recommend him!",1
"Professor Joseph was really nice, but her class is extremely boring. Just four or so exams based on lectures, which are incredibly hard to sit through. She repeats herself a ton so it's hard to miss things, but really hard to actually want to listen to what she is saying. Nice, but brutal class to want to listen",0
She doesn't accept any late credit and gave an essay on the first week of class. I can't stress how unforgiving she is when a student makes a mistake. I wanted to take this class so that I could learn something about English but instead I can't stop myself from being discouraged because I missed an essay and now can't make up for it. 2/10,0
"He doesn't understand that this is class meant for non-science majors! He teaches it as if you need physics to succed in the world, every class there's a quiz and you have to read the textbook to do well on them but even then the textbook is hard to understand. Goes on tangents a lot and he will always keeps you until class has ended.",0
"He means well and is a nice guy, but he doesn't really answer any question you have for him fully and clearly. It seems like he is doing this in an effort to try to make you arrive to the answer yourself, but that doesn't really work for the amount of new material in this class. It's upsetting that he was the only option for this course for 2 years",0
"This is the absolute worst prof I have had. I CAN'T stress this enough, do not take his class if you want to pass. I am an amazing student, and I never once missed class, but he still managed to confuse me more and more. I also went to the tutoring for his class and STILL managed to not do well. Also, he only grades based on the THREE tests. BEWARE",0
Is the best professor at Russell Sage... hands down!! Classes are hands on and engage you in thought... Students get involved in class! Much different from most classes where all that happens is lecture with no class interaction.,1
"If you don't like to talk in front of a class, don't take him. He gives over 100 problems for homework and the only way to get credit for the homework is if you go to the ""homework days"" in which everyone, one by one, has to read the question and their answer. If you get it wrong and/or don't fully understand how to answer it correctly he gets mad.",0
Online quizzes are not as easy as the other posts make it out to be. Withdrew from class because of low quiz scores. The additional program you have to buy is also pretty pricy.,0
"Taken during COVID, she's too unaccustomed to online learning. Assignments were graded harshly, we got 0 feedback, and we didn't finish all the syllabus assignments due to her negligence. Had very little sympathy for students, answered questions with annoyed sighs and insults. Learned mostly through Pearson study modules & the textbook.",0
"She is a nice woman, and her accent is not hard to understand. The class as a whole is fairly easy, just do the readings and come to class. However, class itself is super boring! She talks to you all hour, instead of having it be a discussion on what we read. Also, she can be unclear on what she wants you to learn exactly. ",0
Class spikes sharply in difficulty  half way through. I tried to explain that I was struggling in the class because I was pouring all of my effort into calculus (another class required for business) and he really couldn't seem to care less,1
"If you want to learn about how to manage people, save your money and don't take this class- get a job at Chick-Fil-A intead. Seriously, if learning theorems and meaningless group projects is your cup of tea, by all means Prof. Crampton is your gal. She is the most scrupulous teacher you will ever meet. Do yourself a favor and AVIOD THIS CLASS!",0
"Nice guy, but not the greatest teacher. A third of his final exam was based on the last chapter of the book, which was only covered in a makeup class where only a few people went due to last minute scheduling and was never in any tutorials or assignment. He's better than other people teaching this course and better than some Concordia profs",0
It is hard to understand the material. He is a fair grader although tests are VERY hard. If 50%+ of the class gets a question wrong he won't count the question against you. The material is often too boring for me to even pay attention. I would not recommend this class but do enjoy the Prof. very nice. If the class avg is below 80 he adds a scale. ,1
He is the best teacher i have ever had. Don't take public speaking from anyone else. It is an easy A. As long as you show up and do the work you got an A. He is super nice. ,1
"Amazing professor. Uploads lecture videos that are informative and easy to follow so you don't really need the textbook. 6 class discussions, 3 homework assignments, 3 exams. Easy and straightforward. My favorite class by far.",1
very strict with turning things in and grades hard...,0
I was so excited about taking physics until I met this guy. His lectures didn't make any sense. He liked making people look stupid. He used the sample problems from the book for the in class problems. I ended up dropping the course because I couldn't get it. I didn't take the first test but talked to some classmates and most of then got 20-30%!!!,0
"Her lectures can be very confusing, and her extremely poor handwriting doesn't help at all. Because of that, quizzes were pretty hard. But if you study on your own and pay attention in the lecture class, it makes the class a little easier. Brittney is super nice and fun to talk to though. Cool person. Mediocre teacher.",0
Tuition worthy,1
This Professor was probably one of the most confusing and hard to read professors I have endured. She teaches a four hour class that can easily be taught in an hour and fifteen minutes. Only use her if there is no other open class.,0
"Overall, pretty good lecturer. Makes his material easy to follow, and gives helpful examples. However, be prepared for homework questions that you were not prepared for on quizzes. He also posts his own lecture notes online, and that is extremely helpful. once you get used to reading the right side of the page first.",1
"Very good teacher for the lecture portion of class, interesting and with great examples.  Lab lectures are incredibly boring and drawn out. This teacher takes far too long to grade exams, to the point where it feels disrespectful.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR CARIBBEAN BIODIVERSITY!!!!! Class grade only dependent on 3 exam grades out of 4 (1 is a cumulative final). The average grade for the last exam was a low D without the curve. He asks questions that are very specific about something he said during a lecture that he barely mentioned. Very unorganized way of teaching.,0
The last comment is totally not true and the most foolish thing I've ever heard.  Kristy invests herself in her subject matter and her students.  She is smart and creative and fun.,1
"This man taught me how to teach.  An incredibly clear lecturer who nurtures student interest by introducing motivation for material before presenting it such that the reasoning behind the material becomes intuitive.  Exams were extremely well-written, to the point of being fun.",1
hoity toity!!!,1
I love love love her!!! She is the best professor I have ever had. She works very well with students and is amazing. She loves what she does. I take her for every class that I need!!!!,1
"The content of SPAN 141 isn't particularly interesting (it's GRAMMAR), but our section made the best of it and we had a blast. Florencia is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I wish I could take more Spanish with her!",1
Wish there was another professor to teach this course at Fresno state. She doesn't offer plenty of extra credit which seems reasonable considering her test are extremely hard. You need to study so much for this class. She's tough on her students and expect you to know everything.,0
Makes the material easy to learn and he does not want to fail anyone. Gives chances for extra credit as well. Usually lets class out early.,1
"She's tough. But, if you pay attention in class and participate she'll teach you a lot. There is a lot of papers and quizzes. But, if you work hard she'll help you with your resume, cover letters and help you find an internship.  ",1
"This professor is absolutely awful, I would not recommend her at all. She tries really hard to sound smart but when she does it just gets confusing. She is very unclear when giving instructions and it is either her way or the highway. She is a hard grader and is not willing to work with you if you need help.",0
He explains how to do business algebra clearly and gives practice tests online if you do them youll be fine,1
"Based on my experience with Dr. Ayadi this semester, I do not understand the negative reviews. She is very knowledgeable and overall a great professor. Her class is organized and she tries her best to breakdown the  material. There are a few writing assignments but nothing over a page long. I recommend taking her.",1
"He assumes you have had experience with coding even though this is an intro class. Tells you to look at Arduino reference pages, which are helpful but you need to learn how to code essentially on your own.",1
"His lectures are interesting and his exams relate to the lecture with the exception of a few questions about the chapter readings. He requires the same book for both 141 and 142, which is helpful in making what student pay for the textbook worth the buy.",1
"Dr. Courtney Ray is an obviously inexperienced teacher. She had 4 wrong answers on her midterm that she had to correct for all students. She assumes it's your fault if you bring an issue to her attention. She's pretentious. She does not explain what she requires for the essays, then lowers your grade when you don't do it exactly how she wants.",0
"She's such a nice person and takes time to learn your name. However, I would not recommend this professor. Lectures are very fast paced and EXTREMELY hard to follow. You need to be in class for the material to make any sense, and it's a tough class to want to attend. Expects you to read 5 books throughout the semester and have 4 tests. Would avoid.",0
Took SI101R (with another prof) and did well. And then decided to take 102R and he excepted us to be masters of the language even though we were still in a 100s course. Will not take another course with him AGAIN!!  ,0
"I had her for my first and ONLY online class and she was extremely rude. I wasn't handling the online environment well and let her know that, but she wasn't receptive. She would send out email reminders for class discussion but not for quizzes!? She gave others full points for writing a sentence or two on discussion, so feel free to slack on that.",0
"She really cares about her students and has a very open lecture and takes any questions that people have and do her best to answer them. Her tests are tough but you get a two sided cheat sheet for each test and can use them all on the final. Her lectures can kind of be all over the place, has no power point slides and hard to follow at times.",1
"SO FREAKING HARD.  I had to retake this one.  She never explained ANYTHING in this class and it was completely independent.  No tests, 85% of the grade rides on 5 papers.  RIDICULOUS.  Courtad or Kessler allllll the way.",0
"Its very tough to do well here unless youre a native speaker. Favoritism is rampant & melanin seems to interfere with his hearing aids. The more you have, the less you are heard. The grading criteria varies without warning & you will not know how your grade will turn out until its already over. Take his overall rating literally.",0
This professor is doing nonsense thing! She asked me to rewrite my essay twice just because she didn't tell want I need to achieve at once! Now I have less than a week to write a final essay! It is killing me!,0
"Goes over nothing in lecture all the quizzes are based strictly on reading from the book.  Nice guy, he's pretty funny and didn't have a final exam but was a terrible teacher.  Class time was pointless the only reason I went was because he would give us journal questions we had to answer and the only way to get them was in class.",0
Probably the most horrific class you could take. Sitting through this class is miserable. Very arrogant. His tests are next to impossible for most.,0
"Prof. Whitmer is the worst professor I have ever had. No rubric for assignments. I went to office hours, he smirked at me the entire time I spoke, and then refused to give guidance. He kept most students at a D or and F til the end of the semester, and then assigned ""participation points"" based on what grade he wanted to give. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!",0
Enjoys teaching and will answer any question that you have.,1
"Miller is an extremely tough teacher. I mean this in the nicest way possible, but his voice is extremely hard to tolerate. Your final grade is composed of 4 exams that are not similar to the ridiculous amount of optional homework that he assigns.  He's also not helpful when asked questions. Our class always went over by 15 mins. Do not recommend.",0
"One of the worst decisions you could make in your life to take this prof. Unintelligible, lacks knowledge, and his lectures are all over the place. He shows us useless videos and you literally cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. Project/labs are difficult and asks for more than what he teaches. Literally regret taking him so much.",0
"taylor is very very willing to help, enjoys the maestro, subtly insults the idiots in the class, and knows his****. learn it or don't, he doesn't care. and thus, why he's hot.",1
"The best professor I've had at JMU (and I'm going into my senior year). I really enjoyed his class; he constantly changes things up by using videos, guest speakers, and group activities. I highly suggest taking him! Such a sweet guy.",1
"A very good teacher for a very good class. Highly recommend above all the other MGT268 profs.  Exams are based on quizzes and book, so lecture is more for understanding.  Assignments challenge thinking, and are normally group projects. He's very helpful towards students on all subjects.",1
"He lectures slowly so you will be able to take good notes and understands him. He is there to answer any questions during and after class. He gives group project which helps a lot because students are able to help one another to understands the material. Do not miss class,  study and do your homework; you will be fine.",1
He truly cares about all of his students and wants to see them become amazing teachers. He tries to give his students real experience with teaching by setting up volunteering in schools and by giving real papers to grade. He gives great lectures that make you realize how you want to teach. Homework is pretty light and resembles what a teacher does.,1
He isn't always the most clear and doesn't necessarily get up to teach this course. He makes you learn proofs by presenting them. Its pretty easy to rack up points and he has a unique grading scale that pretty much gaurentees you to pass if you come to class,1
"Ive taken all of the calculus sequences and passed with an A in all of them. Hes a great lecturer, but often his lessons are not as structured as you may expect. He always told us that he lectures off the homework, meaning he will display the homework problems and base his lecture off how to solve that problem set. Hes a great and funny teacher.",1
"I love Mr. Fultz!! He is so funny, cares about his students, and makes anatomy fun and interesting. Granted, he gets very sidetracked and distracted, but he is a great professor and I would recommend taking him.",1
"Avoid Sandy Hanson at all costs. Im not joking when I say she makes her students MISERABLE. Shes a horrible teacher I have no idea how she has a job to be honest. Shes completely inconsiderate, doesnt give a crap about her students. Not even a little bit. She basically talks to herself during class because nobody can stand to listen to her crap",0
At first I hated the subject matter but professor was so inspirational that it got me through. I learned a lot but I'm just not into business ethics. Greatest Prof!,1
hard teacher and can be rude at times so watch out,0
Great teacher. Made class fun and enjoyed it.,1
She applies the ENS curriculum to the world so her students can apply it to what is happening in the world. Her graders grade fairly which can be a rarity. One would have to TRY to fail her course because she really does hold your hand and give extra credit. The work is rewarding for ENS majors. Take early in college career or else it is not new.,1
As long as you participate the class is easy. You need the textbook to answer packets but if you can find one for cheap you're set. All grades are papers and if you email them to her ahead of time she'll give you feedback so you get an A.,1
"Hes a decent guy but the way he teaches class is ridiculous. Your grade is based off of 2 exams and the final and for the 2 exams he grades so hard. Theres vocab with no word bank, any little detail he takes off points, hes just not a good professor, do everything you can to avoid him in order to save your gpa",0
"He barely looks at the stuff you turn in. I would definitely take him again. Kind of awkward, lectures are boring. Textbook ""mandatory"" (everything can be found online). All around great teacher. He makes class fun! Gives a lot of pop quizzes but he pretty much tells you on the previous class.",1
"Teacher that does not like students despite what he himself thinks. Overall, the class was uncomfortable with an almost hostile feeling to it. He also does not understand modern approaches to software projects. Class also does not have a lot of resources. You will be punished for using internet for help (not code copying). Also no piazza.",0
Tests are a little tough and unreasonable at some points. Going to class is a must.,0
"Ms. Long was the best college professor I've ever had. Her class was the only one I ever looked forward to! She loves teaching and she really just loves people! her favorite is people who are willing to think outside the box. To make an A in her class, show up every day, prove that you're trying and just act like you care! She's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Unclear, but you can corner him and envoke a lie and catch him with it. Likes costco, anything google gets him to bust a nut. If you want an A you'll need to go over the top on all assignments and make him feel warn and fuzzy with terminology. Giggity.",0
Marvin is certainly the worst professor i have ever had! do not take his classes they are terrible and he is a aweful teacher. i have never rated a professor before but he is just to awful to not.,0
"She isn't a tough grader but she's very politically correct. Often brings up discussions about race, discrimination, and the like which can sometimes make you uncomfortable. She's a decent professor overall.",0
"wow. how awesome. I paid 3grand to watch two ""professors"" read a PowerPoint. I thoroughly enjoyed that neither of them demonstrated hkw to approach a single exam question. Great way to TEACH someone! impressed!",0
"If you enjoy hearing the word ""um"" incessantly, this class is for you.  Prof Miiler is a terrible teacher.  Don't let her nonsense critiques of your papers fool you...she honestly doesn't know what she's doing.  If I were you, stay away!",0
I liked his lectures and that's about it.  Jeans were too tight.  :(,0
"Mrs Jensen has a great deal of experience in her field. She tends to share stories in her lectures, but they always build on her subject. She's tough, but she's more than happy to work with you on your assignments. She likes to leave her office door closed during her office hours, so if you need her don't be afraid to knock!",1
A+ ego and F- in every other category. The only pleasant experience youll get from his class is closing his atrocious 1997 websites.,0
"Took this class online- Pretty easy...you have to do the work- Discussions all the time, quizzez, & tests just about weekly. Just do the work, i got an A.",1
"Takes points off for the wrong hue of yellow. If creative choices do not align with her own, points are lost. Spent most of class on non-class topics. Breaks lasted upwards of 45 min., covering new topics with 5 min. left of class, running over. Welcomed outside students into her class to interrupt lectures. Take with someone else.",0
Professor Brunner is an awesome professor. If you are an Econ student at CMU he is one of your best bets to take. If you take notes and pay attention in class you will pass. He is also a very nice guy and is very flexible about missed classes,1
"She is someone I  have so much respect for, someone I learned so much from, and someone I  look up to. I had Jayne Lobert for 141, theory, clinical, and 153 theory. . She is not easy, but she is definately an awesome instructor,and a teacher I will always keep in contact with. Be prepared to work hard cuz she doesn't put up with stupidity.",1
"Professor Cho talks very fast during her lectures, and if you miss one you will be lost. There are 3 exams and they're worth about 70% of your final grade. Her lectures are long and difficult to understand. I don't recommend this class to anyone.",0
Excellent teacher,1
"He used a graduate level text for an undergrad course.  Highlight of the course: ""This is a very important theorem that we will use a lot"" followed by, ""I am not sure it's true"" when after about 10 minutes he couldn't prove it.  I think he used that course as a vehicle to get paid to review group theory for himself.",0
really hard class. lectures are irrelevant to midterms and final. midterms and final contain unseen problems,0
I had Professor Watkins for two classes. He really knows his stuff. I think the best part of the class was that what he talked about he had actually experienced it by being there. I really wish he taught more classes because I learned alot from him. His attendence is not mandatory but you will fall behind if you don't come.,1
He is my favorite forever!,1
"Dr. King is a very interesting professor & clearly knows a lot about Africana studies. His lectures are a little long, but if you pay attention & take good notes, you should be fine. 3 film reviews a semester, 1 midterm, & 1 final. Take your time & edit your film reviews & you should be fine. Shows interesting (yet intense) films.",1
This professor is very laid back with assignments and feedback. Is light hearted and can joke around with students. TONS of useful knowledge and very helpful with everything.,1
"I was completely lost.  Tests did not accurately reflect the homework.  You had to really understand the concepts (and I did not).  Tests were open notes/book, but it really didn't do much good.  I got a B because I randomly did well on one test, but I didn't learn anything.  My grade was pure luck.  Most of the dept. sucks so I guess he's alright.",0
the worst professor,0
worst proffesor i have ever had do not take music theory if you were never in band,0
Horrible!!! If you can avoid her please do! She is not so helpful.. Her exams are confusing and does not require a textbook. She has you read articles of moodle. (I rather study something of the book) She gives you a option of writing a 10 page paper or join a group and present in front of 120 + students. Avoid her if you can : /,0
"The worst professor I have had at W&M. She does not communicate well with students and is very hard to reach outside of class. This class was super interesting, but head this warning and take it with a different professor. AVOID PILKINGTON!",0
"Sometimes, I want to purposely get into a car accident to avoid his class. The workload is extremely heavy... although its just copying but beware lab reports. Bless your soul if you have him. But outside the classroom he's dope, he's a great dude.",0
I learned a lot about art and myself taking this class.  Mi-Sook is a nice person and knows her stuff.  She pushes you to do your best which sometimes stresses you out.  She's honest and tells you if your project sucks.  Expect to spend time and money on every project.  BE PREPARED TO MISS SLEEP WHILE TAKING THIS CLASS. Take if dedicated to art.,1
"Knows the subject and explains it very well. Grading ambiguous in the beginning of the semester I took this class. It felt as though you had to write EXACTLY what he was looking for--not an easy task due to the expansiveness of the tax code, but he lightened up as the semester went on. Very sarcastic, but you quickly learn it isn't personal.",1
"The professor is the worse professor I have ever met. There's pretty much zero practical explanation of the material in class, and exams are ridiculously difficult- it's as if your expected to memorize every little tax rule and condition, as writing everything down on a cheat sheet using the textbook takes far too long.",0
Take this class. You will learn! Not your typical WST class.,1
"I loved Dr. Soljan as a person, but I hated being in his class. I dreaded going to class because it was so unstructured and hard to follow what was going on. The only grades were 3 papers that everyone seemed to get an A on, which was nice, but I do not feel like I have learned anything about mythology overall. Class was not worth my time or money.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF! His grading is extremely unclear and it is impossible to get an ""A"" on the papers and discussions boards. He will pick apart every little detail and give you a ""B"" at best its very annoying. I am an ""A"" student and this class is killing me. I was told I only have a basic understanding... it is a 100 level intro course",0
"Mr. Prey is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Yes, his tests are hard. You have to study, and do so regularly, but you will make memories. You will learn a lot, and you will get out of your comfort zone. I had a tough time with the content in this class. There's a lot to learn, but he makes it as easy as he can, while making you work for it.",1
Super interesting. Not an jerk. What more could you really ask for?,1
"Awful! This professor didn't care at all abou tthe course and was a very hard grader. Instructions were never clear and she gave NO feedback! awful awful, would never take a course with this professor again. If you have this professor... drop the course",0
Sarver puts a 20 point curve on every assignment and test. Not because he is easy but because all his quizzes and test are very hard. He didn't use the book but expected us to read the chapters and understand it without using it in class. The tests went way more in depth than the notes ever did.,0
"Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit.",0
"The top ISOM prof. at GMU. Took him for MIS310. Homework, quizzes and exams are challenging, but as long as you attend the class and read the slides, you will get a good grade. In my time at mason, I never learned as much as I did in this class. If you get a class with him, you are in luck. His seats are in high demand. I would highly recommend.",1
"No assignments for 6 weeks, a couple of weeks with normal workload, and then suddenly slammed with oral exams and tests and compositions. Doesn't respect her students, seems to believe that any problems learning stem from them, not her teaching style. Says (in writing) that material won't be on a quiz and then it is. Worst prof I've ever had. AVOID",0
Very boring class. The work you do in her class has nothing to do with computers. She gets mad when you try to ask her questions DO NOT TAKE HER.  She is the worst professor i have ever had in my college career!,0
"Professor Pitney is awesome in class- beyond intelligent, humorous, and genuinely wants participation. No tests, only papers. Very specific in what style of writing he wants.",1
"Yasser is a very nice person, and a very intelligent professor as well. However, don't expect to get clear answers when you ask a question in class. His exams are based primarily on his notes from the board, so you really cannot afford to miss class, UNLESS he refers to a textbook for the whole semester.",0
"Shenton is an amazing man and works hard to get you understand the material.  The class itself is hard, but if you stay on top of the material and homework it is possible for an A.  ",1
"Prof. Gross is a good teacher. Her lectures are easy to follow. Her tests were difficult for me. They're separated into the following sections: lecture, book, and online labs. The questions from the book are from her study guides, but they are very time consuming. She posts her lectures on BB, but she talks of test information during lecture.",1
"He isnt as bad as people make him out to be but at the same time his in class teaching isnt helpful. Your grades in 3 tests, a final, and homework. I passed by working in the homework until I got a 100 and I took time to learn the material outside of class. I was 1 of 2 people who passed my class",0
This teacher is awesome! I learned so much from this class and I actually retained a lot of the information. He is a public defender with great stories.I would totally recommend him. LOVED HIM!! :),1
"The lectures were very confusing and proof oriented. The homework did not relate to the lectures, but was very easy. The exams were then based on the lectures and extremely difficult. The questions were worded poorly due to her poor English. Take this review with a grain of salt, I am not a math major and I did not take 1  prerequisite course.",0
"As someone who struggles with science, I dreaded taking it. Prof Cox has made it as enjoyable as possible by providing relevant connections, great readings and videos. She is an extremely charismatic lecturer even on video, and great at explaining complex concepts in understandable ways. The amount of work is reasonable. Take her class!",1
"Dr. Rivas is engaging but relaxed.  He believes in student led discussions that allow for conceptual exploration and explanation of the texts.  Not the easiest course due to thick academic reading, but very thought provoking and useful for future educators, or aspiring writers.  Well worth the required reading and rhetorical response writing.",1
"Well, she has an accent which makes it difficult to understand her at times but she is nice and helpful, so if you don't hear what she says, just let her know. She is sometimes a bit boring as well (or maybe it's the class that is boring).",1
Hes a great guy and is always willing to help you but he really loads on the work and its not always clearly explained,1
"prof. frazel is the such a great teacher, very willing to meet outside of class for help and super funny. lots of memorization for quizzes and tests, but totally pays off. overall, just a funny guy teaching latin.",1
"i do not understand how she has 100% rate on taking her again as a professor. She is very tough and treats her students like they do not know anything. Only she does. Honestly, she can be rude at times. Her material is hard and overwhelming. You must come home and teach yourself the chapter because all she does is talk about her stories.",0
"Doc is a HORRIBLE professors. Nice guy, but a HORRIBLE teacher. He is very vague and confusing. He changes his mind about his ""research"" every class. All he talks about is himself and his connections (which aren't even that useful). Waste of class and waste of time. I will not take one of this classes again. Also, HORRIBLE test writer.",0
"This professor tries to make sure that you understand the material. However, the homework is harder than it is on the quizzes and he gives either 2 or 1 chances on the homework. As long as you don't skip class too much and you really focus on the lectures and you know the material from calculus I really well, this class is not too bad.",1
Dr. Curtiss is an excellent professor. She knows the material inside and out and will do everything to ensure you get as much from the class as possible. She expects you to work for your grade- which I appreciate. Tough grading and high expectations are what have shaped me into the statistician I am. I have had her for STA315 & STA317. ,1
"SUCH an amazing teacher! My graduation was hinging on this class that I had attempted to take several times from other professors and the content was dull, as were the teachers. Not this guy! Hes amazing at teaching content that could easily put you to sleep, but he makes it interesting and relatable, therefore easier to retain. Recommend 100%.",1
Just No,0
"Prof. Moss is a funny guy & the class is easy. Only three tests are taken during the year and he drops the lowest score @ the end of the quarter. MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS. My grade went from an 84%-73% bc of it. Didn't realize how strict he was about it until end of course. Perfect grade on final presentation & essay, but still got a C.",1
Weekly Journal and homework every week usually takes me 3-5 hours each. 5 exam + Final are out of blues range 20-30%. 20 multiple choices worth 3 points each and 2 essay of 20 points each. Some found on Quizlet some found on Teacher's testbank. My first class in Mira Costa with great disappointment for a hard working student. avoid this teacher.,0
"She is the worst professor. I got a good grade but I didn't gain any new information. The class is so boring. she thinks she deserves the noble prize. to pass the class you should study off her powerpoint, textbook, OLD TESTS, note outlines, do all of the problems in the books and the reviews. I think you'll be fine then.",0
"Professor Wood was one of many teachers I was truly honored to have. She's very endearing and cares about her student's success and well-being. This class is very informative and very helpful with improving public speaking and confidence, and Professor Wood's expertise and knowledge really helps add to your communication skills. Would take again!",1
"Attendance is mandatory, he knows everyones name and calls on you randomly in class. You have to work hard for this class but he is a great teacher. He is the only professor for this class. GO to class, study the old exams, do ALL the EXTRA CREDIT POSSIBLE. You have to really work to understand the material but if you work hard you'll get an A.",1
"Horrible. Will never take another class with her again. However, it is noticeable that she will grade easier on you if she likes you. So get on her good side, she is a very biased grader.",0
"Took this class online. 4 exams each worth 16 points. 8 assignments each for 2 points, 11 guided exercises and 8 quizzes both each for 1 point. Easiest class you'll ever take at UD. Just listen to lectures, do the guided exercise and you'll do just fine. To give you an idea of how easy it was, class average on all exams was about 90%.",1
"Prof Sethia is one of the best Grad Student Professors Ive had. The course material is pretty much the same for every Prof teaching the course and she teaches it well. If you have trouble, let her know and she will go out of her way to help you learn. The class is definitely useful overall too so try your best.",1
"Took his Irish History class, easily one of the most influential and well-taught classes I've ever taken. He's usually pretty difficult as a teacher, but the content is rich, he's VERY informative, and he is an AMAZING human being. If you're up for a challenge, he comes with my top recommendation!",1
"He means well, but he makes the material way more complicated than it needs to be. It doesn't help that the TA he has, is on his own agenda. If Dr. Meserve says he is only concerned with logic, that means you'll be graded on logic, as well as finite details. Lots of reading, having the book is a must. Tests are also pretty hard.",0
Posted all the assignments online. Responded to questions quickly through email.,1
I would not recommend taking Roe at all. Only grades are 50% midterm and 50% final. He is disorganized and rambles in class. We had a textbook and 4 ethnographies to read. If you end up in this class do all the extra credit because it will save your grade. He does curve which is good though. But not an easy breadth requirement.,0
"Great teacher. 4 unit tests 15-20 questions-review is the class before it, he does the review in class and it's exactly like the test just different numbers+if you complete it you get bonus points. 1 final of 30 quest no bonus points. No mid-term. Mymathlab HW due on the day of each test - easy!!! I suck at math but he makes it easy for you.",1
He is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. All he does is wastes people's time with the stupid videos he plays which are unrelated to the topic.,0
"Jaymi is a very boring lecturer, even while teaching an intro to public speaking class. The lab sections for this class are hit or miss based on your TA. If you can take this class online or with someone else definitely recommend, because it will be easier if the lectures don't put you to sleep as fast.",0
Not really his subject but filled in after regular prof left the country.  Was interesting at times and always helpful and honest about what he knew.  Will take one of his regular courses as soon as possible.,1
"Gives assignments on coding, but all grading is done through an online grader; to pass, you need to go to class and record every minor detail he might drop on how to format your code, because the assignments are written rather vaguely.  Office hours were a must, otherwise the chances of getting every formatting detail correct are minimal.",0
"Really smart professor- he knows what he's talking about.  Interesting lectures and yes, hard exams, but if you listen to him, you'll do well.",1
"McConkey is a great teacher. Interesting lectures and personal stories however he does put that information on his tests, it's helpful to at least get recordings of lectures if you're not in class. Would recommend taking him, would also recommend trying from the start. Each test counts a lot.",1
"I honestly don't know if she's a good teacher or not. She was extremely late giving back work and grading assignments and didn't respond well to inquiries regarding assignments. Additionally, none of the dates or assignment values matched when looking at the syllabus versus the actual assignments. Really disappointed.",0
"Like below, nice person, god awful teacher. Although she is willing to help when needed, she's not clear on anything during class. The subject is hard enough. The first test she gave a sheet of about 200 anatomy terms to know and about 30 were on the test, its like that for every test. Waste of time studying and guessing whats on test. FRUSTRATING",0
"Weekly quizzes, homework, math gym and pre-class assignment is not mandatory but really helps your grade. There were 4 test and 1 final exam. My best advice is to take the practice test seriously and do as many versions as you can. Come to class because of i-clicker quiz questions, which also help your grade. Things i wish i knew before this class.",1
"Never a boring class, you do get a lot of work but everything you do is helpful and essential to getting a good grade on the essays. Readings can get a little overwhelming for some, but it wasn't a problem for me. Her class does require a lot of time outside class, but if you fulfill all the requirements and ask for help you will pass",1
"Nick's a funny guy, and even though his lectures are long, he tries to make them funny and engaging, while teaching you at the same time. The tests are decently hard if you're aiming for an A, so don't take them as a joke. I got a B+ on my first 2 tests, but aced the final and ended with an A. Overall, he's a great teacher and actually cares!",1
never take him stay away.  useless professor.,0
"Dr. B is extremely passionate about what she teaches. She in knowledge about environmental science and that shows through her lectures. All of the texts are hand written but that only makes you study harder so you actually can recall the material youve learned. If youre passionate about environmental science, youll enjoy it!",1
"Obviously a very smart man, but he showed up to lectures late more often than not and was unprepared for them the vast majority of the time. Taking this class over the summer with him was probably a bad idea, considering the pacing and that he was hardly ever available outside of class.",0
Horrible is the only way to describe her. She does not respond to emails and the assignments make absolutely no sense.,0
Clover Leary is an amazing professor. She's very supportive and organized.,1
"Laptop's are not allowed, must write power point slides. You have an online 4 exams of 100 questions and 4 quizzes of 20 questions. Notes are allowed but write everything as the quiz is still difficult. Group project and presentation at the end was hard, a lot of research and a lot of writing! Participate and do your work and you'll pass.",1
"This professor just reads off of her slides and goes through them really fast. She rarely participates with the class. She DOES give partial credit on exams which is, I guess, a plus. If you miss a class don't worry because she posts her slides on blackboard. She gives study points that don't really help and she's terrible at explaining things.",0
"Awesome lady. Does her best to help you understand everything. 3 essays make up 90% of your grade, and 10% is participation and attendance. Go to class, do the essays well, and walk away with an A.",1
"Worst teacher I've ever had. Better be an artist and he will still degrade good work. To subjective. Waste of semester and money. Surprised hes employed. Something is off with this guy, on drugs, mind is in space somewhere.",0
"The class is easy.  She gives review guides for exams, and homework is for completion grades.  She posts the notes online before class, so you can follow along.  Class is very boring, but she is nice.  I wouldn't take her again just because class is so boring, but i would recommend her for an easy A.",1
"Jeannette is awesome. She really cares about each student in her class, and will work with you to improve your business communication skills. The class is tough, but she does a good job of making all of the effort worth it.",1
Kageyama's class is really something. He knows his stuff but I don't think he knows how to teach it. The tests are almost nothing like the powerpoints or textbook. He had random questions that had nothing to do with Genetics or anything we've discussed in class. You're better off not studying or getting another professor.,0
Professor Wenstrom is the best math teach I've ever had. Her energetic and happy personality makes this class so much fun! If anybody has a question or an issue she is always there to help them. I highly recommend her!,1
"One of the laziest online professors I ever had the misfortune of taking. Save your gpa and take another science class because as the previews reviews have stated, he really does not care because he's more concerned about people cheating in his tests (can't even find his questions online anyway?)",0
"If you have to take a history class at Ship, take it with Godshalk. As long as you show up to class, write down notes (which he provides on D2L in Powerpoint format) and participate, you will succeed. He gives ample extra credit opportunities - some being eating at the dining hall during a ""dine through the times""  event. How could you pass up that",1
"A nice guy and always willing to help those struggling in the class. The content of the course is not difficult but if you have any questions, he's willing to answer them. If you're struggling with the workload or directions for an assignment, he's willing to work with you to ensure everything gets done. Participation is key for his course.",1
"Enjoyed this class. She is a little scattered at times, but does her best to keep on top of everything.",1
If you can take a different professor do it! You can tell he knows the material but does a horrible job of teaching it. Homework is assigned before you even learn that chapter and takes hours! You turn in homework for completion so you never know if its done correctly or not. He has a funny personality but can come off as rude at times.,0
Avoid him if possible. I was sick and missed one class on a quiz day and it completely ruined my grade. He told me he would work with me and then the end of the semester came and he acted like he didnt know me. Told me not to worry about my grade because its in the past. Dont even try emailing him because he will not respond.,0
"Umm, do not take him! As someone who nerds out over different cultures, I was looking forward to Anthro but was SO disappointed. TAs run the class (he rarely comes)we mainly watch old videos form the 30's, read bland books, & are lectured about old white mennothing interesting really. He is just cashing in on his seniority & needs to retire soon.",0
Couldn't see anything he wrote on the board and neither could the rest of the class. First used chalkboard then projector but the glare from the lights washed it all out. Could never follow his work. Quizzes every 1-2 weeks homework due every class. Gives extra credit for attendance. Sometimes sits us alphabetically for exams. Would not recommend.,0
"Barger is a great prof and keeps you entertained during an 8:30 am lecture, he is easy going and enjoys class discussions, he marks quite hard but if you put the effort in you will do great! Favourite prof!",1
"I took three of Prof. Byrne's writing classes, and I was sad that I ran out of courses I could take with him.  He was an excellent writing professor, and he took time to discuss each individual's style. The reading material he assigned was always helpful.  His evaluations of our writing were always fair and honest.  He is one of VU's finest!",1
"Professor Rodriguez was knowledgeable about the class which was very easy. Lots of discussion in class, which made the class go by quicker. Had great examples to share. 2 text books are required, but yet we did NOT use them, so save your money and do not buy them. you can find your exam answers on the power point slides. he gives out a study guide.",1
"Not clear, unapproachable, isn't coherent. His tests aren't feasible. Tests are based off of his lecture notes if you can even call them lecture notes. Instead of being objective in the material he is teaching he likes to throw in how he sees the topic. This class isn't convenient for visual learners.",0
"Cares more about how you present your work then what you present. Spent a large amount of time covering Chicago style, and tells us we'll get 10% off an essay for missing periods in the footnotes. Quizzes are easy, read to participate, and get ready to be bored at his slow style. Grades toughly for not following the instructions *exactly* as typed.",0
"Horrible teacher.  I skipped 1001 because of my ACT scores, and I dropped this class right after midterms.  He gave me a 0 on m first paper because my criteria was not clear enough, and a 0 on my second paper because I used the word ""they"" instead of ""she.""  I do NOT recommend him to anyone.",0
"Saralina is pretty great. Very bubbly and energetic and makes a speech class a little more exciting. She is a tough grader and if you don't complete assignments or show up to class then you might have difficulty. Overall, she was pretty fun and I enjoyed how she brought the discussion of art related things into what we were learning.",1
He is the best professor in MMC. Can't say more than this.,1
"Professor Hardgrove comes across as a teacher who could care less to answer questions or clarify course content, in fact, she portrays it as a burden. If you are having trouble understanding a particular section she will not give positive feedback to help you understand. Assignments are long and tedious.",0
"She allows two days to be skipped but other than that you start to lose points. I missed four days in total and my attendance was a 50 out of 100 and two of those days didn't count against me. If you don't do speech night, then she is tough on your speeches. Her grading changes every class and she rarely pays attention during a speech.",0
Worst teacher I've had here.The course has no pre-requisite but he acts like you should already know a lot about music. Goes way too fast and gives a lot of work. The textbook is way too hard to understand. He knows a lot but is very snobby about it and if your opinion doesn't agree with his then it's wrong.,0
Great prof! Tests are short answer and fill in the blank but he tells you exactly what you need to know to get an A. He's an awesome lecturer & you'll always look forward to class. The TAs do post notes but take your own since they have sometimes have a few errors. Highly recommended.,1
Didn't really understand the lectures,0
"Dr. Williams provides many opportunities for extra credit which is really cool. His lectures are a real drag though, and I mean a real drag. Overall, if you go to the test reviews and do the study guide, you should make an A in the class. But, attendance is mandatory, which isn't fun because the lectures are a little boring.",1
"Great teacher, id recommend her!",1
"He's one of the more difficult professors I've had, but also the BEST at actually teaching the subject. He is blunt, and doesn't sugar coat the information. More than EARNING your grade you will have a better understanding of the subject matter compared to fellow students taking a different professor. Take him if you want to learn, not for an A.",1
"Most of the class time is spent listening to him talk about himself, which seems to be the only reason he came out of retirement to teach. He includes a page long resume/biography about himself on his syllabus. You have to keep track of your classmates, and report on their whereabouts to the entire class, which takes about half the class.",0
hate this class. she made the experience of learning about children boring and in fact made me want to switch my major.,0
"This class was easy for me as I had prior experience in the engineering field going into this program. A couple of group projects and some pretty hard homework and tests. If you are weak in math or engineering is not for you, don't expect to pass. I put in about 10 hours per week. Creativity and precision is key in this course.",1
"Zarb is a friendly guy, but I don't care for how he'll spend the whole hour going over our homework.  Makes the hour go by very slowly.",1
"Very good person but very hard to understand. He is all over the place, coming in and out of the textbook, sometimes using it but then crafting his own thought as well. Never gave any homework only quizzes. No tests or final.",0
"This teacher failed to provide an adequate learning experience due to the fact that she was terrible at focusing on the main topics. At times, it felt as if she was simply reciting the material from the text. She also would assign exams almost every other week that required memorization of the most minute and pointless details. Worst teacher ever.",0
Avoid!!! I wish someone would've told me about her earlier. Slick throws the shade if you don't understand something.,0
"PLEASE disregard any positive  comments since 30 May 2010.  Prof. Debessay sent out emails to his ""A"" students asking for good evaluations: TOTALLY UNETHICAL -  in reality, his students cannot understand him/his accent, he doesn't teach current issues, and he is known as one of the WORST profs. in the department per evaluations. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Although the test were very hard (highest grade was 50), I still made an A because of all the extra assignments. They were all easy, fun, and interesting. She is also very funny in class.",1
"Professor Peters is a really good option for psych 101. I enjoy her class despite it being 3 hours long. Her syllabus is spot on, there are no surprises. She explains things really well and breaks up the 3 hours with group work or interesting videos. I cant imagine anyone rating her badly.",1
"Very personable and explains things well. He co-taught this class with another prof (who was terrible) and under the circumstances he did the best he could to help us understand the other prof's material. Going to class is a must because I maybe opened the ""textbook"" once and he didn't have powerpoints.",1
"Sara is a great teacher! Whether or not you are a social work major, her classes are always really interesting.",1
"Pretty easy class. 2 papers and 2 tests, as long as you pay attention and read the material the tests are fairly easy. I always studied the night before and passed but I do recommend you take the time to read everything when they go over it. She's super nice and loves what she's teaching. Would recommend!",1
"Dr. Allen is so nice and he's intelligent. But he does not know how to teach. He literally reads and repeats the chapter headings and that's it. He repeats everything like 20 times but doesn't EXPLAIN anything. He puts the ""next best answer"" on the exam versus the actual answer. Had to withdrawal from the class.",0
"I Totaly agree with other comments below. Great guy, BUT can't teach. Make you look like stupid when you ask question. Wont grade HomwWorks.",0
okay teacher.,1
Acts intimidating to the point where some students droped his class. At the first class he made everyone question their decision to go to UFV. Extremely condescending to the point of being rude. If the english is your second language I definitely do not recommend him.,0
"I have Taken Ms. Theus for Soc 101 and 112. I initially took the 101 class because it was mandatory but I liked her lecture style so much, I took her for 111 and used it as an elective class. Not only was she awesome in class, but I had a personal issue dealing with mental health and was able to provide me with resources and was very helpful.",1
had great learning experience in class,1
"Took his class 12 yrs ago. I still think of him too often as the single, worst excuse for an educater that I have seen. I was astounded that someone so incompetent could be so arrogant!  Each class was an opportunity to bask in his greatness. My fondest memory?  ""the dialectic"" . His ridiculous attempt to sound profound.",0
"Adjusted class time to start 0.5 hr later, causing the class to run 30-60 min overtime often. Over the term, students contacted her with questions for assignments. Never received responses 95% of the time. 100% NO COMMUNICATION up to assignment deadline.s Promised samples/explanations never supplied. Heavily biased. Inability to be dispassionate.",0
"Professor Fritsche does a good job at explaining things, he takes his time to explain things if you are confused. There is a lot of homework but the notes that are taken in class help you a lot with it.",1
"Barbara Sanders is a very kind person, however I did find her to be quite intimidating at first so it was hard to ask questions. The content of this lab is very difficult but I found Sanders to be a generous marker when it came to assignments as she gave out partial marks when appropriate",1
"Proffesor Fosnaugh is an amazing algebra Proffesor! He is willing to take time out of his schedule to help you succeed in his class. He gives exam reviews that help you pass each exam. His lectures are good, just don't miss a class. He grades very generously. I would highly recommend taking him for college algebra, he is the best of the BEST!",1
"Terrible calc teacher.Poor teaching skills, not helpful.",0
"Did not show up for our final speech.  E-mailed us 15 minutes before the final that she would not be there.  We turned in these speeches as essays in a box in the journalism office, and she never gave feedback. Did not give clear feedback for earlier speeches.  When I asked her what I could improve on, she gave vague answers.",0
"I have never failed anything in my life.  I put hours in trying to study on my own.  Why do I go to college to try and teach myself.  This professor is unorganized, wants to cover only what is required each week according to his weekly agenda, does not answers questions, tells you to see him before class. Unorganized. DO NOT take his class.",0
I really enjoyed this class and would definitely take it again. Professor Werbe cares about her students and wants you to pass the course. The only critique I have is sometimes there was a lot of HW and quizzes. Other then this I learned a lot!!,1
"She is a moody and nasty person.  She tells you what changes she wants on a first draft, you make them exactly how she wants them, but she corrects her own changes. She has her favorites and will allow them unfair advantages on other students. You never know what mood you'll catch her in, and your grades are basically prey to her mood of the hour.",0
"Not the easiest class but thats to be expected- its University Physics, its going to be harder than College Physics. I had difficulty on the tests but office hours were always accessible and genuinely helped explain the information. You need to put in work outside of class for this course but as long as you put in the work itll be fine.",1
"Professor Buchoff is awesome! I really enjoyed her class. She is helpful, but expects you to do your work. I really learned a lot from her.",1
"Dr. Sa is the most organized professor I have ever had! He is very clear on the assignments and the lectures. He always provides opportunities to do office hours, meet outside of class, or even during the lecture for questions. He is very caring and passionate about his field of study. Pay attention and you will do well! I definitely recommend him!",1
"One of the best classes I've taken at UMD so far. Professor Nusraty knows a lot about Afghanistan and is great about answering any questions you have. Plus, he brings in multiple experts in the field of diplomacy, which is super cool. Not too much work, more focused on understanding of the issues. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",1
"Interesting a first.  Becomes increasingly more difficult in terms of being able to pay attention to each number's place in the equation sometimes with venn diagrams, and figuring out when to use them.  DO GOOD in the beginning and you will no face your doom when it becomes harder and boring like all math is.",0
"Worst teacher Ive ever had. His study guides for the tests are 17 pages of stuff listed that you need to know. Jokes around about failing and says there is always next semester, good luck passing his class with a C. You can study and work your ass off just to barley pass. Hes a dr so expect to have as much knowledge as him and retain everything.",0
One of the nicest Professors I have ever had. Dr. Madsen is very knowledgable about his subject and cares about his students. If you put in the effort and ask for help he will ensure you pass. He allows test corrections for half points back on one exam. Lectures are boring but worth going to because he mentions things that will be on the exam.,1
"Teacher was very knowledgeable about what he was teaching, but was bad at teaching it. All the learning we did was through the extensive homework we received which was graded surprisingly tough. It's not a credit or no credit deal. At least we didn't get any in class exams or quizzes with the exception of a very easy 10 point map quiz early on.",0
"Great professor.  Kind, attentive, thorough.  He teaches some amazing skills and you overcome speech anxiety at the same time.  I'm looking for other classes that he teaches.",1
if you are absent to her classes you will not pass i guarantee it. Other then that great professor.,0
She really shouldn't try to make friends with the students. Its unprofessional,0
"I would totally take another class with Scott.  He's excellent, and I really like how he gives you free reign to do the assignments.  Make sure you at least skim the books for the quizzes; he gives at least one a week.",1
i loveeeee him,1
"Professor Buckridge is a great prof, very knowledgeab and a well rounded, interesting individual. HOWEVER,He gives no slide shows for lectures so you must write notes by what he is saying. He will write key terms on the board but you have to write down all he says and half the time I can't keep up. Nice professor but not a fan of teaching style.",0
"Professor Loftis sucked. He never would clarify what needs to be done and his prefered style for papers goes against what all other teachers taught throught the campus(apparently transitional paragraphs are only filler, and enough to bump your grade down if used) he also gives you liberal speals ever so passively aggressive. overall,dont takehiscla",0
Awesome teacher. Lots of fun. Not much work. Only one paper and a few quizzes. Coolest priest I know.,1
"I hated this class. Pia is not a very understanding person, nor does she understand many american customs. I do not think she is the right person to be teaching an introductory spanish class.",0
"Dr. Kass is determined to provide UMaine students with a top notch Anatomy & Physiology experience. The tests are hard (class average in the C-D range) but there's plenty of opportunities for gimme points and extra credit. Lectures are boring because Kass speaks in high level science lingo. Lab's are tough. Dr. Kass is a tough, but good, professor.",1
Prof Allen overall just sucks. He's arrogant and inconsiderate to the fact that this is not everyones first priority and mostly everyone only take his class to fulfill a gened. He gives super long boring lectures that no one understands unless you're an expert in Refugee crisis's. Do not take this class unless you have the time to do excess work,0
"I took Calc 1 in the active learning classroom, and I learn better in his interactive style rather than a lecture. Pay attention to the facebook group because he'll put up solutions that end up on homework quizzes (you don't turn homework in). Labs are a pain but they aren't impossible. Tests are hard but he adjusts the grades afterwords. ",1
Gerard expects participation in class and in online discussions. If you read the additional material you'll be a star in his class.,1
"I have never met a more condescending professor. He is not clear with what he expects. The tests are impossible. He is the worst professor I've had here and it has given me a horrible view of the music program since he is the chair of the department. As of right now, at the end of the semester, half of the class is failing. Do not take him. Ever.",0
"Good prof for Religion.  Took online, quiz and writing assignment due each week.  Midterm and Final are both essays, which combined make up most of your grade.  Reasonable grader, and pretty clear on his expectations.  I would recommend taking this class with him.",1
Prod D gives a lot of assignments but if you follow instructions you'll do fine. Pretty interesting for an 8 am. Really helped me improve my writing as a freshman and I gained a lot of perspective on American politics.,1
"He makes you buy a book that you will use only one, just because he wrote that book.",0
"Dr. Vazquez has the right approach to being a physics lab instructor. Definitely a solid choice. Show up to class and do the work, and you'll get a good grade.",1
"This class was kind of difficult in some parts. Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor though, he's very passionate and insightful through his lectures. He gives 2 major tests (midterm and final) and 3 quizzes based on the 3 thematic books that he assigns.",1
Really nice guy! Very helpful and wants his students to do well. I took him for summer session and it was great. Makes every effort to help you get the best grade you can. Loves to talk about himself but makes class interesting. I really learned a lot from him. I wish I had taken him for E1 also. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,1
His teaching style is terrible.  Every time you ask a question he says you should have learned that in high school.  He goes out of his way to let you know that you are stupid.  If you love yourself you will not take this man for calculus.,0
"Grading criteria was not clear. Gives extra credit, but she won't post it online. So, it is hard to tell if she's really applying them to your grade.  Not very helpful. When explaining something, it was confusing.",0
"The worst class I took at the JC. The time spent in his class and writing assignments are soul sucking. He barely reads the essays and doesn't read the journals assignments at all, but expects students to follow a strict format that gets graded based on his arbitrary observations. Even getting final grades has been frustrating. Awful class",0
I am in her class right now and i am just done with everything. She treats you like you are a child and doesn't understand the fundamentals of reading the simplest of stories. She is condescending and just to insane when it comes to literature. Don't take her if you don't want to feel like you are losing brain cells just listening to her voice,0
"Do not plan on getting any help because it won't happen. DO NOT Communicate through email because it's a disaster. And he is very rude, super confusing, and cant hold a conversation. Save yourself the time and do not take him.",0
"Jim and I got off to the wrong foot. At first I hated his class but after the midterm things got better. His assignments are time consuming and there's a TON of them so be prepared. He's a sweet guy and I like him as a person, just not as a professor.",1
When he teaches he just stands there and reads off the powerpoint. doesnt do many examples to actually teach you the material. No extra credit. Does not care if most of the class if failing and does not do much to help. Would not take again and would not recommend. Tests are majority of grade (75 percent of your grade including final).,0
"Great guy, hardest class. He cares a lot about his students but its difficult to keep up with the amount of information hes throwing at you. The tests consist of everything hes ever told you, even if you didnt think you should write it down. Good class for a major, but not for someone who isnt interested.",1
"Fast talking, hard to keep up with, and gets off track a lot. I had his 3 hour class and I could not take sitting there listening to him speak! It was so boring and most of the time he did not let us out for a break. His tests are hard. You have to write two essays and he does not grade them generously. He knows what he's talking about, though.",0
"Class is easy and prof. is friendly. Teaches off of the powerpoint slides that are posted before class, 4 homework problems each week. Exams are not difficult plus you are allowed a 2-sided cheat sheet.",1
"If you enjoy listening to the same things over and over every class, and never learn a thing youll love Professor Allen. If your like me and cant stand to hear about The Coca-Cola Company or see the same profit equation on the board, then do yourself a favor and avoid this class. Hes an extremely nice guy, but horrible Professor.",0
Dr. Piland was the worst teacher I've ever had. He made things more difficult than they should have been. He changed his grading point scale multiple times and nobody could keep track of their actual grade. He doesn't answer questions clearly; he just tells you to look it up yourself. Avoid this teacher if you can!!!!,0
took the online class. Lectures were LONG. I studied lectures thoroughly at first but didnt find the first study guide which killed me on the first test. then i stopped watching his lectures and just studied the final study guide and aced the final. could have gotten a B but didnt know there were listening assignments. Dropped me down two grades.,0
"Paul is vague, unclear, unhelpful, and ultimately a waste of time. Even if you work many hours on a project that's clearly amazing, he'll probably criticize it for some obscure reason. Very biased against certain types of art and will make class miserable and for those who don't agree with him.",0
"One of the better teachers I've had in college.  Very entertaining, and gets you interested in learning the subject.  Pretty nice, funny, and makes you feel comfortable to ask questions, and for help.  I'd take him again if I could.",1
For starters he wrote his own textbook which is poorly written. You don't NEED to read the textbook or really anything to do okay. He teaches you everything you need to know in lecture. His homework is harder than his exams which is good. He talks very fast in his classes. Overall good class and good Professor if you can keep up with him.,1
He is a nice guy but at first he doesn't come off that way. He wants you to work hard as if it was your major. You will have to teach yourself throughout the whole course. This course is hard and you may need a tutor. If you take this class make sure you read ahead and request the power points from him via email and GOOD LUCK,0
"She can barely write a complete or coherent sentence.  If you ask a question, her reply has nothing to do with what you asked!  Very confusing.   Avoid this teacher if you can.",0
"Excellent Professor. Lectures are solid and to the point. She entertains hypothetical and ""silly"" questions gracefully. DO THE READING! Otherwise you will be lost. Clausen won't make you look bad if you don't (others will) but you will get left behind. Your fault not hers. Definitly want her again for other classes!",1
"Warners is a solid prof. His lectures are usually very interesting, since he shows enthusiasm, makes the occasional joke, and he brings in plants/fungi to pass around. The class is medium difficulty, but you should be aware that DeJong and him include specific, real world examples of the concepts we discuss in the lectures, so memorize them.",1
"Dr. Tharu is nice and will offer help if you ask! Communication, honesty, and homework are key in this class. He also takes his time to explain his lectures and asks if everyone understands throughout.",1
"I liked this class and the topic was really interesting. She really involves her students and lets them talk about what they feel relates to the topic. Since it is child development, there are people who have their own experiences (own kids, cousins, nephews, nieces) and its always interesting to have a group conversation with Athena.",1
"As a psych major, I don't mind this class since I've taken AP psych. The thing is, a lot of students just take this as a gen ed so this may be more difficult. He doesn't assign much ""HW"" but expects you to do the reading (I recommend making outlines) and randomly gives out pop quizzes before or after the lecture and he won't let you make them up.",0
unorganized and grades pathetically hard! most students dreaded the class,0
"I put more work into this class than I have in any other class in my 4 years and I got my worst grade ever. Wrote over 30 pages, he grades a ""rough draft"" & a final paper. His comments on my rough draft barely helped me improve my grade on the final, if there were more things he wanted improved he could've said so. But WWII material was interesting",1
He cares about the students.,1
He's super fine! SILVER FOX material here! Hes also an awesome teacher! Love the guy!,1
"Such an easy class, the only thing you have to do is keep up with the assignments/group work. She's very lenient with absences as long as you have a legitimate excuse. I would definitely take her again! She is very nice and patient and will have no problem helping you.",1
a very helpful and interesting professor. he may be scary at first but then the atmosphere was relaxing and I actually learned a lot. He was very encouraging during the preparation for exam. one of the best professors i had in this program,1
Your textbook is a set of drawings from a building on campus. He is genuinely interested in students success in class and industry.,1
"Worst professor ever! he talks about himself a lot and doesn't teach the subject, and he expect u to do well on the tests and they are extremely hard! I regret taking this class with him. wish someone warned me before and i could've passed this class with an other professor who actually teaches philosophy!  ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO FAIL!",0
"Loved Mrs. Hutton! She cares for her students and their success. However, she makes you work for your grade, HW every night and tests about every 2 weeks. The tests are very confusing; they are filling the blanks (10-15) & 3-4 short answers. Other than that I loved her personality & the way she teaches to the point Im now taking Special Ed with her",1
"He is a pretty good teacher.  He realizes that students are not geology majors and keeps the class pretty interesting.  Tests can be difficult, but he does study sessions before each test that are extremely helpful.",1
You don't need the textbook and you probably won't pay attention.  I can say I have learned absolutely nothing in her class.  She is boring to listen to and she reads off the slides.  The worksheets are easy but you need to study for the tests.  She started using a grading site for essay s that doesn't even apply to how she grades.  Awful class.,0
"Worst class I've taken at JMU. Henigman is all over the place and difficult to follow. Canvas is extremly difficult to navigate. Lectures are boring, she doesnt make material intersting. Mandatory attendence but you cant gain points. Four shortpapers throughout the semester and 12 page final paper that she is very unclear about. Avoid if you can.",0
a very gifted teacher...but talks too much. it seems like she has to cover every little thing in the book and still add more stuff.her three hour lecture classes are just too much. doesnt give too much time for lab(20 min tops/wk im serious) i also think she gives you very tricky quiestis for the exam.im def. not taking her for a&p2.,0
Great Teacher!  He is fair and expect the best out of each student.  Slackers be awarded!,0
"His class is extremely boring and it is not fun to sit through. He has a very deep voice and it is hard to pay attention and half the class falls asleep. If you do happen to get him, paying attention isn't necessary, just read the book!",0
"There's only one word to describe this one: loopty-loop! But yoga is cool so take the course. Hint for the final: Sikhs avoid meat not because of compassion for the animal, but because humans are not designed to ingest the adrenaline flowing thru the animal at the time of slaughter. You were not going to get that one right.",1
Really knows his stuff and is really energetic about wat he teaches. Funny and nice man. Class material is easy. Only one paper. Enjoy his accent!,1
"She is very biased and if your opinions do not match hers she gives a lower paper grade. She is a really nice lady and does care. This was her first year, so hopefully she improves.",1
"Great Professor! I will recommend to anyone. Test are a little difficult, but if you study you will be okay. He gives opportunity for bonus points, take advantage of those.",1
Very easy class. Assignments are very straightforward and as long as you do them and participate in class you should have no problem getting an A.,1
Professor victor is the best. I took this class wth another professor but I dropped because  was hard for me. Professor Lombardo will help you and he is calm and funny at the same time. He always makes sure everyone in the class understand what he is teaching. I really recommend Professor Victor and you will enjoy ITE 115 like never before. I GOT A,1
"He's tough, and doesn't take any crap. If he sees that you aren't pushing yourself, then you may as well not come at all. He's hard to like if you don't push, he's mean even. But if you push yourself, even if you can't do the harder moves, he will notice it, and he will help you more than ever.",1
"very good teacher. All the homework will be done during the class, and her test questions come directly from her review. However, if you lat even two minutes, she will detect points.",1
"Shapiro is pretty great - he was clearly engaged in the course material and excited to teach it. The textbook can help you better understand concepts, but it's only used for a few questions on the exams. Group projects can be tough but he's fair and he really explains your grade. Rewatch all the lectures and reread your notes for exams.",1
"Class could be a lot more clear. Seeman himself knows a lot and teaches really well, but clarity with grading could be improved. I was just pumped to get an A-. Just work really hard and talk to your TA.",0
"Dr. Townsend has high expectations.  She wants you to learn in her class.  The class time goes fast and hw is limited.  Watch out for her tests.  Make sure to talk to her with questions and interests.  I recieved a 4.0, so she is possible.",1
"She does not reply to emails in a timely manner. Days go by. When I receive a reply it is like its typed by a teenager. And I dont get clarification that I needed. All the homework is on this other Connect website (costs 100) so dont bother buying the book, unless you need it. Shes been very unhelpful. Im glad my class is online.",0
Dr. Graetzer is a very intelligent woman with a vibrant personality. Great teacher. She is very interesting and makes her class an enjoyable and relaxing place to actually LEARN! Would highly recommend.,1
"The problems that were talked about in class were not nearly as difficult as the problems on the test. She would always say in class that she was ""trying to invoke a higher level of thinking."" While I appreciate this, I wish that the examples in class were the same difficulty as the test. We also rushed at the end of the year which was not fun.",1
"The class itself is interesting, but Sun makes the class a little bit boring. Generally, he's grading is fair to what you have done. Sometimes he likes to give tricky quizzes to let you guys down, also he likes to raise some questions, but he never gives you back the answer, which will make you feel suspended to the answer.",0
"Instructs really well, especially on what we need to study and what needs to be done In order for everyone to understand the lab. As long as you show up and participate, the class will be easier to understand! But Id still work hard for the quizzes since they count a lot for the grade and help out a ton!",1
"When taking this class, you would have to be prepared to teach the material to yourself. He does not use any power points. You must read the textbook chapters, which are extremely long. His test are impossible to pass, even though they are multiple choice. Additionally, you have to read two long novels outside of class. If you don't, then you fail",0
I made an account just to comment on what a terrible online teacher Derek Maher is. I wish I could've read this before taking the class online. It is not an easy online class. He does not work well with computers and is hard to keep up with his mishaps. He is terrible at responding to emails which is crazy because its online! Tests are hard. ,0
THE WORST CLASS WITH THE WORST GRADE EVER !!!,0
"She is very dependent on the workbook and had students complete assigned pages that were not reviewed in class beforehand but reviews it too quickly in the following class. She gets annoyed when too many questions are asked as well. If you can't keep up, you're going to have to teach yourself.",0
"Shes is a super awesome person and I feel as though a great in-person professor; however, as someone with ADHD it was very hard being in her online class. She can tend to get off-topic and talk about things not related to class. I am person who is bad at math and found this class to be pretty difficult. I would recommend her for in person not onlin",0
"She is a tough grader, I wouldn't recommend her class if you aren't confident in your writing or aren't confident in research papers. She didn't really work with us on a research paper and how to form one as a first year student. I had to try to get as much help as I can outside of class and I was confused on how she wanted the paper to be.",0
"She teaches absolutely nothing in her class. If you ever wanted to be better in writing, please don't choose her. ",0
Really hard to understand him and expect you to learn everything on your own. Do not recommend this professor.,0
"I would not take any courses taught by this professor. She is hard on the grading. She is very rude to her students. Plan on spending at least 2 to 3 hours a day on her class. You will have 6 things a week to do. LearnSmart, Discussion Questions, Chapter HW, Practice Exams, And your Test all in one week every week. Let me say Exhausting!!!",0
"Prof always willing to help and doesn't want to move on unless we fully understand the topic. If you aren't that great at math, I 'd take him. He makes understanding the class quite simple. Homework also reflects most of the quizzes/exams.",1
"While I didn't think perception was interesting, Dr. Kunz is a great professor. His tests are fair and he seems like an overall good guy. You can tell he is extremely intelligent, but he is still approachable. He doesn't take attendance (in case that's something you're concerned about).",1
Lectures aren't helpful. Would've gotten same grade if I didn't attend any but I still went to all of them. What helped most was the homework questions and re-doing all of them before exams.  Averages of the exams are really low (like 50%) but I still got a C- in the class even though I got below 20% on midterm and final,0
"Take this guy!  He is awesome!  No homework, 1 Test. and 2 3-5 minute speaches on whatever you want to talk about.  He was so fun and funny.  Truly a profesor you can create a relationship with.",1
"Very helpful, clearly explains and won't proceed unless you understand. Allows corrections for half credit and he is very patient. This was my 2nd time taking one of his classes. I was really dreading Trig until I saw him in the class offerings. Totally recommend him for anyone who isn't math friendly.",1
"Pyrros knows what she is talking about, and if you pay attention in lecture, the class is not bad. The quizzes come from the optional homework problems. The exams come from the green book practice exams. She is very nice so don't be afraid to ask for a little extra credit as long as you actually go to class.",1
"He made me laugh at least once every lecture! He seems so interested and happy to teach.For this class we just had a midterm and final and one paper. For the test, he picked one essay question but gave you a list of 6 to study two weeks before hand. Pretty much come up with the essay on your own and memorize it and you'll do fine for the test :)",1
"Mr. Steinfort is the worst and the toughest math teacher I have ever had! He only grades test not the assignments. If your are beginner like me, you are going to have hard time (Especially ESL students). HE expect you to know all before you enrolled in one of his class. DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR ONLINE IN PERSON CLASS!",0
"Easy B class. Getting an A is extremely difficult in general. Compared to other Engl 1 A, it's outrageous. Papers and projects will bring your grade down.  The class average for both is around a B which is why this class is an easy B. Way too much work and all for nothing. Avoid taking this class if there are better options...",0
"I took FIN 100 over the summer which means I took the class in 5 weeks. He doesnt give partial credit for discussions, you either get full credit or a zero, even if you type the wrong group number. No notes on the exams which seemed ridiculous for the amount of material he required us to know for the exams, and it is just a 100 level class.",0
"Not feeling this class. All the people who said to avoid it are right. This class is hard for no reason. It just is. The lectures are ridiculous, because literally speaks at a million miles a minute. Tests are crazy, too. My biggest gripe with them is that they are just terribly worded sometimes. which is annoying! Just ask the question clearly.",0
"its very easy to get A in his class, I just attend his lecture and finish the HW in time, I didn't do anything else to get extra practice , and easily A for me.",1
"Prof Yonker is a pretty good english teacher. She makes you work for it. Not too hard, but enough to challenge you and improve your writing skills. For the most part she is organized but sometimes she changes due dates. Overall easy, just work and accept her feedback. She gives extra credit opportunities. Take adv of them.",1
"Projects are not hard but he gives you no direction so you are always confused when you start.  Go to his office, he'll do the work for you.  Test is all memorization.",1
"Honestly, just do your work and put in the effort and you'll do good. She really knows what she's talking about, and really made me love costume design even more.",1
"Ins. Warden was very irrational when it came to grading. If you make a single mistake on one of your sources, you instantly drop to a 60 and then she grades it from there. Her assignments are very vague and she is very close minded to things she does not understand. Still made an A, but would not wish this class on anyone.",0
This was one of the more difficult classes I've had. For some reason learning the economic concepts was rough for me but the professor really tries his best to help you. He's easy to talk to and he lets you out of class early!,1
"Personal experience and friends taking the course, he tells you what will be on the exam .... he gives you the complete opposite.  He definitely knows what he is talking about but is very boring in class.",0
This class is SO much work. There are 3 tests and a cumulative final which is optional if you have the average you need to not take it. There is a financial report that is submitted in 2 parts which is VERY time consuming and he doesn't help you on it at all. There are hw's on MyFinanceLab for each chapter. He doesn't explain concepts very well.,0
"The hardest marker I've ever encountered! The course was interesting and rather easy. I would get nearly every true/false, multiple choice and fill in correct on the tests, but he was very unclear of what he wanted in the long answer questions.Definitely suggest avoiding him, he was also rude to anyone who wasn't in love with the course (like me!).",0
Ok all the rates cross them out. SUCH AN EASY A dont even have to stay sign in and leave supper easy course 3 exams all online easy to cheat all answers are on quizlet and one group project a 4th grader can do! Deff him take lol strong accent tho,1
"Awful, awful professor. Expect to teach yourself most of this class, and be prepared for him to make you feel incredibly stupid and humiliate you.",0
"Probably the worst 1L Professor at Iowa. 30 Question MC Final on Civil Procedure, 5 questions on international law, 0 questions on minimal contacts/personal jurisdiction, 0 questions on the Erie doctrine. Yep, sounds like a Maya Steinitz Civil Procedure final exam.",0
"covers a lot of material and requires a lot of reading but she's a really good teacher. at first i was worried about her tests that are in essay form, but they're not bad and i got an A- in the class. i'd definitely take her again.",1
"I decided to drop her class after the first half of the first semester. Her class may be ""easy,"" but she is such a boring teacher-she reads straight from her notes. She gets WAY off topic WAY too much. It was rather dull at times, and I don't recommend this class for anyone unless you absolutely LOVE history.",0
"Very unclear with directions and when will take points off for minor details. If you revise your papers towards all of his notes, still won't get a good grade on it. His email responses are very rude and how he criticizes his students is untactful. Do yourself a favor and find a different professor. ",0
"She is a very nice lady, but I do not enjoy her as a teacher. Sometimes it feels like the students asking her for more is a chore for her. She also feels somewhat judgmental over our abilities, even though everyone is struggling meaning that we need more help. She is a nice person but her teaching style isnt very universal for all learning styles.",0
Took a 1.0 credit class with her. You can tell shes very passionate about what she teaches. Don't be distracted or text in class cause she will get very butthurt about it and make announcements. Overall a wonderful teacher really engages with students. Only had one exam which was based off the notes and readings. You should do the readings.,1
"I can honestly say that I genuinely look forward to this class every week!! Walsh makes the info interesting, and helps you form your answer for the short answer assignment due weekly, and the short quizzes are all on quizlet. The exams are easy peasy, esp if you go to the review. I attribute my 99.5 in the class to his great teaching! He's v cool!",1
"Little to no communication. Easiest A I've ever received. However, if you're looking for an extension or miss a dead line, he will not give it to you, under ANY circumstances. You could be in a coma and this guy will not make an exception.",0
"I will be sure to never take another class with Professor Matthews. She is unapproachable & unclear in her expectations. Grading is inconsistent. She was chronically late to class, which she claims she wasnt. She found out that a student had emailed the dean in regards to her attendance and was very aggressive in how she addressed the situation.",0
He is passionate about the subject he teaches and is very knowledgable about the subject. He gives out a lot of extra credit assignments and is an easy grader as it is. Very self explanatory teacher/class. You ARE tested on the same material taught  in class so there are no surprises. Do you the clicker questions and study and you'll be fine.,1
Can easily carry a 2-hour lecture. Brings a wealth of experience. My favorite professor by far. ,1
"SHE IS THE BEST!!!!!! By far, one of my top three fav professors ever & her rate on here is 100% accurate. I can't say enough good things about her! Not only were the assignments easy to digest, but I actually learned something every week... I mean this class was a DREAM class taught by a DREAM teacher. I would highly recommend her for sociology",1
"She is awful. Acts like she is the only Professor kids have to take in the university. Is very nice to her students, but is an extremely hard grader and does not want students to pass her class. By far the worst teacher I have ever had in my entire university career. I would rather have a cartoon character for a teacher rather than her!",0
The content is OK but the prof is helpless. never have homework or extra practice but the final is something beyond the handout,0
"Honestly Professor Schap is actually really enjoyable and can be funny in lecture. However, his material is very challenging and he grades tough. Every class will go 5 minutes over so be prepared for that if you have a class after. Additionally reading the text and doing the problem sets are a must to do well in the course.",0
he's a nice guy but kinda weird.  its a really difficult class and his tests are also difficult.  if you ask him he'll help you.  if you do go to class (which most don't) you must pay attention b/c he's disleksit(sp?) and you might need to correct him from time to time.,1
"Just a warning, he doesn't use blackboard at all. Doesn't even bother to set it up. Definitely takes attendance, but is never on time for class. His lectures are very hard to follow as he goes on tangents quite often, so my advice if you take him is to keep all papers he passes out and just use sparknotes and you'll be fine!",0
"This Professor is disrespectful, unprofessional, condescending and mediocre. I did not learn anything from this class, she is more interested in hearing her self speak and repeating irrelevant information in the third person rather than if her students understand. You cannot ask questions, you will be attacked. DONT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL REGRET!!",0
"I liked her, realtime experience and genuine.",1
"Don't let this 100 level course fool you! Lecture power points are VERY confusing. Test questions are very tricky and confusing. Dr. Nochera had to leave half way through the semester, and Professor house took over. TAKE PROFESSOR HOUSE! Her exams were so much easier, tests were straightfoward, her class is an easy A.",0
Professor Donia is a gem. Definitely take notes during his lectures and do not be afraid to challenge him. He gives his opinions and tells you its his opinion and why he believes it. If you disagree write it in the essay and use facts for your counter arguments. Received great feedback in disagreeing with him. Which is very rare in professors.,1
"Took this class online. His grading was a bit brutal, there is a lot of work involved, he puts you in a group to work on a major report together which got really frustrating when everyone has different ideas and writing styles. I got an A in the class but only because I put in a lot of time and sweat into it.",0
"Class was interesting, youd watch one film the first class of the week and discuss it on the second. The films that Philbin picked were also some classic and very entertaining ones. My only complainant is that he was too harsh on quizes and tests. I also felt if he scrutinized certain people more than others. But overal, dece teacher",0
Worst professor I have had at UD by far. He comes into class 5 to 15 minutes late every day and came to a review 2 hours late.  The average on both of his tests were in the 50 without a curve and the low was a 7.  He expects you to already know the material and doesnt explain what he is doing. Buy the textbook if you wanna pass cause he is useless,0
Extremely difficult  tests were over vast quantities of information and the 30 questions on the test were usually not emphasized. To be fair she did email prior to indicate this course was very tough,0
This professor was absolutely horrible. All she did during lecture was read her power point slides word for word. As if I can't read them myself. When test time came the answers to the questions could not be found anywhere in the slides or book. She expected you to have a deep understanding of the subject material without teaching it to you.,0
Hes very dry but funny. actually enjoyed class. If you show up you will pass,0
"She was always willing to answer questions. Her constructive criticism was helpful and she always had suggestions to help me improve my work. A lot of work was done in a little bit of time, so be prepared for some pressure to finish projects on time but don't be afraid to take a little extra time to turn projects in if you need to. ",1
"Crowell was very nice and helpful. He would always answer questions if you had them and would make sure you understood the material. My only problem was that I have never taken music before and took this as a gen ed and it was very difficult for me. He assumes everyone has had some type of musical exprience. Not  an easy class, but super nice!",1
"Dr. Pittman is by far one of the sweetest and most highly educated professors I've had. I have her for Comparative Religion and Cultural Geography, both good classes. Her lectures are very interesting and packed with interesting, but it's not always relevant to the online quizzes and tests. Overall, wonderful woman and professor!",1
Mrs. H is a really funny and chill prof. She goes over your papers with you and gives you a lot of honest feedback. Very invested in wanting everyone to do well and very understand and kind in and outside of class. Her class has a lot of reading on politics and history which I thought would be boring but I learned a lot.,1
I wouldn't recommend this teacher to anyone she is extremely difficult and loves to pass out bad grades. Do yourself a favor and chose a different teacher im warning you,0
"Professor Fish is not the worst but not the best professor. Directions were always unclear on essays/work in general. Fish graded mainly on grammar and not on what you actually write. Attendance not really mandatory as she tells you when everything is due, except some days she gives random points for ""in class assignments"".",0
"I really thought the class would be easy but I was wrong. The lectures are easy and boring, but the quizzes and tests are wordy and confusing. Gehring herself is a quirky person and will get on your bad side. She got on my nerves the entire semester and I was tempted to skip her lectures but go for the power points!",1
"He uses algebraic formulas to explain every concept which makes everything needlessly complicated. So don't expect to learn anything from lecture. These formulas have been condensed into a ""bush bible"" which you can print out and use for his final to pass. He is good at putting on a show but he cannot teach or inspire students to learn.",0
Dr Allens cool but his class was tough as hell his take home exam answers are all online but his in class exams are nothing that was ever touched on in class,0
"Professor Brownlee is a nice guy, but I regretted taking his government class in a way. The topic was very interesting and I enjoyed the lectures. However, it's hard to get an A in the class due to there being only 3 exams (30 pts) and 10 points for showing up on exam days. A difference of 3 points or a bad exam can ruin your grade. Lots to read!!!",1
Poor clarification in regards to assignments given.  Class is boring and down not provide many benefits to the student.  Professor often contradicted what she was teaching by how she would act in and outside of the classroom.,0
"He's a pretty easy professor, so long as you keep up with the reading & talk to him about the cases every now and then.",1
"A very informative and enriching class. A class that all sociology majors should take, as well as anyone who takes it as an AGNG class.",1
"excellent, wonderful.  take her.",1
this class is impossible.  everyone fails the tests. no one knows whats going on during class. lab reports are hard to write because he doesnt tell you what to do. you'll end up hating him very soon. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!! (he's a cute little old decrepit man tho!),0
"Basically just reads of PowerPoint slides. Tests/Projects/HWs are extremely easy. Very accessible outside of class + very caring towards all students. He is glad to help you any time. The class would be better if he taught more advanced stuff, wouldn't just read off slides, and make us learn more contemporary Java frameworks.",0
"Polanco is 10/10. She makes things understandable and lets you take the final and midterm with a partner. her quizzes can be hard, and public speaking is nerve-racking, but she does everything she can to make everyone comfortable. she gives tons of point options and is funny. Everyone in my class loves her. If she is available, take her!!",1
Un des meilleurs profs d'HEC !,1
"Professor Wu is kindly, and fun to talk to, but his grading criteria is incredibly unclear, he has no experience with Blackboard or teaching online, and his answers to questions posed are often lacking and/or outright unhelpful. Given the chance, take someone else's class, especially if the teaching is going to be via Zoom.",0
"Funniest prof I've had, she made lectures so entertaining. The tests are the hardest tests I've ever taken though. But she does virtual office hours every night before the test and they help a lot. Also she drops your lowest test score.",1
"Honestly the hardest and worst class I've taken in college. He expects you to memorize 80-115 slides per lecture. He calls his 6 tests ""quizzes"" but they're anything but. Large curve but if I didn't HAVE to take this class for my major I wouldn't have tacked on the added stress. Don't be fooled either this class is not psychology. ",0
She was a really good professor and I learned a lot.,1
I am TERRIBLE at math and still passed with a good grade. I recommend him to all my friends. Each week followed the same routine which I liked and the homework wasn't heavy. The beginning half of the semester we did quizzes on our own then did them with a partner. You get to use a cheat sheet for the midterm and final (only two exams)!,1
"Awesome teacher, not a tough grader and gives a lot of useful feedback and advice!",1
"This is no doubt the ""weed out"" class of the art program. There are many things wrong about this tho. 1) it's a required course so many people dont necessarily need it for their career. 2) it's only a 200 level course and the professor goes over the top with test questions! 3) he requires 2 books that you don't need. So study the notes and show up",0
Bad,0
Good Class. Great Teacher!,1
Talks too much and doesn't listen to what students have to say. He also tends to talk down to students and never gives a clear answer. His grading is straight forward. Expect multiple long emails per day.,0
"If you have him for microelectronics, do not expect to learn anything from him. My advice is to find a better textbook, and follow an online class so you can learn the the material. When midterm comes, copy every useless and very confusing assignment questions that don't teach you anything on your cheat sheet.",0
"Instead of set hours of lectures, she posts short and concise videos going over materials you read in the textbook, which is a nice review/summary if you are into that. You do need to read the textbook though, just watching the lectures is NOT going to be enough. She also holds review sessions before each quiz which is very helpful.",1
"Mike Jurmu is a very nice guy. I can not say that about his classes. Worst grader I have ever had. If you're looking for a class that you just want credit for with an average grade, take his classes. Does not reward smarter students for their hard work, and everyone is within the grade average pretty much. EXTREMELY terrible grading. TERRIBLE!!",0
This class was hybrid and we were supposed to read and teach ourselves outside of class but when in class it was a waste of time. She talked about things that were not relevant to the class. Watch out on her tests she mixes the order of the answers on the answer sheet. You cannot just transfer your answers over. I don't suggest this prof.,0
"If you want to learn something, then take his class. Not an essay class, but you will definitely learn something, that is if you pay attention!  The exams and problems sets were not easy, but if you pick the right partners for problem sets and study hard for exams, then THE HUGE CURVE HE GIVES DEFINITELY HELPS!  I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM!",1
"The worst professor I have ever had in college. He claims to have only given a single digit number of A's in his career, which is not something to be proud of, just a testament to poor teaching ability in my opinion. Sets unreasonable expectations of undergrad students. elitist personality. I am an A-B student & failed. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!",0
"Love the flipped classroom, hated the complainers in the class. Seriously - just watch the lectures and you'll be fine.  Lots of problem-solving in class so you know what you're doing when you get to the test.",1
"Doctor Green expects a lot from his students, but he gives thorough feedback and will help them become great writers. I highly encourage all English majors to sign up for at least one class with him.",1
"I did this one online, the content was nothing I hadn't studied in high school. Just a brush up course really. No homework online and you can do the exams anytime you like. I finished early so I could focus on other subjects. He was always quick back with emails but you're probably better off getting help in the LRC.",1
Great teacher. Super easy class. He explained every topic you would need to know in class. Labs for him took almost no time. He also has a great sense of humor.,1
"There was lot of reading and work for this class. However, you shouldn't expect anything less for a graduate class. I found it pretty easy as long as you complete and comprehend the readings. Don't fall behind and post any questions you have. Work on your final paper ahead. You will learn a lot if you put in the effort. Overall, was a good class.",1
Lorie is a real gem. She makes public speaking so easy. I honestly even liked her lectures. Even with classes being transferred online she was so helpful and kind!,1
"He was very unforgiving, very harsh grader, and gave homework every class session.",0
"Network Architecture and Protocols was a living nightmare...Karvelas' slides we crap, his DL format was email vs. Moodle like everyone else, exams were absolutely impassable, and he didn't even admin his own exams...STAY AWAY!",0
"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily.",0
If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
"Rambles off onto random topics during lecture, extremely complicated tests. You have to teach yourself Trigonometry pretty much. Expect him to accuse you of cheating, and don't expect to ever hear back from him in emails. His study guides and answer keys for exams consist of page numbers and references to lectures, doesn't actually explain anything",0
This is hysterical!  I had Prof Kayal at SHU in 1978 for Soc 101.  Roe V Wade was just 6 year before and at a Catholic College here was this at least Bi-guy advocating everything anti-Catholic/Establishment.  We didn't have the internet or means to rate someone.  But 30 years later I can still say he and somewhat his class was the most memorable!,1
"This professor is AWESOME! By far one of my favorite classes in all 4 years as a college student. He is mellow but strict. He has great conversations with the students and is very helpful and passionate for ART. If you cant draw, nobody is judging but you. There are a lot of projects, but once he turns on the music he lets your creativity flow.",1
"Very straightforward and relaxed lecture style. He is also very responsive to emails. Tests are fair and usually based on notes/homework/labs. The labs can be challenging, so be sure you get a good group! Would highly recommend this professor; he has been one of my favorites.",1
Don't take this man!!! He does not really seem to care for his students or anything else. I get going online with COVID is tough but it does not mean you have to be mean and rude and overall hard to work with when it comes to your students.,0
"Dr. Krumpe knows his chemistry. It is not an easy subject to learn, or to teach I imagine, but he is fair! He is always willing to work with the class on deadlines and is receptive to comments/questions. Make no mistake, his tests are HARD! But if you show up, do your work, and try hard, you'll be fine.",1
"She is extremely nice and understanding to the fact that students have a lot going on. She definitely LOVES students who go to her office hours. That being said, the class is HARD. I'm not a theology major, but I had some knowledge prior to the course. I struggled to get a B. She has very precise expectations and does not articulate them well.",1
This is honestly the worst professor that I have taken at UNC Charlotte. Please do not take his class. The test in this class are ridiculous and amount of information that he gives you and the amount of time that you have to prepare for the test are unrealistic. If you have to have him as a professor be ready to take good notes and study A LOT!!!,0
Would never take class with this professor again. He does not care about his students. Told me in front of my face i never tried. Doesnt care about you. Very hard teacher. I have heard he is a bad teacher for intro courses what i took but better at high end classes. He just doesnt understand how kids do not understand math. Not recommended by me :(,0
"Attend classs, do the homework and pay attention and you can get through it.",1
"He's a tough grader. Small mistakes can cost you lots of points, which I think is too extreme from his part. He tells you exactly what he wants in the lab reports. The error analysis stuff may be hard but I'm glad I learned about it. The labs are varied, like 8 lab reports, a couple of quizzes and a final (individual, no groups) Expect to work.",1
"You will hear good things about professor Stapp, but these things should be taken with a grain of salt. Stapp does not take attendance, but instead scatters random facts throughout his lectures that he will later include on the exams to make sure you attended. The exams are exceedingly long and difficult and make up pretty much all of your grade.",0
"Jenneke is less of a class and more of a commitment, but it's very rewarding. She's willing to work with you along the way as long as she can see you're actually trying to achieve your goal. One of the best instructors I've ever had.",1
Professor Green is incredibly disorganized in his lectures. He gives little information about each topic and often trails off on to tangents about an unrelated topic during lecture. He is almost impossible to reach outside of class and won't respond to any emails no matter how important it is.,0
"Tomi is wonderful! Very fun to listen to as well! Alabma Stories, Woohoo! Your education at UTM is not complete until you have Tomi! You should hear her sing Sweet Home Alabama.",1
Avoid this professor at all costs. She makes things over complicated and has unnecessary weekly quizzes. She will make this class more time consuming and stressful than your more important classes.,0
"I mean.. i thought she is very easy at first because i took her class before and then i passed easily. However, if you slack, you can fail. Because she gives you very confusing feedback on your paper. She always says your creative ideas are really good but, she can fail you on very end of the papers.",0
PROS: 1.) automatic 50% for just turning in assignment. 2.) Automatic 100% for submitting completed assignment. 3.) Plenty extra credit! CONS: 1.) Little directions on how to do assignments 2.) Gives mostly busy work 3.) Portfolio worth 50% of grade 4.) Don't miss class for any reason,1
"Munson is one of those guys that you will absolutely love as a person, but dislike as a prof. Once you realize that his grumpy exterior is about a millimeter thick, you have a little more fun in the course...a little. The course is near impossible to do well in seeing as assignments are unclear and exams were literally the scourge of my first year.",1
"As a film student, I loved taking Perrine's class.  Her lectures are engaging and clear.  Yes she is a tough grader but she is very fair and her expectations are clear.  Some people are offended by her honest attitude, but those people just are used to the other professors at Grand Valley that aren't nearly as challenging as Perrine",1
"Professor is nice, kind, and informative. however shes not on time with anything, always adjusting her schedule of the syllabus changing dates for assingments due. talks about her jobs and is constantly asking for feedback which pushes time back for assignments due. Heavy grader for a class to improve for poor writing. DONT TAKE HER!",0
Saas was an awesome professor. He was very laid back and was really lenient. He really does care about his students. He wants everyone to pass. This class is an easy A. Literally just do what is asked of you and turn it in on time and you'll get an A. Not a hard class at all. He's also really funny.,1
"Very passionate, he posts detailed notes & audio/slides from lectures, and he's hilarious. Very accessible during office hours & truly cares about your success. However, the class is not very structured. No HW and attendance is not mandatory for discussion/lectures. If you are self-motivated then definitely take his course.",1
"This guy was horrible.  If he wasn't screwing up his lectures, he was calling for his TA Tanner for help.  I did well in the class even though I have no knowledge to show for it.",0
Horrible teacher. Don't take this class with her!,0
"Took US History after 1945 a few semesters ago, and it was great. I forgot to write a review, but he's an excellent teacher :)",1
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,0
"Best professor ever. I would recommend to take her for 123 A,B and c. She doesn't make lecture boring. Its very important to do the lab and homework, trust me it boost your grade. She gives practice test so you know what to expect on the test. If you don't understand some problems she is more gladly to help you out.  ",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Tests us on chap. not even gone over in class. 30pgs a chap. 6 chap. a test. Long and boring. No homework except for reading. I was excited before taking this class but not now. Please dont take it.,0
"Oh My Goodness!!! If her classes are not already filled up, you HAVE to take her. I hated spanish in High school and thought I would hate it here, but Mrs. Silva makes it so easy to understand and truly cares. She was always open for discussion about your grade and just wants the best for her students. I hope to take her again for 102!",1
"He's extremely fair when it comes to grade. He makes you fight for your grade. As long as you show him you are willing to work hard, you'll be fine. He doesn't care if you show late but you have to show up. Most of the frustrations will stem from working in group.",1
She definitely won't be swayed in her ways but she is very easygoing as long as you follow the instructions and get your work done. You can learn how to quickly improve with her feedback.,1
She's very fair and Cengage was messing up the portion of the class by marking incorrect answers and the assignments every week are 1-2 pages and she grades them very easily. TestsQuizzes were easy online with exam 4 optional (final).  I respect her for her effort and she is a good person to get to know on an individual level! Easy AB course!,1
"Professor Fox is an amazing Spanish Professor! At first, I was nervous that her Advanced Spanish Grammar class would be difficult, but she has a way of explaining things that make grammar easy to understand. I completely understood everything we studied because of her lectures. She improved my Spanish, and I hope to have her as a professor again! ",1
"She really makes the classroom comfortable, which makes speeches easier to give. Gives 50 bonus points if you have perfect attendance. Gives very detailed feedback for speeches so you know exactly how to improve for the next speech. Only midterm, final, & few quizzes, which she makes harder than they should be, but if you study you will do fine!",1
"Doesn't reply emails, doesn't want to help students, doesn't respect international students",0
Great class.  Knows so much about Computer Science. Will help you out. Nice guy.,1
All she does is read off of her slides but it is so hard to learn what she teaches. Homework is not necessary but she gives homework quizzes every Monday. Midterms are hard and we have a group activity every Monday.,0
"Bruce will forever be my boy. Taking his class was the only plus of my semester. Just show up, crack jokes and the information in his lectures become easier to remember which will reflect on your exams.",1
he sucks. he wanted to fail me...but knew better than that...glad he's gone,0
"He's the kind of guy that will stay two hours after his office hour ends just to listen to you cry about your problems, and still motivate you to be the best version of yourself. One of my best friends and he's my professor. One of the coolest guys I've ever met.",1
"Matsushima-sensei is so nice! She is super patient and cares a lot about her students. Most of the class will be spent practicing speaking Japanese, which helps a lot with learning the language. This isnt the easiest class, and there are tons of homeworks and quizzes, but if you do the work you should be fine.",1
"DO NOT TAKE KERR'S CLASS IN SPRING/summer! even if you're good at math, it's set up to fail. 2nd week of class had 1st test, 3 days later had another test w only 2 days notice before. No way anyone can learn that fast before being tested on. It's not just that it's 7 weeks-had a spring math class before & did fine bc was graded on more than tests",0
Makes it incredibly difficult to understand your own grade. Not a clear grader. Incredibly picky on tests.,0
Horrible instructor. Super specific requirements on assignments that you will not know unless you read every little millimeter of the syllabus. Crazy strict grading. Doesn't respond to emails. Do yourself a favor and do not take her class.,0
"The critical thinking in psychology class is self explanatory.  While it is easy to pass without reading the book, you miss out on an amazing piece of work.  The class attempts to assist in critical analysis of claims, and the books have and interesting way of conveying that.  Pretty funny and a great professor",1
"Professor Wheatley is very picky and confusing when it comes to grading. I definitely found the class extremely boring, which made me dislike it even more. She doesn't post our grades on Blackboard, so you don't even know your current standing in the class. Personally, I regret taking this class as my COLL 150.",0
Amazing teacher gives good feedback and will definitely learn in the class I would love to take it again.,1
He is a nice and funny guy but I would not take him again. He acts like he offers so much help but really doesn't. You really need to know your stuff to pass this class.,0
Professor Ebels is a great professor and understands peoples limitations when it comes to online class. As long as you do the work and participate in discussion questions you will be fine. Also responds to emails quickly,1
She is nice and amazing.,1
"Not an ""easy A"" class but she's a good professor. Funny at times and has a lot of interesting things to say about the subject. If you work hard you should do well.",1
"I'm horrible with statistics, but I went to class every day and tried. If you show up and at least try he'll work with you and give you a decent grade. There are a few tests, a group project, and some difficult SPSS assignments. Overall the class wasn't too bad.",1
"Esposito is an awesome professor. He makes greek history engaging and even though it's expected that you read all the material, he breaks it down so well that if you miss a few days of reading you won't have trouble knowing what's going on. Highly recommend",1
"When I am confident that I could teach a class better than the professor, I don't recommend them. This is the case with Dr. Blaustein. I'd like to have a beer with the gentleman, sure, but I'd like someone more straightforward and serious teaching me Biology. Learning taxonomy is no fun, and when the lecturer wastes your time it's even worse.",0
Joan is amazing. SO SO caring about her students and really does care about their mental well being amongst their academic career. Very clear grading criteria and projects. Nothing was ever hard just took some time. Very interesting class and a nice breather from my hard sciences. Would highly recommend and would take again.,1
"I had him as my prof; when he loses his temper, he will become a wild aggressive attacker. why is he teaching us?",0
This class included some interesting material but we never gave any of the readings the attention they deserved. The class is superficial and pretentious and the professor will laugh in your face/make the classroom environment very uncomfortable.,0
"His class was one of the few classes that I felt confident in. The only thing I didn't like was spending $120 on a work book that he wrote. You need the work book in order to pass. Don't skip this class, trust me, you actually want to show up, he makes it interesting.",1
"not the best teacher in the world. its a good class but the teacher has her own expectations. my previous teachers have made english pretty interesting which motivated me to actually read, she made the class very bland. if you don't like english much, this is not the class for you",0
"I've only had her for one course, but she is a very caring professor. She really cares how you do in her class and takes the time to help you on your assignments, ensuring that you understand concepts clearly and correctly. I recommend taking her classes.",1
"He is a very self-righteous person, doesn't believe that he consists of imperfections. Claims he is the best writer, and can do anything better than anyone. Excessively talks about movies and shows. Loves to play Devil's advocate but isn't open minded enough to see other sides. Offers suggestions but will tell you that you're mediocre. Conceited.",0
"VERY BORING! His lectures do not correspond with his tests. Puts questions on tests that weren't even covered in the chapters assigned. A lot of movies that will put you to sleep, only watches the beginning and expects you to know everything about the play. Relates everything to sex...(notice no pepper by his name) TRY TO GET A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!",0
"I'm taking this class because I'm a transfer student and I want to fulfill my science requirement as a business major. I've dealt with difficult physics, and this class is easy. Freda's lectures are clear and he tests you from your notes. The labs are also fairly easy. He really makes you *think* about your answers, which helps. Good professor.",1
"David is alright, I mean he knows his stuff I would say a good coach and very knowledgeable of judo. However his class requires too much effort for a 1 unit class. And he only explains the move once, its tough for people who have no background in martial arts or wrestling. I didnt find him as funny as the people suggested in the comments below.",0
NEVER take this prof. Does not care about students grades and does not help teach students how to write. Worst prof. I have ever had.,0
"Attendance is vital to passing the class. The hardest class I have taken so far. Lots of homework, but it balances out your grade because the tests are brutal. Shes a good teacher, but talks very fast and once you fall behind its hard to catch back up. Its a lot of self-teaching as well. Be prepared for any question she asks, theres a lot.",1
An outstanding drawer and knows what he's doing. Is casual in his unique ways. He really tries to help anyone who puts in the effort to ask for the help. He's not going to push to help you unless you push first. Focuses a lot on the real world applicability/getting a portfolio ready but gives no dedicated time to it in class.,1
"Cares about what you learn, really wants you to pick your topics so it allows you to be interested and care about your work! Good professor and very reasonable!",1
"One of my favorite teacher!! Don't mess around in class or she will call you out on it. Textbook, tests and homework are done online and she is very good about helping. Sometimes it's hard to understand her, but she tries hard to make it clear. Very on top of everything including grades. Concerned about her students, always willing to help.",1
"Professor Huffman is such a sweet man! He really cares about his students' success. He has so many inspiring lectures especially for students who are education majors. There aren't many assignments, but attendance is mandatory. I loved this class and would take him again if he taught more class.",1
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or get a tutor. When you ask to get help on a question he will not help you and look at you like you should know everything. He doesn't give you credit for any homework if you miss the class period they checked it in no matter the circumstances.,0
"By far the worst professor and class. She reads off the slides and sounds very unknowledgeable, I learned nothing in the class. Lectures consist of basic concepts about health, but exams are about the smallest, most irrelevant of details. Study her slides and you'll at least get a B in the course. Need a GPA boost or easy course, take it.",0
"Dr. Raja's class isn't that hard, but be prepared to be talked down to a lot...I just kept my head down and surfed the back row.  Not a lot of busy work outside of class at least.  You can pull off a B in her class relatively easily if you just study a bit and show up, but I found her sense of humor and attitude toward students really irritating.",0
"Dr. Hansen is the best- he tries to get to know the students which is great for networking. I took his soil science class and I loved how much passion he has for soil! Definitely do the reading and pay attention during lecture for your own benefit, but he doesn't mind if you fall asleep during lecture lol. Class takes effort, but not impossible.",1
"I have ECO 495 entirely online. We are using R and he does not explain how to do the assignments in his lecture videos. If you ask questions, he seemingly gets angry at you. I am an economics major and not a computer science major, so I do not know how to code in R. He also made us buy a book he only mentioned in the syllabus and not in banner.",0
She's a great instructor and very easy. I even emailed a lab report a day before it was due to her to see if it needed improvement and she sent it back less than 30 minutes later. she's very dependable and willing to help. She'll even tell you the answers if you just take the time to ask her. she's great!,1
Dr. Ihrman is my best teacher you so must take him!!!!,1
"Such a sweet woman! She's very easy to get along with and it really isn't that difficult to get on her good side. As a teacher, she is quite laid-back and loves to joke around a lot which does lead to going off topic sometimes. Don't be afraid to talk to her, she's very understanding. Plus, she does swear in class. Super entertaining!",1
"I have no idea why would SDSU first decided to hire such professor, who is the most irresponsible and ridiculous professor ever. He apparently does not understand how to talk with students, and his way of teaching was autarchic. No one in my class ever like him, please resign yourself if you have any consciousness left in you!",0
"The lectures are scattered but helpful, however his tests were usually too long and he values the conceptual questions more than computational. I feel like we had fewer concepts than other Diff Eq classes but we had to go much more in depth. He was a good lecturer overall and gave good curves at the end.",1
"She allows you to put notes on 1 side for your cheat sheet. Watching her recorded lectures is important. You have to pay for online hw. For the exam, She tells you what to study for. For Quantitative Q's, she tells you what she will test you on. For Concept Q's, she doesn't specify. So pray that what you put on the sheet, will appear on the exam.",0
"In the beginning she seems like a nice,good professor but the whole semester we did nothing, I learned nothing, struggled with quizzes and tests she let us take home because we did nothing in class, can never get ahold of her out of class, she grades stuff late & I felt I didn't get the grades I should have. Nice lady, but should not be a professor",0
"She gives a review the lab before the practical. However, it is misleading because she would say certain parts would not be on the test but it ends up being on the test. She also takes points off for spelling. You are better off reading the manual. It is a hard lab for an already hard class.",0
"One of the best professors I've had at GVSU, 100% recommend! He absolutely loves what he's teaching and this makes it easy to listen to his lectures & learn from him. I love that he includes small videos & new journal articles into his lectures that correspond to what he's teaching. He also adjusted really well to teaching remotely due to COVID-19!",1
"I have taken this professors class online for summer 1 (5 week course). The good news is if you're taking another class you can put off this class until Monday becase that's when everything is due. The bad news, her tests are HARD she does give you an outline and review questions for each chapter but those won't help you for the midterm/final exams",0
"Boring speaker, monotone, with no passion. I have Aspergers and have difficulty with social situations. He did not accommodate my disability, just scoffed. Group projects would have been much better if there was a discussion board, forum, or chatsomething to get to know classmates and discuss problems. If I could ask for a refund I would",0
"1500 words comparative paper, 2500 words research paper and final exam make it like 400+ level history class.",0
Weeks will go by before you get your graded work back & then w/no clear guidance as to what you did wrong/how to fix it. Syllabus not clear (but in a late graded paper she stated she will not READ anything with more than 200 words). She set up a MTG & didn't even show up on time. She is rude and extremely short when speaking to you. I rate her F+,0
"Professor Regan is a nice, funny guy. I wanted to like his class. I wanted to become a better writer. Did not happen. Regan is an extremely tough grader. He does not always give clear expectations and office hour appointments are good to show you care and he likes when you come (grade helper) but don't expect actual help.",0
"Graham should never be able to teach a college class again. If you want your GPA to get bent over then take his class. If you want someone who just expects you to learn everything on your own then take Graham, everyone I talked to from my class was also failing all quarter long. Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",0
I strongly disliked social psych with Pilkington. The lectures are long and dry and would advise you to take social psych with any other professor. The tests require you to have crazy specific knowledge on all of the info covered in class so be prepared to completely memorize all of the notes you take in class.,0
"Outside of teaching, he seems like a very friendly man. But he has taken away my love of writing by assigning vague subjects to create structured papers. His grading is harsh and his assignments dont give enough time to complete. Even the writing center is no help, they tell me they dont know how to. The topics are negative and unspecific.",0
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant man.  However, he's incredibly intolerant when it comes to others' opinions and monopolizes the class discussions.  I don't recommend him, but if you must take him, just try to keep your mouth shut and do what he says.",0
Amsler treats the class as a review for everyone. Her explanations are difficult to follow and the class is EXTREMELY DRY. She flies through slides and does not post them or allow pictures to be taken. There is a lot of homework and reading involved. Definitely the most difficult class I have taken so far. I would not recommend her.,0
"Coffey is a good guy, he wants you to do well. If you show up to class and put in just a bit of effort, it goes a long way. He knows a LOT about teaching and education. Even though the course is boring, that's not his fault.",1
He's a great professor who likes English way too much.,1
"I would avoid VIctoria at all costs, but she unfortunately is the only professor for Thesis. By far the worst experience I have ever had at GVSU. Very condescending & rude. She has laughed & scoffed in my face multiple times. Very unclear/disorganized & expects the world from you when she doesn't even have her own head on straight. Needs to retire.",0
Great professor! Take!,1
Quizzes everyday and is a tough grader. Her tests are very hard and her tests / quizzes are worded very hard. Don't take her you will hate that class and she makes it so much harder. HW every week and her lectures are so long and boring but you have to stay to get points for the quizzes.,0
"Mrs. Zeoli is a great lady! I've always struggled (and failed) through math courses; she takes all the time you need to help you understand the material fully, is fun and engaging with the class, and teaches at a decent pace. Highly reccommended for anyone who needs extra help passing math!",1
This teacher is AWESOME. Easy speeches that are only like 3 minutes long. He is very passionate about his classes. I only had him for half of the semester but he is a great teacher from my experience.,1
"Ok, kids. I had Mrs. O'Donnell back in the 80's. She was tough, but thank god I took her class. From day one after graduation, I was totally comfortable in front of large groups giving presentations. Think she's tough? Late to work like her class and you'll be fired. Learn from her- you WILL use it.",1
"I can't see how anyone can not like him! Having to take religion, I only took him and refused anyone else. I thought it would be religion shoved at you but no, it's the values and theology behind them. Plus, you learn a lot of valuable life lessons. It's the one gen.ed class I didn't mind at all and think everyone should take. WONDERFUL professor!",1
"Honestly, I am SUPER understanding of professors due to them also having personal lives. This, however, is so different. This class was supposed to be fun and interesting, especially during this election year but turned out to be the worst class I ever had. I had all As this semester besides this class due to disorganization and procrastination",0
Expects things your going to learn in class before you even learn them.  completely unrealistic expectations with no understanding.  She expects final week papers the first week of class.,0
"An above average Professor. I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, which were about 50/50 lecture to video/documentary. If you dislike the pausing of videos, he is not for you, as he will stop to clarify what is happening in the video. I found it helped me focus on the content. He has a lot to say about the philosophy of life, and how it affects you.",1
Professor Murphy was very understanding when I asked for clarifications or guidelines during the semester of this asynchronous class. There were four papers and extensive readings. I recommend watching the lecture videos while typing notes and then start reading and annotating the weekly texts.,1
"Dr. Mason was an awesome professor, and I loved having him. All of his course was laid out ahead of time on the syllabus so there were no surprises. You can tell he has a background in education because he really knows how to teach.",1
Lapp is a great professor to have and he will be there for you when you need help. Most students in his class do not take advantage of his office hours so therefore they are left confused. If you pay close attention to lapp's lectures you will understand the material.,1
"Honestly, it went from DOWN to UGLY. It started weak and could have ended pretty bad. I didn't think college teachers would go on every single class talking about their family, their weekends, their nephews and how they're queen of a subject when they can't even help you right and can't answer their own quizzes. Just read the BOOK and take NOTES!",0
"Pretty good teacher.  He always eats a donut every hour on the hour, which I always thought was kind of peculiar.  Then again, I once ate my own **** to win a $3 bet, so who am I to judge.",1
"The material he teaches in class is almost no help when it comes to homework. Then when it comes to tests, reviewing homework, the study guide (which is a list of topics), and writing a sheet of notes seem almost useless, because the problems are not what you prepared for. The good thing is that tests are heavily curved as well as the final grade.",0
"Dr. Capper is by far one of the best professors on campus.  He is extremely helpful and kind, and always finds ways to help his students understand the material.  I had Rel 131 with him, and I also went to India with him last summer.  Do not believe a harsh word anyone says!  If you want to learn, take him!",1
"She has very high expectations for her students. She is obviously very knowledgeable and influential if you are going into legal studies, but if you are not then avoid taking her class. She talks down to her students consistently, but if you can ignore that and take advantage of her office hours she will help you out. Patience is key.",0
This professor will not reply to your emails and never sent out emails regarding our assignments. Our class was left with nothing and his syllabus was super unclear. He cut class short due to COVID-19 but never graded any of our work; even as a I write this I dont know my grade in the course due to his poor involvement with the class.,0
"Terrible class. Prof is passionate about his own research, but is otherwise very monotonous and lectures regurgitate the textbook exactly - didn't even study lectures for exams, and skipped a bunch. Put in groups of 5-6 for projects that could have been done with 2-3 people tops. Most people just end up sitting around. Vague with instructions.",0
This guy will give you a zero if he doesn't like what you write on case studies. Most professors will give you some points but no this guy he is either a zero or an A that is it. Don't try to speak to him about it he wont care.,0
"Awesome person, terrible teacher. His lectures were all over the place and was hard to figure out what the main points were. For every exam he would actually tell you to Google the answers because we wouldn't have talked about it in class. The exam questions were written like we were all experts. Honestly the worst ENV class I have ever had.",0
"Changed an open book exam to closed book less than 48 hours before, is hard to follow during class, can be very unclear during lectures. Moves at an unreasonable pace and does not post lecture notes until after the case/unit is over, which is unhelpful for trying to study or if you have to miss class.",0
He made tests too difficult for students to pass. Was never prepared and was not very intresting during class.,0
"My GPA was a 4.0 until this class. This woman is ridiculous! I received a F for my milestone 3 for my final project. She said I needed to use parenthetical references which I used 8! One solution for bullying I used for the anti-bullying campaign and she said it doesn't tie in! Um, what?! If you are unlucky enough to get her, change that course!!!",0
"(REMOTE INSTRUCTION) This course is HIGHLY READING INTENSIVE. 60% of your grade is based on reading questions. But Egan is the only professor I've had this semester who is actually receptive to student feedback. He is very flexible with deadlines if you miss them, and will adjust workload if students feel they are getting too overwhelmed.",1
"Take him with caution. Very, very quirky. He will punish you if you do not attend the lectures, which are typically rife with upper-level dad jokes and random stories about his life. He can break down the material decently. He cares about students, but he's too idealistic for grace. As a lawyer, he is extremely legalistic about every aspect.",0
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.,0
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"Professor Bullock is extremely passionate about not only material, but knowing each and every student. He gave very specific feedback on each and every paper we turned in, and I can truthfully say he improved my writing immensly. If you have the chance to take him, do it!",1
Literally avoid her like the plague. Does everything out of the textbook. Her personality is annoying. She made the class painfully dreadful and uninteresting. The entire class was doing exercises from the textbook and she always made us work with partners because she's too lazy to do anything with us.,0
"Cochran is just straight up awesome; I had him for American folk music. Sometimes his lectures are a little loose, and on quizzes I occasionally had a hard time with obscure names (so GO TO CLASS and take notes). But the material is interesting, esp. if you're into music, and he's a super nice guy and knows his subject. No tests; one big paper.",1
DON'T TAKE HER,0
"If you are in the hybrid class, theres a lot of assignments due weekly. Its kind of hard to keep track. We also meet weekly online but you only have to attend 4 of those sessions. We take tests in class. She does put a lot of time to try to make sure every body knows what their doing however shes a little confusing at times",1
"She is a terrible teacher for physiology. She was forced to give everyone curves because her tests were always terrible. She goes way too fast, cannot explain anything, but she does try to be nice. Her grading is just....bad...half of the time she doesn't even know what she marked you off for. Avoid her at all costs!",0
"He is a story-teller, he always talks about his experiences. Attendance is mandatory but you get 1 excused absence. He enjoys what he teaches also all of the slides are online. His test are tough and you need to study.",1
She was very passive aggressive towards students. Every question was a stupid question. I'm taking her again since she's the only one who fit with my schedule. Nothing changed. You can get a good grade but it's just an annoying class.,0
Avoid at all cost. Very distant and disorganized.,0
Very energetic and bright guy!,1
"He's a bit tough to learn from although he does want his students to pass. If you have lots of trouble in math, don't take him.",1
"super cool professor and really easy class. makes lectures fun. she will call you out if you are talking while she is trying to teach, so be respectful. attend class if you want to remember the topics easier",1
"Good teacher all around, very fair with the amount of work assigned. Graded pretty fairly, though his handwriting is on par with a seismograph so don't expect criticism without asking in person. Tests were hard but fair, prepare for the essays because you don't have much time to write them!",1
Said she would correct the team project before the exam but didn't. We therefore had no clue how to write the solutions adequatly in the exam.,0
his class is pretty easy as long as you do the discussions and finish the quizzes before deadlines. He gave helpful feedback and graded often too. Also he was one of the most supportive professors I had during this pandemic. He would always check up on his students and email us any resources or job opportunities he found. 10/10,1
"Was one of my favorite professors at LSU so far. She is a fairly challenging teacher but she is very passionate about what she teaches. I went to her office hours several times and she was always nice and willing to help, especially on her researcher papers (definite thing). Would definitely recommend her, as you will learn a lot. Worth the effort.",1
"Everyone complains about this class but if you put in the work (reading the chapters, taking notes on the chapters, showing up to lectures I found typing up all my notes during lecture was really helpful it is doable. Yes, the quizzes are harder than the test but it's good test prep and you have 99 tries to get a better grade. She's also sweet :)",1
"Class was supposed to be on inductive logic, though we didn't cover much of that. Not really a way to fulfill math requirement. West got off topic a lot and seemed more into trying to entertain than teach. Easy A, but don't expect to learn much.",0
"Paul was frivolous and arbitrary in his criticisms and unhelpful with our projects. Instead of teaching a material, he told us what to use and gave a brief demo in equipment. We ended up having to get around using the material instead of mastering it. His assignments were obscure.",0
"Every-time I asked for help, she made me feel like the dumbest person alive. She is so smart that its hard for her to dumb things down. If you dont have a strong science background, youll probably fail.",0
I don't like her because she hates foregners.,0
"Professor Admiraal is amazing! She makes English interesting, class lectures are full of humor, well thought out, and enlightening. Her teaching style is difficult to get used to at first-it took me four class periods, but Professor Admiraal is a sweet lady and she takes time to talk to her students. Class readings were bad--liberal Atlantic!",1
He is a very nice professor however he says papers only deserve at most a 93% which I believe is unfair. He gives one extra credit assignment. Other than that hes a good guy.,1
Worst professor I have ever had!,0
She is AMAZING! Dr. Birnbaum is brilliant and truly cares about the success of her students. I have never seen someone actually teach the way she does. I learned so much from the class. Tests are hard but you can get an A if you talk to her and take good notes.,1
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
I barely went to class... just for the review and tests. Going to class will just confuse you because all she does is drag on topics and uses big words for no reason. Her power points are literally just words without explanations. The only reason I got a B- was because I never went to class and just read out of the book.,0
Wonderful teacher with lots of knowledge of the topic. Highly recommend......,1
"I highly recommend if you can take another professor, do it. Every lab you will have a quiz on the previous lab section done, there's about five assessments not including the final, and a research paper. She acts highly unprofessional outside of class and rude. The phrasing of her tests will be confusing. Although if you do get her, get a tutor.",1
Dr. Pringle taught the second semester of this course and she is a fantastic person and her lectures were well organized but her tests were absolutely ridiculous. She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,0
"This was Grubb's first time teaching the class since the 90s. While I think Grubb would be a good professor for higher level courses, he seemed to assume we already had a basic knowledge of economics, and many things were left unexplained. Notes were unorganized and scrambled. However, office hours for problem set questions were helpful.",0
Took him for the basic linux class.  Within the first couple of weeks we had already covered the entire course material the department chair taught in his class.  We then started doing heavy bash scripting and customizing our kernal with little explanation on what exactly we were doing it for.  Taught material way to advanced for a basic course.,0
"Avoid this class/teacher at all costs. She is way too upbeat to be a human. Her grading is ridiculous. Our team got points off because she ""felt we didn't get along"". When we asked her about it she said it was because she just had a feeling. We all liked each other a lot actually.",0
"I don't think I've been more uncomfortable in a class as his.  He's very intense and passionate about his work and expects his students to be as well.  He went on a tirade one day when he felt our class wasn't participating enough in the class discussions.  I appreciate his style, but I will not take another class from him again.",1
"A very patient and understanding professor. If you put the required work in, you should be able to achieve a good grade in his class. Offers extra credit for going to the Writing Center, so that helps as well. Make sure to do the readings and the short assignments, so your papers are much easier to write. Also, he enjoys precise writing!",1
Where to begin. Simply impossible to succeed in this class. Amazing she still teaches at East Bay.,0
"she is the last person that needs to be in health care field. i missed the 1st day my son was in hospital and she informed me she didnt care and refused to tell me what i missed then brought it up in her lecture as an ""example or hypothetical situation"" critical condescending, its all about her and her life NEVER take her class",0
Interesting and kind person.,1
"Gave the final exam. Was challenging, but then I have learnt more in this course than any other at University of Winnipeg!!",1
She doesn't give feedback or let you see what you got wrong on quizzes. This is especially a problem because she has made mistakes grading. She gets annoyed when students ask questions. I basically taught myself using the online homework and book.,0
"This class was taken online, which I highly recommend. Lots of negative feedback from peers who took the in-person lecture class. The textbook is essential, especially if math is not your strong suit. A condensed course, 2 chapters & quiz a week. Take the time to do the computation examples. Time management is imperative to success in this class.",1
"Such a great professor. He is passionate about what he does which is the most important thing. He made a subject I didn't find particularly interesting in neuroscience (sensorimotor system) really interesting, and he's so cute! Very knowledgable, and sweet.",1
"Easy A, but you actually learn in the class. She has a lot of guest speakers that actually teach you things you should really know going out into the world. She gives only a midterm and final, but goes over it with you before you take it. She also assigns 2 papers that are opinionated based and short.",1
She is unfocused and unfair.,0
"Professor Reyes's class was the only SPA class that I didn't stress about. We had a small class of about 12, so there was a lot of attention to each student's skills. He put a very heavy focus on speaking and writing, which helped out majorly for the tests (all that was left was memorizing vocab words). He was also super personable. Great prof!",1
"Hardest class I've taken. Almost nothing covered in his lecture is on the test. you must rely on the reading for that material. Loves talking about himself. If you can teach yourself, then you can do well.",0
Very very vague assignment instructions. I had no idea what I was doing the entire time in this course. It was mandatory for me but his classes are not mandatory don't take them! He is also really quiet and zones out a lot. He does not explain anything in class or on paper.,0
"Do not take this class whatever you do. If you want to learn calculus you are better looking at youtube tutorials than learning it here. If you do not spend 5+ hours studying the homework (Given every 2 days) then you will fail the class. If you do take Eran Makover, Good luck!",0
Stay away.  Bad professor.  He is absolutely obsessed with printers and computers. Went into the class wanting to learn more about engineering and the class did not teach me anything i already didn't know.,0
"Very interesting class, wish he didn't have to grade. He was just very unclear had us reading like 3 (100 page) chapters a night, it's a good class for those students who don't have to earn a living and don't have kids.",0
Very nice as a non major it was a relief to not feel like the art I was putting out had to be as good as the rest of the class because she understood it isn't the same,1
"Fridlund definitely knows his stuff, but in the case of Psych 1, too well. He clearly stopped giving a crap about this class at least a decade ago. The class is structured so poorly that apparently the TAs still (a quarter later) sometimes talk about how useless it was. Take him for upper divs, for intro wait till winter, spring, or summer.",1
"He makes some materials easy, and he shows them in step. Sometimes I felt like he assumed that we already knew how to do certain things. If we didn't understand anything, he would say ask, but sometimes I was scared to ask because he would say, it's easy, you guys should get it. Practice the material that he teaches on your own, and you'll get it.",1
"Great Teacher!! REALLY helpful and fun, You can tell she enjoys teaching- tries to teach you and easy to get an A in her class if you study before the tests and go to class. At times I felt that she wasn't challenging enough, but then again I LOVE Spanish. Recommend!!!! :)",1
"Dr. Hays made this class interesting and fun. He helped us understand the basics of developmental psychology with interesting discussions. He does not post grades, which can be stressful.",1
Professor was always available for my questions and helpful with my queries when I was puzzled. The added bonus I gained from this class in addition to in depth network administration knowledge was an industry standard certification for network administration which will be extremely valuable for job hunting in a competitive employment market.,1
"This class is very time consuming. You must pay attention and come to class. If not you will fall behind and fail. He tries to make it clear and simple. He is very laid back. But if you email him, he only answers back half the time. Decent but yet stressful class.",1
There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure. He is a very sweet guy and tries his best to teach during these trying times but I don't recommend him for online classes. The only two things he's grading is a midterm and a final that's it.,0
do not take this class. definitly drop it!,0
He is not the most responsive and his grades are tough but not horrible. The tests are hard and he doesn't always get grades back right away,1
She was awesome and understanding,1
Be prepared to have your mind blown his lectures are so interesting and infuriating how nothing is being done about the problems in the world. He is very caring and he is always making sure were good for nothing is wrong. We only had to write two essays a midterm and final and group projects.,1
"Professor Rice makes this lab very difficult. She grades very harshly, and also waits forever to post grades, leaving you in the dark as to how your doing. Professor Rice gives poor feedback on assignments and is not very flexible/understanding.",0
"Really Great Professor. Did not find him at all boring or 'dry'. Far from possessing monotone, very passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. His grading system is fair, exams will be fairly easy if you study the outline he gives you. Take this class!",1
"Reminds of School, Sending you back if you are 5 mins late to class, i am serious not joking at all! Gives a lot of Quizes and final is cummulative! Trust me guyz dont ever take her class. Lot of studying for low grade!",0
"Professor Zipf is a very nice woman, but her classes are terrible. She is a verbal teacher and there are no power-points. Her blackboard exams are really hard. A lot of the people n my class hardly passed. One good thing was, at the end of the grading period she changed around her grading % to make everyone have a higher grade.",0
"Professor Swift was decent. He had good lectures, so make sure you go to them. His tests were pretty hard. He will answer and go over any questions people have during class, so he was very helpful in that way. When we transitioned to online learning, the quality of learning decreased, but I think he might have just been adjusting to the new style.",1
If Geology 1 was the last class you needed to take and if professor irwin was the only professor available I would seriously  consider staying another year! This class is the biggest joke I've ever taken and she is the most useless person I've ever met in my life. You have a better chance of passing your tests by closing your eyes and drawing,0
Doesn't use clickers and attendance is taken occasionally. Test are easy if you study and offers a study group session that I HIGHLY recommend going to. She is very passionate about what she teaches and offers help if asked. She uses UD capture and there is no homework for this class. Get textbook if this isn't your strong suit but can pass w/o it.,1
Been in this class for 4 weeks and already dont know whats going on. Very unclear expectations and does not talk about/go over the chapters in a way that should help with the test.,0
"If you want to be ""taught"" by someone who's in love with her so-called education in feminine and gender studies and makes everything in class about that, you'll love her! She's all about politics and her personal social agenda. Disagree and and she resorts to threats. Technically vacuous, so learning degenerated to self-study. Worst in my lifetime.",0
"Professor Will was probably one of the worst math teachers i've had in awhile. First, he isn't clear about his subject and never actually answers your questions. My advice would be to test out of this course it was a waste of my time. Also treated our class like he was teaching 2nd graders",0
worst teacher ever. went to see her for help in office and did not help what so ever. gave me the lowest grades on papers when i worked for hours on them. book readings mandatory. talks to much of herself and does not clarify well. do not recommend.,0
"An absolutely fantastic professor and person. I had him when he led the London First Program for the first time, and he was incredible and the made the experience even more memorable! Every class is engaging, he works hard to contextualize and make information more tangible, and truly cares about his students. Definitely take a class with him!",1
"Worst professor I have ever had! He writes the wrong numbers and or answers to example problems on the board which throws everything off frequently.  He also does not respond to emails promptly if at all.  He posts practice problems, but never promptly posts the answers even when you remind him in class or email him.",0
"Ayland is an amazing teacher. He cares about the students, and is clear on grading criteria. He wants students to learn the material, and really puts lots of energy into the course. Highly recommend.",1
"Rudest professor I've ever had. He is extremely condescending and has an attitude most days, which isn't the best thing to deal with at 8am. A clicker is also required for the course, which costs $75, and is only used to take your attendance. Grades are based on few assignments. Honestly just don't take this class unless you're super into religion.",0
Lectures are hard to follow and she sidetracks a lot. Very unclear grading criteria on assignments. Prepare to read upfront!,0
Cogan is a very nice guy.  I thought this class was lots of fun and he's an easy grader!,1
Amar is a smart man but not a good Professor. Last day of class he went through the attendance records and blasted those he felt either didn't attend class often enough or didn't give him the attention he was due. Useless.,0
"Only have had this professor for a month and I already hate this class. Extremely rude. Yelled at us the second week of class when only 4 of us had purchased HIS textbook (which at the time was sold out). Also received the ""taxpayers pay for you to come here make the most of it"" speech. Boring lectures. Acts like his class is the only class we take",0
"I took this course online, and I'm usually fine in online classes. This teacher takes a long time to grade assignments and doesn't always unlock the new weeks assignments right away. She responds quickly to emails. I love history but this class was kind of boring. It's not that the information itself is boring, just the way it was presented.",1
"Honestly this class was unreasonably difficult for a 101 class. It's not that it was hard necessarily, just way too much work expected for such a low level course. Lectures were not good and she just read off the slides for the most part that had nothing to do with the tests. Too much outside work and event attendances required.",0
I enjoyed this class a lot. It was challenging without being overwhelming. The instructor has great presentations to help learn the vocab words. Some of the activities in the book can get boring but the ones she makes herself are great! She is really picky about following instructions and calls on people to speak. But she is fair in her grading.,1
The class itself is kind of tedious but Prof. Lange is great and makes it interesting. Also a genuinely great guy.,1
"Good guy, bad professor. He asks very passive aggressive questions and makes students feel bad when they dont have the same political views as him. He cancels class a lot, and his lectures are very long, boring, and repetitive. Easy grade for busy work and can find answers because he doesnt teach what is on the tests.",0
"Jana was an exceptional Professor! She only took four grades, but as long as you show up to class and do the work then you will be fine.",1
He was terrible.  He refused to help students and when he did he was very vague and just confusing.  ,0
"Had Dr. Palacios before she became a permanent part of the department. She reads off her notes which shows she does not know her material, her test was so hard everyone failed so she added a bonus essay. She seems sweet but she is boring in class and her textbook is sooooooo dry. AVOID.",0
This man is a terrible professor. His class is boring. Out of all of the staff in the English Department I had the worst dislike for him. Attendance is a must but that is self explanatory. I took his ENL 369 Gender and Negotiation class. He is unfair with his grading and is not understanding at all. He grades very harsh and low.,0
"What I liked about Professor Mayne is that she consistently provided feedback, and applied her knowledge and wisdom to her perspective on the case studies and analysis of basic employment law. It is necessary to read in order to understand the course thoroughly. Her organization and guidance made the course successful.",1
yee,0
"He thinks he's the next Freud. He literally teaches his opinions and his exams are hard af. Beware nursing majors, I got an A in orgo and could barely pull an A- in this class. The paper and hw will pull u up a lot tho. Study his class notes, things that seem subjective aren't his opinion is always the answer.",0
"Awesome, awesome, awesomeeee!!! He loves math, it's his passion. He's funny, understanding, and knows what he's teaching and helps the students 110% HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!Not too bad to look at either",1
Really great professor. Ken Lewis is a very sweet man and is so knowledgeable about what he teaches. Method of teaching is a little bit of an adjustment but he does a really good job of explaining everything in depth. Always accessible for office hours. Exams are extremely similar to practice exams so no surprises w/ grades.,1
"Her lectures are straightforward but allows students to ask questions Readings are important and so is section The essays exams are not super easy but not hard either, gotta make sure you provide the relevent info (regarding the question) and that it is adequate to support your position (undefined number of paragraphs) overall good class",1
Had Dr. Sullivan for Border Crossings. Phenomenal class. There are a lot of readings however so be prepared to have a heavy amount of work. She is very passionate about her work and very nice. Great Professor. Do all the readings and assignments and you'll be fine.,1
This course was designed by someone else but Dr. Laura ran it online. I received an excellent grade and opportunities for bonus assignments.,1
"Definitely, do the packets he hands out even though they are ""optional"". Most of the questions are on the tests. Also, no word banks so learn your definitions. STUDY FOR TESTS.",1
"Took this class to check off my cultural class requirement and it was great. He is a very nice teacher that wants you to do well. Read ""To Shake the Sleeping Should"" which was a great book. I used audible which made it easy to do his study guide while listening to the book. 1 portfolio project and 2 tests on top of the book quizzes . 10/10",1
"The lecture notes are mostly just definitions of everything and a few examples that weren't very helpful to me. Homework and Labs due before tests, she gives a review sheet and formula sheet for each test but I did not learn any of the material well or understand how and when to use certain equations. Got distracted easily, nice but not the best.",0
I find her classes most challenging and interesting. Best prof. I ever had at Alma.,1
You will have a lot of homework if you take his class!!!,0
"This was the worst English professor I have ever had. He rambles on about philosophy and the true meaning of friendship and ""philia."" He makes you join a messageboard to post your ""excellent thinking"" and it's all extremely pointless. Beware this class and if you already have it I would drop.",0
"Ms. Brock squeezes ever single minute out of class, letting no minute go to waste. She is very helpful and gives reasonable amounts of(very easy)homework. I love her class and her discussions, however don't come in late, you don't want to miss a thing, moves fast at times, which is a good thing.",1
"If you have the option to take another teacher, go for it. She's unclear about what she wants due for class.",0
"he only likes you if you agree with him, otherwise he might threaten your professional relationship (""I'm on the board that selects students who get fellowships; I hope this won't affect our professional relationship""), might conveniently ""lose"" your work...",0
"Three hour class that can be done in 15 mins. The professor skips over the slides, which I could be doing at home. Papers are simple but he is a tough grader for no reason. Does not provide constructive criticism for you to do better on the next paper. Asks questions about your opinion, however if it is against his opinion then you are wrong.",0
"Professor Neff wants all his students to succeed, he is truly an amazing professor and wonderful person! Loved the thought-provoking, unique experience in his IH 0851 class so much that I am taking his IH 0852 class. Readings are engaging and he loves open-ended class discussions (makes everyone more open to talking together on their thoughts).",1
"He's a great teacher, I now love math because of him.",1
"Dr. Mandell is one of my favorite professors I have ever had. There is a ton of reading, but it is a literature class so that is to be expected. She is very big on participation in class, but that is not a difficult thing to do. She honestly cares about her students and it shows. She places emphasis on learning instead of grades. Would take again!",1
"This class is super easy. Assignments are simple, tests and quizzes are open book and can be taken several times. He's not very helpful if you have a question on an assignment. Really boring, but super easy.",1
"He is extremely repetitive to the point it gets annoying. For example, he repeated almost every day and at least 5 times a day that amphibians need water...His class is boring and his exams are not the easiest. There are only a few things you are graded on which doesn't help if you do badly on one thing.",1
I loved her ! She was extremely helpful. I took her for African American literature and she actually found a way to relate each reading to current issues . I would take her class again,1
"She was very unorganized, received marks for a group that was not mine. Not inspiring at all, hard to stay awake during class.",0
"Incredible, helpful and super nice. If you take his class and you study, you'll pass easily",1
Professor Bartz is probably the worst professor to have for an online class. I am convinced she just marks you down on assignments so you don't get 100. I compared my assignment to a class member and her feedback was the same exact as the feedback she had given me. If you are not going into AT do not take this professor.,0
her complete and total lack of meme knowledge was completely inappropriate. i give 1.5/10,0
She is awful. She never responds to a single email. She also missed 3 class periods (that were 6-9's) but made us still attend. Her powerpoints are boring and she is difficult to communicate with. She acts like students are an inconvenience to her and her time. The group presentation is graded the hardest out of all of your assignments.,0
Very willing to help-- a good teacher with a very creative mind.,1
"She demands contacting via Canvas, which no other professor in HCC does. I tried emailing her for problems with the platform but she ""stated on the syllabus to contact her through canvas"" and that was enough to drop me without giving me even a chance to start the course. Dont risk your time or your money.",0
"She doesnt teach the material in class, instead she makes you watch videos at home at teach yourself. Videos have bad audio and do a poor job of teaching the material. Exams were long and difficult, good luck finishing them on time. If you use a different method than the one from the videos, she docks tons of points and accuses you of cheating.",0
I fully recommend her! She is better than my EN-100 instructor!,1
"AVOID THIS GUY AT ALL POSSIBLE!. His test are nothing like that homework, which by the way he couldnt even do half the time. The Bradley Phyics dept. is very good but whatever you do, dont take capozzi. He is a really cool guy but the worst teacher i have ever had in my life. take my advice.",0
"Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"made me question whether university was worth it, not worth it take a different course",0
Great teacher! Very kind and hilarious. My final paper was written about the work environment of the tv show Parks and Rec. Definitely recommend her!,1
One the best directors I have ever worked with.  He works the choir very hard but is very caring about each individual and knows so much about music.,1
One of the most inspiring professors Ive ever had. He LOVES chemistry. Seriously. But hes tough. He wants you to know chemistry and hell test you on it to make sure. You have to know it. I personally think its too much but hes really a great teacher.,1
"Dr. Singer is very difficult to follow, he makes mistake after mistake and is constantly making corrections on the board confusing us even more so. If asked a question, many times he becomes irritated and will repeat ""too many questions"" I will not take a class with him again. I would highly suggest checking into SCC for course equivalents.",0
"his class is horrible. He just uses textbook powerpoint and extremely hard tests. I thought marketing was be a bit easier, but this guy took to another level. You dont have to read the chapters 3 TIMES to pass, just go over the powerpoint slides on MindTap. Good luck if you have him!",0
"Craig is a great teacher. He does draw his explanations out alot but he does it so we can learn. Those that say they didnt like him is because they probably started trouble. HE teaches for a total of 4 classes, then gives us the remainder of the 11 weeks to work on our assignment and ask questions and he helps. HE knows his shyt",1
"Nice Professor, Helped me on my journey. I am doing much better now.",1
I hated every second of this class. I studied HOURS AND HOURS and still earned mediocre grades because the professor asked extremely specific question in exams. This made me extremely frustrated the entire semester. DO NOT take this class,0
"Not very interesting material but she takes extra time to make each lecture entertaining. Very clear with what is expected of you with homework, quizzes and tests with study guides for the latter two. A lot of material to cover but the study sessions helped especially before tests.",1
Class is impossible and professor does not teach. Only class I did not get an A in this semester.,0
"She's a very nice and easy teacher. Just do all the assignments on time and participate in the class group discussions, I bet you will get an A for sure. You can email her to ask when you have questions. Hard to find her in her office, usually she doesn't have office hours. I recommend take her class if you are an ESL student.",1
I think he expects a little more than he should for an introductory course but if you are interested in the subject matter he is amazing. He is incredibly knowledgeable and has a good sense of humor if not a bit dry. I will say he is not all that easy to approach but nice enough. The only problem I had was one of his student teachers that graded.,1
"Unclear instructions given for projects. She is unwilling to help if you are having difficulty understanding. She taught a color theory class without using color, she would only verbally describe projects. She did not enforce any deadlines, so most students did not have their work done for critiques and she would critique unfinished projects.",0
"As a junior biochemistry major, I've had all A/A- in all my sciences courses until this one. I got a C+ and struggled immensely. I don't blame him entirely.. i hated physics and did not work as hard as I should have but he did not make it easy with his unclear lectures and 5 point multiple choice questions on exams. Def would not recommend.",1
"Professor Christie seems to expect that his class should be above all others. His tests are ridiculously hard, equivalent to an AP Biology of Psychology class and his papers require more writing than an actual writing class. He also doesn't specify what is required for the writing assignments. ",0
Dr. Norris is a great professor. This class becomes increasingly difficult but he is more than willing to help you. He truly cares about his students.,1
The class was story-based so there's lots of reading. Projects are straightforward and easy if you've taken good notes and done the necessary reading. There are in-class points so I wouldn't skip much but there are also some extra credit opportunities that can help. She's nice and the lectures are interesting if you are into that stuff.,1
"Bloody brilliant. He knows how to keep class interesting. You need to actually do your reading, but I personally found the reading assignments (if not overwhelming at times) incredibly interesting. He's also extremely helpful in his advice on how you can improve your writing style and class work.",1
"Professor Anderson is great. His class is lecture based with short readings assigned. He shows some cool comedy skits that relate to the material. If youre uncomfortable discussing and thinking critically about religion, dont take his philosophy course. Pay attention and participate. He will fail you if you are frequently absent, so show up.",1
"Ms. Moody is a great professor and really does care about her students. She just wants to see you succeed, so come into class with a positive attitude. The A is literally spoon fed to you as long as you come to class, follow directions on all assignments, and do your cultural events well ahead of time. Lastly, she teachers this class for free!",1
"After 60 hours worth of classes, she is by far the worst professor I've ever had. I took the summer session A&P course and it was the most sporadic and unorganized class ever. She would loose our graded papers,  biased when it came to essay questions, and overall rude to students. She would make you feel unreasonably incompetent if you asked a ?.",0
"Lectures were very dull and hard to follow, plus he brought up his personal life a lot. This was a lot of people's first CS class and I didn't feel like I was being guided by a professor at all. He taught us things that weren't important for each section throughout the quarter. Please don't take if you are new to programming.",0
"nice guy, easy marker.",1
Incredibly arrogant and disinterested in students. Encourages students to drop out and is punitive towards those who are dissatisfied.  Far too impressed with herself and her work.,0
"Avoid. Does not tell you when ""enhancements"" are due. Trying to follow lecture is impossible and he will call on you and then cut you off. Just avoid.",0
"By far, the best online course I have ever taken. Li Liu sets her students up for success by providing a very organized course, clear grading criteria, provides lecture videos, weekly messages, and is interactive and involved with her students. I wish all online courses were as organized as hers!",1
"Dr Sam is a good professor. I have him only on Lab. Besides his heavy accent, he always try to explain everything clearly.",1
I have taken him for microbiology twice. He has improved so much. I was worried at first but i am so glad i took his class. He is a great guy! Show up to lecture and study. You will do fine.,1
Shes a nice person but her teaching style is entirely based around very low info power points and she says that the tests are based on the power points but they never were. She kept changing her teaching style when it came to reviewing for exams and it made it so you had no idea what the exam was going to be over. Talks VERY fast during lectures,0
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
"very interesting, very factual and funny",1
"The worst teacher I've ever had so far. He was always late and full of himself; lectures would often turn into a statistics class, which was neither interesting nor helpful. He often got carried away and shared personal details from his past. The lectures would end up being useless and had nothing to do with test questions. Made mean comments often",0
"I absolutely loved Rodell! He is the reason I now want to be a Biology major. He really wants everyone to learn the material. His tests are fair - if you go to class, you'll get a good grade. I am so sad that I am done with his class. He is the sweetest man too. TAKE HIM!",1
"Reads off powerpoint, doesn't explain anything. When she tries explaining she messes up and only confuses you more. Students corrected her on every quiz and exam because there was something wrong. Heavy accent which makes her more difficult. No curving, class grades are set lower although. Easiest Ochem professor at CSU although,just teach yourself",0
"absolute worst professor i have ever had in my life. I had to retake the class because she failed me with a 72. She may or may not be clinically crazy. Her tests are impossible, she is extremely lazy, she gives you one day to do hw. makes you hate microbiology bc shes so awful.",0
"If you want to take a class and memorize definitions word for word and get points taken off if you alter one word, hes your guy. Ask questions but beware hell make you regret it. Good luck (:",0
He talks too much about unnecessary stuff for Eng 101. he should focus more on explaining things that are really important for class.,0
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
I have nothing negative to say about Mr. Butman. I tried the class out and did not comprehend with his way of teaching. So now i am retaking Eng. 28 with a differ Professor (SANGHA) and it is a dramatic change. I am learning the concept that needs to be met for this english class.,0
"Yasser is best known for his catch phases like: ""Excellent Students"" ""Green light?"" ""I see you all nodding"" ""You are all excellent students and I am very proud of you""  He is a really nice guy that is insanely intelligent, but he cannot teach to save his life. If you are just looking for an A take his course, but you won't learn anything.",0
Easy and very very nice. One of my best profs. I have ever had.,1
"Worst class and worst professor I've ever experienced. Incoherent, arrogant, insecure, condescending. There's nothing I learned in this class that I couldn't have picked up from reading the books by themselves. In short: a waste of time. Buyer beware.",0
"hate this class! had tutor, read book, did online stuff and no help from her. learned more from outside group. Horrible teacher!",0
"The ASL class had a pleasant and quiet atmosphere. We didn't speak and really immersed ourselves in the language. The way she went about teaching without speaking wasn't hard to follow at all, like you may think. I would take the next ASL class with her again if I had the opportunity to do so.",1
"Unfortunately Nassau Community College does not have many chemistry professor options during the spring and the fall semester. Do not take this professor! confusing, misleading, sarcastic, and is very tough on tests. Half the class failed the first test. The only reason I passed was because this class became online during the later spring semester",0
"His teaching style is not easy to adapt to. The concepts in the class are drowned out by his example problems and poor explanations. The guy ""teaches"" coding and algorithms yet doesn't have the ability to operate his laptop (which uses Win '98...).",0
I DO NOT recommend her for Microbiology! She makes it very hard for no reason and expects you to just know everything. The lectures doesn't really help because it's pretty much the slides that are posted on bb. Exams are super hard! But she does curve at the end depending on the class average.,0
"Entirely too much homework. Discussion questions are complicated and grading is harsh. If you over clarify and give lots and lots of details, you will be fine. The project is extra long so, give yourself a lot of time to complete. Plan to spend all of your time outside of work and sleeping participating in the class.",0
"attendance is mandatory even though nothing she goes over is on the exams. Exams are based solely on the textbook. Probably would be better as an online course. Her attitude was not the best, i wouldn't recommend",0
"the class is easy, but if you dont stay on track its easy to fall behind. however, you can review everything a week before and do decent on the tests. they are taken at the testing center so you cant cheat. but he is super nice and super understanding and is willing to help you do better on tests.",1
"Simons is an awesome guy, and I really enjoyed this class. He is very effective at teaching and somehow makes economics quite interesting to learn about. Whatever is written on the board is guaranteed to be on the exam, so take good notes. I'd take him again and I would encourage anyone to take him. He's easy-going and likes to swear. Recommended.",1
I never opened the textbook I bought. Lots of online homework. She was often very snippy with our class and the final was an assigned group project.,1
Awful professor. Doesnt care what his TAs did in the class or how they graded. I passed his but Ive never had to work so hard for such a low passing grade.,0
"Easy professor for studio, doesnt give much work usually. but when he does he gives a whole lot together. Wen it comes to grading he sucks. If ur a teachers pet and suck up to him, then he's great for u.",0
"This was an easy class. However, it was the worst because of the teacher. He was rude through email and IS NOT ORGANIZED AT ALL!!!His lessons were all over the place: wrong lesson content. His due dates were the worst they were different every place you looked. For being a communication teacher, he is terrible at communicating!! Find another prof!!",0
"He's the best at what he does. He has extensive knowledge of the subject and shows various examples that are on his quizzes, also knows how to put people in their place. If you didn't pass pre-pre calculus then don't show up and go back to elementary math. Only true mathematics can attend his lectures. Best teacher of 2016-forever.",1
Great teacher! who cares.,1
"I made the mistake of not using ratemyprofessor before this class. Now I will NEVER sign up for a class before checking this website. He is absolutely horrible! He is a great example, however, of what kind of teacher I do NOT want to become. At least he's a bit inspirational in that way. Avoid like the plague!!!",0
Dr. Williams is a fantastic professor! He makes history so interesting and he is very caring.,1
"VERY helpful, she really wants you to do well in her courses",1
"I'm in love with this teacher and wish he would ask me to marry him. He is an amazing teacher and is extremely smart. He will answer any questions you ask him, and he doesn't sugar-coat the facts.",1
"He gives the worst grades ever. He lectured on A thing and mark you down for doing literally the exact same thing. He's good I give him that but doesn't allow him to be rude when giving comments. His instructions are unclear and his requirements are just too much. He's asking for too many things, even if you're doing everything asynchronously.",0
"I've had Dr. Johnson for 3 courses and have enjoyed each of them. The set up in each was: Participation & attendance counted like 10% of your grade, an annotated bibliography, paper abstract, and rough draft made up like 60% of your grade, quizzes are 10%, then a final paper worth 30%. The classes have been interesting and fun. Take her classes!",1
"Dr. Lim is a knowledgeable prof. Notes were clear. However, he is incapable of teaching or getting anything across. Took him in the summer, and it was painful to watch his lectures to get somewhere since he focuses on things that dont matter. His midterms were okay. Final was natural selection. Advice: dont take him unless you absolutely have to",0
Awful. Just plain awful. She actually believes learning Genetics just comes from learning by reading outdated papers about cystic fibrosis. Avoid at all costs.,0
"She is a waste of space.  Totally useless, living in the 80's.  This class, on the whole, is a waste of time and just a way for SCC to get money.  She thinks she is funny, she is not.  She claims you need the book, you do not.  She likes to be the grammar and spelling police when most of her work is laden with errors. The class is a complete waste.",0
"Popcorn reading from textbook with the whole class like its 5th grade and her lectures arent so much discussion as her telling you what she thinks you should think. Also no work 90% of graded work assigned in the last 2 weeks of class. Its a joke class, she doesnt teach you anything a few hours of wiki and google wouldnt, save your money!!",0
"I didn't really get the point of the class. Anyone can pass even if they fail both tests, not very challenging. Open book tests but that really doesn't matter because you won't finish it. The exams are graded on how much you can type not if the answers are ""correct"". He's an alright prof...",1
"He is a very boring professor, he asks trick questions on the tests, he brags about people getting low grades on his tests, he makes study guides that have nothing to do with whats on the tests, theres little to no extra credit in this class, and he doesnt round up grades at the end of the semester",0
"I hate these UDGE classes they make you take. But if you need one, this one is easy. 3 short papers, 1 group project, 1 pop quiz. All this class did for me was take 3 hours/week away that I would have spent studying for other classes. Teacher was nice.",1
"Lecture heavy, goes through many power points. You must pay attention and take notes or passing the test will be difficult. The class is still doable.",0
"This was his last semester before retirement, so not much use reviewing him. His class was 100% quizzes and essay exams. The quizzes were tricky, but at least we could prepare well for the essay exams by doing a Google Docs study guide. He seemed shy, awkward, and monotonous at the start, but got confident and funny as time went on.",1
"Professor McDermott's class is perfect for someone who is motivated and truly wants to learn about the subject. Naturally, if you dislike history this may not be the class for you, however assignments are very clear and you will get a great grade so long as you pay attention to the things she purposefully emphasizes in her weekly study tips.",1
"Shamane is a great professor. My class only used the textbook twice, but it's not required. Some writing activities from the books are used for some assignments. She is a little intimidating at first but is a good instructor that will push you to become a better writer.",1
Professor Bermudez is super chill and laid back. My class was asynchronous for the semester and as long as you hand everything in by the end of the week she will give you a 100 for every assignment. Just do your work and you'll be fine. Super duper easy and the readings she gives you are actually interesting and fun.,1
"She is such a sweet lady and has a great sense of humor. After having a horrible Span101 prof, she really helped me understand the language and concepts much better. Quizzes can be hard, but exams are basically the same as the review. She is always willing to answer questions and make sure you understand the concept. Make sure to participate.",1
"I took this class for political science 1010 and i DO NOT recommend you take this class, ive heard his other classes are fine but not this one. He spends all of the class just talking about how he worked in the white house and was an assistant to al gore. He barely spends time expanding on the material from the book and its really hard to keep up",0
"Qaiser Imam is the complete opposite of a good professor. Throughout the entirety of the semester, I was struggling with staying up through his boring lectures. His teaching style was very bland and when I tried to access him outside of class, he wasn't much help to me. I had to use the textbook to learn the material and only then did I do good.",0
"Took this online. Recommend it to everyone. All blackboard assignments are based on opinion. She gives review sheets prior to test stating exactly what to study, and this is always true to her word. As long as you do every assignment on time (there are 9 very short ones this semester) and do review sheets, easy to do well.",1
"Charmaine has gotten much better! I actually gave her a review here last time, but I had another lab section with her which was great. She explains the material really well, better than the other instructors. Although she still is a very tough marker. Nice lady!",1
He is the one of the BEST math teacher I had in my life. He makes math so easy to understand and he teaches the fast way to get the answers. I took him over the summer so he was more lenient but I would definitely take him for any math that he teaches lol.,1
I love this professor so much. You can tell he cares about his students so much and will do everything he can to allow you to do well. Class isn't mandatory but you should go in order to do well. It's definitely a lot of material and you have to study a bunch but if you can do that you will be fine.,1
"I liked the structure of her class. She contextualizes the reading assignment from the night before, and then poses questions that generate class discussion about it. Lecture-heavy, but manageable, as she gives an outline of what each test will cover. She comes off as a little condescending at times, but just get your work done. Pretty standard.",1
"Not helpful. Extremely Hard marker with stupid multiple choice selections like ""C. None of the above D. None of them apply"". Makes you do your whole group project on D2L which is extremely inconvenient and inefficient. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",0
"He's a nice guy, but his teaching style is super weird. No textbook, which means lots of reading of links off of BlackBoard. Complete every single question on the Problem Sets or no credit - just write anything in; he just checks to see you did it! All exams are open-ended. This is a course you really need to teach yourself.",1
This professor was okay at teaching but was extremely difficult to understand from accent and quiet demeanor. Tests were often and large. Homework was steady and the same every week so you knew what was expected. I don't think id take his class again if I had the choice. I need something more clear.,0
"Interesting topics but not worth it honestly. She is very passionate but lectures the WHOLE time, readings everyday, and only 2-3 tests with a good amount of papers.",0
"fels does not know what she is teaching, our class average for midterm exam was 45% while other classes had 60%. for the final, she put a short answer while no other class had it, she also made us watch 2-3 hours of youtube videos and study all case studies and noother class had to. she also counts 5% of participation mark for tweeting",0
"He is entertaining. Went over a concept repeatedly in lectures so easy to remember but made it long.  He is a good spirited guy who will go out of his way to help you. Definitely taught me that being social is essential to business. I don't like group projects but if you want to get into business, it's best to get out of that comfort zone.",1
He makes CIS300 much more harder than it should for a base programming class. Expects you to know C# like the back of your hand and to remember every single detail that comes out of his lectures. The class starts to become increasingly more vague and you'll exponentially have to dedicate more time outside of class learning material.,0
"Don't take it, Just don't... He's not a nice guy nor a good professor",0
"(The honor section) His idea is very clear, his logic is extremely strict and his proof is always complete. The class is almost perfect except that..................I cannot understand........",1
"took over for our physic teacher half way through the semester because he was ill. Completely changed the lesson plan. skipped 5 chapters of learning because we left off at chapter 11 before spring break and came back on chapter 16... and then tested us over 11-15. Nice lady, but her homework and lesson plan could use some work",0
"This teacher is amazing, if you struggle with math especially in an online environment she is always more then willing to help and make sure you succeed. She really wants you to be able to get something out of her class so as long as you reach out she will help you.",1
"Exams were complete, utter disasters, he didn't introduce us to the topics (only gave difficult application questions), and his voice slowly puts you to sleep. He seems confused teaching calculus instead of physics. Not a good choice on the department's part to give the class to him and take it from Elizabeth Leonard. He could be good for physics.",0
"always unclear expectations. she talks down to students. the entire class struggles putting together assignments and essays, unsure of what she is wanting. low class test scores due to not covering the material clearly before test. very agrivating and stressful class. she's nice. but pretend nice. she does not care if you sink or swim.",0
"He is a really nice guy and speaks really clear. If you go to class and take notes, you should be fine. There are assigned books, but I never read them and still got an A. Don't buy the books, just lookup important quotes. Tests are just essays, which blows, but if you pay attention it's really easy.",1
He is really passionate about Biochem so that is nice. He wasn't the greatest professor but I managed to do fine. I would probably try to take someone else but he is still an okay professor if you absolutely have to take his class.,0
"He seems like a very nice guy, but that truly does not outweigh the insane amount of classwork he gives each week. He is also completely inaccessible outside the classroom, and will take off 1% point from your final grade if you email him something that could be discussed at office hours. PSU offers a variety of ECON courses, TAKE ANOTHER ONE.",0
"First off - Marty is a very humorous and sarcastic sun of a gun, but never would he harm a student's feelings or views. He is very engaging and his interest in the material presented before you is not just seen, but felt. He is very knowledgeable and has lots of information to offer - again, with interest and desire in his subject matter!",1
"Save your money and AVOID this professor at all costs! My final grade was a whole letter grade lower than what my points showed. I had an 87% and he gave me a C. His Grading criteria looks like this: Exam 1  25%, Exam 2  25%, Exam 3 25%, DB's(14 of them)  25%.",0
"This class was a lot harder than it had to be. Reading the book is super important! During her lectures, she didnt follow the book which made it super confusing. Her tests are insanely hard! Would not recommend if you arent a psychology major.",0
"Best of luck is the best words I have for this class. He intentionally give notes in class that are easy and PURPOSELY gives homework, bookwork and online, that is extremely difficult. Ontop of struggling every night, he grades on accuracy. On top of that, you have to have a 75% half way through the semester on your homework grade and before final.",0
"I had Mallinson at CUI for philosophy. He is always so enthusiastic about the topics However, he gets side tracked easily. I attended every class and didn't read any of the 5 assigned texts and still got a B in the class. Tests are easy if you MEMORIZE ANSWERS TO THE REVIEW GAME!!!! make flash cards of them if you want an A",1
"Also had him for higher plants and wetlands. Lower plants too. Excellent professor. Take his classes and getting out of the classroom is guaranteed. Might end up getting a little dirty or wet, but seeing and touching nature is much different from reading about it in a book. Tests can be difficult, so work on his practice questions. Enjoy!",1
"If you have the ability to take him, do it!! He made me love English when I hated it coming from high school. He has a grading contract where as long as you do the work required with effort, you will get an A. While this seems like an easy way out, it actually encourages people to take risks and deeply engage with the material in interesting ways.",1
"Probably one of the easiest classes I've taken, ever. As long as you're able to complete all of your assignments on MyMathLab, and partake in the discussion boards, ON TIME, you will pass this class. She has a strict-late work policy.  Also, if you're passing the class with an 85% or higher, you're exempt from taking the final exam ",1
"Dr. Jasmin is the BEST chemistry teacher I have ever had. If you want a good orgo teacher, take him. Yes orgo is hard. No it isn't going to be easy. Jasmin makes it more enjoyable and bearable. He curves the tests if the class average is below a 50% and he curves the final grades. Also, he is hilarious and knows EVERYONE's names. I'm not kidding.",1
One of the worst professors that I've had. He is all over the place. He rambles on about stuff that isn't going to be covered on the test and rushes through the stuff that is. He slides are repetitive and confusing. He skips through most of them anyways.,0
"Eisner made a comment regarding Greek pedophilia that made me never return, therefore I received a D-.",0
"Suann was a good professor, she tends to go into detail on topics because she is very passionate about the material. Lectures are powerpoints mixed with group interaction that tend to be fairly engaging. Definitely a fair, and overall solid professor. Getting an A is not easy but not impossible if you pay attention and study.",1
"When I was a student a seton Hall I used to think the same as the others. But, after graduating five years ago I realized that the program did a horrible job preparing me for a job using Russian. I blame the textbook for this. Its from the 1950s and is not even close to being an accurate representation of the Russian language spoken by natives",0
"He isn't great at explaining things, he's a tough grader, yet does't give any structure to the assignment. I really hated his class, along with almost everyone who took him. His lectures are short, but they seem super long because of how boring they are. Would not recommend.",0
The only thing I really didnt like about professor light was there was very few things that our grade was based on.,1
"Dr. Young's classes aren't easy A's. But if you work hard, show up, and participate, you'll walk away from that class learning more than any other college course. Dr. Young is one of the best professors the CoB has to offer.",1
"Melissa is a great prof! The class was not too hard. Basically do the reading, listen in class, do your work, study for like 15 to 20 mins for test and you should pass. She is really funny (and really sassy!) she is fun to listen to with class discussions. Highly recommended class and prof!",1
Brent was the best professor I've yet had. He is very clear and interesting. He's good at keeping the class on their feet and explains everything. He is very laid back and very understanding.,1
This class is very difficult. 30 seconds to answer a question on lab exams so its basically you know it or you don't. She's really hard on the students and makes the excuse that if we want to go to the medical field you need to be able to do well under pressure. I would say this class messes with you mental health.,0
"*online class* This class shouldn't be taken online. Her notes were hard to understand, any feedback from her is non-existent. Self-taught class.",0
"He's a great professsor, love the class just be prepared to work you butt off for a good grade.",1
Not helpful,0
Melissa is round about amazing. She understand us students got stuff to do outside of class and gives us time to do projects. Sold 10/10.,1
Seek him out when you get to Coventry..he will help you in almost anything.....The best. Without his help I would not have my degree its that simple,1
"Dr. Wang is one of the best in the IE department at UH. Very caring, very fair and really just wants to you learn and be successful, wish I could take more classes with her!",1
Self-important schemdrick. Why screw up your GPA listening to this self-absorbed movie critic.,0
"Biomedical Image Processing is not an easy subject. However, Dr. Okada makes it easy to understand. He is always reachable to answer your question even during this pandemic! Very lenient grader and a lot of extra credit so don't feel bad if you didn't do well on the midterm!",1
I've had Hammill for 2 classes so far. He is definately the best Prof. I have had in the 2 years I've been at BCC.,1
I had Dr. ferguson for a blended course. His lectures are rather boring and he words the tests to make the very hard. All of my tests were open book and I averaged between an A and B on them. There is daily quizzes and weekly writings. no extra credit,1
"Dr. Schauer is a wonderful professor. She is super nice and really understanding of her students. Upper level French lit classes can be intimidating because it is a lot to read and then discuss, but she doesn't put a lot of her pressure on her students to speak perfectly and is able to put more nervous students at east. Would definitely recommend!",1
Dr. Cochrane is a great professor.  Attending class is necessary as lecture notes are not posted online.  The discussions in class are very interesting and helpful to grasping the concepts she teaches.  If you pay attention and take notes you'll do just fine.  Projects build on each other giving them a clear focus.  Would take this class again.,1
"Absolutely awful. Didn't get the feeling I could approach her at all, and any questions I would ask, she would end up beating around the bush and not answer them. She treated us like children, talking to us condescendingly and just all around gave us disrespect when some of us have done nothing wrong. Got an A somehow.",0
"Dr. Clasen has not impressed me. His ""lectures"" are just him reading slides. He was responsive at the beginning of the class, but then he just disappeared. Lots of assignments; it's a summer class so it's 3-5 ch/wk and no feedback on any homework and rarely on tests either. YouTube is a better teacher!!! He does give extra credit, which is nice.",0
His assignments & lectures (monologues) provided little groundwork for success in the class & his teaching (telling) was far from thorough. Pretty much nobody had a clear idea of what aspects of his teaching to digest & remained hopeful that a miracle would occur on an exam. It was hard to prepare for class/exams... I would consider other options.,0
"As terrible at math as I am, Professor Conner was wonderful! She is so helpful and willing to help any student out. She does give a lot of homework, but it really helps you to master the material. I would definitely take her again!",1
"This is the worst professor I've ever had. He rambles nonstop, directions are never clear, and his vocabulary is too high for an undergraduate student to follow. Although philosophy is not meant to be easy, he is not helpful in the least in decipher it.",0
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
"He is so cokcy and full of himself. He makes you buy the books he has wrote and read them. THEY ARE SOOOO BORING and crap that no one really cares about. If I were you I would change professors, unless you want to hear about how much money he makes and listen to him belittle other professors.",0
alright,0
"I was concerned when she said she doesn't do study guides but this is college, not  high school.   I had to study and attend class to learn the topics but I was glad afterwards.  I used the chapter summary technique she required  in her class to study for Microbiology and I passed Microbiology also. Taking her class has helped me get ready for UCF.",1
"he really knows the information and can facilitate philosophical discussion well. papers make up most if not all of the grades, so definitely work hard on them. he is super accessible outside of work and cares about your well-being in general and in the class.",1
"This class can be easy, if the professor was a bit more in depth with the material. The syllabus is very vague so it's hard to know exactly what to cover, and taking any of the exams are a mess. But if you are on top of things it can be done.",0
"Sandoval is a nice guy, and does seem to care about his students. The problem is that nothing is clear in his class. He doesn't give out specific essay prompts, and a lot of the time you end up writing a 4 page essay that's based on a 4 page excerpt you read. class lecture time is pretty useless, he tells stories for most of it, and repeats things",0
The most unlikeable person I have ever met. No one in the class could stand him. His wife is nice but he has no good qualities. Maybe the college could give him some kind of job where he never has to be around people. Avoid his classes.,0
"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",0
"This guy lost my papers, and gave me an incomplete for the semester due to his mistake.... also very bias in his opnions - caused a lot of stress for no reason and didn't learn much from him",0
Would not recommend this teacher to non english majors. He knows a lot and wants us to know a lot but most of the time it has nothing to do with the assigned text. He's funny and extremely experienced. Lets you rewrite essays for a better grade. His lectures can be tortuously long if you're not interested in English or history.,0
"Dr. Choi is such a nice, funny guy! He really makes lectures enjoyable. He explains the dense readings very well. I have honestly enjoyed his class, despite the large amount of course material you will need to know for his tests. He does like to play the ""Devil's advocate,"" though, and get into some pretty tense class discussions. Prepare yourself.",1
"1. His slide decks are awful - paragraphs c&p'd, reads directly from, few in-class examples, no excel use, no computer lab classroom 2. Projects were good, but all self-learning, easy grader 3. Final is egregious nonsense. Took full 3h for 30q, and I wasn't alone. Most material not covered, you need to self study book. Take CFA instead.",0
"I took him for 1301, 1302, and HIST 2313 (World History) and he has easily been my favorite professor as Sam. Really, this class is what you make of it. He assigns weekly readings, which are under five pages, but they're simple and there's a lot you can take out of them. If you or your class refuses to participate, you're gonna have a bad time.",1
"Registered for calc expecting to end up with a B. The exceptional Dr. Vutha is the reason I have an A, a newfound interest in math, and much-developed skills. He breaks down the most complicated concepts, keeps you engaged, & gives you countless opportunities to improve. Abundant review sessions. Will tailor his help to your needs if you reach out.",1
"Toms a character, but knowledgeable about what he teaches.",1
"One of the less work-load LIBS teachers, although assignments were confusing and participation was a HUGE part of your grade. Word from the experienced, participate as much as you can in discussions.",0
"Brian's lectures are very interesting, and I find myself talking about the topics with my family/friends outside of class. If you read the textbook and review the study guide, you'll do good on the tests. Practically the only other thing that's graded are weekly short writing assignments.",1
Read! study the connect homework he gives you as an additional source. This class is easy if you are constantly ahead. Get behind and you will fail. Overall the lecture felt unnecessary. I would have rather taken an online class because It was basically the same thing. Lectures not helpful :(,0
"I took her English 116 class in the Spring 2019 semester. I really enjoyed her class with the topics that she would discuss to us. As a whole, she would check everyone's topic on their essays and give any feedback if we had questions. She is very sweet and is open to help you out. Take her!",1
"A Wonderful teacher! I could not have asked for a more patient and enthusiastic professor. I recommend that anyone interested in a foreign language, take her course!",1
Very scary... She hardly understand your questions and her tests are very hard--8 choices for mc questions. Try to avoid her...,0
"extremely smart but sucks at teaching, assessing, and grading. He should be out there fixing our economy but instead is stuck teaching. Do not take him if you can, it was pretty rough. Unless you are in love with econ and have lots of time to teach yourself!",0
I learned a lot from her class. Good instructor.,1
"He is terrible, I do not suggest you take him. Was very unclear, had to do a lot of reading, lectures were all over the place and unhelpful and he was very sassy. Critical of students and did not make me feel welcome. Would not take again.",0
"If you are not already fluent in Spanish, you will not learn with this instructor. This class is very difficult, do not let ""beginning Spanish 2"" fool you. I am fluent in Spanish and got an A, but my classmates who weren't struggled very much. he ""teaches"" too fast and doesn't allow enough time for a subject to sink in before moving to the next.",0
"Either you like him or you dont. Knows his subject!  He goes on tangents, but worth listening to his cultural criticism.",1
"Absolutely awful. Can't understand his accent, doesn't understand you to help you. IMPOSSIBLE tests. Terrible with scheduling. Very hard grader.  Find a different professor... you can't be a good professor if you cannot communicate with your students.",0
Extremely disorganized and we only got one paper back so its impossible to know what your grade is like. She asks lots of confusing questions about the reading that no one had an answer to. Also announced on the day of the final that she lost our final and made us right an essay that no one was prepared for.,0
"Professor Wallace is my favorite teacher ever, took him for both 1301 and 1302. He is  straightforward and beyond helpful. The pop quizzes are short and super easy. And as far as the tests go, just review your lecture notes a few days before and you're guaranteed an A. Prof Wallace made learning about history a breeze, I highly recommend him.",1
"It says it in her name! She RUSHES! She goes over material very fast and doesn't take the time to make sure everyone is following along. She lectures as if she is just solving a problem on her own and mumbles. After she completes example, she asks if everyone is okay but students are still trying to write all her work down. Very confusing and awful",0
"The worst prof I have ever had at Mal. He treats students as imbeciles; Duane is both rude and arrogant. He is very opinionated and I felt his lectures to be exceedingly bias.  He added labs and lectures not outlined on the schedule and made them mandatory, so beware, your class schedule will be much more than anticipated!",0
"Not good. Doesnt explain material very well, gets confused by the information himself. Doesnt do enough examples and usually stands there and points at the power point. Only uses mymathlab ppts. to teach. Tests are the majority of the grade, there's only 3. MyMathLab assignments barely count toward your grade, so if youre a bad test taker, beware.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had. Stay away from her at all costs,0
The class is just to hard and many students complained about him. Grading is not fair and he requires too much. I received a zero for not taking a non required post test :(.,0
HE IS A TRUE GEM.  Cares for his students way too much! He's hilarious too!  So easy! TAKE HIM! You won't regret,1
"Don't buy the books, rent them just get copies of the Leopold articles it will save you some $$. Attendance is not mandatory but you will miss some important notes. The group activitis, the bus tour and the game are fun. I learned a lot. Exams are hard. Lots of reading and must be organized for this class.",1
"Has an accent but it is not hard to understand. Homework is assigned every week & you have 1 week to do it. His test are similar to the review handouts he places on his website, but do not ONLY use those to study, refer back to the HW too. HW is all on the interweb. After the first exam, things get a lot harder. Try to take a different professor.",0
"way way way to much work. from one honors student to another, save yourself! besides being a tough grader and giving huge assignments, she is fairly nice and approachable ",1
"The man thinks online shopping is a huge terrifying scam. Does not do anything online (powerpoints, study guides, etc.) Makes you memorize facts like what kind of car his dad had to take ""attendance"" on exams. Exams are designed for students to fail. He knows what he's talking about, but the class structure and his ego are both horrible.",0
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I have Ms. Triggs for clinical. She is an awesome professor! She's sweet, nice, and funny, but also fairly direct and will definitely tell you when and where you need to improve. She's clear with deadlines and expectations and quick on email replies. I hope to get her for a future class.",1
"The lectures are packed with information yet she talks too fast for any notes to be taken. Also if you ask an honest question in a lab, be prepared for a rude and condescending response. It is not impossible to do well in the class but you'll be given a terrible experience the entire time.",0
"if you have the chance to take Prof Boelkins, DO IT! I have never had a professor care so much about the success of his students. He is a great teacher, well organized, and very motivating. There is a heavy workload in his class, but if you stay consistent and utilize his help, it's very doable. Definitely recommend!",1
"One of the best professors i have had in my 3 years. He actually takes the time to make sure we understand the material & readings. Even though i had no interest in the subject, he taught it in a way that allowed me to actually pay attention in class. Assignments are easy - mainly busy work, exams are fairly easy -MC/blanks/short answers.",1
"One of my least favorite professors. Became very condescending to students, lacked professionalism, and allowed her physical health, and pride, to affect her teaching. All tests are application based over minute details, no opportunities to practice this application prior to tests. Take another professor if possible, or at a different college.",0
"We're taking an online program called ReadingPlus and its the WORST. I get it done, but I dont learn anything from it. Has nothing to do with reading really. It FORCES us to speed read. we should be able to read at our own pace. And forces us to advance when we're not ready. The whole program feels like a video game. Horrible program.",0
"Mr. Faulkner is one of the best teachers I've ever have.  He assigns just the right amount of work, organizes his lessons into an easy to follow way, and has a good personality.  If you are looking for a class to take as an elective, this is the one!!",1
Hawkins will be late for almost all the classes. Will bully students by calling them out infant of the class. Half of the class got a F- on midterm. Started the class with 25ish students probably 12 by the end of the semester. Avoid her class unless you like regurgitating her thoughts and being swimming in homework and readings.,0
"I never looked forward to attending this class. He made it clear how much he believes Conservative Christians are completely nuts and holding back society with homophobic beliefs. Very offensive and rambled the whole class projecting his beliefs onto his students with no sources to back up his own ""facts"".",0
"It felt awkward and hard to ask questions because her responses make you not want to ask again, and just figure it out, on your own. To be fair, she knows her stuff but the lack of communication made it weird. I took it online. Work is basic college stuff. Read and manage your time. Hard but not impossible to pass. Wouldnt take her again, though.",0
"Ms. Facknitz happened to be my freshman adviser and Creative Writing teacher. I really love her! She is a great teacher, very interested in poetry and helpful in providing feedback on your work. She can be helpful with advising during meetings, but does not respond to emails as often as I would like. Inspired me to join Gardy Loo!",1
"Scribbles vague notes on board, and cannot read handwriting whatsoever. Tests are way too hard- covers too many chapters in one exam, and are not permitted to use any notes, and entails excessive essay questions. Each individual test is worth 20% of your final grade. 70% of the final grade is based solely on these test scores.",0
"Mrs. Lusk-Stern honestly made Psychology not all that exciting to me. It wasn't that she was a bad teacher and she is very nice and understanding, but her lectures feel useless and like they go on forever. Most of the lectures she gave only barely touched on the actual test, however she gives you very useful reviews so definitely USE them.",0
It shows that this was her first semester teaching a course by herself.,0
GREAT PROFESSOR,1
"DO NOT TAKE SENSATION AND PERCEPTION. YOU WILL REGRET!!! hes a cool dude, but theres only three tests and thats the only grades you receive. The tests are almost impossible to pass, so if you're willing to focus all your attentionwork on this ELECTIVE, take this class.",0
"I have had her for both classesTE 103 and TE 104.  She went well above and byond with the students in these classes, staying after helping students with problems that we had problems with.  she appears eager to teach and enjoys her job.",1
"Boring, boring, boring. Changed my major because of the amount of interest I lost in the class and field. His notes are not helpful, just a bunch of pictures on slides, making studying for exams incredibly difficult. I got a decent grade in the class but hated every minute of lecture. ",0
"Please take this with a grain of salt. I had the pleasure of having professor Adrian Garcia as my film 3 professor. All though hes nice and very easy going, I wouldnt take any of classes again. Hes unorganized, seems to make things up along the way. Doesnt speak thoroughly (ex: he informed my class that we had to present a film idea to...)",0
"Professor Stewart is a great professor to take for accounting. I enjoyed his class and wish I could take him again. He doesn't take attendance, but you need to attend because he lectures heavy over the content. Also, the TEXTBOOK is MANDATORY!",1
"I took this class already having  experience with the subject matter, but Remlinger definitely has very high expectations and I can see why people talk about how difficult she is. However, I really cannot see all the accusations of not caring about students or being willing to help. She was always very warm and more than open to provide assistance.",1
He really knows policing of US and some other countries. I enjoyed his lecture a lot. Not really a tough grader but you need to show a certain effort when writing papers and discussing the topic online.,1
"DON'T TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!  If you want a sense of dignity and want to feel respected as a person, don't take Rogers.",0
"super easy, but if you are struggling or are gonna miss class just let her know and she will help out however she can",1
"Randal was an okay professor. Easy subject, however, all he would do is read from the power point slides or show art history videos. If attendance was not required, I would have only shown up for the quizzes and tests.",0
"Horrible. Random lectures a& the info is never on the exam. He words the exams so badly its hard to understand the meaning. Bad textbook. Struggled for a C, barley got major credit. Will avoid his class at all cost in the future. All Psych majors avoid unless you can memorize the whole text, manyyyyy theorists & definitions.",0
"He isn't a good teacher but he certainty has a heart of gold as he is willing to help all the time. In class is bad, he goes through slides so fast I stopped taking notes after a while. And if he's not teaching, he's rambling on about something unrelated. Also, he doesn't give back things you turn in. I wouldn't recommend him as a teacher",1
"Do not recommend taking during a pandemic. He gives strictly pure quizzes and times you one minute per question. When students emailed him about the struggles faced during tests, he does not give much resources to help out his students. Already the end of the semester and has not graded any written assignments since the beginning of the semester.",0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
"Jorgen is one of my favorite professors! You do have to go to class he doesn't upload the slides and so you won't get your notes, and you're going to need notes for the exam. The exams are hard but you MUST do the readings and take good notes & you'll be fine. I was really scared for this class I heard mixed reviews, Jorgens is an awesome prof tho.",1
"K first off his accent is amaaazing and is what makes him so hot.  But, I liked this class.  His tests were a little on the harder side, mainly because there is so much material but they aren't too bad.  The only thing that's sucky is the webpage you have to create.  It's tedious. Labs aren't bad, you get out early.  I'd take him again though.",1
"My favorite professor. I learned a lot, and I never felt stressed in this class. His lectures are interesting, and I honestly wanted to come to class. There were 3 mandatory paper, and an extra credit 4th paper. Use peer-reviewed sources on papers. Absolutely no reading or homework required. I love Dr. Solari, highly recommend!",1
"I took this 200-level class for as a Gen Ed credit, and it was one of the most difficult courses of my academic career. Attendance isn't mandatory, but it's not like a perfect attendance will guarantee you an A. His tests are nearly impossible and many students didn't know what they were getting in to. Hard to take notes considering he rambles.",0
"Sucks worst prof at St. Lawrence to date.  Talks about his kids all the time, dosen't know how to teach.  Concieted and petty.  Never take a course with him, save yourself, and your grades.",0
"I really hate physics, but I really like Tolich. He is a great professor and does his best to make EM easier. The content is really rough, but you're way better off with him than most other professors.",1
"I've had professor Jacobo 3 times for 3 different reading classes, I got an A on all 3 classes. She breaks in down well enough for you to understand, and if you still don't understand she'll help you. You can tell she enjoys what she does by how she cares for her students. Sometimes she even gives extra credit to help bring your grade up.",1
"He is an amazing professor.  Very clear, and very forward.  I took his class on child psychopathology, and I really enjoyed it.  I want to just sit down and have an hour long conversation with him.... <3",1
"No exams. Weekly 500-word essays, 2000-word final paper, 20 minute weekly discussion videos. Easy class",1
"Trefzger gets a bad rep from kids the class who blow off his advice. Finance isn't easy, but if you do the practice problems and pay attention in class, you can get an A. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK.",1
Makes you earn your grades.,1
It warms my heart to know that SUNY awards mediocrity with tenure.  Since when does  standing in front of a class and reading verbatim from a book you wrote qualify as teaching?,0
"If there is a better Professor that Senor Morcillo I have not encountered them. The professor is as understanding as the come, and very patient. He generally wants you to learn the language and does his best to help. He responds quickly by email and will assist in any way he can. Would take again and again if that was possible!!",1
Dr. Lorton is an amazing professor. I took him for Calc III and he explained the math in ways that were easy to understand. He goes through every step thoroughly so if you are paying attention then you will be able to understand everything pretty easily. Do your homework and study for the tests and you'll be fine.,1
"By far the best prof I've had, a nice and caring person. He understands what hes teaching. Easy grader and his tests are reasonable. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do good. He goes out of his way to offer help. He puts more time into his course than any other prof I've seen. Hes doing excellent for a prof just starting out!",1
"Must have a laptop for notes. You'll get a study guide, MUST learn concepts. Not a class to memorize things. It took a long time to try and figure her out and what she expected, and I worked really, really hard. However, I got good grades, so I think my problem was more not understanding her as a professor. But she's nice and will work with you.",1
"Professor Swedenburg mostly just rambles on about what he wants to talk about, and only vaguely ties it back to the course itself. Unapologetically and annoyingly liberal, which would be fine in a political discussion, but not really what I look for in ANTH courses.",0
"If you have any aptitude for mathematics or physics, this class will not be difficult. Lectures go at a snail's pace. I did not show up the last month of lecture and still received an A in the course. When he lectures, he confuses more than he helps. Great sense of humor; nice guy  overall. Take Estrada if you already know Physics, not to learn!",0
Dee is a great teacher but has a smart mouth and is extremely rude towards some students... She makes a huge difference in students and has her picks. Her rude CAN BE VERY OFFENDING!!!,0
"She was terrible! She was inconsistent, and was never focused. She would tell some nonsense story for half of the class. Also, she assigned meaningless homework assignments that were subject to change the day it was due. I disliked this class immensely.",0
New professor,0
Dr. Keeling is an awesome professor and very knowledgeable. He is very passionate about equality and getting to know his students. He is very understanding and wants his students to succeed. He will move deadlines if we are overwhelmed with work and is always there to talk if you are confused or have a problem. You do have to work for a good grade.,1
"She doesnt initially teach the material very well, but if you ask questions she does a good job of explaining things in a different way. I can understand why people dont like her. If you value understanding the material and put in a little effort, youll do just fine in this class.",0
"he can seem like he is kinda of jerk at first, but really a fair guy when it comes down to it. i missed 3 or 4 assignments just because i was lazy and he let me turn them in on the last day(even though he doesnt allow late work) and it raised my grade an entire letter. also extremely intellegent in his field.",1
Dr. Griffin is really helpful and kind! She draws from lots of different sources to teach the material effectively and incorporates strategies we can use in our own classes someday.,1
"Dr. Conner is funny, interesting, and most of all, very kind. He is clear about class expectations, and if you do the reading and study then you will do well in his class. Even if you don't do most of the reading (like me) and write your papers the night before (like me), you can land in the B-range.",1
its bad. you can barely understand him. very boring. easy class write what he does and look at him with adoring eyes. very attractive yet don't take the class to get your kicks,0
Avoid Ellen at all costs. If you want to do what is best for you or your 110 grade... do not take her.,0
"Personally I didn't like the format of his quizzes but I still learned a lot from his lectures. His presentations were cool and the videos that were shown are neat. He's too nice about people skipping quizzes... he lets you take them at a later date, which isn't fair to everyone. Overall, he's a good history professor.",1
This course was disappointing because I never understood what Dr. Shannon was saying. He reminded me of Mumbles in the Dick Tracy cartoon. I found him to be rather disorganized and unclear to the objectives of the course. I would have preferred a more hands-on approach rather than the theoretical approach that he poorly presented.,0
"Hey John Carroll, don't make a sociology professor teach a psychology class unless you want all the students to fail. Horrible teacher. Would not recommend. Tests are hard and so are the worksheets. Attendance not mandatory. Grade based on 4 tests. ",0
"Pros, Easy class with little academic rigor, Say the right things with bare minimum deliverables will result in an A unless you openly disagree with her. Cons, Little academic rigor, Slow to respond to email, Can be extremely rude to paying students.",0
"To sum it up, Vannozzi was the absolute worst professor or teacher that I have ever had. He expects you to pass everything in on time, or you will lose 50% of the grade, but it takes him more than a month to pass back homework. He is impossible to make meetings with, he is unclear in his lectures and just does not know how to teach. DO NOT TAKE",0
This professor is amazing!! She was so sweet and helpful. She was always available and more than happy to help. You can truly tell she's dedicated to teaching and is focused on the students and their best interests. I would definitely recommend taking her!,1
"You could really pass the class if you only showed up for exam days... Everything is online. Nice guy, easy to talk to, sometimes his voice is annoying, but would be worse. Wants everyone to do well, and is willing to work with you.",1
Mr. Hanna was awesome! I had some family stuff going on during his class. He helped me with my essays and even let me take my mid term exam at a later time. He even say there with me and went through how to write an essay since it had been a long time since I had written one. I would take all his classes if I could.,1
"Lots of homework, lots of work for the labs, and pretty much no clear rubrics or guides for anything. There are very few resources that actually help, but with all this said, I was working 40 hours a week and managed to get a B so if you're doing nothing over the summer you could get an A.",0
This teacher was the most unclear professor that I have ever had. She was never avaliable if you needed help. YOu could never get a hold of her. She told me I was getting one grade then ended up with another. I know a few people she did that to. My thoughts are they could find someone better to teach an education course.,0
Very good instructor.,1
Very difficult class.  Didn't help that he burned through the material.  Nice guy though.  Knew what he was doing.,0
I loved the fact that we could talk about real world issues in class and not have to fear what others think. It was nice to be able to speak your mind in a classroom. Make sure you can back up what you preach he will call you out on it! Liked the class and loved sean.,1
"Dr. Wilson has a poor knowledge of the information in the course. She often asks the class questions that she does not know the answer to herself. I do not recommend her as a professor. I would rather skip her classes and read the book myself. She swears by her lecture notes but they are useless, and do not correlate to info on the tests.",0
"Best professor for AP I. Fun teaching and gives extra credit at the beginning of class so be on time. She is willing to help if you ask for it. Good new, she is not teaching AP II.",1
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
"Dr. Johansen is the epitome of a caring, and charismatic professor. She makes a Monday evening class something to look forward to. She truly demonstrates what true passion for teaching is. I am grateful and honored to have been in her class.",1
Worst professor at appalachian state. Cannot understand his lectures because he just rambles on about nonsense. He does not answer questions you ask but instead makes fun of you for not understanding and then continues to speak nonsense. If you have the option to never take this professor do not do it!,0
"loved history of rock n roll. glen is an absolute G. going to class and paying attention means that you can skip reading the text book. listen to the assigned music as he goes over it so you won't have to cram. really, this isn't that hard of a class, as long as you do what he says to study.",1
This class is not that hard and Dr. Kazemi is not that bad of a teacher. The thing that makes this class difficult to get an A is the test. Careless errors in a test can cause you to fail even if you get the answer correct. Make sure to come to every lecture and pay attention because all of the test materials come from the homework and notes.,1
"This class is incredibly reading-intensive. If you have other difficult classes or are even slightly involved on campus, this is not the class for you. If you read, the weekly quizzes will be super easy. Your grade is reduced after 2 or 3 absences so be careful! This is not an easy class.",0
She goes right off her powerpoints which teaches you NOTHING: you can obviously read. she gives you chapters to read each night but does TEACH you anything. she gives reviews for exams but then SURPRISE: only a few things she went over is actually on the exam. Papers are easy. Exams are hard. POP QUIZZES!!!,0
"Worst professor ever. Attendance is ""mandatory,"" but she doesn't actually take 10% of your grade off after 2 skips. Final grade was based off of one assignment a tutoring portfolio that she was very picky on. She gave us what should be in it the day it was due. Gives the same lecture over and over. Very unorganized.",0
"worst prof. I've ever had, the online 6 week class is a joke and I don't recommend taking it, she does not know how to teach and likes to throw in tough trick questions.",0
Terri was one of the best profs I've had at Westfield. She really cares about the students and is very available to talk outside of class. Her grading is very fair if you do the work and Terri is very understanding if something comes up. Would recommend and would take again!,1
"This professor does not care about the success of his students. If you take this professor, you will be stressed to an unhealthy level the whole semester. He requires a research paper worth 40% of your grade that is insanely hard, and he refused to answer questions on the paper the final three weeks before it was due. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.",0
"Simply the best purveyor of information I've ever been privileged to experience. Professor Hay brought the subject of the Holocaust alive in a way that indelibly imprinted our minds & hearts concerning a subject that needs to be part of any informed 21st century student. Clear and succinct in his delivery; inspirational, gems of info each lecture.",1
"He loves films, it shows quite a bit. Gives out a lot of handouts, and most are useless (like reviews or something). I had four major papers, he seems to grade easier if you talk to him about your paper beforehand. The exams are not the best, but not horrible. The films he chose were very interesting ones.",1
"McBee is the chair of the HIST department at Tech, so he knows his stuff. His lectures are rather boring, but his tests are fine. Super easy compared to others. Also, some days he will just show movies. You will have four novels to read, and each comes with a quiz. Super easy books though. I definitely would take his class again! #EASY-A",1
Worst experience of my college career. He does not seem to have much interest in teaching.,0
"This is the worst professor at Kettering University. He is the most anal grader, and marks down points even if your answer is correct. If there is a short answer you must answer exactly as he wants or you get no credit. He even gives multiple choice questions where there is no correct answer. Avoid at all costs. He thinks he is great, but he is not",0
"Most interesting class I've taken at UDel, also the most impossible. His tests are confusing in that he uses terminology only he understands. You will be fascinated and think you're learning a lot in class only to be dumboundead on the exams even if you write down everything and study. Write a good research paper; only chance to boost your grade.",1
"this professor has too much homework or project which is really tough, and it's really lots + big size. you have to spend huge time on this class. and last thing is that he is tough for grading + his mind doesn't have any sympathy for anyone if you even explain to him, such a horrible professor. be careful !!!!!!!!",0
Buddy doesn't explain anything. He literally sends YouTube videos as lectures and he gets mad when you ask him something. His expectations aren't clear for work.,0
"Professor Canedo structured this in a way that most students will either barely pass or fail. Quizzes are 8 questions, each worth 5 points, and they are based off of a reading of 50+ pages. No study guide. He won't work with you or consider your feedback. If you can avoid taking this class with him, please do so for your peace of mind and good gpa.",0
"If you struggle with subnetting,take this guy! He is fun, but beware, he won't let you leave his class, if you don't get it. You will definitely get it! Best Cisco teacher ever!",1
Avoid!!!!!,0
"The class corrects him everyday on his arithmetic. He makes the lesson wayyy harder than it needs to be, but the webwork is quite easy. I wouldn't recommend him because of his grouchiness and his dislike of elementary ed. majors. He loves to write on the board with dead markers.",1
"got a good grade, but bad teacher. kind of an air head. kinda nice. I worked pretty hard for my A, but you could prolly get a decent grade w/out much effort, but lectures can be annoying.",0
"Nice lady, not a very good professor. For Asian Art she blows by things so fast and goes off on tangents so when you leave the class you're thinking, ""what just happened"". Do not take her writing intensive classes.",0
"Looks like some people got a ""D"" in his course.",1
Really easy class overall if you just go to lecture and do the labs. She has a study guide for each exam that covers content in the book but you don't need to read the book to do well it's mostly common sense. I got A's on all the exams and never fully did the readings. She also curves every exam. Pretty boring class but it's an easy A,1
Waldman is incomprehensible and his class is the worst. Most of the TA's are excessively anal about grades and their are no exact set of rules to follow or adhere to when writing papers. This class was completely useless and did not increase my interest for architecture. It's a necessary evil to complete the Architecture major.,0
"The textbook is easily found online in PDF form! It isn't too important, but helps grasp concepts better and it's a good read. Professor Bullock explains the concepts very well too. His class is very rarely boring. There are 2 essays and 2 tests, none of which are very hard. I definitely recommend any class with this professor!!",1
"This course was taught by an awful TA. Unfair grading and little help. If you have the chance, just take Physics at a community college. It's insane that UMB charges students so much money, just to be ""taught"" by graduate students who are grumpy because they miss lunch during 11am lab and do not care about the students.",0
"She was unclear on everything that she would assign. It was confusing, the lectures were long, she accuses you of cheating with no facts to back it up, and she will not reply to your e-mail's. I would not recommend this ""teacher"" to anyone. She is rude and inconsiderate to her students. The worst experience in a semester.",0
I really enjoyed this. It wasn't too hard but I also learned a lot. I loved learning about each popular religion.,1
"Madame Kugler is an extremely nice professor who really cares about her students' success in the course. As long as you pay attention and study for the quizzes and exams, you should be good. One of the best teachers I've had at UD.",1
"I failed his class, It was super hard and his exams was hard also. will not take again ",0
She is a sweet lady to your face but when she returns assignments it is as if she is Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde. She is not clear about what she wants and then takes off alot of points when its not up to her standards. Take her if you want to work your butt off and still get a bad grade.She is one of the toughest graders in the nursing program. BEWARE!,0
Professor B shoves the cheating policy on every email so harshly that I wouldn't be surprised if some students ratted themselves out even though they were 100% honest on their work. Do the homework and use the software and you will do fine. Quizzes become way easier with the software. Other reviews say he was rude but I never experienced that.,0
"Excellent instructor. Able to help all students understand material. Truly a blessing to not only the students, but staff as well here at Cameron.",1
"Profesora Fox is a wonderful and passionate spanish professor. However, she taught the entire class in english and made us do busy work that didn't improve my spanish. I am taking SPA 322 right now and I feel that I am at a disadvantage because she did not prepare me well at all. She's very unorganized and kind of crazy even though she means well.",0
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"Best professor ever!! I had her for history 101 and she is super easy and clearly outlines what is on the exams for you which are not difficult at all. She gives 4, 3 page essay prompts throughout the year, but you only have to write 2 and she is not a hard grader. Overall, I totally recommend taking her!!",1
doesn't miss a step and explains difficult material slowly,1
"very helpful, but kind of ""creepy"". real nice guy and really knows what he's talking about.  would highly recommend for chem lab",1
"I love Ms. Brock. If you're looking for a teacher who's organize, straight forward, and understanding, take this class.",1
"The material need more boundaries, and less subjectivity, but his eccentricity overpowered any faults there might have been with his teaching style. He's insane... but it's a good thing.",1
"I took Professor Mc Lawsons online PHIL 1304 class and it was super easy and straight forward. 1 quiz, 1 discussion board, and 1 reading assignment every week and then your final exam at the end.",1
He makes tests hard. you have to memorize chapters to pass.,0
Its a difficult class no matter who you take it with. But Don is fantastic and really engaging,1
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
"Beba is the best! the only thing was this was a visual imagination class and when she got busy doing the show she would end class early and would want everyone to go help with costumes for the rest of class, i didnt mind but some did. you need to be there, and she has trouble explaning what she wants someties but you will get it! loved her class!",1
"Great Professor, very fair and helpful.",1
"Assignments are obnoxiously long.  Exams are just piles of confusing true false and short answers that she never mentioned.  Easily the hardest class in my college career, without having friends to work with, you will not make it.  I hope she actually stops to inhale sometime between classes, because she certainly doesn't while shes lecturing.",0
"OMG DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HUBBARD! She is so unclear, she gives tons of notes that are completely irrelevant.  She generalizes everything, everything is the same as everything else. Its confusing and difficult to study for.  Study guides don't have the information you need to know on them!",0
"Honestly, this class was terrible. I did not understand anything and he went too fast to give me a chance to keep up. I do not recommend.",0
"Great professor!! I took her class in spring 2019. She really knowledgable works hard to get students involved in learning process. She always offer assistance to struggling students to work on how to improve grades in her class. Very punctual in keeping her notes, grades, announcements etc. definitely recommended!!",1
"Makes you work hard, also hard on grading!",0
"Loved Prof Fritsche. Very clear structure for the entire course. HW is from WileyPLUS and he gives you practice exams for each exam. Avg for exams are like 70%, but he makes it the material as clear and simple as possible. Not easy A, but you can definitely earn the A. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but doesn't relate much w students.",1
she is amazing.  great vocabulary that she doesn't dumb down.  treats people kindly & fairly.  great class- extremely interesting material,1
"The class was OK.  He was super easy and always seemed to be thinking of other things, super preoccupied. Overall I recommend his class if you want a super easy A.",0
"Professor of the decade goes to Professor Davis. She respects students, tries to help them, and wants them to succeed. Amid a switch from in class to online due to Covid19, we were lucky to have her as a guiding light. She helped us make that transition with ease. While this class can be challenging at times, she is always there to help. The Best!",1
Great teacher. neet camalot textbook not the other one. show up to class. study guides are basically the test. Do the group project- put effort into it,1
Fail me although he knows my difficult situation,0
"He's on of those very dedicated professors.  He has both a clear and excellent teaching style and care for his students. Kinda like a young version of Dr. Widger, but better at explaining stuffs.  Great class. You will learn much about neuroscience. Exams are easy because it comes from lecture notes. Very fair exams, and he's open to corrections.",1
Tests are a joke. Most of them are self graded. Make sure you keep up on the little assignments and youll be fine.,1
I definitely should have picked a different professor for this course. He did not make the subjects very clear and so many of my classmates failed the class. I would recommend choosing a different professor if you plan on passing!,0
"Professor Dietrich is a good professor, always willing to help you. Se is a tough grader. The exams for this class were mostly online on Wiley Plus. She is not that generous in giving partial credit but if one pays attention in the class, do the homework the course content is not that challenging.",1
Took Prof. Casada's 8 week online class over the summer and passed with an A. The expectations are clearly laid out. Be prepared to read the textbook and the class is fast paced. He's a great teacher,1
"he doesnt respect his student's effort at all, and students are struggling. He loves see his class average is around D. Honestly, he had a hard time to become who he is today, so he would make everyone's life hard. He is the ONLY one professor I didn't respect at all in my school.",0
"le pire prof que j'ai jamais connu, a eviter a tout prix",0
"bad professor, not helpful at all. Just tells you to read the chapters and expects you to do a 60 question test in 30 minutes...dont take this guy trust me.",0
Gives out a lot of work. Super heavy lectures. Monotoned. Class feels super long. Doesn't take time to know students. Very dull teacher. No motivation.,0
Really great professor! He tries his best to make lectures fun and interesting. His grading system is very fair and as long as you do all the work its a real easy A. He does his best to help you learn and to help you with anything you don't understand. Very relaxed guy.,1
Yuhas is a nice guy but he lectures way too fast for anyone to keep up. Read the book and do some practice questions to help practice the material. Doesn't write on board much and when he does you cant read any of it. All of his papers are poorly written needs to seriously have all of it re-written and proofed. I passed but would never take again.,0
"The final could have been a bit more relevant to what was discussed in class. Overall, she was an average teacher, who I believe is passionate about passing along the education of law, but may need to refine her teaching methods, as she is new to teaching.  She says what needs to be said to new students, but needs to refine the message.",1
"Caring, knows her stuff, but def doesn't wanna be teaching 101. Higher up maybe she wont be so monotone.",1
I picked this teacher from the reviews on here saying it was easy and that its mostly power points. I hated it she goes through the slides quickly without giving you time to write them down using the excuse for you to check them online its wasted time in class. Expect the same boring power points every single day. She also makes the test confusing.,0
This class was my favorite class for the entire semester. Talbert is hilarious and a great storyteller. He will engage you to the point that you will wish class wouldn't end so you could hear the next part. There are a lot of papers though (5) and he does not hand out (cumulative) 8test questions/specify study areas beforehand (only sample tests).,1
HORRIBLE AND NASTY WOMAN...SHE WOULD GIVE YOU SUCH A HARD TIME TO SIGN YOU INTO A CLASS...AND TELLS YOU RIGHT IN YOUR FACE THAT YOU WILL FAIL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GREAT NURSING STUDENT...AVIOD HER AT AL COSTS,0
"Luther is the most insightful and greatest professor I've had throughout my college experience. He is very intelligent and knows a wide range of topics from philosophy to political science. I really enjoy his classes, they're my favorite. I hope to have more classes with Dr. Luther in the future.",1
"Such a hard grader! He gets down to the nitty-gritty of his rubrics, you have to do everything specifically how he says or you won't receive full credit. Discussion boards have to be 3 replies DURING the week, God forbid you post 3 replies/day. Only good thing I can say about him is the material is good, other than that, wouldn't recommend at all!",0
"Very nice, low-talker, but very knowledgeable and enjoyable.",1
"She is boring. Students talk while she is lecturing and she can't control her class. She is a great person, just not teacher material. She is not punctual. We don't get started until like 40 minutes into the class period. I really like her as a person and she is a great social worker!",0
"So this professor wasnt necessarily helpful, he did not provide good feedback at all and can be very unfair. The only thing I liked about his class was lecture. Everything else was a disaster. Prepare to be disappointed.",0
"Terrible professor! He's so unorganized, does not follow his schedule according to the syllabus, and all he does is blabs about nothing the entire class. His material is very dull and he's just BORING! Don't waste your time.",0
"Gilmore was such a great professor! His class was my 1st upperdiv Sociol course and I got an A! He is a very fair grader and makes connections that students are able to understand in lectures. He does't have any slides but he tells you what is important for the test. Attendance isn't mandatory, but is strongly suggested! Take Gilmore if you can:)",1
"Dr. Feagin grades incredibly hard for no reason. Like it's history class? Relax. She doesn't give a rubic for her ""activities"" or assignments, but takes pts off for my bibliography not being in abc order???? If I would have known, I would have put my sources in abc order. Nevertheless, do not take her class if you're looking for a easy hist class",0
Fantastic teacher. He really knows his material and is open to discussions after class. His quizes can be quite difficult and alot of reading is to be expected in this class. He lets you use the book and internet for the quizes though. By far my favorite professor thus far.I would certainly recommend his class if political theory is your thing.,1
"Dont take this class if you want to understand statistics. Do take it if you dont care and just want an easy A. Lectures the entire time but never explains what any of the distributions or equations mean, and instead just gives you homework answers and tells you exactly what format exam questions are in which you can put on a cheat sheet.",0
I hated this class I wish I dropped it.,0
Horrible professor-- was not helpful at all. I didn't receive any grades until the end of the semester.,0
The absolute worst professor ever. Professor graded my work very poorly. There was quite a great amount of work in regards to classwork and homework. I completed both and still somehowmanaged a poor grade. Dont take this guy. Im retaking Comp I.,0
"Yeah, she's a really easy grader and you learn a lot. You've got to be a dingbat to get anything below an A in her class. No tests, just... ""formative assessments"". You learn a lot and the subject itself is not very challenging at all. Expect a lot of group work.",1
"Dr. Harvey was the *first* person that made stats click with me, and thats after STAT185 and RMI. His instruction leaves for zero grey area/confusion, as he if very thorough and makes sure 100% of his classroom is understanding everything. This means that if you have a question, don't be afraid to pipe up! He's wonderful professor, TAKE HIS CLASS!!",1
"Great instructor, really know his stuff. He explains everything detailed. A really great lecturer. Only flaw, miss class, miss a lot. If you attend class you should be fine. He covers a lot of material in one class. Great instructor, one of my favories, wish I could take his class again.",1
"It's basically one of those classes where as long as you do your work, you should be fine. It's not all that difficult of a class.",1
"She is a super tough grader on her 2 virtual child papers. Go to her &the TA before hand for ANY Q's bc clarifying what u have written is important. Her exams r very fair, & I personally never read the book &only used it to quote for the papers. Dont forget to do the discussion board posts and go to all the ec she offers. She grades out of 430 pts",1
"He is a good prof, yes his class is lecture heavy, but the long term paper and weekly reading assignments are pretty normal for any history class. The history final is graded very fairly. It is worth 40% of your grade and is graded as such. Not a paper you should leave for the last night. Weekly quizzes are all on quizlet so they are easy to do.",1
"This guy doesn't understand we are taking the class as a requirement and pretends we actually want to learn the most intricate and specific content in the subject, and grades as such, don't take, he will waste your time for content u will forget right after the exam and never use. STAY AWAY",0
Extremely lazy.  Worst teacher I have ever had.,0
The best prof I have had yet! If you can take her class do it! She goes out of her way to help you on EVERYTHING! I met with her the first week of my first semester in college and she talked to me and reassured me like I was family. She'll read drafts and give feed back for every paper you write. If you're sick and miss she'll check up on you!,1
"Ms. Burd is a very good profesor! She is always willing to help and her tests are simple if you study her study guides.  Lecture is sometimes boring because she reads directly from power point.  Overall, great professor!",1
"I miss this professor!! he's the fairest professor ever, no ugly attitude, ALL UNDERSTANDING. group talks, he likes your feedback to improve & i respect that. GIVE him a RAISE!! his examples are well explained too so keep your mind opened. he is very cool and his final was optional: if you liked your grade, you didn't need to stress taking it ;D",1
Amazing teacher and class! It's a lot of work and requires focus but the assignments are interesting and allows for you to be creative. He walks you through every step and then turns on music and allows you to be creative. He is helpful and is enthusiastic about helping you. Fun class,1
"As I am writing this review in class, the kid next to me is watching Lacrosse highlights and a kid two seats up is watching House. His lectures make no sense, and no matter how hard you try to get involved eventually you give up. I like History but hate his class, and all of the homework is online and he doesn't take attendance. ",0
"Had her for Spring semester. She's easy but not very clear, she's also very confusing says one thing then says another the next day. She loves doing free writes. That's all you do and hand them in for a letter grade. I disliked her way of teaching.",0
I recommend him to anyone.,1
"Best professor I've had so far.  Hillarious, energetic, and passionate.  I switched my major after a year, and he is one of the reasons why I am coming back.",1
"Had her summer 2010 UE program, pretty weird but awesome prof.",1
Very Good he knows his stuff. Can teach you alot if your not lazy and willing to,1
You think it is an easy class until he piles all of the stuff at the end.  An alright teacher.,0
She is very knowledgeable but her class is hard if you don't pay attention. Dr. Yamazaki seems like a kind professor. She goes by very fast when lecturing and her tests are very hard even if you study. Take this professor if you are willing to put in the work and like Biology. If you're just trying to fulfill the requirement try another professor.,1
"sUCH AN Interesting and smart and caring professor and his stories are very interesting and fun to learn and reflect about take his classes and you will learn a heavy abundance of information that you want to learn Also, he is accessible outside of class and it is very fun talking with him about anything please take his class",1
"Even if political theory is not your interest, take Stoner if you need a social science class under your belt. This guy can can make any topic interesting. I Loved the books he assigned us. Easy A too. 80% of multiple choice questions on final are selected from the 2 previous exams.",1
I know everyone loves Mrs. Alemany and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about her too! She is so energetic and funny. Keeps you on your toes and interested. Love her style! Great shoes! The best Spanish teacher I've ever had.,1
This professor was all over the place with his lectures. It was very hard to follow him and understand what he was trying to say. He was not very good at explaining what he wantesd from us and worksheets were always so repetitive. Although he gave chances to earn extra points. Attendace taken every class and will affect grade if you do not come.,0
What do you do after a political career? Teach at a college! This class will have you staring at the clock. The minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days. There are opportunities to meet members of the political community and the guest speakers are intriguing. Other than that it's an easy A without much learning. #whygottocollegeagain?,0
"You have three books and lectures to read each week, averaging at about 140 pages per. Then you have a 30 question quiz, often with paragraph long questions. Then you have pages long ""discussion"" board topics to write weekly and bi-weekly journals. All the while you need be working on your 40-50 pages term paper. This class is busy work.",0
"He is the worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of meeting in my college career, he does not care about his students. He thinks anyone and everyone is trying to become a scientist.... don't take him if you can!!!!!!!!!!!! he is really hard",0
"This dude is the ""stuff"". Hilarious, inspiring. Hate mornings, took this guy for a 8am class. I have never been so happy with a choice before. Immediately in ""awake mode"" when you enter. Relates the ideas of the study to current events. gives small notes. A lot of ""hands off"" teaching. Biggest thing is studying for the midterm, and not slacking off",1
"I'll be honest Vega is a very nice guy, and he tries to be helpful. However, he is very unorganized. His teaching style is all over the place. His test focuses on the the textbooks, but he does not teach what is in the book. He gives WAY to much HW!!! His test are hard than they need to be, and I would not suggest anyone take his class.",0
I love RIT,0
"This guy is a total jacka$$, he does not care to help students instead he set up ways to fail you. He is so rude.",0
"Easily one of the best profs I've had. There are a lot of readings that you have to do that you will be tested on, which are not that difficult. There is one big essay that you have to work on throughout the entire semester but he teaches you how to write properly and is very approachable and gives amazing feedback. 100% recommend taking his course",1
"Dr. Kalinowski encourages her class to perform well academically, but she's concerned with more than just grades. She cares about each of her students' ability to grasp, retain, and apply so that we can easily transition into a nursing career and be successful. Goes above and beyond for the students who reach out and makes a strong impact!",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. He has ridiculously hard assignments, which I would spend hours on and the math center tutors couldn't figure out. His accent is hard to understand Doesn't like questions; scoffs and mocks you if you dare not understand. He races through the lecture, then assigns group work and doesn't teach anymore. DO NOT TAKE",0
"Matière à l'examen beaucoup plus difficile que les exercices, en plus d'être beaucoup trop long.",0
"He does not reply to emails AT ALL, I literally turned in every single assignment  and he gave me the most horrible grades. We were coming to the end of the semester and he still did not put in any grades and I ended up failing. I was supposed to graduate.",0
"Absolutely fantastic at explaning things.  His lectures are incredibly well organized and easy to follow.  Assignments are tough, but well explained.",1
"Dr. Oks was a really nice guy. If you went to his office hours he was very easy to talk to and was very willing to help. However, in class, he never explained anything very well and would only flash typed examples of physics problems on an overhead and then removed it promptly. Only survived by using old tests. Never learned a thing.",0
"Dr. Schumann is a real gem, I had him for two courses. He gives specific questions to answer for the writings so you know what he wants you address. He breaks up the class by showing documentaries so it is not just hours of him lecturing, and has guest lecturers. No tests or book for 4050. He answers emails quickly; only downer is group projects.",1
"She is very tough. She demands a lot of work outside of work. She taught my class for 121, 211, 212. She shares a lot about Japanese culture in 121 but she stopped in 211 & 212. I became bored by the end.",1
"Great professor, need textbook to pass class",1
"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",0
Really fun and enjoyable class. I enjoyed how we walked through the instructions as a class so that no one would get lost.,1
Quizzes are manageable if you are willing to memorize large volume of terms. Scores on tests do not correlate with how well you do on quizzes. 6 essay prompts handed out a week before your essay exam. You get 2 of them random and must spit back every single term that relates or you lose a point. Unrealistic expectations on these essay exams.,0
"She has odd rules, like you can't ask questions after class about the lecture, instead come in for office hours. Her voice always sounded condescending to me, like she was teaching elementary school instead of college. At the same time, her explanations are partially mumbled and said as if she assumes we already learned the material. Would avoid.",0
"I spent so many HOURS a week on this class and am doing fine in lab but legit am scared that I'm going to fail and have to repeat the course. Tests are crazy hard, lab is hard and hw's are the only thing that can bring your grade up so DO THEM",0
Attend or you fail. Participate or you fail. Ever heard of the saying the customer is always right? Cool in this case the teacher is God and youd do best to follow his commandments or else...,0
"On the first papers ever, he gave us a pass. He said that the grades we got didn't count, and most people got Fs, Ds, and Cs. There were two Bs in the entire class. Just context for how tough he is. However, he's extremely engaging, hilarious, and insightful. He also gives good comments, but you have to have tough skin.",1
"DONT take this professor if you want to learn. I lasted one day in the class and had physical anxiety symptoms because of how awful & creepy he was. He droned on about himself, his very personal medical problems and his life story. Things NOT related to the class subject. Younger people might think this is inspiring, but no thanks. Take it online.",0
"Paul is not an easy professor, but there are not really any 'easy' professors in the art program. You have to work for your grade. If you do the work and get to know him (make an effort) it's extremely rewarding. If you don't get something or need to know your grade, just ask him. He's an understanding man who really is there to help you do well.",1
"BEST PROFESSOR OF MY LIFE! IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, JUST PAY ATTENTION, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS MATERIAL!",1
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
Excellent professor!,1
I agree.,0
HA!! Try research methods. she is strict and demanding (but still fun),1
"One of my first professors... when I decided to go back to school at the age of 39. If it wasn't for professors, like gator, I would have dropped out. I am so thankful for Gator and his love for his students!",1
"Huey is perhaps the greatest professor that I have ever had the privilege of learning from. His lectures are informational, thought-provoking, and often entertaining. Work load is very forgiving and exams are open-note. You can tell that Professor Huey really cares about his job and his students.",1
Professor Burg is one of the kindest profs I've had at GVSU. She is very caring and goes out of her way to make sure you understand the material. She even has exam study sessions outside of class that help A LOT. You have extra credit opportunities and the exams are not difficult if you study the guide. She also makes the material very interesting.,1
Ms. Peggy is awesome teacher if you apply yourself you will get an A.,1
"If you are not an accounting or math/formula person this class will be difficult without a lot of hard work. Otherwise,  it is a good class and not super difficult.",1
"Yonn is not only a lovely guy, but also a scholar and an intellectual. The subject matter is always interesting, and his entertaining lectures and fun personality make it all the better. You'll likely have a couple research-oriented papers and a couple quizzes/exams, and that's it. So be sure to do the work and study for tests, and you'll do well.",1
"HORRIBLE!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He hates life. Never happy. It's his way or no way. You opinion doesn't matter. Have no idea how he still teaches there. He will give you a zero for wrong format, wrong folder, if he doesn't like your opinion. Should not teach. He hates everything. He's the devil of English. He enjoys being miserable. No sympathy!",0
"Professor Elliot obviously knows his stuff. However, he does not translate it to lectures in a way that is very effective, or conducive to his students learning. Notes are exclusively hand-written by him, and are not published online. Attending class isn't required, but I'd recommend it if you want to pass. Definitely have to work for a good grade.",0
I have never hated a class or professor more than this guy. This website doesn't allow me to express how i really feel about him. All the negative reviews are correct. Do yourself a favor and take another class.,0
"No trouble for a while, but is horrible on respect for students. Lectures and textbook use were ok and could understand the material, but not to his liking. Not willing to help students better understand wrongdoings and was not respectful to student confusion. Great professor for content, but not by any means for respect and working with you",0
"Marafino is possibly the worst math professor at JMU. He can only teach by just spitting out information and his practice test are too easy compared to the actual test. Your final grade is based off of 2 tests and a final so if you do poorly on one there's no hope. Will not answer emails and is proud when half of the class fails, overall just rude.",0
"Nice guy. Took as an hybrid class & the work load frightened me when I read the syllabus, but it was actually really easy. For a 300 level online class it had a usual amount of writing assignments but I think most were just graded as a credit. Super easy to get an A. In class days are long and boring but there were only 3. Case study was kinda fun",1
"Prof. White was super sweet and gave great feedback; but she treats you like a child, gives no time to work in lab, and assigns pointless ready that takes up unnecessary time.",0
"Craig is cool and has done a lot in his own career, but thats all his lectures are about- correlating everything back to him. He doesn't respond to emails, cancels class from time to time, and never grades anything. He isn't the most helpful to students in class or those he is the advisor for",0
"Mrs. Wilson was the worst English experience I have ever had. She has recently had her first year at USC Upstate in Spartanburg. She is the toughest grader and gave feedback that was unreasonable. I took a 101 class, and there is no reason for the tough grading. Wilson clogs most of the class with her personal life allowing little time for work.",0
"Great teacher, great readings (you can find them online), only 4 easy essays that she has you submit drafts for and perfect. She takes attendance seriously so show up (also its a fun class).",1
He sucks a a professor and when you ask him a question pertaining to the subject he does answer it. He will tell you to go to office hours. My overall opinion in this is that if I could give him a zero I would.,0
"This is the worst professor I have ever had. His lectures are horrible! He does not present with powerpoint, photos, or makes notes of any important information. He does not give you any assignments, only quizzes (2-3) and exams (2-3) ! therefore, you have to get a perfect score in every exam & quiz to pass the class.",0
"I took this class as an intro to the rest of my anatomy classes because I had been out of school for a while. Dr. Matt is very funny and he clearly cares about the classes he teaches. However, he can be very unorganized and might seem a little scatterbrained. Be prepared to read a lot and to teach yourself about half the material.",1
"Kristi always tells us to communicate with her if there are any questions/issues, but she never replies. She isn't clear with what she wants and is a very, very slow grader. Wants us to have long responses to other people's posts but there's not much to talk about. Lectures are just videos after videos. Why am I paying money just to watch videos?",0
"Bijan made Psych 160 nearly impossible. You aren't allowed to take notes without getting yelled at, so you're forced to stare at him lecture for over an hour. However, the lectures do not help on tests as the tests are 100% from the textbook. There are only 3 grades, making it very difficult if you bomb one. Stay away from him, not worth it.",0
"This professor told me I was going for hell for being LGBTQ and repeatedly talked about women who have had abortions going to hell, she was cruel in the way she spoke about people she disagreed with. I took her during COVID and she was not flexible or helpful at all.",0
Do not take this teacher unless u want time to do literally nothing else. This class is required otherwise no one would be here. She give tons of homework and talks OVER the three hour class schedule. Its brutal. Its history not law. She gives homework like this is our major. Its crazy and avoid her at all costs,0
Her lectures consists of stories of her life and when she was in school. Goes extremely fast and is hard to follow. The notes are very long and tests are on 2-3 chapters at a time. Quizzes are harder than the test and there's one for every chapter. Labs every week and they're online and sometimes can be very hard.,0
"She is honestly one of the best professors I have had at GV. She is so kind and funny, and you can talk to her about anything. She provides amazing feedback on drafts and will do whatever she can to make sure you get the grade you want and worked for. I would definitely take her again if I had the chance!",1
"motivate? he constintly puts people down, refering to their personal lives, and when asked for help often catches an attitude. He makes you work double hard to earn extra days off, but the days have to be benificial to him. He plays favorites badly so kiss butt!",0
"hello everyone don't take her class it's big mistake laguardia is doing big mistake to keeping her here and letting her teach psychology classes , she have attitude problem .",0
"Ryan has great intentions, but is very unorganized and seems like he's still getting used to teaching at Carlson. He is very knowledgeable on class topics, but almost to a fault, as he goes on tangents and side comments that take away from the true topic at hand. Ryan has great potential and should try being more intentional and organized.",0
"Jacobson was great, she was entertaining and kept relaying her materials back to everyday life. I enjoyed the class and will look for classes from her again!",1
"Great, hilarious instructor who makes the material easy to learn! He keeps class interesting. Im pretty sure he has watch every movie ever so be prepared for tons of movie references lol! Hes overall great and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone.",1
"The lectures are usually boring, but it's good to pay attention. She usually hints at what the essay question for each of the 3 tests will be, so going to every class is important. She gives out study guides, do them, that is the only way to pass the tests. Define every term you use on your tests or she will dock you points. Be specific.",1
"The class can appear to be daunting at first, but Dr. Eager is very willing to help outside of class.  Topics build quickly.  Tests can be tough, but quiz grades and project grade are an easy 200 pt safety net.  He teaches what you need to know.  Homework and plenty of time outside of class are necessary.  He is a fair grader. I recommend highly.",1
"David Turnbull is a fantastic teacher! BY FAR my favorite at Lake Land, he is very helpful and teaches well. He also is very good about making sure all his content is online, so if you miss a class on campus, it is all online!",1
I know journalism writing is different from the usual essay writing I was use to.  I expected in a journ. 1 class to learn the basic mechanics and techniques to newspaper writing but she failed to do that.  She started the class off as if everyone already had experience in the field!  I ended up dropping it.,0
"Amazing professor. Her homework and class work is harder than the actual tests. She gave 4 tests and a chance for extra credit. The homework usually took me like an hour or so but definitely do it. I learned a lot from her. She doesn't ask trick questions, tests are straightforward. The final was the easiest test out of all the tests.",1
Dr. Capozzi is definatly entertaining!  The class is hard but my advice is attend every class and museum visit and do the extra credit.  If you have any questions or concerns talk to him.  I had considered dropping the course due to low test scores and he adviced me to hang in there.  I ended up with a C.  He is very kind and understanding.,1
Great instructor. Nice guy and I really liked the class,1
Very different class style then all the others in CIS.  I really liked the open discussions trying to get us to see different view points and issues with current IT decisions.  Very good class.  Prof Leidig knows a lot about the IT field.,1
"I liked Dr. K a lot. I am on the edge of an A and a B. He is a hard professor, but his tests are fair and a lot easier than his lectures. If you asks questions he tries to help you to understand. He also does a review at the beginning of every class. Take notes on these because it's a good review for the test! I would take him again.",1
"One of the best professors I had at ASU!  Responds to student participation If you don't care about your grade, don't expect a good one. Common sense. The workload is very light-read, blog, show up to class, discuss, open book exams. He's a down-to-earth guy, very helpful, and treats you the same way you treat him.  Highly recommended!",1
"do not try to help you. he says smart remarks. he will not give study sheets, do not take him please.",0
I took her online class and I would definitely suggest it. You just read from the online textbook from McGraw Hill Education and take reading checks (participation not accuracy) and exams at the end of the unit. I recommend printing out the study guide notes that she provides for the chapter and filling it in as you read so you have the notes.,1
"Mr. Spence was not a very good online professor. He never assigned any due dates unless a student emailed him. Even then you never knew what work you were supposed to complete because the due dates would take you to a blank page. Also, he would assign the quiz in the late afternoon, and he would have it due by that night. Overall unprofessional.",0
Great teacher very helpful with answering your questions and giving you suggestions. Always availble if you need help. Overall Great teacher and cute.,1
"You can tell that Dr. Poindexter is really passionate about mass media. However, this is basically a history class and he lectures on and on until you fall asleep. No need to take notes, it's an easy A and he makes progressive notes for you in Bb. DON'T SKIP CLASS! He has notecards and if you miss class it's 11 points off each card you miss.",0
"If the answers aren't exactly word for word as his, its wrong. This makes getting a good grade difficult as he grades homework very harshly. While in class you have to attempt to take notes, teaching style is all over the place and writing is illegible. Take this class if you want to see your GPA nosedive. Save yourself the valuable time and money.",0
This course needs to be revamped prof anikovsky needs to learn to teach stuff more throughly and test stuff that he actually taught us. literally buddy goes and tests on stuff he skipped in 10 min and is amazed that we did so bad. I am so happy to be done with this course.,0
"I have visited him during his office hours, but I always get the feeling ""you're wasting my time with your questions"". Lectures are convoluted. He uses slides to teach concepts that are difficult to follow. Heavy accent. Many days came away frustrated and confused. Often better off reading than attending class (although I attended all his classes).",0
"This class was one of the best online courses I have ever had. Others have said it is an easy A but I do not think that is a correct description. If the A was easy, it was only because you completed all of her assignments and participated in the discussion board. I loved the way the discussion board is an open forum for everyone. GREAT class.",1
"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",0
Clear on what he expects from you. Very funny guy!,1
Dr. Grapenthin is THE BEST! Even though I haven't had her in college (yet) I have been studing piano with her for wuite some time. She hasn't only helped me with music but she has helped me get throught a lot of other issues I came across. I HIGHLY recomend her she helped me with A LOT and I am sure she will help you to! Shes so nice!!!,1
"DO NOT take this professor, you will regret it. I only have 350 characters to describe how bad he is and that is not enough at all. I can go on for hours, he's unfair, grades your work as if he gave you a detailed grading rubric (which he does not), if you ask him a question he can't even answer it completely and he is VERY rude. I learned nothing.",0
Prof. Henderleiter is a very enthusiastic teacher and she shows you that she cares about you and your grades. She definitely makes you work for your grades and her tests are fairly difficult. I am a mostly A student so ending this class with a B- was quite a let down. I could have probably tried harder though.,1
He's a bad Prof that doesn't know how to teach material. He also showed some kids email in class to everyone saying that he was sick and wanted to email his assignments. Rick then complained about the email for ten minutes. Basically a volleyball coach that for what ever reason for what ever reason was able to land a job as a Prof.,0
She gives a ton of work. It's a very interesting class. She is very understanding as long as your vocal about your needs and concerns. She's also just a cool teacher to have. I would recommend. ,1
"Long study guides, multiple-choice portions of exams are easy if you study but the essays are graded harder. Talks fast during lectures, but provides note-taking guides for extra credit. Kinda rude to some students. Attendance and participation are worth points. Weekly quizzes and discussion boards. My e-book doesn't work so I haven't used it.",0
This teacher assigns way too much work.  Lots of projects that take way too much time.,0
Mr. Hays was by far the best teacher I have ever had! Love him!,1
"I LOVE taking courses with Dr. Handy! I have no idea what i'm doing when it comes to accounting and she offered extra help, she puts the notes online for you that she does herself on the computer and you can go to her office whenever you need and shes more than happy to help!",1
"He is one of the best professor I have ever seen in my life if you want to get a good knowledge about history and of course, if you want to pass I will definitely recommend gis class he is the best !!!!!!",1
Rambles during lectures and goes on constant tangents. Presents material in an unorganized fashion. It is nearly impossible to keep track of what he is talking about in class. Excepts far too much of students on exams. Impossible to truly study or prepare for tests and will not clearly define due dates and what we will be tested on.,0
Those who say he just wants to challenge you need to realize theyre paying thousands to willfully get their lives ruined by this sad excuse for a teacher while learning nothing in the process. You might as well print out his projects in your free time if you want to feel challenged because youll get the same amount of teaching and guidance,0
Tim was a great professor. His work was clear and easy to understand and he helped make it a stress free environment.,1
"Jamie is one of the worst professors I have ever had. She is hopelessly repetitive, completely uninformative, and vague with expectations. She is also incredibly rude and condescending. Her grading is based on whether or not she ""feels"" you are trying hard, not your actual work. The is no actual dog handling in the course.",0
Do not take her she teaches at an advance level  and goes way too fast in lecture . If you struggle in math I suggest you find another teacher.,0
"Whatsoever, DO NOT take him as your prof. Biggest procrastinator i have ever seen in my life. Took 8 weeks to grade 2 assignments. No feedback on time and doesn't reply to emails for up to 4-5 days, sometimes never.",0
"Nothing was good enough unless it came out other own mouth. Very tough grader. Asked her to release her comments on our final presentation (that she said she would release) so we could use them to write the final paper, and she told me to get the critiques from my group member who took notes. Nobody took notes on the entire 20 minute critiques",0
"He made me hate chemistry, the guy is so knowledgeable that he think on a different level than us and therefore can't explain anything. Test are difficult and have questions that aren't from the book. Doesn't explain things clearly nor does he care about students. He is literally the worst teacher I've ever had in my life.",0
This man is just too cool.  One of the best and most knowledgable man that I could learn from.,1
"He is the sweetest, most helpful professor a student could ask for.  Although at times he seems flustered, he never loses his positive attitude.  He genuinely cares about his students learning his content.",1
he was a great teacher. film and short fiction is a really great class and he really loves what he's doing. he's very passionate about it and will def be up to helping you when you need it. and he lets you hand in your 1pg paper late which is nice :-) i would def recommend him!!! take his class!!!!,1
Super easy online class. No tests! Has quizzes for every 3 weeks or so and a few homework assignments. Pretty much there are 5 units and each unit has about 3 quizzes and a homework assignment which you have about 3 weeks to finish. Super easy! Didn't put in much time or effort,1
She was very sweet and knew what she was talking about. Her critiques were always good and really helped when writing papers. She wasn't available for office hours and through email. I thoroughly enjoyed her class and recommend her to everyone.,1
this professor is ridiculously hard! class it self is pretty easy you don't consider spending too much to study but you should! lecture notes are so important. his grades are not fair. he grades by name.so u better go ask him question and attend the classes.he doesn't take attendance but from his mind he knows who is attending or not.good luck!,0
I had her for WRT 120 & I didn't like her at first but now I do. She's actually super nice & caring. But she is very strong on pushing students to ask questions for help or clarifcation which is an important skill. Her online class is easy to navigate and she has a good sense of humor too. She also understands a lot if u reach out to her.,1
"if you like English it might be the good class for you, but trust me this teacher is Hard.  ",0
worst prof at ucsb I've ever had. also most monotone. tricky tests. full questions on his tests emphasize concepts that he tells you aren't important during lecture. take mcdb 110 or chem 142 if you can,0
She does not care about students and thinks she is more important than she really is.,0
"Bret is great! He's very funny and expressive. He doesn't hold back. He's also very strict- there's no wiggle room. That said, he's usually very clear about what he wants and if you do it, you'll be fine.",1
"We are expected to read chapters weekly from a confusing textbook, which is fine, but in class, his lectures make no sense and have little to no relevance about important topics from the chapter. Class tried to discuss other issues (including the lecture problem) such as not a clear syllabus and he brushed off saying that's not on him.",0
"I took BIO101 and it was quite possibly one of the worst classes I have ever taken. It is extremely exam heavy and does not offer open note. No lectures, book is completely online, and it is a weighted course. Where the exams are 45% of your grade. Absolutely ridiculous. I would have dropped the class if it was not required to graduate.",0
I had him for bio 120. The tests were hard and his powerpoints are straight from the book. He skips over multiple slides and hes hard to follow along with. I got a B- and wanted a better grade for a 4 credit class so Im taking it this year and I have an A. Avoid him for bio,0
"Terrible professor. Assigns homework that isnt mandatory but helps your grade, then spends all of the class time going over said homework. He doesnt teach. Tests are super hard unless you know the material by heart (and great at it) BUT its probably the easiest class to cheat on tests. If you can find a way to cheat, take this class. If not, dont.",0
He is a nice guy but the lectures are extremely boring and don't pertain to the material covered. He will get sidetracked and talk about something irrelevant for a half hour. The tests would have been really hard however he puts up previous tests on blackboard that end up being the exact questions on the exams. You just have to memorize the answers,0
I didn't  really have a problem her as a teacher. She is a tough grader when it comes to labs and exams though. She does offer extra credit. She takes time outside of class to help you if you are struggling. I believe that her lectures are super long and most the time very monotone and dry. The hw is online. She is very smart and can help you out.,1
This class is extremely difficult. I was never able to meet the standards she presented because she expects so much detail. There are always so many assignments due and many of them take you at least 2 hours. She gives a lot of feedback but rarely gives positive feedback and makes teaching feel more like a grade than something actually enjoyable.,0
"truly terrible. would ask for help and more feedback and would give little to none. if you have the opportunity, DO NOT take his class.",0
"He is a genius. Hi class can be boring for some because, his strategy and counter strategy is based on numbers and is a mix of economics and finance. The best prof I had so far in MBA!! hands down !!",1
"Really nice guy! Very smart and intelligent, knows his subject, and always informed about attest news. Lectures were boing sometimes, but because of topics, not him. Assigned 5 books to read, I read 1.5, still passed, after reading reviews and some summaries. Tests are pretty easy if you show up in class, take notes, and review the material",1
"AVOID THIS TEACHER FOR MATH FOR EDUCATORS! Answers her own questions incorrectly, your test will have material you never learned, you will have to teach yourself, midterm is 20% of your overall grade and your final is another 20% - and they only have 20 questions. Grades projects toughly. Several people I know have failed this class twice.",0
quality teaching approach and makes the student think analytically,1
"Avoid if possible; boring, and has an attitude problem.",0
"The content of this class is fine but his grading system is simply awful. It's far too easy to pass but far too difficult to get an A. With surprise test questions, sporadically dispersed (yet heavily weighted)  iclicker questions, and no extra credit I was the only one to actually achieve the score for an A (95) in nearly 250 students. Ridiculous.",0
"He has many in class assignments that go towards your attendance and final grade. In addition to in class assignments, you have quizzes once a week, which are fairly easy if you skim the textbook. Exams are easy in the beginning but become more lecture heavy with the last 2. In general, his lectures aren't helpful.",1
Burke is great!  He is always willing to help you if you need it.  If you do the work you will go good. ,1
"He gives terms to look up, these terms are never on the quizzes.  For mid-term study guide he gave a list of 75 terms, not one of them was on the test.  It is hard to know what to study for this class because there is so much information and the ""study guides"" that he gives are misleading since none of the information is actually on the exams.",1
"Ala is amazing! Physics is a hard subject but if you put in the work youll definitely pass! She was always more than willing to help me. Utilize her office hrs! Shes also extremely caring and makes her lectures fun! Take her, you wont regret it!",1
"Mr Farris is a really smart guy, but he makes the class is extremely difficult. He expects you to know the material the first time he teaches it and there is A LOT of stuff to learn and memorize. He doesn't explain things very well and you will not pass if you don't study super hard and pay attention in class. Had to drop his class",1
"There is not much teaching in this course in fact he is quite inconsiderate,  won't provide preparation material and doesn't help you in anyway. Likes to be authoritative but ends up looking silly. I pay too much money to hqve my time and effort wasted by such.  Bye",0
I wish I went with Falzone on this one. He's not approachable or helpful at all. He doesn't care about his students.,0
"Amazing class and prof. She really provided the most useful info. And challenged me to think....she made me want to learn...funny, passionate and so insightful....all this and so humble and caring. I would take her for very class. I consider her a mentor",1
Not a good teacher at all,0
"This instructor was great for the class. He really showed that he cared about us getting to the right project. After I found the project, he showed me very good pointers. A little harsh on the grading but I also missed some stuff. Clear explanations and instructions. I would take another class with him.",1
"She is the most disorganized professor I have taken in my undergrad education. This means that assignments don't make sense, but she still gives them out like anything. With that, she still is the toughest grader who won't give you any margin for error even though the assignments themselves have so many errors in them. Worst professor...",0
"I believe I took her on her first year of teaching so she was very new and you could tell she didn't know what she was doing. Her exams were okay, just study off the power point slide notes. Her final is a combination of all her past exams. Basically I give her a 7/10.",1
You have to do well on your exams in order to pass. He doesn't give many buffer points (homework) to help boost your grade. So be prepared to pay attention every day and study lots.,1
"Not helpful what so ever, doesn't post grades until around the last week of class. Waste of my time.",0
For those of you that want to pass English 1A there are many other instructors that teach this class with the student's success in mind. Stay clear of this instructor unless you want to learn English within prison walls. You will buy many books that you won't use. Be prepared for boring lectures.,0
"Not my favorite professor. I'm great at math when I have a decent teacher but I struggled here. He caused asking questions in his class to be a spotlight on students. At points, I would make minor mistakes on tests and he'd take away 5 points even if I showed that I understood it. Don't take this unless you want to get a tutor. (only grades tests)",0
Horrible experience for the online summer class. Webcam is requires for tests and is extremely uncomfortable. You have to buy and expensive online program that requires you to log on multiple times a day. Tough grader on projects. Hard tests even for a 4000 level class. Would NOT recommend at all. Dropping this course.,0
This class is hard and the exams are really tough.,0
"Paul is a super nice guy, and willing to help out students with anything they need. However, he is not great at lecturing or teaching statistics to people without background on the topic. If you already know the material you will do fine, but class time is used very poorly and he often goes off on tangents. His grading is also extremely subjective.",0
"She messed up point values for assignments alot, and emailed us about eight times a week. The hardest part was the class time was pointless but she took attendence, and you lose 5 points everytime you miss class.",0
"Good, fun teacher. Lots of homework and online confusion. Probably one of the better choices for this class. I would give her a B+; well worth the hassle.",1
"if im being honest, i went to only one class in person and skipped the rest. prof richmond wants her students to succeed, so she is straightforward with everything. the quizzes are very easy if you read some, and the tests arent bad either. all online. very easy A!",1
"Professor Mizell is more into current events than the actual material you need for the class. You might as well take this online before you take her because nothing you do in here is relevant to the essays you turn in. She's constantly wanting to start a debate. Also, she has never once replied to any of my emails. If possible take someone else.",0
"He barely knows what he's talking about it seems like, students are constantly correcting him. This confuses the students and makes it hard to understand. He seems to not care about failing students and probably thinks he's doing his part in helping explain the material which he isn't. Don't take him, you might as well teach it to yourself.",0
"This quintessentially tactful man is a wonderful professor. His notes are written in munson and may need to be translated to english. while attending this class i did not have legitimate expectations of longevity, but am happy to say that i have survived two of his courses. we enjoyed this class..the PROFESSORIAL ""we"" that is..",1
"I really enjoyed his teaching style and the text book he used, which he wrote himself. If you have trouble with grammar and writing then i advise against taking this class, only because he grades very harshly on the few papers you have to write. He could be an English teacher! Otherwise, great class. I learned a lot...and remember it!",1
"Great math professor, clear examples and good notes.",1
"He spends a lot of class time begging his students to talk and doesn't teach. On the papers, he wants you to write his opinion, but we don't ever get to hear him explain anything. If you ask him a question about your paper, he gets really defensive and think you're trying to ask for a grade change. He doesn't try to understand what you are asking.",0
"Heres the truth...Class averages are consistently below a 70, tests are ridiculously hard and unfair...I had to change this to pass/fail and still am struggling to pass ..STAY AWAY, ITS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS, YOULL THANK ME",0
awesome teacher - great class,1
Great instructor with positive feedback and very down to earth! I took this class online and at first the workload looks hefty but the whole class is open so you can work ahead. Work is not difficult and its very interesting!,1
"This guy sucks. Pop quizzes every few classes, sometimes 2 in one day so you never know the information to look over. Sometimes, the info isn't on the pop quizzes you learn in class. Not a good personality, if you can take another prof or class, take it. No connection with students, barely even knew our names. Overall, not a good time, hated it.",0
She is not a good teacher,0
"VERY EASY CLASS. So many points makes it impossible to fail, extra credit final, and so many easy points. DO THE PRACTICE QUIZZES FOR THE TESTS multiple times. . These quizes are the exact questions for the test in your lab. EASY A",1
"This guy knows more about writing good stories than anyone I ever talked to.  His classes are fun and you learn as much as you want to learn about writing.  He turned me from an ""ok"" writer to a ""good"" writer and he inspired me to keep learning.  One of the best at FSU!!!",1
"Oh my god, where do i start.  Its actually so funny, because she was a horrible..horrible teacher.  Not helpful!Repetitive! You actually have to show up to class, so ditching is not an option.  She is soo boring, that when class is over you think she is nuts.  Do not take her class. Even if its the last class left.  Trust the site, they are right.",0
"If you are smart, you are his best friend.  If you have trouble or need help, you are screwed with him.",0
"The material itself is fun and I learned a lot from it. Theres no denying hes knowledgable and creative. This being said, I think he lacks a lot of empathy for his students and can be condescending or rude towards them. If you are stressed or struggling, he wont be very helpful. If not, youll probably enjoy the class and do fine",0
"Kim excels at teaching the subject matter in an efficient, yet introspective manner, making him pretty inspirational. He is also extremely understanding of other student's circumstances, especially considering 2020. Ask, and you shall receive. While quite serious most of the time, he's got rare moments of humor that nobody sees coming. real legend.",1
This class was the easiest class I've ever taken. Two easy assignments that can be done early in the semester and four tests make up the entire semester's work.,1
"He is funny but you can't deny his holier-than-thou attitude. He used to disregard me in office hours and participation because he genuinely enjoys humiliating a student who volunteers to contribute in class. Also I once asked him to review my bugged code and he scuffed at me ""your attempt isn't good enough for a rudimentary problem"" So opinionated",0
Absolutely loved his classes. He is so laid back and funny. I was extremely nervous about A&P because it was required for my major and I knew it was going to be hard but taking it with him made it a breeze. Make sure you study all of the notes because all of his essay tests come directly from them. I wish all of my professors were as great as him!!,1
He really reeled me in with his lectures. His style is much different and it can come off as stressful but I always saw his class as a way to just sit back and relax and I would always usually learn something.,1
"Extremely helpful, kind, generous, sees that his students understand the concept. Hands out free lunches! One of the best proffs at Mac and definitely the most memorable.",1
"Solid prof. Lectures can be slow and dry, but they are very useful and exams are straight from the notes. Use the powerpoints and the lectures and you will be fine.",1
"As others have said, she is picky about punctuation and sentence structure. But, duh, this is an ""English"" class so that should be of no surprise.There's a lot of writing, but she does her best to make it interesting. The only people she treats like elementary schoolers are the people who talk while she's instructing or playing on cell phones.",1
"he's an a$$, he goes too fast, he hates CPEGs, and he's a mean grader. lectures do not help at all. unfortunately, he's the only teacher for this class.",0
"Prof. Shields is hands down one of the greatest Professors I've taken. He's really passionate about his work and gives amazing feedback. I took his winter course so it was really fast paced with tons of movies to watch and notes to write but it was really enjoyable, especially completing the creative assignments. Also, his quizzes are not too hard.",1
"Munson knows everything, unfortunately he thinks you do too.  He can be very intimindating, but he really does love his students. His powerpoint slides are incomprehensible and his ""quiz"" questions have paragraph long introductions.  You need to practice doing HIS problems, he has his own language.",1
I have never read so much and learned so little.,0
This class was the most boring class I have ever taken at GV and Allison might possibly be the worst professor I have ever taken. Shes an unfair grader and her lectures are painfully boring. Shes also very mean and offensive. Avoid this class if possible or take with a different professor!,0
"Good guy but not the best professor. Disorganized but the class was so easy and there was hardly any work, just a short 3-5 question ""quiz"" after class. He was a lenient grader but if you're taking a harder math class I probably would recommend a different professor. He's great for 110 though because it's pretty easy even if you're bad at math.",1
"Grade is based on 5 quizzes, 2 exams, and final. All telling detail: a T/F question about mitochondrial enzymes, which wasn't anywhere on the slides. I asked about it, she pointed to a picture of the mitochondria with an enzyme and said we should've known what it meant. She did give me 4 points that I argued for, but she was a terrible prof.",0
She is worst professor ever. Really tough to get graded even though u go to class everyday. Take other professor's class. And too many quizzes and exams every other weeks. No make ups tho.,0
WORSTTTTTTTTTTTTT              DO NOT TAKE HIMMMMMMM,0
"Ressler is a chill and funny guy. He grades really easy, especially on free response questions for tests- he is very lenient.",1
"The teacher gives NO feedback. Do not expect clear instructions or responses. Poor communication for a communications teacher. Other than that, the class is an easy class as long as you participate. Also, when you try to find out information about your grade, you will receive an extremely rude response.",0
"I had to withdraw this class cause of the load work hed expect from us, do not take this class if you dont like to read",0
She gives a lot of reading and very long videos to watch and u have no time to do it because there is another assignment given in 3 days. She opens the assignments 3 days before. I advise you not to take this class while you are taking 3 or more other classes. She doesnt give good feedback and asking her about your grade is a waste of time.,0
"Prof. Jebb is a hilariously quirky dude. I will agree he is a bit of a tough grader, but you just got to learn to put the effort in. Just take a strong side when writing an essay, and he'll think your paper is amazing. Definitely have to read the material or else your done for. I worked a fair amount in his class and left with an A. Favorite prof.",1
Gives homework on stuff he was not able to cover in class. Expects you to get 100% of homework done or he'll give you F on your midterm.  Dropped class & fighting to get my money back which is a pain with Delta.,0
"has favorites, grades poorly, not organized, and overall totally not interested in students unless they kiss his rear end.  And I mean total humiliation.",0
I took SOC 231 Intercultural Communications with Vanden Berg and loved him so much I took SOC 130 for core with him. He's really funny and a relaxed prof. He trusts you as a student and doesn't try to micro manage his class. Easy work load but make sure you know your notes for the exams and midterms. Wish I could take more of his classes!,1
She's a great professor. Also really cute.,1
"Brad is a wonderful professor. He truly cares about your future and your experience as a student. He wants you to take away more from his class than just what's in the book; He wants you to become a leader. He will go above and beyond to help you succeed. There is no reason why you shouldn't do well in his classes. Also, he offers a lot of EC.",1
"Pretty unprepared usually and unpredictable every class. Does things last minute constantly and gives no time to prepare for anything. Review sheets prepared arent close to what is on the test. I always felt like like I got the gist of what he said, but if it wasnt word for word, expect points taken off. He loves stochasticity a little too much.",0
"Professor Rice does try to understand his students on a personal level and always is in a good mood. However, his lectures are unorganized, most of the work done is online ALEKS ( basically you're teaching yourself.) He always says study, spend more time on your homework, but how will you learn if he doesn't teach? Good person, horrible teacher.",0
"In 10 weeks, I took only 2 pages of notes, while attending every class, even though only the last ten minutes of class are relevant to anything. I ended up with a C, but on the bright side, we got to watch three movies!!...Basically, only take him if you are a senior who just needs to pass. Because you probably won't get an A.",0
"Took this class over Spring 2013 semester. This guy basically takes what another instructor does and tries to teach it. Automatically get an A if you try. I would turn in projects half done and still get A. If you are looking for a great great and no idea what is being taught, then this is the class.",0
"He doesn't give tests, instead he does sbars. They are very unclear to how you are doing and he doesn't use blackboard. You won't know your grade until the end of the semester because he doesn't even know. Really no structure to the class and that alone makes it hard to figure out what is going on and why you are doing some of the things you do. ",0
This class was useless. It was an absolute waste of time. It took time away from my family and now that I am student teaching many of the master teachers I have talked about this class to have found her assignments outdated and laughable. Best of luck on your 10 day science unit outline. You will never ever use that again.,0
"One of the most challenging classes I have ever taken, and it was only a first-year writing seminar, yet, I've increased my writing skills tremendously. Prof. Qualls may be cutthroat policy-wise, but he's actually very friendly and approachable outside and inside of class. This man can teach you a lot, but you'll have to put in the effort to learn.",1
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
Gartland is horribly unorganized and unprofessional. She goes on and on about her personal life. I'm not paying tuition to listen to her actively try to avoid teaching us the material. A number of us are considering complaining to the department chair.,0
"Dr. Hanley is very quirky and funny (i.e. he rides a bicycle everywhere).  There are 3 ""textbooks"" he switches between, and he loves talking about Peter Singer, a PHIL prof. at Princeton. Downside? He's extremely left wing and regards conservative  opinions as ""wrong."" As a Republican student, I clashed with him a lot and my grade suffered for it.",0
"Overall I was pleased. One thing that future students should look for is her grading scale. I realized at the very end of the semester that the grading scale did not make sense.You will learn a lot from the class, though! Online quizzes are pretty much everything so do your best. She takes off points on nonsense stuff. Good Luck!",1
"This class definitely has a bad rep among the undergrad math/stats courses. I did bad on the first exam, but by the second exam, I learned: GO TO CLASS and TO OFFICE HOURS, esp before exams. He is so nice in office hours and really tries to help. I did super well on the second two exams, once I figured out how the tests are structured. Great prof!",1
"He's a great teacher who definitely knows the subject. Anything he lectures about is fair game to be on the exam so take good notes. His lectures are structured based on students' questions, so come prepared to ask something or he won't lecture. Grades very generously on the lab portion and overall is very willing to help you with any questions",1
"Professor Maizel is a cool and entertaining lecturer to say the least, if you come to all his classes and take good notes on his lectures, you will pass. The content itself is not that bad, the course has no structure as there is no textbook and all content is oral. Beware of his harsh accent, he may only give definitions to terms orally 1x or 2x.",0
I loved this class. Accounting is boring supposedly but he made it interesting. I too wish he was teaching 211 or 212. I pulled an A out of this class and walked away loving accounting. Tim is always ready to answers questions and explains things very thoroughly. I wish could say the same for my 211 (see Charles Salazar),1
"Professor Wang is an excellent instructor. Class notes and answers to classwork are posted on Canvas. Her lectures were clear and, overall, helped me improve my math skills. This is an accelerated math class. If you are up for the challenge, this class is definitely worth taking.",1
"I have never taken a class with a professor who is so inconsiderate to his students. Grades essays harder than AP Essays (trust me, I took AP Literature in high school, this guy is worse!). For a 102 level class, the work load is ridiculous and he worries about citing sources correctly more than the content of the paper. Never take this clown.",0
"Great guy, has a ton of applicable real-world experience.  Very knowledgeable about pretty much all things to do with tax.  Not the quickest grader in the world but nobody's perfect.",1
His way or the highway when it comes to techniques so if you found a good way to do something too bad.,0
"He expects you to read and will often give a short quiz (usually 4 or 5 questions) over the material. Personally, I just read sparknotes or shmoop and I got a pretty decent grade in the class (it was a B or A, I can't really remember as I took this course last spring). I would definitely recommend Osborne to anyone!",1
Great teacher. Class lecture is pretty heavy but its understandable. Only 3 every short essays and no homework other than studying for the exams!,1
I think Mrs. Bowlin is a great teacher. I really enjoyed her class this year. She had us work in groups and I made some new friends on top of learning about Sociology. Thank you Mrs. Bowlin!,1
"I am not a math person at all, but this class is manageable if you pay attention. Dr. Kazemi is extremely willing to help and wants everyone to do well. If math doesn't come natural to you, do the homework because it is very similar to the tests. Go to class and pay attention and you should do well. If you have problems, ask early or you will be lost.",1
"He seems like a nice guy; however, his teaching method and his lecturing leads it to be a difficult class. Tutoring also did not help with this class.",0
She was always sick and blowing her nose. Other than that very kind and understanding.,0
He was the only part of blackburn I liked. He made my time there easier and was my favorite art teacher and helped me see what I can really do. I would stay at Blackburn for his class but I hate the school so much.  I will miss him and the library the most.,1
Decent professor but teaches right out of the book and off the slides. She is really frazzled and not confident in her knowledge at all. HW is all online assignments due at midnight which is really dumb.,0
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
Grade consists of 3 long essays and 8 one page response papers. Only gives a week for the long essays. No need to attend lectures; you can find everything you need in textbook. Do not reccomend. Final paper question was overwhelming especially during finals week.,1
Hands down one of the rudest professors I have ever had. I have never met any professor who is so rude and seems uninterested to teach their students. He truly seemed like he did. not care if we learned the subject or not. He said that calc 2 was the hardest math class yet he said we need to teach ourselves. He did curve a little at the end.,0
"Dr. Wolff is an awesome professor! 4 exams and an optional final exam to replace a bad/missed exam, tophat participation points, and two brief papers(CBTL and movie assignment). Exams are very easy if you study her powerpoints. I would definitely take another class with her!",1
"Great class! Professor Wood was very helpful, the class was fun and engaging. She encourages you to communicate, work in groups, and build friendships. She also teaches you key steps to get past your fear of public speaking. I would highly recommend her classes, if you pay attention, participate, study, and communicate you should do well.",1
"seriously dont know whats up with the good comments. she is unclear, cannot answer questions, moves through the material too fast, and reads directly from a powerpoint. DONT TAKE HER! you can get a better grade in another section",0
"He's awesome and is willing to meet with you if you can't make office hours. Like other people said, he is EXCESSIVELY literate. I think I've broadened my vocabulary more in this semester than I did in the last two years. He tries so hard to get the class to participate but struggles. He can be unclear but he encourages you to ask questions.",1
"She is a good teacher, but also a very hard teacher. She makes the class enjoyable, though!",1
"I liked her, solid prof, make sure you participate. She's respectable and respects the students.",1
"this man is so caring, funny, and honestly an amazing professor. 10/10 always tells stories and makes lecture worth while.",1
"Prof. Zaitsev is excellent. He is very knowledgeable and always answer your questions. He explain with details and with good examples, but in order to pass you have to pay attention in class, and read the material. The tests are multiple choice but you definitely have to read. His classes are amaizing and fun. You will learn a lot.",1
Brilliant guy but terrible teacher. He made students feel stupid when they asked questions and huge curve due to poor teaching ability. I would not recommend anyone having him as a teacher.,0
"BE CAREFUL! This class is designed for you to fail if you have never taken Calc. You will waste 3 hrs/week in lecture. I suggest using that time for HW or learning Calc online. Do the HW diligently, on pace. You will have to teach yourself all of Calc at a high level. This is a huge task to juggle, so be prepared. Kirsch makes SDSU look like a joke",0
You can tell that she really cares for her students. She spends some time going over the material in class much not as much as she showed. The tests are kind of hard especially if you don't study.,1
"I am currently taking her for AH2 and my recommendation would be to NOT take her class. Her exams are ridiculously hard and dont match up to her lectures; multiple students in my class are failing her class; our class averages for her exams were usually always failing, but she never curves. And never answers emails so dont even waste your time!",0
"I have been taking so many classes with professor Christine and she is one of the best instructor you could find in CWU. She is hilarious, caring and inspiring. A lot of reading is required, but she also gives out a lot of extra credit opportunities. She is always available even outside the classroom. I would recommend her courses to everyone.",1
"Do Not! I repeat Do Not take this Professor under any circumstances! Please try to avoid him! His Syllabus is not clear, he does not give you extra credit, he has no compassion for his work or his students and he will give you lectures about how getting a degree dont matter when it clearly does! Because he wouldnt have one two Or three degrees!",0
"There are over 30 articles expected to be memorized for each exam. The final exam has over 60 articles with no study guide. You must also read the textbook for each exam or you wont pass. Lectures are not posted online so attendance is a must. There's a curve, but that's because the avg grade for the 1st exam was a 55. Without it most would fail.",0
I made a breakthrough with prof keene . I my music is starting to click!,1
"Walker is hands down the best teacher I have ever had at LSU so far. His lectures are very entertaining and participation does matter, but I loved going to his class so that was never a problem for me. He cares a lot about his students and is so funny.",1
"I honestly hope you don't get this professor. She's very unclear with her instructions and will assume you're not ready for this class if you're not a strong writer. She grades very harshly, and won't grade your work if she thinks it looks incomplete. If you get her spend time at the writing center and do what ever you can to be on her good side:)",0
"Wonderful person, but horrible teacher. Does not actually lecture, but she will play video upon video. She does not teach. Her tests are ridiculously hard and are all short answer/essay. The first test was 32 short answer/essay questions!!!! You will have to teach yourself AND finish the ridiculous repetitive and useless online biology homework.",0
Great professor. I highly recommend him for any class he teaches,1
"Good guy. Quizzes daily, but not too hard if you do the readings and you can makeup a quiz through a rewrite, so don't worry about missing a quiz or doing badly. No midterm, just quizzes, one group project and a final. Not too boring, just basic history class. Get one sheet of info for the final- pretty lengthy, but not too bad. Good class, overall",1
"He has been the most passionate, inspiring, &, genuine profesor I have ever had. Each day was memorable in class discussion having us use different perspectives to analyze literature. This class is no cake walk, but he truly shows you how much you are capable of and opens you up to Chicago&Illinois history which has an incredibly unique timeline!!!",1
"Very rude professor. Her notes were confusing and did not go along with lab. She would roll her eyes and give attitude if asked a question. Slapped the back of my chair because I asked someone for a pencil. She wasnt even lecturing, she was just walking around while we were getting supplies. I recommend not taking her ever.",0
"TeBeest is one of the best professors I have had at Kettering. He loves his students and has a passion for all he is teaching, and you can tell this is true during class Pay attention in class and study, but if you do this you will have a great term. Would definitely recommend.",1
"Hybrid class PROS: friendly, no lock down browser required, sends weekly reminders, clear grading structure, will excuse absences, doesnt mind if youre late, Hybrid so all quizzes/exams are online, free e-book, CONS: DOESNT ALLOW MAKEUP, no extra credit, ALL assignments due at 8PM, quizlet is of NO help, get ready to google ALOT or read,",1
i would not recommend taking this class if you are new to writing or not very good at writing. he provides very little guidance and does not like to respond to emails. His lectures were just him giving Purdue OWL links and expecting you to figure the rest out. all of his assignments were for completion and he provided little to no feedback.  ,0
"Love this guy. Take any class he teaches, trust me you won't be sorry.",1
"If I could rate him a 0, I would. This class should be renamed ""History of Media"" since all you do is talk about the invention of the radio, etc. Ridiculous amount of (boring) info and Miller himself is irritating and off topic 90% of the time. My hardest, most dreaded class of the semester. 3 tests that ask SPECIFIC SENTENCES HE SAID IN CLASS!!",0
Krohmer is really down to earth. He is kinda like a philosopher so be ready for deep thinking. He talks a lot during class and you don't really do much besides just chill and listen to him talk about life. This class reminded me of a learn how to do good in college class.,1
"Riley is just amazing! I really enjoyed his class, and it was super fun! But, I think if you are not an art major or not interested in art/design, it could be hard at first. But, he will help you! His lecture is helpful and not boring! I definitely recommend this class!",1
"awful prof, awful examiner",0
"Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree",0
"I took this professor because all of his great reviews, which are probably all fake. I used to love chemistry before this class, but now Im on the verge of failing. The class averages on tests are normally Ds. His lectures are by far the worst Ive experienced, the homework is impossible to do without looking everything up on yahoo answers.",0
"I would definitely recommend this professor.  Just go to class,  and make sure you understand how to do the sample tests he gives. Memorize how to do those, and you'll be fine on the test. There is a lot of homework, but you have all semester to do it. You actually learn a lot.",1
"HATE geography!! I skipped a lot of her classes-they seemed pointless at the time, but REALLY wish I hadnt.  She is SO passionate about what she teaches which makes geog so much more interesting.  DEF TAKE HER, but study hard & don't blow off the class, its worth it in the end. 2 TESTS (HER STUDY GUIDES ARE ON BB) 1 PAPER/PROJECT + FINAL = not bad!",1
"This class was not very difficult, but if you don't attend/watch the lectures, you won't do well. His exam content comes from his lectures, and his lecture slides are mainly pictures, so you have to attend and take notes. Your grade comes from 3 exams, and Dr. Z offered extra credit in the form of quizzes. Overall, not a bad choice for an elective.",1
She was absolutely one of the worst professors Ive had at GSU. The only positive thing I can say about her is that she gives extra credit yet she didnt grade some of my classmates extra credit and classwork until the grades have been finalized. Grades would have been better if she had graded the assignments before the final date for grades.,0
great teacher! only homework consisted of 2 five page critiques and 2 exams (the mid-term and final) which were take-home tests. he grades a lot on participation during class. highly recommend him as an instructor!,1
"4 tests with 6 short answer questions.  She assigns reading(gives you online textbk for free) dont need to do it but helps to skim to get random details to throw onto the test, which she likes.  She gives you a study guide which is very similar to the test. Need to go to class to get good notes so you have a bunch of info for the essays",1
"she's a very nice lady who is always willing to help. i took the class online, so the fact that she responds quickly to emails was essential. the class wasn't difficult per se, but there's a ton of material to absorb. luckily she allowed the exams to be open note since it was an online class.",1
"GREAT MATH INSTRUCTOR! Very helpful and extremely nice. Kinda cute and pretty funny, too. Take Stats with Professor Fry for sure!",1
"He's a funny guy, very helpful and nice. Kinda confusing at times but always straightens things out, and he's a little bit harsh on the grading. The poems and songs are ok i guess... He's a good prof though, and I learned a lot.",1
Very nice person and extremely willing to help students. Great professor!,1
Sandoval is a chill professor. I enjoyed his class.,1
"Ms. Smith is so nice! Her lab practicals are difficult because she doesn't give you a word bank, and you have to memorize several complicated body parts, many of which sound Latin. But other than that, it's an easy course. Go to class, she gives you points every time you go!",1
"Ning is difficult, nigh impossible to learn from.  He outright lacks the ability to communicate ideas clearly,  does not set clear expectations or plans for his course, jump from topic to topic while teaching, repeats himself over and over again (and not in a helpful way) and just appears to be doing the absolute minimum required as a teacher.  ",0
"You need to buy SIMnet for this class ($90) cause thats where all your assignments are. Its an easy class, its just a lot of work online with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. Also, the text book will help you with your tests so you should buy it!",1
"He is by far my favorite professor EVER. He is knowledgeable and loud, definately you will not sleep in class. If you attend every class-gives attendance points and take notes you will Ace this class. He asks you write two essays during the four exams you take, write atleast two pages per essay and you will get a good grade. Note taking is a MUST.",1
"Been in college for five years and he's my favorite professor. Very willing to work with students who are struggling (approachable). Explains grammar concepts in a clear way. Brings outside sources into class lectures, like Arab music artists, poets, etc., so students get a taste of native syntax and culture. A wise, charming, hilarious man. ",1
"he is a really tough grader, but hes a nice guy and pretty funny. he makes you think and at sometimes that may be challenging. If you actually try on the homework and study for the tests, its a super easy course. on the last exam you get a notecard for formulas",1
"I had french with her, neither english nor french are her first languages but communicates very clearly in both of them. straightforward about what to expect on the tests, i had a night class with her and it got long at times but never dull, you can use the old version of the book but it's a little bit confusing, i used the old edition and got an A",1
"My 8th online class-4.0 GPA. Worst prof. by far! Description of 8 wk online course: Step 1) Read the book. Step 2) Take 4 exams. Step 3) Write 2 papers(7+ pgs each) AND 8 pg group project AND write & give 5 minute speech. She told you which book to buy, graded papers & then zip. What about using the internet to show exs/clarify topics? AVOID AVOID",0
"Worst professor I have ever had. It seems like she is never prepared for lecture. She mumbles, and if you pay attention to what she is saying she repeats the same idea several times in one sentence, just reworded. She does not know how to help students and when you ask her one question, you're left with many more after her answer.",0
"By far the most amazing professor I have ever had! Absolutely loved, and looked forward to each class! I would consider him an expert in his field! Full of knowledge and humor! TAKE HIM! You will not regret it but if you don't take him, you will! Professor Lyall is simply the best!:)",1
Teaches ok but exams are very irrelevant to the coursework from Smartbook and Connect. Her brother apparently works at the IMU bookstore in which she will half force you to buy course packets from there. Wondering if there's anything fishy between her brother and her collaboration.,0
"College of Engineering selected outstanding Pros based on their student evaluation, he is in that prime list. Congrates, Prof. Pol.",1
"Lots of homework but it's assigned over two weeks so enough time to get it done. She's ridiculously strict about class participation & behavior over Zoom. Camera must be on at all times, no eating, be dressed properly etc. Tests are pretty easy as are the written assignments. Class is just going over a few exercises in the book. Overall an easy A.",1
"My all time favorite professor a Case. He's hilarious and genuinely enjoys teaching and making an impact. He goes above and beyond as a professor to make sure he's students have a valuable experience. Take whatever class you can get with him, you'll be doing yourself a favor!",1
"Take Her she is awesome, and very nice!!! I wish all the professors I have taken were like her",1
"Jill Neitzel is the worst professor at UD. If the goal for the anthro class is to expose students to different cultures to broaden their perspective, it fails spectacularly as Neitzel would rather you do busy work than any serious learning. Her expectations are never clear and all she gives is busy work. What a waste of a college course and tuition",0
"by far the worst prof. I have ever had. You don't learn a single thing in his class. Everything is up to you. Have a question? funny, he will answer it but will give you a poor response, and barely answer it. Whatever you do try your hardest to stay away from his classes.",0
"Took him online, on vacation they said there was wireless in each room *wasnt). I emailed him and asked if I could complete the assign's when I got back in a week, he told me to find a cafe or drop the course. I dropped. Later, got an email telling everyone to make sure they have their missing work in. Because of this, I was a semester beind.",0
"Margaret is very helpful and positive. She has a friendly, non-hostile personality, and made everyone feel at ease for our public speaking (as much as this is possible). I would enjoy having her for class again. While this last point certainly isn?t relevant, it is interesting; she has a very attractive girl-next-door look.",1
"He calls out students but takes it too far (made fun of kid obviously on the autism spectrum); brought god into several lectures; screens white, predominately cishet male films w/ offensive stereotyped roles (Lottie in Mildred Pierce for ex) but never brings that up. Go to class, and you'll get an A (BME major so def not a lot of work/effort 4 me)",0
"Not very accomidating during pandemic. Big group project, which was very hard due to being online and limited feedback from her. Hard grader with homework. Wish I would have waited to take this class in person because I would have definitely gotten a better grade.",0
"She's a great professor. I am extremely glad I had the chance to be her student this semester. She is so nice and wicked funny, and the class time is really  chill and welcoming. The grading can sometimes be more challenging than other professors, but overall it is fair. Awesome person and teacher!",1
"I wouldn't recommend taking his class during the summer. Really fast paced. Tests were every week. Note cards allowed. However, no extra credit and no lowest test grade drop. Clear grading criteria and does get back to you as soon as he can. Tests are worth 70% of your grade.",0
"I am an upper level student and I found the exam unnecessarily hard. He went over the lecture notes but failed to mention that there would be many questions that weren't in the lecture. Also, he had too many answers to multiple choice that were ALL TRUE, and you had to pick the ""most"" true. His lectures aren't worth attending if you read the book.",0
"She doesn't mind helping students during her office hours, however she made a lot of mistakes when teaching in class which then will confuse you a lot.  If you want to do well, attend her office hours, she might give you a hint what will be on the mid term, which happened to my friend. Overall, not a great prof. Come on U of T!!!",0
"Professor Law is a sweet and caring instructor. He makes his class easy and understandable for everyone. Even though attendance is not mandatory, please show up and give him the respect he deserves. He puts in a lot of effort for his lectures, but it is sad to say that most people take advantage of him by not showing up.",1
"She has been by far the greatest english professors I've ever had. She so kind and helpful. You'll learn really cool things in her class. I was very disappointed when I found out she wasn't teaching 93. If she taught a higher level of English like 96,1a, or 1b, I would take her in a heartbeat.",1
"Would not take again, makes you read over 100 pages just do an assignment. Graded on four topics that require quiz and paper. The quizzes allow 2 attempts, but second time questions have different answers and does not make sense. Does not respond to emails, takes weeks to do so. Gives decent feedback on papers is only plus.",0
"Professor wider is a very fun and energetic professor, he expects his students to read material and quizzes are basically every class but is very easy. Gave 3 tests of multiple choice, true or false, and fill in. Cool professor definitely",1
"Her readings are extremely boring!!!!! Bring your pillows; she will put you to sleep!!!!!! A Don Quixote groupie, her stupid brownie points are annoying, seriously how old are we? She’s a harsh grader! Avoid taking her!!!!",0
"He's a nice guy. Seems like he has seen his fair share of the world. Rambles a lot about random things, like pink armadillos and manatees mating.  Good professor? Not really. Easy A. Bring something to do. Will go over time every class period and will not care.",0
"Professor Adanu is a great professor and definitely wants to help his students. If you need help, be sure to stop by his office hours because he definitely wants to help you get better and create better ideas for your papers.",1
I really enjoyed this class! If you read you will get a good grade!,0
"Easily my favorite professor, all the good reviews are true. I genuinely looked forward to his lectures every week because always had interesting stories to make the content enjoyable. If you have the chance, you need to take Sanford!",1
Great teacher!  He cares so much about students! Impressive personality too!,1
His instructions are confusing.,0
Good professor and more than fair. Discussions are clear but you have to pay attention. What you get out of this class depends on what youre willing to put in,1
Dr. Neumann is very funny and can get off topic extremely easily. Overall good professor. As long as you pay attention and ask questions you will do well,1
"He's nuts, but if you read and take VERY GOOD NOTES, you'll be fine.  Not recommended for non-English majors.",1
"Prof. Bucklin is loud, vulgar, can be offensive but also sometimes funny. The class is relatively easy if you show up but she has quizzes that are hard. She also gives assignments and then takes 3 months to give you one grade back. The class feels like a waste of time because I don't pay attention but I still have a decent grade",0
Mr. Turner was a great professor! I took this course online and ended up with an A. You write a total of 6 papers that come from the chapter; they arent hard at all because you just write about the high points of what you read. Mr. Turner is amazing and doesnt overload you with tons of assignments! I will definitely take him again in the future.,1
"Nice guy, lousy teacher. Get ready to fly through powerpoints, watch a bunch of JMP tutorials, and do random assignments and busywork.",0
"What a terrible professor. He rushes through his lectures. We have class Mon and Thurs 8:30-9:45, and this fool always ends it right at 9:30 and relaxes the rest of the day. Tough grader and expects answers in a certain way. Definitely the worst professor I've ever had. Worst part is? You have very few grades. Only 6 hw assignments and 4 exams.",0
"The class was all lecture and he tends to get off subject, but it's easy to pick out the important stuff. He teaches about multiple philosophers and said many times that you don't have to agree with what each philosopher says, you just have to understand it. If you can go by that saying and study, you can pass the class easily.",1
"I had Prof. Jackson for Eng 150. I didn't have time to go to the writing center, because my semester was so busy, and basically, she will not give you an A if you don't go. I ended up with a B. I'm now an English major with a 4.0.... If you don't mind risking getting below an A then take her, otherwise I wouldn't.",0
This class was the completely opposite of what I was expecting when I enrolled in the Alpha program. I wish I took another class instead of this one because at the end of the semester nothing she taught was relevant. The plus of this class is that every thursday she buys pizza for the class which is a nice treat.,0
"Extremely tough grader. All tests are cumulative and she doesn't curve them (avg score is 30-40%). On tests, need to identify 60 diff. (very similar) rocks and their characteristics. Her attitude is condescending and unapproachable. You don't get a break despite being a 3 hour class, and labs are often so difficult you stay up to an hour after.",0
"Susan is a great math instructor. She works with the class on anything that they aren't really clear on, even to the point of changing the homework schedule and the content on the exams. She brings real world examples into lectures to further clarify the concept. She really does give each student the opportunity to be successful. Great experience.",1
"Guy is easily the most passionate and knowledgable professor I've had. A lot of reading but class was discussion/videos every week. Wants to help students and make an impact as much as any teacher at UD. Great guy, challenging class, but you'll do well if you put in a little effort.",1
"Friendly lady, not a great teacher. Don't get me wrong, if we were out of the classroom I would be her friend. She does not say what she means when it comes to the assignments. Make sure you are thorough on your on account. She will act like it's all good, but when it comes down to grading she will say something like...well want I wanted was this..",0
SHE IS A NICE LADY.HAS INTERESTING STORIES TO TELL. HER CLASS IS NOT HARD AS I HEARD. SHE WON'T GIVE YOU A GRADE UNTIL YOU TAKE A MIDTERM AND A FINAL. YOUR GRADE IS BASED ON EXAM AND EXTRA CREDIT. NONE OF YOUR ASSIGMENTS ARE WORTH A GRADE. GOES TO FAST IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT THE LAW. MIDTERM IS NOT FROM THE BOOK. KNOW UR COURTS. WOULDN'T TAKE!,0
"Very nice guy, but not very helpful. The other two portfolio professors Sean and Maria are much more productive with class time, and actually give helpful critique.",0
This class was ridiculous! I am a senior and a psychology major and this is by far the most difficult and boring class I have taken at UT. I highly recommend not taking this class!!!,0
"Only recourses you can use for your papers are the lectures she assigned (2 per a week, each 1 hour) and the readings which are pages and pages. Only 5 papers and participation and the prompts are sometimes hard to understand. Wouldnt take her class again.",0
Victoria is a very special woman. She has lived a long and exciting life and often gets caught up in reminiscing rather than teaching. She loves photography and has an ambulance of knowledge but struggles with staying focused or using new technologies. If you are kind to her and are patient she will give you the world to see you succeed.,0
"Follows book exactly as written does absolutely no explaining on it, more like show and tell. Makes mistakes follow his instructors books. He is corrected all the time. Had A's in MAT 102 and 116 with different profs, ill be lucky to pass him. Textbook is his bible. Will not explain in detail, he ignores questions. Worst prof I have had at SCC.",0
"FIN 320 is a very challenging class overall, but Sue is a very caring professor who is very flexible with students and is genuinely interested in getting feedback and listening to students. She will always take the time to help you if you need it and if you go to class and pay attention to her lectures you will do just fine!",1
"This professor responded quickly to emails and graded quickly. However, She does not provide additional instructions for assignments. So, even though there is a good bit of extra credit, you may end up with ZERO points if you don't complete how she expects it. And if you reach out to ask questions, she is somewhat rude.",0
"YOU HAVE TO PARTICIPATE. Dr. Spaulding seems like a nice guy but he gets very upset if no one is participating. Requires textbook but rarely talks in detail about stories, just general concepts. Also impossible to reach outside of class and ignores the chat on Zoom. Assignments aren't too bad. Weekly reactions and discussion boards and 2 papers.",0
She is considerate and willing to help,1
"Stan is a pretty good prof, unlike the other reviews in past years, he does not talk about his personal life in class , just straight to the lecture. As long as you attend every class, do every in-class questions, you should get B+ or higher, if you miss 1 or 2 classes, its hard to catch up. Grading structure is 90% tests, no assignments required",1
"Pace is a hilarious old dude, he's great to listen to and he is always really excited about what he is teaching. He explains things very thourougly and makes his class outrageously interesting. David Pace is hilarious and very smart.",1
"Plant evolution and diversity. Very hard course. Online lecture quizzes after each class and labs. Grades hard. Difficult to understand. When you ask for him to clarify or ask him any question, he does everything but help you. It's like you can't get a straight answer out of him. Very difficult to learn anything.",0
"Terrible. He uses cases and basically gives all the answers in class, so you learn nothing. Awful at getting back to you on emails. Has the dumbest sayings ever that he constantly repeats in class. If you want to actually learn something, take someone else!",0
"Awesome, fun laid back teacher. Made classes fun. Bring him chips!",1
Not available outside class. Always tries to avoid students and their questions. Not organized at all.  Made simple things more complicated. Never gonna take his course again.,0
"Look I took this course fully online, googled everything exams are easy. If your trying to learn dont take this class. Also hes a d!(k so if you miss something its a zero.",0
Cool professor. Helpful.,1
He is amazing! I was skeptical about taking him because he had no reviews but he is awesome! He lets you take all your exams in groups if you want to. Do the homework and study and you will pass.,1
"She is one of my favorit professors. She makes the topic interesting and is very excited to teach. She takes time to answer questions and is very kind. Your notes might get a little sloppy, and the tests are pretty straight forward.",1
Mr. Cage doesn't know the material he is teaching in this class.  He is disrespectful to his students.  His tests are hard and he gives no guidance on what to study for.  He is not teaching the curriculum.,0
Awesome Prof!,1
The class is easy enough and some of the books are actually interesting but the ones he focuses more time on are incredibly dull. The class overall is just boring and aimless conversation with no end goal. Would not really recommend taking unless it's the only IH section that fits your schedule.,0
I did not really understand her explanations during the lectures. Better off studying on your own.,0
Pretty much just mediocre all around. No complaints but nothing special either.   Sometimes I felt that the exams were not testing what I had learned but instead were testing me ability to see through the tricks and misdirections posed in the questions.,1
At first it might be a little hard to understand her but as you go to more classes it is easier to understand. Very knowledgeable in what she is doing and very helpful if you ask. Takes her time on lectures so you will fully understand. Even if that means she will have to redo assignments ans syllabus schedule. Would definitively take her classes!!,1
"He will never reply your email. Whatever you do, he will give you a B.",0
GREAT teacher. Torts can be a bit confusing so you must not fall behind. Start memorizing early on as he expects you to know every rule & policy verbatim or you will NOT get credit on his exams. Study his model answers & follow his suggested formating! You will be expected to know every detail of a case so don't skimp on briefs. You stand to brief!,1
I really enjoyed being in Professor Rubin's class. She has so much experience in the field and offers lots of knowledge. She is very caring in her own way and was supportive.,1
"So rude. When all you have is a simple question she can easily make you feel like an idiot for not knowing, awful.",0
"Very disorganized, seemed very gender biased and not a fair grader.",0
"His class lectures were horribly boring, and he spent most of the time telling stories which were not relevant. I emailed the professor three times throughout the semester with questions and never received a response. His experience is 30+ years old. I've since completely changed my schedule to make sure I'll never take a class with him again.",0
Kindest professor I have ever taken. His lectures are thought-provoking and he will always engage with students. One of the best teachers at OCC.,1
worst professor i've ever had. though she's interested in the photography she is not very good at teaching the important stuff ie. the photographer/ his background/ ideologies and theories. her assignments are too vague and she grades unfairly.,0
"great guy, if you wanna learn the real deal take tony bass. learn the material by taking notes and reviewing them time to time and you should get an A no problem",1
"Worst professor I have taken at UCD. Her tests are very subjective, and she's a tough grader. You can literally rebuttal every question on her test. She has a horrible memory, so make sure you don't ask her to repeat herself (because she forgets). She is also very rude, HATES when people walk in late, and gets distracted easily. Avoid her!!",0
"Professor Ivanov is great! Super easy class and gives a good introduction to music, his only flaw is his thick accent which can be hard to understand at times, but overall he is a great guy. He really cares about his students learning the material.",1
Dr. Ball is the best professor you will find in the Political Science department.,1
"I really enjoyed this class and thats saying a lot because Ive never been a big lover of science. She is a tough grader, and although there are a lot of paper, if you put in the work youll see the results. She explains things very clearly and has no room for those who are there to waste their time and hers. Highly recommend this course and prof.",1
"Dr. Lorton is a great teacher. He does each problem step by step and explains things really well. He is a little monotone, but he does give study guides for his test which are REALLY helpful. Solid choice!",1
He is a terrible professor. He has papers throughout the semester. He is the hardest grader I have ever seen. I reached out for help and he basically told me to drop the class. His exams are difficult. He makes everything difficult. None of his feed back is useful at all. I WOULD NOT take him if i was you. He is a nice guy. Just a poor professor.,0
"Dr. Rix is a great professor, he is really passionate about his subject. If you know his interests, you can get him on really fascinating tangents that stall the class a bit but you learn a lot.  -Lots of Blog Post -Lots of reading -Lots of interacting",1
"Good prof, funny, but tends to favor the males more. Hard to approach at times, but will usually help.",1
"WOW this class is pointless. I don't think I learned anything.. I don't even know what the heck information systems are. Clay is a nice guy, but lectures are super boring. Tests are practically impossible, no study guides. Ended up with a C.",0
"Nick is nice ,and helps out, but a little spacey, kind of makes him more endearing though/            Cool teacher",1
"She's tough, rude, and doesn't know how to use a quiet voice. If you did something wrong, the whole class about to know what you did. She also scolds you like you're in elementary school. Get ready to read, and get harsh criticism. She also doesn't always tell you everything that you need to know, or only tells you once. Don't take class with her.",0
One of my favourite techers.Has taught me a lot about the art of acting.Would highly recommend taking his class.Also take his improv class its one of the best classes that you will ever take at a community college!,1
This class is all group work literally ever single assignment and she grades so so hard my group got a 50 on just questions for an interview project and she offered no extra credit dont take this class,0
"Dr. McCargar is an extremely intelligent individual but is tough to learn from. He assigns work packets with problems concurrent to the material he teaches. Most of the coursework is self-taught because of this, but he expects the material to be learned at quicker than normal pace. Exams are HARD. Some up to 10 pages of problems. Tough grader. ",0
"She is the worst professor I've ever had. She flat out ignores questions and refuses to help. There is absolutely no point in going to class except she gives 70 points worth of iClicker questions every day. Avoid her at all costs. If you have to take her class and shes the only prof available, WAIT TO TAKE IT!!!",0
"HORRIBLE. he uses about 10 minutes of class time to teach and the rest is stories about his life which have no relation to what we are learning in class. he swears all the time. even when there's no point to, just to come off as a hard ass. he teaches government but is one minded and refuses to accept other people's points of view.",0
"she is such an angel. trust me you'll do good in her class, she really wants the best for everyone. shes super approachable and i wish i could give her a thank you hug",1
"i failed the class once. but let me tell you, the first time i took the class we had masters students taking the class too. all of the exams were DIFFICULT. you still can pass but you wont be able to get the grade you r wokring for. i took the class again and didnt have any MASTERS students and the class was easy. and i got the grade i worked for. ",0
"Professor Nina is a quick-witted, sharp, outgoing, and deeply compassionate teacher who is committed to the intellectual and emotional growth of her students. She is quick with a joke, a tale, or a well-memorized recitation of some beautiful classical poem or passage. I wholeheartedly recommend taking her class. You will be better for it.",1
"I would recommend keeping up with all of the lectures, powerpoint, and taking notes. If you dont come to class you will be behind, tests are hard. Would not recommend meeting outside of class. I would recommend taking someone else if I were given the option.",0
"Not that it matters, because this was her last semester, but I found her to be very friendly. She expects certain things, but lets be honest, we are college students! If you attend her classes and turn work in on time, you will get an A",1
OUTSTANDING PROFESSURE!! This is what all teachers should aspire to be. Lectures are interesting and engaging. Tests are tough but fair; you always know what you need to know. Term paper is long but fun and he tells you EXACTLY how he wants the paper written. TAKE ANY CLASS WITH THIS PROF!!,1
He may not be the best professor of physics but he is extremely helpful. He scales the grades and does quizzes as a group work together. The clicker questions help to notify that you are attending class.,1
He might have ADD. He jumps around talking about many different topics at one time. He draws a bunch of graphs on the board and class can get confusing. I had class during his office hours so I don't know how helpful going to them would have been.,1
So sexy!,1
"Due to Covid restrictions and class being held fully online when I took GEOG 239, there were many technical difficulties that occurred which sometimes made class hard to follow. She doesn't typically respond to emails & posts things at 11pm which are due the next morning.",1
Very chill teacher! His way of explaining things is funny which makes the class not so boring. Super easy class if you do the homework! Simple questions on the tests. Take him it's a for sure pass!,1
"Mrs. Peters is a well organized teacher and is always prepared for class but her teaching methods are horrible. She teaches everything the long way. Alot of our class had issues with her method of teaching. Not very helpful when a question is asked, always gives general answers. Very sarcastic attitude. Not very helpful. Would not recommend her!",0
"Rude. Interrupts students while they are presenting & tells them they are wrong (how embarrassing for them). Never clear with what she wants, will mark you down for things she claims she said was required but never did. Call her out on something, she will become a total B. Such a BORING lecture, tells lame stories, explains pointless things. SUCKS.",0
This class has 2 papers and 2 exams. You need to learn the concepts to pass the exams. Take your time and research your paper topics. He is a tough but fair grader. He honestly made me a better writer and I'm happy I took his class.,1
"Misses tons of classes, very hard grader, her 100 point grading system is absolutely ridiculous and makes it hard to do well.  
 I'd avoid taking her in the future.",0
"Currently in her class during the coronavirus. Although some teachers lighten up on homework during this pandemic, she doubled it for us. I know we have a lot of time on our hands, but an eight hundred points essay and a thousand points essay are too much on us students who is stressed about the times going on outside of the world and in their home",0
"Taking her class, I learned more than I did back in high school. Shes an amazing professor! Will need and prepare for reading but its well worth it!",1
"She is a very nice lady who is obviously very passionate about her field. Her section of the IMIN371 exams were more or less fair (in that she tested from what she taught), but expect to study A LOT for her exam just due to the sheer amount of material to memorize. Every detail counts.",1
"You have to attend class and pay attention, but as long as you pay attention in class (ESPECIALLY to the pictures and maps) you'll do fine on the exams. Pretty interesting course and easy connections are drawn between the different civilizations. Would definitely recommend as an easy A to science students.",1
"Hardly ever lectures. Class is all presentations which contributes very little to the students understanding of the course material. If you ask any of the students what they learned, they won't know how to respond because they did not learn anything. Should not be ""teaching"" this course at all, and he should consider the feedback he gets...",0
"Professor Bullock is a kind and caring individual. What I thought was lacking was the seemingly pointless homework assignments and incredibly boring lectures. I took the class thinking we'd discuss more of the Civil War but we spent ten minutes on it. It is difficult to get an A in his class, but if you are interested in the topic take it.",1
"Funny man, yet for geo100 you will be bored completely and he makes you do a group presentation that is a waste of time and dependent on other group members. Overall an easy class but irritating.",1
Elliot and his questions are consistently confusing and often have no relation to the videos or lectures given. The average score on quizzes is a 6 -7/10. He gives no work to buoy your grade and tricky exams lead to a much harder class then it needs to be. If you take this class expect a C. Avoid if at all possible and do not show up late to class.,0
I loved him. He made everything so easy to understand. Plus he's cute,1
A very nice teacher!!,1
"Very nice lady. Pretty much an easy A. Gives you about 8 essays, no penalty if you hand in late work. She allows you to pick you own essay topic. Also NO textbook needed!! Took her Spring '11",1
Do not take this professor. Such a boring class and incredibly hard to follow lectures. I learned absolutely nothing and he grades discussion papers incredibly difficulty for just a 100 level gen ed class. Only benefit is there's no tests.,0
"I didnt mind this professor at first, but recently he has been so rude and inconsiderate. I find myself not wanting to go to this class because I get such a negative vibe. He takes off points if you spell something wrong and I also I feel like our lectures don't go along with the chapters. I wouldn't take this class again with this professor.",0
I took Dr. Bailey for weekend class in CJ 420. She has an incredible amount of knowledge in the field and tells good stories. She is one of the kindest and fairest people you want to meet so long as you are honest with her about things. The first exam was difficult but she took feedback from students on it and changed up the format. Excellent prof.,1
"At first I was apprehensive of Ms. Fedorchak because she teaches an english class, but I came out really enjoying poetry. I didn't know she was doing her MFA at the same time in poetry, so that addition to the class was really cool. I learned a lot from the poetry alone, more so than reading essays. I wish we talked about poems more in class",1
"Dr. McCartney was a WONDERFUL teacher! Sweet lady, really knows her stuff. If you're looking for an easy gen ed, this is NOT the class for you. If you're looking to learn/ challenge yourself, the class is great. Lots of reading, weekly 2-3 pg journals, map quizzes at end of sem, one current events pres., midterm, final, and 12-15 pg research paper",1
"Coop was a cool guy, but he was an awful teacher.  I often left class confused and didn't understand and went to office hours but his tests were 2600still hard,  but gives generous curves because of the low averages.  I did very well in calc in high school but his class was terribly hard & doesn't prep you for the final at all.",0
He is straight by the book no other way.,0
Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She drags on everything we do. I would never recommend taking her. Incoming freshman beware she is heartless.,0
"Very Good prof. He knows his subject thoroughly and is a great lecturer, but requires loads of reading and writing. Extremely friendly and supportive to his students a true professional. Without question, one of the best Profs at CBU.",1
"Hi, I'm luke. If ya'll take Anderson, you had better try to attend every class and participate in the discussion. If you do, Anderson will be merciful when grading your final exam.",1
Has a hard time speaking. only information is pre made slides. recommend not taking him.,0
"Skip is a nice guy, but the teaching style was not helpful on homework, or group projects and overall this class just became a repetitive annoyance irrelevant to future career use. The final was optional though so make sure you work hard during the semester.",0
I am glad that I took this prof online instead of in person. Lectures are brutal and loves to call on people to workout problems. Will not move on until you get it (I guess that's a good thing??). He's super smart but had to use outside resources to keep up with lessons and study for exams. Only good thing: he never assigned homework.,0
"Twyla is a nice person and seems to care about her students, but constantly cancels classes and shows up late. If you're a punctual person, do not take her classes. She is also an extremely tough grader and offers little to no feedback.",0
By far the worst professor I've had here. Do not take this class if you're looking for something easy,0
Cook is an awesome professor. He tells you entertaining stories during class and seems to know a little bit about everything. I would definitely recommend taking him if you can! He is very willing to help you understand and his tests are fair--you know what will be on it!,1
Tests are unnecessarily tricky. The way she asks questions makes you second guess yourself. They are so tricky that even she messed up 3 of the questions. The NCLEX questions aren't even that tricky. I am an A student and got a C on the first test. She told the class we were doing very well with an overall C average. How is that a good thing?,0
I took this as an easy lab requirement but it ended up being way harder than I was expecting. Exams and lab are all memorization of useless information. Madsen wasn't bad though. Take GEOL105 instead,1
He is a very hard man. The only reason people put effort forth in this class is because they are scared out of their mind of him. He likes to publicly humiliate his students and will call you stupid to your face. He will mock you constantly and will make you feel like an idiot every time you mess up.,0
"One of the worst teachers i've had to deal with during my educational road. Seems unprepared during class, does not know how to lecture either. Constantly goes back on her examples saying forget this forget what i said this and you never get through anything. I suggest studying the material to understand it, because exams aren't math heavy at all.",0
Lecture consists of useless proofs of equations. Insanely hard exam where I 4.0 in AP Calculus BC in high school and am struggling in this course. No partial credit and marks you down if you don't write it the way he wants,0
"Worst teacher ever. You ask her for help, and she seems to get mad that you need her help. Piles the homework up as if this is your only class. Takes for ever to grade your work. She is fast at emailing you back if she is going to respond with a smart comment,otherwise it will take her forever. I do not recommend any one to take her. HORRIBLE",0
I took Mr. Harp's class for the 2019 fall semester and he was great. Just follow the rules. He uses an online interface for his textbook meaning all the work is done through McGraw hill and DO NOT turn in things late.,1
Makes it easy to pay attention and explains things very well.,1
"Great professor, the course was interesting, follow the syllabus and youll do great. Prof. Pfeifer was communicative he provided feedback and answered emails almost instantaneously. The man is more than fair, the work for the course is manageable providing you stay on top of it. Midterm and final are written essays highly recommend",1
Really easy class but his lectures are boring and there often aren't slide shows so you have to pay attention. Get the textbook it really helps with the study guide. He uses UD capture and there is never any homework. He isn't a hard grader but its hard to pay attention in class.,0
"Pros: passionate about his teaching, funny, helpful, gives extra credit  Cons: gets so excited he can't be understood, goes off on tangents often. Test questions have material that wasn't covered in class.",1
HORRIBLE! Do not take her class. Did everything she expected on papers and still get horrible grades. This class ruined my GPA. Tests are very difficult and when you meet with her for help she just basically tells you that she cant help you.,0
"Very sweet woman, and extremely there for you if you need help.  She will always make sure to have office hours and review sessions.  Tests are straightforward, straight from her lectures and powerpoints -- barely looked at book and got a good grade.  Would definitely recommend.",1
"Interesting guy with lots of great stories. He will tell you up front though that he is a TOUGH grader, which he is. He is unorganized with his lecturing and has very few grades. He will also take like 2 months to grade papers.",0
"He almost never had class, but when he did all he talked about was Carnegie and social mobility. Then he would give us online quizzes worth 100 points that were impossible to pass, and I ended up getting a C because he never actually taught but still gave us the weekly quizzes. His tests are all essays and he never gives you your grades back.",0
Overall very disrespectful and wouldnt recommend him unless absolutely necessary. Way too full of himself to ensure his students are learning what he expects. If you are a student who likes to mind their own business do not take Mandel. He will call you out for something.,0
I retook this class over a 5 week summer session with Mr. McDougal. I did have prior exposure to chemistry from the first time I took the class (with a different and awful professor) so concepts weren't too hard but the class did move fast. Mr. McDougal gives practice exams that are very similar to the real exams and overall is a great professor!,1
"No joke, had a quiz every single class. Each night we had 2-3 readings, normally about 15-30 pages each. They're also over incredibly absurd topics like devil worshipers. This was my least favorite class at TCU so far.",0
"Exams are difficult, you need to go to class to be understand what is going to be on the exams. The book and his slides definitely aren't enough. He can seem abrasive at times if you ask questions via email, but you can tell he cares about the material being taught.",1
"Class is mandatory, but you won't learn anything, the exams are very close to the practice tests, and can be passed by pure memorization. If class was not mandatory I would not have gone since we were lectured at for over an hour twice a week for a full semester mostly about his theories and ideas. It's easy to get a good grade, but it's tedious.",0
awesome teacher!!!! loved her class she is great in a lecture and explains the poems well! take her and you won't regret it!!!!!!,1
Mr.C is a great teacher!I am currently taking his Intro.to Philosophy class at the NTC of Mott.He is an excellent teacher and truly knows what he is talking about.He tries to engage students in conversations about the topics at hand.,1
"He is the best teacher!! he is my favorite teacher, is a awesome guy and super passionate about everything he teaches. besides his awesomeness, he is super easy, a couple online quizzes that are straight vocabulary from the text, some inclass quizzes, which he basically tells you what is on them. There is extra credit and  You Wont Regret it !!!",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. Joyal.  His lectured kept me very captivated and he was extremely crystal in explaining details and would be very fluent in the topics discussed.Very easy to approach in office hours but best to ask him in lecture if you can visit him in his office.  Very long tests, make sure to listen carefully in lectures and you'll be good",1
"Great Prof. The reason why cats fail him is because they think that his tests are like his class. You do NO WORK in his class, he tells stories and jokes all day, but then when the tests comes it is YOUR JOB to read the required cases, or you will fail. The man don't believe in extra credit and your grade is made up of 3 tests. THAT'S IT!",1
"Don't take this class, not because his essays are unclear and not because the class is extremely boring and 4 HOURS long, but because Leitch believes that the movies he picks are thought provoking- however they're about dead dogs and cut up eyes. 5 assignments that are unclear and you'll want to leave seconds after entering- awful class w NO VALUE",0
its a hard class but Professor Sanford makes it easy! his exams are lengthy questions but as long as you go to class and pay attention youll be fine,1
"I loved this professor. He is awesome for a math teacher especially! His tests are also reasonable(not to hard or easy). He has a bit of a thick accent, but i find that helps in solidifying the material i.e. : ""if da leemeet o a funnk-shon has no hoes o sharp poins in d graff eet iz not differentiable""!",1
"Extremely nice, easygoing, and helpful.  He can babble and be scattered with his material at times, but he always reviews it so it is clear afterwards.  He truly cares about his students and always attempts to interact personally with them.  He will offer help in aspects that do not even involve his class.  Few assignments, and you can rewrite.",1
"Class sucks, might as well be reading out of the textbook. Most of his students fail. Dont do it. Loves to talk about his college experience and college football thats about it. Tests cover chapters he didn't go over.",0
"Maureen speaks VERY quietly so sit in the front row. Meet with her at the very beginning of the semester even if it's just to say hi. If you do so, she'll bend over backwards for you. Shes not always clear on what she wants you to do so ASK QUESTIONS. Participation is very important if you don't want a major assignment. Didn't really like the class",0
"Professor is really rude and hard to communicate with. Grades seem random. We watched movies with no assignments attached to them. Easy A but useless class, didn't learn anything. Great for someone who just wants the credit, doesn't want to learn or do much work. ",1
She truly wants the best for her PR students and understands the difficulties of our other journalism classes,1
"For someone not interested in math, this class was very dull and seemed to be a lot harder than it would have to be. She seems pleasant enough but doesn't make any attempt to connect to most students. Not a great teacher; take someone else for 125 if you can.",0
"This Professor is not my favorite. The reason why is because his teachings are extremely boring and have no enthusiasm what-so-ever. He brags on his background being very egotistic a lot of the times. It's very annoying because he is arrogant for no reason, and we're trying to get there. He knows his material, but have some gaps in teaching it.",0
"Nice guyinteresting character at times. Passionate about his class. Throws chairs. A tough grader. Doesn't give clear feedback. I felt like I didn't improve as a writer at all. In order to do well, PARTICIPATE. Go to office hours and email him! If you show you care, you'll do better. Laugh at all his jokes even if they're absurd and not funny.",0
"Graham is awful. His quizzes are unscheduled and so much of the quiz material isnt taught before the quiz is given. The tests are worth way more than they should be. You can fall as many quizzes as you want and be fine, but if you do bad on one test you may as well kiss your grade goodbye unless you do amazing on everything else.",0
Very disrespectful person makes fun of sensitive topics. I am someone who isn't sensitive to risky humor but he takes it way to far. Some of the things he said were extremely disterbing and literally threatening. I can't believe some of the things that came out of his mouth. I didn't even feel like I was in a sociology class.,0
Though I received a passing grade I still regret taking this class and thinking about this professor is going to anger me for a while. He told me I wasnt aloud to question him because hes a professor. he thinks he deserves the utmost respect by everyone but doesnt reciprocate the respect to students. I would reconsider if you are taking his clas,0
"Professor Stevens was straight forward with what he expected from the class. If you go to him with your graded homework's he will walk you through what you missed, and even offered extra credit opportunities. Would take him again!",1
Petty work load.. Busy work,0
"Matsushima-sensei is great. Very kind and helpful and she makes the content easy to learn. Going to class is actually fun and it's a great break in your day from some of your more stressful classes. This was a fairly easy class. Just attend the class and pay attention, you'll do fine.",1
"Great professor! Very kind and extremely accessible. While the course work was not difficult, Hamilton would assign many assignments in order to keep students accountable. Just follow the syllabus, do the assignments, and you should be fine. Class also is based on one large group project, which is great to learn how to work in a team.",1
"He has a thick accent and is hard to understand, especially when he is rushing through the chapters to get it over and done with. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM. Dr. Ba is a knowledgable man and knows his stuff BUT he is deff not the one to teach.I might as well have taken a hybrid class.Also don't be surprise if he gets fustrated if u ask questions",0
"The special topics class on The Wire with Scott, was by far my favorite college class. There is no textbook, you just have to buy all 5 seasons of The Wire and watch it throughout the semester, go to class watch it and discuss it.  HIGHLY recommend this class.",1
"Prof. Humphrey is excellent. Would definitely recommend taking his class. Lectures are long but very informative, you can tell he truly cares. A little goofy but it makes class interesting. 2 papers and 3 quizzes, plus the final. Also 1 group project that is fairly easy. As long as it's entertaining you'll get a good grade on it.",1
"He's such a nice teacher, very helpful and patient especially during office hours. If you make an effort and seeks for help he is going to take that into account.",1
"I dropped his course when he told a story about kicking a student out of his class when the student didn't understand the course work. H also spent half of every class talking trash about the students who don't read the book. This was meant to be a warning to get students to read the book, but I was paying to be taught, not to listen to his rants.",0
Crazy hard grader. Reported everyone for plagiarism for no reason. DONT TAKE,0
"Don't expect to do many tastings in this class, it's mostly a lecture. There are 2 papers 2 presentations (one per paper, 5-7min each), Top Hat is used in class for attendance and a few questions (for participation points) here and there, and occasionally you'll get a worksheet. Each year focuses on a new SPECIFIC region. Overall  fairly boring.",0
The Detective in Film and Fiction is an incredible class if you enjoy the genre. You may not like every book but they are all worth the read and you only need to write one page on each book. It is a book or movie a week which is a lot but the class discussions are so fun to participate in it is worth it. Dr. Jebb is awesome and loves teaching this.,1
"I didn't like this professor & his accent is really thick. If you ask him a question sometimes he'll reply with a smart alack response. All he does is read from his power-points. He is not energetic at all. If you want to get help, i suggest you ask someone who is a econ major because he sometimes will not answer your question clearly. ",0
"Tries to push you to the online website for the book but ended up not using it.  Directions are sometimes confusing.  Don't be silent, ask the question and you will do just fine.",1
This guy was such a confusing class. Save yourself from the confusion and buy the book he goes by on amazon. its called The most dangerous business book youll ever read. Theres also a free download of it if you search for it. He comes off really intense but hes just an interesting guy messing with students. Getting the book will make the class easy,1
"I absolutely hate this guy. Mad picky on hw and grades the tests like no one else. Got a 91 on one of the test, if other professors graded it, it would have been at least like 96. Unnecessarily picky, extremely boring, and not good teacher at all. I would avoid this guy. Take friedland. He will make your life easy.",0
Dr. Henton is not a very understanding professor. She knows her stuff but she doesn't really know her students. I definitely don't recommend her as a prof.,0
"Easy class, but he talks to us like elementary students. We NEVER stick to the schedule he sets because he drags discussions out. VERY boring class",1
You need to read a ton of material and well. You cant miss class because he goes over exactly what he will be putting on the test but really likes to ask questions on things you literally havent talked about. He doesnt do power points so its all lecture. Talks quietly and fast and spews at you. This class would be great if it wasnt with him.,0
"If there is any possible way to avoid his classes, DO SO!  He is a very smart man, but has absolutely 0 teaching ability.",0
"Prof Sandweiss' class was probably the hardest I've taken so far... He grades really heavily and does not allow for expression of your own political views. If you do not answer a question with his political view and do not write a paper his way, then you will not get a good grade in this class.",0
"Barely showed up to class & had no idea what was going on ever & got an A two semesters in a row (ENC1101 & ENC 1102). Easiest class I have ever taken. Grumpy teacher but if you keep your binder organized you basically get an A. Also, he lets class out super quickly. ",0
"Bude is probably the worst person to be in charge of a whole major. Her directions are very unclear and she clearly does not know what she is doing . Her work is all OVER the place. She came in to our SL to introduce a paper, she came in with parts of her power point missing so she edited while teaching. Also her English is TERRIBLE, she needs help",0
"I took Dr. Kelley's online class for Winter '20. Class is interesting and could be use as a tool to research diets on a particular interest, Dr. Kelley is supportive and provides many opportunities for extra credit, just put the effort in projects and quizzes and everyone can succeed, book is needed for class.",1
Loved this class. It was on dystopias and survival and we read all kinds of great books like the walking dead comics and handmaids tale. Catherine was down to earth and really nice (AND a cool english accent)! I dont like english or writing but I feel like I really know stuff about the books and society that I didnt before. Would def take again.,1
"DO NOT TAKE LESSONS OF THE LAWN UNLESS YOU HAVE TO FOR ARCHITECTURE. I missed nothing skipping his class and when I did go, he put me to sleep within 5 minutes. He is semi-comprehensible when speaking about buildings, but 3/4 of the time he tries to relate them to entirely unrelated things. A 3-8 pg paper a week. Teaches you to BS like a pro.",0
"Honestly, his lectures are a mess and so unorganized, and good luck writing notes and keeping up with him . There is alot of reading and papers due for the reading. The study guide that is provided is no help. Whoever is a history major please avoid taking this class. This isnt high school where you can't use the bathroom either during lectures. NO",0
"Gross scared me. He is big and intimating. He calls on you randomly. If you don't understand, good luck. He is a scary dude. I do not recommend him at all. If you see that you get him, run for the hills. He won't help you if you need help. At one point I had a D in his class and I worked so hard. He was an annoying dude.",0
great professor! he explains the material very well and gives you chances to make up work best math professor by far,1
Dr. Keys is the best professor I have ever had! He makes his classes so interesting and highly applicable. There were always hands-on problems to solve in class and labs were always interactive and almost always outdoors. He even took our class on a weekend camping trip up north! He is the best prof! Take him if you get the chance!,1
"Multiple choice tests,no partial credit, 20, 8-16 problem hw. Studying midterm for final is futile. doesn't matter how much material you can shove into a both sided cheat sheet You are screwed. Got tutored, did all the extra credit, showed up every class ON TIME, took notes still failed, Pass is possible if taking teacher twice.",0
"She is way too harsh a grader. She gives assignments for projects and papers, but does not give you any structure for them, just ""do this"". Then she tells you that you did the assignment wrong. I would not recommend her.",0
"Only teaches the easiest questions in class and then sends you home with a bunch of hw either much more difficult questions that he didn't even at least brush over and there's even questions that we didn't go over what so ever, overall he's a terrible teacher. Guess that proves that anyone could become a teacher",0
"Liggin is an awesome human being and teacher, he understands learning software online due to COVID makes it more difficult. He is willing to stop and answer all questions to make sure everyone is on track. This course honestly falls on the individual to put in time and effort beyond what the class time grants",1
"Took online over winter. Her online lectures were useless, so I stopped watching them and just memorized the textbook myself and did really well that way. Have to study a lot, but doable. A lot of her exam and quiz questions were either incorrect or ambiguous - I got points back by going to her office. But she's very slow to reply to emails.",0
"Nikkel was awful. I worked so hard in his class, studied over 15 hours for each exam and still got 60% or below. His class averages are horrible because he's not good at lecturing. His OWL homework are ridiculous and a waste of time. I've done well in all my other chemistry classes except for his. Take another professor if you can.",0
"Nancy has a way with words. By that, I mean she gets up to her lecture podium and performs lectures in the style of ""rap god"" by Eminem. The textbook will be your best friend in this class, but the lectures are worth going to know what is up. The weekly quizzes come with a difficulty I cannot describe - they're essentially impossible.",0
"I love Najar! he's my favorite teacher this year. Incredibly clear and willing to go over anything you might not have caught, and very interested in his students.",1
Not a difficult class if you pay attention and take notes. He is very funny and manages to tell stories that relate to what we are talking about. Very enjoyable to be in his class.,1
"The NCP she teaches you will be different from the NCP you learn in your other classes, I believe she is a great nurse in real life but she needs to understand that she is teaching a first semester of nursing class and can't expect a graduate level writing.  I am an A student but all I cared about was passing for this one. RIP to the next cohort.",0
"I love her,she is understanding and easy to talk to.The only problem is she gives long readings.",1
"Do not take this class online. Extremely lecture heavy and the way he lays out his modules is confusing. Videos are also reused from like 2015. You have no contact with him at all during the semester, his TA is the one who hosts review sessions. Review sessions are also not helpful. May be better in person but online its very hard for a 101.",0
He is a really nice guy and passionate about what he teaches. I unfortunately had to drop the class because he talked way to fast and I couldnt keep up! Very lecture heavy and was hard to type off the words he was saying because it was way to fast and hard to study if you have bad notes!,1
"He really knows his stuff, has a lot of industry experience and makes you actually learn something for marketing instead of letting it skim by as a joke class. Really enjoyed his class, wish I had time to take him again",1
Gardner is a pretty good choice if you aren't a math major to get your gen ed out of the way. She can be pretty funny but kind of sarcastically rude too. The class is an easy A and I suck at math. Get the online homework done on time and you're golden.,1
"Prof. Koehlinger was great. A decent amount of reading, but not an overwhelming amount. Quizzes were exclusively on the readings. She is a fair grader and very responsive. The only thing I didn't like was for weekly discussions the responses to other students had to be done on different days, but other than that it was a good class.",1
this class can be pretty exhausting because ever week is a new chapter with a quiz or short essay or discussion post. He does post reminders about stuff due. its super heavy reading! I wished we had more time on the quizzes instead of 5 min for 5 questions. lowkey feel like you should already be an expert on the subject to take this class,0
"Sue, SUCKS!!!!! DO NOT TAKE HER! If you want to learn anything take a different teacher. You'll sit in class and waist time, you don't learn anything from her and she is the lead instructor for the class. The other teachers (co-instructors) were good but they don't teach as much. She is very vague on what she says you should know.  BAD TEACHER >_<",0
"Great guy! Professor Vannier is energetic, passionate, and has a sense of humor. Offers lots of extra credit opportunities and is very willing to help students. Only downside is disorganized lecture slides. Note key concepts during lecture and you should be fine. Likes to give away quiz and test answers during his lectures, so look out for that.",1
"I'm not one to give such a poor review, but this is truly the worst class I've ever taken. He doesn't tell you how to do well, games are often unclear, way too much reading. I was so excited to take an untraditional class, but the stress and confusion was overwhelming. Don't recommend if you need structure, reasonable class load, or applicability",0
"Tough grader, Little feedback, and has no filter",0
"Seems to have no idea what he's doing, forgets to bring materials to class. Rarely gives partial credit, and doesn't want work to look ""like scratch paper,"" which makes you rewrite all the labs unless you do the work on another paper. If you're a math person, it's just pathetic. If you're not, you'll be very confused.",0
"Where do I start? She has no clear idea what she is teaching, her reflection quizzes doesn't help in my retention of the material that is covered(if its covered). She doesn't place all the assignments somewhere where it can be easily accessed and seen (almost costing me). And her grading system for group projects doesn't reflect fairness.",0
Professor Madsen is the man! He is so understanding and flexible. He allows extra help on exams if you reach out to him and he truly cares about student success.,1
He reads from his slides he's easily distracted and I think he's useless,0
"This class is terrible/stressful. Mohun's lectures are somewhat interesting because she speaks as if she is telling a story, but her power points are very vague.  Most of the notes must be taken from what she is saying. The TA is an extremely harsh grader. She expects too much from her students. If you want to take an easy class THIS ISN'T IT.",0
"Professor Milligan is probably my all-time favorite. My first class with her was a 3-week summer session. 4 hours a day - 4 days a week. It was tough going, but to this day I find myself using what I learned in those 3 weeks in my other courses. She is a gem, that if you push yourself, is the most rewarding experience you could ever want.",1
"Thomas-Reid is an eye-opener. The man is fantastic and wants to see everyone do well. He does not care about your grade he just wants to learn, but he helps so you can get that A that you want. Take him and you will really enjoy it!",1
She has you write about a 400 word paper every week. They way grades are given is really strange (a 90% is a B+). 2,1
Ramsey is the smartest professor on campus. She has figured out how to get paid without working. She is a poor excuse for a teacher. Find another class. You will regret hers!!!,0
"Dr. Kunz first tells you that he will be monotone and boring, but he actually pokes fun at himself and it's hilarious. He gives out quizzes once a week, 10 questions all multiple choice, and right from the slidesnotes. No surprises and everything is really interesting if you follow along. Study for the quizzes, and you're golden. ",1
"She is a great teacher if you have interest in actually learning the language. Alas, if you are taking the class to just fulfill requirements, she is not the prof. you want. She is understanding with your problems, but she is strict when it comes to class. Be prepared for work if you take her.",1
The class is not hard at all and he gives no homework. All you have to do is read the chapters and there is a quiz every week. He makes the final paper worth 1% so it doesn't affect your grade. He is really nice and is available at the bridge twice a week to study with. He tries to makes things as easy as possible.,1
"Unethical!  Lowered my grade when I challenged him about it!  Rude, condescending, arrogant and I could go on.  Don't take his class.  I did not feel comfortable in his class as he liked to berate many students.  You won't learn much and you will dread going to class.  UD needs to investigate this one.",0
I barely attended class and got away with it because I read everything she told me to read. I didn't know there was a textbook but I read all the articles she talked about and got notes from friends. She was hilarious and talks about pop culture a lot. This course is easy.,1
"On top of being the worst professor of my college career, he lacks the ability to grade your essays at all, you will not pass his class with a 4.0! Wastes time in class talking about aliens and his classes are not enjoyable AT ALL! save yourself and DO NOT TAKE HIM!! FIND SOMEONE ELSE!!!",0
"Stay away from Dr. Singer. His lectures do not correspond to what the books say. His test problems look nothing like the problems from the book. At least half the class dropped this class (including me) because he is simply a garbage teacher. The material is learnable. I took it with someone else and passed easily, not because of a pushover teacher",0
"Oh man, where do I start? Thibaud Tallemfumier is without a doubt the worst teacher/professor I have ever had in a math-related subject. His lectures are bland, useless, and often extremely confusing. Homework assignments are unnecessarily long and do not accurately represent content tested on exams. Seriously, don't take him.",0
"Stan can be very rude to his students at times (calling some of his sections idiots) and can be very discouraging. I have taken his class in person and online and I don't recommend either. He doesn't believe in review classes or showing how he got an answer, he just tells you if you are wrong (which isn't helpful at all)",0
She is very good not an easy A but it is possible,1
"Figen is amazing, and definitely my favorite teacher at Grand Valley. While the work load is very heavy, she is very understanding and is a fair grader. She gives out a ton of extra credit, which helps take some stress off the work load.",1
"Prof. Cerda is a very nice person, her class was not that much fun. However, class its kind off the lines sometimes. She expects that students read the ENTIRE BOOK. ""Mind you 15 chapters.""  Test are so,so. One group project and one individual essay. GO TO EVERY CLASS.",1
Grades very strictly and doesnt offer help. He is an awful professor and his lectures are boring. Do not take this professor! Grade is based solely on papers and tests that are very difficult. Hated this professor!,0
"almost nothing but powerpoints, very difficult to understand, doesn't explain things well and skips a lot of material, overall too difficult to follow if you want to seriously learn in depth about databases. You are better of learning on your own.",0
"wpc 101 with Dwosh was very relaxing which is perfect for being a freshman orientation class, highly recommend him, little work outside of class you just have to participate when you are there.",1
I didn't have this professor for a hard class but he's just a mean person. When having discussions or debates he shuts down anyone who doesn't share his opinions. He acts like his passive agressive behavior is a joke by laughing after he screams and/or roasts someone's beliefs when he obviously is serious. Hated listening to him speak.,0
"He is well planned out. His tests are not easy, but he gives you good study tips/guides. I would take him again.",1
"I did horribly in the 1st half of physics and hated it. Then I took the 2nd half with Dr. Holland and have a new appreciation for physics. He makes the subject interesting and easy to  understand. He also has an obvious love for physics that shows through his teaching, rubbing off on his students! Highly recommended.",1
"Very sweet and kind professor. She put a lot of effort to ensure we understand the materials and she is willing to help you. Basically her lectures are clear (although some trivial mistakes were made during lecture), I would recommend her class. Her GSIs are very helpful and funny.",1
Read straight from the powerpoints all semester and did nothing to make the class interesting. Attendance is mandatory so you actually have to sit through the class.,0
"Extremely caring, goes out of his way to make sure you get a good grade.",1
"Dr. Meche is a tough grader. If you do not understand something in his class, GO ASK. I cannot stress that enough. Some times he doesn't seem like he's helping but if you go to him enough times he will realize how hard you are trying to pass. Make sure you get his title correct. Talking helps when assignments are hard.",1
"Beware of Mrs. Wang's math classes. You need to be well-versed in the subject. She does not provide a platform for C students. She delves into Matrices and Linear Programming. Taking precious time away from more applicable math subjects. Just keeping it real. Also, you will notice that she does not have 23 people on her waitlist!",0
"Where to start... Dr. Reynolds is an amazing professor. Humble, dry humored, and understanding. The class isn't all that difficult but, the labs and exams are. He's understanding and wants to see all of his students succeed. Please, if you are looking to fufil a pre-rec and see this class available with Dr. Reynolds, TAKE IT! He's a joy!",1
"A very good professor. She is very nice and caring. She is willing to help her students. Gives easy assignments.  As long you get all the work done,you are all good. She doesn't give a final, only a midterm. I would recommend her.",1
"Horrible instructor; he isn't interested in teaching you, he is interested in making you laugh. However, he isn't funny. He makes cheap jokes about beer and cocaine, but at the end of the day everything I learned about Marketing could have been taught to be me by reading a few chapters of our book. Doesn't proofread tests.",0
"Yall, Mr Pierce is THE MAN. 12/10 would take him again. He genuinely cares for his students. Lectures are so much fun and his passion for the subject matter makes it easy to learn. His tests are easy to pass as long as you study a little for them. Offers a lot of extra credit throughout the semester. Super easy to pass this class.",1
I generally liked her lectures. She is clearly passionate about plants and was usually good at explaining things. The reason her rating is low is because her test was ridiculous. She asked short answer questions that we talked about for like 10 minutes instead of the stuff she talked about in great detail. SO much memorization was needed.,1
Amazing professor!,1
"i can hands down say this guy is the worst. hes SO RUDE. refused to work with students despite covid. (would put obscure questions on exams on things ONLY discussed in class. if you missed, even because of covid, he REFUSED to help.) i did the reading. i put in the work. he is the dictator of his class (his words). avoid if you want a high GPA.",0
"Pierce is a fine teacher as far as material is concerned, but where he lacks is in giving consistent feedback. He sometimes will knock a bunch of points off a test because he did not explain what to do for the entire section and marks it 'incomplete'. Theres also a bit of homework but not much, just a tough and odd grader.",0
"I respect Dr. Ferguson very much. She has so much knowledge that she just wants to share with us & to learn and expand our knowledge on that. Participation matters and helps the class become more interesting. Buy the books and do the readings. If you do not take a class with her in your years at URI, you will be missing out. ",1
Worst Prof at Brock. Not clear at all and for the 2 hour lecture he goes the entire 2 hours without a break. I think he lacks common sense and teaching abilities! AVOID him at all costs,0
Professor Stolba is strange and rude. Do not take this class unless you have no choice. The information is useless unless you have some burning passion for anthropology. She is a sub-par professor at best and it was very difficult to sit through her intellectually-absent lectures. The tests and lectures are often unrelated. Avoid this prof.,0
"Save urself the misery of this class if you can! While the material is common knowledge her ambiguous canvas assignments (which she neglects to inform you ab besides saying ""check canvas"" as you're walking out the door) will CRUSH ur grade if you don't hand them in on time. This seems easy except she assigns the most random due times like Sat @3pm!",0
"She'll give a quiz every week, but by half ways through the semester, she won't post the slides from lecture until the day of the quiz. And if you're like I who has a class at 9 am, and then her class at 10:30, you're screwed. She has only given one bonus question on 1 quiz and gives 1 on exams.",0
I would take this great professor again.,1
There is a midterm and a final and they are mostly comprised of the quizzes. Make sure to review the outlines. The quizzes have very specific questions and little amount of time is provided. There is an assignment due every week. You have to really WORK.,0
He's extremely condescending and you will not be respected what so ever in or outside the classroom. Often embarrasses and shames you in front of your peers for just asking a question. Mathematical errors happen more often than not even on study guides and tests.,0
He is a nice guy and does put effort into this class; but he is very awkward and expects the large majority of the information to be learned in the textbook readings. He is very vague on what he wants and his essay test questions are no different. The entire class was just a very Awkward vibe.,0
While the class is not difficult Professor Zaech is unclear in her expectations. The discussion board work is usually vague and unrelated to the textbook. The textbook was hardly used for the class as the discussions usually did not relate to the chapter that was assigned that week. When you email her for clarification she does not provide it.,0
"Manuel Aviles-Santiago is a phenomenal professor. Don't do the minimum. He loves your personal insight! Add your thoughts into the media critiques, do around 400 words per critique. 1 per week. Quizzes are not hard. Watch the movies, especially the movie on Banksy (so cool). Since COVID, we've seen everything on Netflix and Hulu anyways. 10/10.",1
The BEST TEACHER at carleton!!!,1
"No study guides, likes to trick students on tests. No extra credit, doesn't care if you learn or not. Bad accent and hates it when you don't understand what he is saying. Do not take him!!!! Nightmare!",0
"Give study guide, and very helpful, approachable.",1
"The experiments are quite interesting and I enjoyed working on them.  However, if you encounter some sort of issue, Prof Ho will be of ZERO help to you.  I dont think he spoke more than three times the entire semester.  Youll have fun working on his required 50 page lab reports - any less and he wont even consider giving you a grade above 80.",0
"I've only had him for intro, but I find that he relies too heavily on his Power Points and spends the same amount of time on complicated material as the easy stuff.  Overall though, he's a good prof.",1
"Mrs Johnson is a great teacher! She is so kind, and she makes the class interesting!",1
"Professor Ivey,  Is an Awesome teacher!! He is funny, witty, knowledgeable, cares about his students. Open door policy to all in need of one on one tutoring.  Excellent teacher, as well as kind person. Most definitely would take his class/ or classes again.  Great man, great professor! You go Professor Ivey!!!!",1
Sanda knows how to design and she's wonderful at that. However she doesn't teach well. She gets mad when students aren't getting it yet we just spend the whole class critiquing and repeating ourselves. She made it clear from the beginning that this class is a lot of effort and time. Not for the unconfident people.,0
"She is always upbeat and excited to teach, good at explaining and reviewing.",1
"One of THE most difficult classes I have taken in my career as a student. While the information is very interesting, she has a certain things she wants to hear, and to do otherwise results in a loss of marks. Bonuses if you are a Feminist. Her classes can go from funny to dull in no time flat, and the otherway around depends on her mood.",0
Terrible class. You won't learn much.   Teacher is not all together.,0
"Abrams is by far the worst economics professor at UD. He does not care about his students and is very bad at explaining things. To be fair he does know a lot about the subject, but is terrible at explaining it. The material is hard so have fun teaching it to yourself. Has office hours but they are almost as useless as going to class. Terrible.",0
"THIS TEACHER NEEDS TO FIND something better to do with his life than ruining students GPAs for fun. I think he just has a very miserable life that his goal is to make all of his students miserable as well. He deserves to be fired and I will be reporting him. I promise you do not take this professor he sucks, he needs to reevaluate his life.",0
I just want everyone to know this professors is not helpful at all. Totally doesn't care about students. Why is allowed to teach?,0
"McGuffey is a nice, quirky guy. He understands that this class is taken because students need to graduate and he doesn't make it difficult. However he can be disorganized, so the TAs and students are often confused with exactly they're supposed to be doing.",0
He has a discord with the professor in it with TA's which makes life a bit easier. His lectures are well organized and always enjoyable. The programming assignments are almost never boring and not labor intensive. A great class with great energy.,1
"I knew the first day when she told us it was her second semester teaching that this class was going to be rough. She does not TEACH you anything, more just expects you to know it and sends you off with these stupid activities that'd be better suited for junior high. It's frustrating when you know you could get a better grade with another teacher.",0
"he is the best teacher in SMU, I strongly recommand the best student to choose his class.",0
Easy class. Don't miss class. Attendance can make your A to a B if you miss.,1
This is the absolute worst class and professor I have ever taken. She is an unreasonably hard and inconsistent grader. Gives contradictory feedback and is rude and belittling in doing so. Her grading system is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I should have dropped this class. STAY AWAY!!!,0
Nikolai lectures very well and even though he does random cold calls he makes you feel like whatever you say has value. He only provides one practice exam per midterm and final so it is up to you to study from the book.,1
Great prof....really takes time to get to know students out of class and explain everything well during it.  Absolutely amazing.,1
"She is not helpful at all; Probably one of the hardest teachers Ive ever had. Studying, taking notes, and looking over h/w is not helping. I'm still enrolled in this class because I have no choice.  She does not give extra credit or curve your grade. Take another teacher if you can you will regret it unless you're good in math and word problems.",0
"PSY 220 IS about the psych of learning. In this class you learn that punishment is ineffective. Ironic. If you do not get every single thing right, youll have to redo the entire assignment. To get beyond a D, yes a D, every assignment expects perfection. A class literally about learning, this was the antithesis. 400 level work for a 200 class.",0
"Hands down, the hottest professor ever!",1
"This class was very unorganized. She is a nice person and the assignments are easy. The group project was a pain, but the final was a reflection paper which was so easy. This class is an easy grade if you do the work",1
"If you are looking for organization and a linear-style lecture, this class is not for you. The lectures were all over the place and expectations were never fully clear. It's one of those classes where you understand the material through the book more than the class. My learning style was not compatible with his teaching.",0
"Online class, home works and quizzes are easy. Test are all short answer and barely relate to topics on homework or quizzes",0
"When I met this man, I was like ""Ok cool guy, easy class, I will get an A"". Jump to the end of the semester and my grade is hanging on a noose and ready to fail. His tests are brutal and are not related to anything in class or powerpoints. Random pop quizzes that are difficult as well. Do not take this class unless it's required.",0
"Nice guy but his lectures are dull. He's a CS professor so he expects students to have a background understanding on CS. If you don't, this will be difficult. The homework is fairly easy and sparse. Not sure how his tests will be, haven't had one yet. He emphasizes that his tests are dependent on his lectures, not the textbook. We'll see.",0
"she was a really good professor. class wasn't always thrilling, but she was passionate about all of it. she had great stories and graded fairly.  plenty of small papers and 3 take home exams that ruined my life while i was writing them. but if you finish them, she'll give you a good enough grade.  i'd reccommend this section.",1
"She's just not a good professor. She curses a lot, assigns weekly homework and there's A LOT OF reading. She also wants you to go to libraries to borrow books to read a few chapters for class and return it. She's also a very tough grader. She doesn't really help students much and makes you feel dumb based on questions you ask her. DON'T TAKE HER!",0
"Spends half the lecture ranting about student complaints; said he gets so many complaints he doesn't care about them anymore. Doesn't teach anything; told us we ""have to learn how to Google."" Don't bother asking questions, he'll answer with ""I don't know"" or ""you have to figure it out yourself."" He'll kick you out of his office too. Disgraceful.",0
As somebody who is not a history major this class was very difficult because I did not have a lot of prior knowledge about  other than what I learned from high school.  I learned so much about European history in this class and really enjoyed the professor's lectures.  HE IS A VERY TOUGH GRADER. Do not expect an easy A or an easy B,1
"This was the most difficult class I have ever been a part of. He teaches very quickly, because he knows it so well. It's like he does not know how to 'dumb it down' to a 101 level. I am very good in science and have always enjoyed it until this class. He is a really funny guy, but this class was extremely difficult.",1
"Three quizzes during a semester and a take-home essay as a final. The quizzes are just about the definitions and maps and they're absurd, they have nothing to do with the definitions she gives during the lectures. Don't waste your time doing the readings, there are quizlets done just google them, listen to lectures do extra cr it should be easy A.",1
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"Good teacher,with sense of humor always willing to help.Some things are a bit harder than others but all in all easy to comprehend.Does alot of extra credit which helps at the end of semester,so attendance is important.Does not like if your tardy and will not accept late homework.",1
He's not bad. Do the work and you will be fine.,1
"Dr Anderson is one of the smartest professors at VSU, he gets to know all of his students and goes out his way to make sure you pass. After taking this class you begin to feel like a scientist. but, He uses stack grading on a point scale. always attend lectures, its impossible to learn the information on your own. Study ASAP before exams. go to lab",1
"Lots of work, he can be difficult to understand. you really gotta learn to pass",1
"This man, within the first few weeks of classes, showed a documentary that showed real footage of people jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge to commit with no warning of what we were about to see. People were getting up and leaving left and right. Everyone was visibly uncomfortable. He preaches about ethics, but doesn't practice it. Inexcusable.",0
By far one of the funniest and most engaging professors I've come across - you will not regret taking a class with Matt Rand.,1
"This professor, who is well-informed and eager to help his students, had one notable flaw--he is unable to control self-righteous and pushy students that tried to seize control of his class at every opportunity.  His classroom soon became chaotic and he was unable to maintain his original plan of instruction, falling rapidly behind in the syllabus.",1
"He expects you to know everything he is going to teach that day before you get into the class. If you miss classes, it's not a big deal but there isn't much you can do to catch up. Take good notes and watch the UD captures later that day. ",0
"good professor, interesting material. But the class is too long and the material in class is important for the prelim, so it gets really tiring with taking notes.  Readings could definitely be improved.",1
"the BEST math prof @ CSM! a literal blessing bc he managed to teach ME stats. effectively too. very accessible outside of class and is very patient with you if you dont understand a concept very well. everything is connected so dont worry abt things popping up on tests. long story short, take him for math if you can, you wont regret it",1
He is a nice person whenever you talk to him one on one. Tends to be very sarcastic with feedback to students. Expects you to know everything and can be rude when you try to ask questions. He is not a bad guy he just expects a lot.,0
"Very odd grading scale, grades off what she thinks is right instead of using the correct rubric",0
Robi's tests are so hard. She is not trying to teach us how to be nurses she is trying to teach us how to take tests. She is very critical and puts the students down. She thrives in the failure of her students. Do not take her if you can at all help it!,1
Extremely inconsistent and unfair marking. Feedback that was given made no sense. Instructions for assignments were outdated. Her expectations did not align with the course syllabus. Very poorly designed course. Do not recommend to anyone. Not an Easy A by any means. Was not willing to discuss grades in person or over the phone.,0
Really fun prof. Made French grammar interesting. I am excited to take another course from her!,1
"For a class with no prerequisites, this class is ridiculous. I read, take notes, and study it all. Pulling a C in the class and the current average is a D. Avoid if possible, especially if you're not an AD student. What he makes sound important in class may or may not be on the test, so get ready for questions out of nowhere.",0
his class was all over the place. We had a lot of different books and we would jump all over the material. He would go off on tangents a lot and it felt like what he was saying didn't align with what we were reading. His essay assignments were confusing and he took forever to grade. He's very stuck in his ways and i wouldn't take him again.,0
"Super nice guy, very hard grader. If you are not an art major DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I am taking this class as a gen ed and was very proud of my paintings. I was told by him that it's based off of how well you can paint. I've spent $500 on supplies. I can't drop it and I have a C+.",0
"Worst teacher I ever had, he doesnt know how to teach at all. his handwriting looks like scribbles.",0
"Sullivan is very disorganized, things are often not graded on time and he takes a very long time to respond to e-mails, or just does not respond at all. Notes given in class are often very different from the things we are expected to read online and in the book and there is no correct way to prepare for the test, all of them have been different.",0
"Dr. Matson is  a great lecturer, but class is still excruciatingly  boring (it's gender studies after all). He can be funny sometimes, but he has a bad habit of trying to shovel his wrong opinion onto you. He preaches about spirituality and expects you to know his religious beliefs on his tests. Great lecturer, but horrible professor.",0
"Though hard to tell, this professor enjoys Physics, and will work with you. However, his grading criteria is very unclear and leaves you guessing often. He puts formulas on the board during tests but seldom do they help. Being in a lecture hall his mumbling does not make his lectures any easier to follow. Content on tests don't match lecture.",0
"Funny guy who gives laid back lectures. Great teacher. Class is homework heavy like any math class, but he gives out group quizzes and likes to pad your grade as much as possible. Very dependable and will help you at any stage.",1
"Horrible planner and doesn't know how to use online tools and basic technology. The pacing of homework was irregular often assigned entire chapter readings the night before a class. On top of this, he is extremely slow and has no humor.",0
"Most helpful prof anyone could ask for, very clear, and wonderfully entertaining",1
"man goes way too fast, mumbles, has horrible handwriting, and just all around sucks",0
LOVED HIM!! Best class i ever had!!!,1
"He wants you to write to his level of knowledge and understanding. Write what he's looking for and you'll do fine. Need to show up to class and have everything ready for the day. Expect 3 papers and 2 presentations and 1 quiz. Looks strict but is pretty chill once you get comfortable with him. Very mild accent too, easy to understand.",1
Professor Grunlund knows her work but she makes this subject too hard! Every quiz she gives is timed too! She dont even give you a second chance to take it over like most teachers. Shes also not truthful about whats going to be on the test. She will tell you to study stuff thats going to be on the test but it dont be on it. Kind of deceiving.,0
Professor Stevenson is by far the best professor I've ever had. Her class is tough but thats because Anatomy is a tough subject. She takes time out of her day and outside of class to teach you and make sure yo understand everything. She is extremely helpful and such a nice person. Would 100% take again. Amazing!!,1
"I took her class online so I never actually was in a classroom with her but shes such a great professor! Shes very caring, doesnt give a lot of homework or quizzes, always answers when you email her, and always gives a clear grading rubric. Take her!!",1
Class is boring enough without the lights being dimmed and him talking.,0
"(This course was taken during COVID, so take this with a grain of salt) Falk is a nice, kind man, but he is the worst professor I've ever had in my life and I no longer want to pursue a math minor because of him. I feel like I am paying thousands of dollars to teach myself the content on YouTube because he never provides solid, concrete examples.",0
"This instructor is the only reason this class was difficult. The rubric was barely followed, if at all sometimes. She will mark you down for random things without reason, and for things I've never had issues with before. She finished grading all my milestone papers within 15-30 minutes.  Nothing was ever clear, making this class terrible.",0
"Arevalo is a sweet person but shes not great at teaching. She runs through the slides and crams things in at the last second. Her thick accent makes it hard to understand her too. There arent many options for bio 104 , but if you can, avoid her. You can pass this class but you WILL have to teach yourself. Tests have little to do with taught info.",0
"If you can dodge this class and take it with another professor, please do so. The exams are the worst, you literally have to read the entire textbook. He will throw in random questions just to see if you read the text. Oh! And you better be an English major/minor for this course because they will ding you if you do not write to their standards.",0
I have a very tough time with math. That being said I've had some amazing math professors she is not one of them. She goes way too fast and doesn't explain anything. All her notes are just practice problems with no explanation. I along with many others dropped the class in fear of failing.,0
"Really enjoyed her class, she's very likable and doesn't give a huge workload!",1
"Eugene is a really nice man, but it is often really hard to understand him. The class meets twice a week for an hour and fifteen min., and it really is a waste of time. We talk about interesting material, but we do nothing but discuss. No tests, but tons of online work! 6 hours of placement a week! Make sure you have time for this class!!",0
Do not take her.  Very disorganized and takes weeks to grade assignments.,0
He is possible one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is very bad at explaining topics and doesnt go over half of the clicker questions so its hard to catch up if you are behind. The only reason I go to his lectures is for clicker questions because I learn little from him. The class by itself isn't bad but do what you can to avoid having him,0
"Dr. Edgar is a nice person, but I didn't like this class. If you don't understand logic (which is hit or miss), you won't get an A unless you have a friend in class who can help you through it. Go to office hours with the TAs, because you'll get 100s on your homework assignments. Tests were really hard but Edgar does give partial credit.",1
"If you go to every class you will do great but he accent is very strong! When you ask her to explain something she says ""You just know"". Be prepares for a hard class.",0
Incredibly hard class and hard professor. if you are taking this class get a tutor ASAP. Professor will call on you randomly if no one raises their hand. if you don't know the answer he will embarrass you infront of the whole class. online homework is really hard and theres a lot of it. Avoid this professor and DO NOT take his 6-9 class.,0
"Wingender is the best professor I've had at Creighton. He has very clear grading criteria (average of 4 tests) and he keeps his lectures both entertaining and relevant. He is not afraid to share his opinion on things, but he's very honest about that, which I really appreciate. He's an extremely friendly guy, and he'll work with you if needed.",1
"Tamara Lubic is the worst teacher I've ever had. Her expectations are very unrealistic and her grading is incredibly hard. She has no problem signaling people out in front of the whole class and is very rude. She talks about her husband more then the course material. For your own sake, never take this class.",0
"Took this class,didnt read the books assigned read the summarys and passed, all I could say is that going to lecture really matters for passing this class. Hes a great professor!",1
"I've never gotten an A in math and I finally did because of David. He is by far my favorite teacher ever. Five chapter exams and final, let's you have a page of notes on exams and final. He's always willing to help and cares for his students. Really happy cheerful teacher and ahh just wish he taught stats . Thanks so much David you da best!",1
"En gros il connait bien le sujet mais ne sait pas comment lenseigner correctement. Reste souvent assied a son bureau et skip des power points et raconte verbalement des choses . Quand il ecrit cest illisible et pas structuré. Genereux dans la correction mais sans plus. Difficilement rejoignable, préparez vous a attendre si vous lui écrivez",0
"Smart & witty, she really makes the class interesting. Her little side comments about society/loyola/students/etc. are one of the best things about this class! She makes you work hard for the grade, but in the end it's worth it. I got so much out of this class. She's great to talk to outside of class. Missing class can throw you off, so go.",1
She is the worst professor I have had to deal with. She gives SAU and Psychology a bad name.  She is incredibly unclear on her expectations for assignments.  She is very arrogant.  She does not grade objectively in the slightest.  Awful person...even worse as a professor.,0
Hated this professor,0
"Very good teacher, willing to work with students and will curve the tests grade. Come to class and labs, do the work and you will pass",1
"Dr Picault is a very nice guy and generally very approachable in office hours. But you really have to get used to his lecturing style: there were weekly only quizzes  and 4 multiple choice midterms. Final exam was a long and moderately hard (multiple choice). No diagrams, no analysis. Very lazy assessment, you won't learn a lot  of economics here",1
Professor Riffe is a real gem. If you have the opportunity to take her for rhetorical theory or really any class you should. We're so lucky to have her at Charlotte. She looks for the best in you and your work and wants to see you do well. Incredible lecturer. She takes attendance but you wouldn't want to miss class anyways. A gem I tell you!!!,1
"A very hard class. there are a lot of memorization but he allows a cheat sheet.  Even though he was hard to understand, he was very dedicated to his students and the class. He held a lot of office hours if anybody needed help with homework. I would recommend to read and study the material before you go to him for help because he will get angry if y",1
The best class I've ever taken!  Dr. C makes it so much fun and I learned so much.  Classes were enjoyable and fun- you get to watch clips and listen to songs from musicals- what could be better?  Dr. C knows his stuff and is a wonderful teacher!,1
"The lectures are two and half hours long and there are no tests, just two papers. He does clicker questions every class to count attendance. He does offer extra credit so that's a plus but I didn't enjoy this class.",0
Professor Baker is a gem! He's very caring and approachable and makes theory interesting despite how difficult it can be to grasp. 3 short papers and 1 longer paper at the end. All manageable and he's always there to help if you need it! Would totally recommend!,1
"Crowley knew her stuff, and gave you all the tools to pass her class. No homework for points, instead she takes attendance. She assigns homework and expects you to do it on your own, her tests are similar to the homework, if you dont do the HW, you dont do well on the tests. Has all the 'distractors' - its tough but she is GREAT!",1
"WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER MET! Don't believe these other positive reviews. Cowan is rude and disrespectful. He is negative and vicious. He does not teach art, only makes fun. I tried hard in this class and my extra work was unnoticed. DO NOT TAKE CLASSES FROM COWAN. UVU would be better off without him!",0
"I would not take this class again.  She isn't organized, she always runs late and there always seems to be some technical difficulties that delays her from teaching off her slides.  She is also very intimidating and calls on students randomly in class.  I received an A- and thats basically because I had to teach myself.  I would not recommend her.",0
open note and book tests make the class easier gives you great study guides. clicker questions for attendance. he's not a bad teacher but the lectures are kinda boring,1
"Dr. Daly is a favorite amongst the evaluative English department students, including myself. With lectures that not only pertain to the reading, but to life, he delivers material that is sure to have a lasting impact upon your life. A wonderful professor.",1
"All in all a decent teacher, however, his accent makes it quite difficult at times to follow along in lectures and understand content. LOTS of quizzes, 2-3 a week.",0
"Never met a more lazy professor, this guy never taught us a single thing only posted videos and never did anything himself. Lazy, unhelpful and unreachable, I have never hated another person so much in my entire life. This prof is extremely lazy, DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. I would have given him a 0 if it was possible.",0
"A lot of people give him crap, but his lectures were some of the most interesting ones I have attended while in college. He cares so much about the subject and the student's success. He wants you to understand the material, not just memorize some multiple-choice questions. If you can talk well about a concept, then you should do fine on the tests.",1
Simple Assignments,1
supposed to be a bird class but he made it really hard,0
"Neil is great, and he is a hot tamale.  He is very helpful and his classes are quite enjoyable.",1
"She is very academic so expect to have to read at a graduate level. It was a lot of writing based on a lot of reading. But the topics were interesting and her feedback on the writing is at the level of an English professor. If you're willing to step up to the plate and read/write, it is an interesting and manageable class.",1
"I cannot say enough positive things about Mr. Wildman. math has never been an ""easy"" task for me, due to lack of interest. Mr. Wildman changed that for me. He was engaging, funny, animated, and truly cares. He uses real world examples based off of the entire classes interests, which makes it feel like it matters. Recommended to anyone",1
"This professor has some very small nuggets of wisdom that can be drawn from the class. However, you will soon realize his biblical hermeneutic skills are lacking. His claims about the story of Jacob and Esau, the cure for anxiety and depression, and numerous other issues are misplaced and almost offensive at times,not to mention his grading is yuck",0
"Horrible professor. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. She grades very hard on essay, and her intructions are confusing.This class was a waste of money.",0
Kinda annoying at 8 am,0
Professor Mazzouri is great!!  He is patient and makes it easy for you to understand.  Make sure you attend class and complete the webassign homework.  If you have questions he will take the time to answer them.,1
The lecture does not reflect the exam. He has study guides for specific exams and it does not correlate at all with the actual exam. It is a intro class but he treats it like a class in Harvard!,0
"This professor's office hours are extremely limited if you are looking to get extra help. However, if you somehow track him down for extra help in this course, you will not feel respected for he had uncalled for political jabs and degrades your work and thinking process.  Prof. Rogers clearly does not believe in the success of his students.",0
Wow this guy is bad. Your quizzed at the beginning of every single class about things you had to teach yourself. Then you have to sit there for a lecture filled with tangents and that is never relevant to what you read. 2 people in my class have above a B. 9 have below a C. Find someone else.,0
"Awesome instructor. Very understanding and helpful. Makes learning Accounting easy if you listen sharp and ASK QUESTIONS. Isn't big into tests, and cares about what students are learning. Funny, but doesn't suffer fools gladly. His lectures are down to earth and easy to understand. Worth taking F2F class rather than online.",1
"Best Professor in accounting department! Very helpful , he truely cares about every student.",1
she's so nice and she gives all the help you need to succeed in her class.,1
"HORRIBLE. LONG BORING LECTURES.  NO visual aids. She doesn't do powerpoints, instead she puts up pages of articles on moodle to read., which are harder than her lectures. She said book isn't needed but it definitely IS (READ!!) When asked to use put up powerpoints for us she says ""I dont know how to do that, so I'm not going to"" ...... DO NOT TAKE!",0
"Had her as one of my professors during the first semester of the pandemic, she was the only prof i had who did not give extensions on assignments and was not understanding/caring AT ALL to students needs. If you have something personal happening in your life dont expect her to be lenient with you.",0
"Tests are the only deciding factor to your grade. Four taken not including final. Very hard to follow sometimes, tells lots of stories that don't pertain to the subject. Difficult class, mandatory to go into sequence.",1
"DO NOT take Biology with Garrison. Expects you to know things not mentioned in textbook, tests are ridiculously tough, and extremely anal. Has multiple choice on tests, but its actually multiple-multiple choice. If you're hoping to get an A in this course, do not even bother taking it with her. You need more than a great memory to pass.",0
"Brunjes really enjoys teaching and wants you to learn, but he isn't very considerate of students who want to pass or are learning a difficult subject for the first time and can't memorize the text in detail. He doesn't use a microphone and there isn't a ppt, just pictures. Beware of exams and study since anything can be a question. Good luck...",0
"I took his class after failing it with a different professor and understood everything. He made it so easy to learn the material and complete assignments. I had a little bit of trouble writing my final essay for him and that tipped my grade, but his class was never stressful for me. Do go to the online lecture because he'll mention quiz answers!!!",1
"I've had Dr. L for 4 classes. In person > online with her. She expects you to teach yourself with provided materials - a rude awakening for the GPY dept, where most teachers hold your hand with old school multiple choice. Bc of teaching myself, I felt like I missed out on learning some things. Vague and tough grader, books required.",1
"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",0
"I think Prof. Darman is decent enough. However, my main concern is that he lectures on tangents FOREVER. Honestly, if you are taking SOC 110 with him, the book is more of a learning tool than he is just because it's a test to focus on his every word. Other than that, surprisingly interesting at times and the writing assignments and tests are fair.",1
"Awesome instructor. Understanding, empathetic, and most importantly, she provided continuous feedback. Great professor!",1
I loved taking Professor Stevenson. She was always so helpful by sending her students handouts and lists showing everything you need to know for each exam. (Many of the other lab professors only gave their students access to powerpoints). Every lab class has 3 exams and mastering assignments every week. Take Professor Stevenson!!!!,1
I took this class online. It was an easy A but there was a ton of busy work. I think I wrote more for this non-SWS class than I did for my SWS ones. She was helpful and very involved in the class and a decently easy grader. Overall it was a good experience but it was definitely more demanding than I expected for a 100 level course.,1
"He's a funny dude with a lot of hilarious stories to help you relate the material to real life situations. Breaks down concepts step by step either before or after class. I'm not going to lie, this stuff is hard. If you don't come to class, you won't follow any of it. Homework helped me out a ton and labs were always a good time. Smart, funny guy!",1
"A math genius, and cares about his students!!!",1
"This class was super fascinating and Dr. Fox is very knowledgable and makes the class very interesting. He talks without bias and explains abstract concepts simply. That being said, this class is also very difficult. The exams are very difficult worth so much of your grade and he assigns so many readings. You need to put in the work to get an A.",1
One of the hardest classes. The quizzes and tests don't correlate to what she teaches or what the readings are on so it's impossible to get a good grade. Plus she doesn't show grades to her students.,0
"Should not be a professor. Doesn't teach. Terrible. All we do is present and no one pays attention. He always talks about how his presentations help people get jobs, but I wouldn't want any company to hear me present what I bsed for the class...",0
"I didn't really enjoy the ""old school"" format of the class with lessons on the whiteboard and all. I would have probably liked opre 3360 more. However, this class is super easy and if you show up and take good notes you will definitely get a good grade. He's also super helpful in office hours so meet up with him whenever you have questions.",1
"BORINGGGGG....he is really interested in what he talks about but he is so very dull to listen to and he takes attendance. class is composed of two big essays and a final. very easy to get a B, but an A ia harder to come by. if you write extremely well and don't mind being bored in class, then you will do fine.",0
"Prof. Engelman's lectures are boring and cover mostly common sense information. The readings are long, but only contain a few important details, so learn to skim. Overall, the class is an extremely easy A.",0
"Amazing professor! She is so understanding and can really work with you. If you do put in the effort, youll get an A! In addition, you received your grade with feedback within 2 days!",1
"Kristi cares about her students, and she is very passionate about what she teaches. She keeps class interesting. She creates a very safe and comfortable environment for students that have anxiety about public speaking. Loved her so much I took another class with her.",1
"Shes a very nice lady, but this class was a waste of time. It was like she wanted to teach a race and gender studies class, but got stuck with writing and rhetoric so she had to shoehorn it into Computers and Writing. This course did not improve my writing, lecture mostly consisted of discussing pop culture, and the final was a group project.",0
She makes the class absolute hell if she doesnt like you,0
"Really nice guy. Very knowledgeable about the subject matter. The class is extremely easy. He seemed a little uncomfortable teaching a business class, but it's always a philosophy professor that teaches business ethics.",1
I was very impressed with Valor's knowledge and for everyone that had the class with me they will understand what I mean when I say I was also impressed with his Baddassary! Thank you for making this class fun. I would certainly recommend just take notes!!!,1
Awesome prof. Awesome class. Dedicated prof who goes out of her way to help.,1
"Easy A. She's always willing to help, she helped me find a major that suited me and even helped me with my major change, always taking students opinions into consideration to make class fun and easy . ",1
"Will is an awesome professor ... you learn a lot from his class, but he doesn't demand much.  Incredibly laid back, and very dedicated for an adjunct.  Rock on, Will.",1
If you study the notes and understand the material it should be an A (study test are harder than the quiz). Don't waste $ on text just buy notes.,1
SHE IS TERRRRIBLE!!!!!I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TAKING HER FOR ENGLISH..EVER!,0
"I don't know WHAT some of these people are talking about.  First of all, if you are not willing to talk and argue with ""femanist liberals,"" then what exactly makes you want to do English? I have found that all POV's are considered with good supportive evidence.  If she seems cold, try to show her how interested u r in the class, u may be surprised!",1
"Dr. Baker is incredible. I wasn't super interested in Beat Writers, and I only took this class to fill an Honors requirement. However, he has so much passion for what he teaches that he made me love it. Two short papers (he took the third one off the syllabus) and a longer final paper. Generally easy grader (he loves his Honors students). Take him!",1
I love him. Great guy.,1
"Professor MacArthur is a double edged sword. If you are a non-English major looking for an easy English class, he is your man. Just prepared to be bored to death. Bring work from other classes to do. However, if you are a serious English major, he is a waste of your money. You will learn nothing because he is busy rambling about irrelevant topics.",0
She was very nice. Her overall posture was very comforting and the way she taught the subject was very nice. The things I learned from her just seemed effortless.,1
Only gives out 20 pts extra credit the entire year. Can't understand what he says. He makes tests as hard as possible. Hands down the worst teacher at sinclair,0
Do not take this class unless you have at least  2 years of  programming experience. I took the class to save money and instead of saving money I wasted it. I ended up teaching myself oop and paying hoagland to sit in front of the class and mumble for an hour,0
really seems like an easy class but the only way you can get a A is by literally getting above a 90 on all exams.. not really easy. Even with getting all 90's you will most likely get a B+ .,1
"She's lenient with grading the lab's but when it comes to quizzes they are just horrible! She would give you a random species that you have no information on a few days before the quiz and then expect you to become an expert on it in a few days! Her lectures are just horrid, she usually joins and talks about how hard her second job is mostly.",0
"Dr. Hinton is super sweet and witty. For lectures, it's really boring; she reads off the powerpoint and they're on her moodle too. Her exams questions are often on quizlet and she reviews the class day before the exam day, I recommend recording her with your phone and searching the questions.",1
"This professor taught management and did a horrible job, so they moved her to business communications. It's horrible too. At least she is consistent but the lack of knowledge and preparedness show. If you get have to take the class take it with the part-time guy that used to be at DSC! My department should have hired him! This class as is stinks!",0
"Hard teacher, but she knows her stuff. You really have to study to do well. She will help out if you need it just be prepared for sarcasm!",1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
Lectures are very confusing and work can be hard to follow. I'd recommend taking Differential Equations with someone else.,0
Best Econ professior I've ever hadHe cares about his studentsGo to office hours if you don't understand the material. He is so nice and friendly. Review the old examsread the textbookthe article on sakaiand the handout he gives then you'll be fine. I got a B only because english is my second language,1
"Brown only cares about bodybuilding and track, so to him every other sport is irrelevant even though the class is called SPORTS PERFORMANCE. He gives a generic lecture about every other course you have to take at BSU and most of the time the information is skewed into an inaccurate and sexist view. He teaches by opinion and praises supplementation.",0
"Wolff is the best psych professor Ive had at the university. Shes super sweet and the best at explaining all of her concepts. Her lectures are interesting and if you listen, youll receive all the information from her powerpoints and do well on the exams. She has 3 exams, and almost weekly online quizzes(really easy). Oh and an optional final.",1
"The class is basically based on the lab. Unfortunately the lectures sometimes don't cover lab material in time so you find yourself stuck sometimes. Office hours are going to have to be part of your schedule to pass. Oh, and it's a problem when a computer science professor doesn't know how to hook a laptop up to a projector.",0
"The readings aren't interesting, and he grades extremely harshly, especially for a 1000 level course. He doesn't give good instruction on what he wants from our essays, and mostly grades on grammer and punctuation rather than the paper itself.",0
"Coop is a nice guy, but definitely the worst professor I have had. I currently have him for physics. It is not worth coming to class as he just rambles on and writes so small on the projector that it is impossible to read. I have never learned so little in a class. It's much more beneficial to spend class time studying on your own or with a tutor.",0
She gives no direction about her quizzes so you have to ask her what she wants instead of her just telling you.,0
"After not having taken Algebra in over twenty years (in high school), I was really nervous to take Mr. Pilla's course. From the first class I knew that he was amazing! He really took the time to explain everything in detail, pausing to answer every question my class had. He used real-world examples and was an overall awesome teacher!",1
"This guy is very sweet and he means well, but his tests are ridiculous.  Nothing in the book or in his lecture notes show up on the tests.  I have no idea where he got his questions from.  He had to scale the grades majorly for my class.",0
"I absolutely loved Margarita's classes. I had no prior experience or knowledge of Spanish before taking her class. I definitely struggled with how fast paced it was, but that is how a lot of college classes are. She cares a lot about her students success and is just as happy as you are when you FINALLY get something you've been struggling with.",1
Tuff prof but very helpful.  Explains things really clearly. I learned more in one semester with her then any other class.,1
"Gives study guides for the tests however, the tests are graded weird. The answers you put down are not the same answers you find in the study guide.",0
"Easy prof. If your female this is an easy A, if your male then easy B+. Just use some vocab from the book in your assignments. There are 3 Exams with 20mc and three optional essays.",1
"Matt is the kindest professor I've come across. He goes out of his way for his student's no matter the expense. He is very responsive and considerate. The course material is not too difficult, and if you do the assignments you will succeed. Each week has a pre-lecture quiz and in class quiz based on the weekly textbook reading.",1
"Prof Hasheminia is simply amazing. Because of him and DS 412, I switched to DS major.",1
"I love Cote! She is super tough though. I managed to get an A in her class but only after studying for hours for each test and I never missed a lecture. She is specific on what you need to know, especially what you need to memorize for each test and quiz. For lab, ask questions! if you mess up in lab she will get angry, so it's better to clarify .",1
This was one of the worst teachers I have had. He is very cocky and makes you feel stupid when you talk to him. I would not reccommend this teacher at all.,0
"Somehow made hard topics understandable, and improved my CS skills too.  Best prof in department.",1
"Dr. Freitag is a good professor with a lot of experience in PR, but he will use the majority of class time to talk about his career and go off on tangents for 20 minutes before getting back to the lesson. He will make you work for your grade and uses the 7-point grading scale. I enjoyed this class though, assignments and tests were not too hard.",1
"Feedback is rude and condescending, makes you feel stupid even when you get the right answer. I was told I used the word ""or"" wrong",0
"Monica was difficult to contact, especially at the end of the term. She often cancelled class and when we did have class she finished early, sometimes this is good but in this case it was not. She only taught for about half of the semester and then it was group presentations for the remainder of the semester. I would not take a class from her again",0
"Ms. Battista is not a fair grader. The online quizzes constitute a large portion of your grade; however, they are on material that is not covered or provided. Essentially, you are walking into the dark with no preparation or access to information, while being graded. The only way to do well on these quizzes is through luck.",0
Easiest professor ever! Doesn't want to teach. Cancelled class many times. When we did have class he only kept us for maybe an hour. Tests were like what I had in 8th grade. It's all textbook. Take this class for an easy A. Don't take it to learn.,0
"Prof. Talsma was quite a character! Lots of online homework outside of class. The homework is time consuming and kind of annoying but it helps you learn the material. You HAVE to do the homework to pass. She was fun, helpful, funny, and gives you two ""free"" passes if you miss the homework. Easy grader. Nice. You will do a few presentations.",1
TAKE HER!! Easy A++ and she is really caring about all her students. Classes were not mandatory and her tests were all in the slides. Only 4 tests and the final was optional.,1
Worst professor I've ver had. He doesn't teach and just expects you to know how to do everything. He is also an extremely tough grader and grades all homework on accuracy.,0
"Yes, he really is that bad. His grading criteria still does not make sense to me. His lectures are IMPOSSIBLE to follow (and I attended all but one class). He said himself that he doesn't believe in giving students good grades. A 35/50 on an exam is considered a great score. Take this class at another community college. Save yourself. Not worth it.",0
Kovarik knows his material however is extremely boring to listen to. His test are relevant to what he teaches however takes a lot of studying to pass. He does not explain any of the projects or homework. Everything is a trial and error process and he becomes very upset when you don't understand. I would not recommend and will not take again.,0
We didn't learn anything because we never had lectures. During the 2nd week of classes she said she was canceling all classes for the rest of the semester. She told us we would all get A's as long as we didn't tell the Goodwin administration. Told us if we cared about Bio then we should just read the textbook. Please Goodwin do something about this,0
i called him professor fidel nicastro all semester.  the online homework is terrible.  a lot of memorization cause he doesnt give you the equations you actually need.  huge curve at the end becuase everyone fails.  he gets really pissed off if the class doesnt answer questions so just hope theres someone who knows what they are doing.,0
"Professor Mark is a nice person, a knowledgable businessman. He shares helpful resources to students who need an internship or job. However, he does not pay much attention to the grades. Lectures are inspirational but are not so helpful for the exams. 4 Exam's questions are wordy and illogical like a crossword than comprehension. READ THE BOOK!!!",1
"I took TV production this year and I am learning nothing! Molloy is such a joke for TV and Film. They should call the class, TV production for Dummies. This is a TV, it is square, anything techncal I have no idea how to teach. Talk about a teacher who is crying out for students to like him. Maybe he should change his teaching style and be a so call",0
Edwards is one of those professors who eventually grows on you (after 5ish labs). He teaches Labs and if you are a competent student you will get along. He can be a bit rude sometimes but that is just his humour and you get used to it eventually. Stay on his good side and you will be fine. The only negative is that you have to write lab reports.,1
"Witch in West World is easy once you realize you dont need to do the readings. NO tests/quizzes. Grades come from research projects/presentations that you can do w/o a lot of class knowledge. The topics are interesting, but the readings were so much for a c100 and I got an A w/o doing 90% of em. She helps you improve public speaking tremendously",1
"Professor Getty is passionate about her job as a speech pathologist but when it comes to teaching her students as a professor, she is terrible. The tests are formatted in ways to trick you which makes them extremely difficult and most of the students reflected getting low grades no matter how much studying. Plus just rude in general when asked ?s.",0
"Dr. Kahn does not need to be teaching classes. She obviously has too much going on to be an effective professor. She will not respond to your messages no matter how urgent, she takes at least 3 weeks to grade online exams, and never gets through more than one slide of the material. She lets students be distracting for participation points. Awful",0
"A total jerk in no other sense of the word. In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, Jeffrey required students to record themselves at home taking tests, stated himself he will fail students for typos made, and stated that if you solve a math problem in any way other than what is thought - which is very possible if you use some tutoring  fail",0
"The best professor at Valley College. Infact, she is the best teacher I ever had since grade school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Reading isn't necessary, so you really don't have to put much work into this class for the first half of the semester. However, after that, you have two big research assignments. Requirements are excessive for an elective course and while she is clear about her expectations, they are very high and she will take off points. Follow rubrics closely",0
"Dr. Goldman is a great history teacher. She enjoys having passionate and important discussions about history. Her tests are not difficult, and you don't have to memorize any dates. As long as you follow directions and put in effort, you will get an A.",1
"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",0
"This class is an easy A if you keep up with the work. There's weekly 50 questions exams with 25 questions that are easy to find on Quizlet, & 25 questions that are 10 second samples of random songs from lecture. There's a required jazz concert you have to attend/ write an analytical essay about. There's also a final essay. Easy class if you keep up",1
"I was very apprehensive to take Experimental Psych, but I ended up doing well.  Dr McLaughlin is a fair grader, and good teacher.  I am very glad I took him for this course!",1
"Very intelligent prof! He is very helpful if you do not fully understand something (which happens often in Ethics) He is rather funny at times too! His tests are challenging but if you know the material well and can understand his advanced english in the questions you will do just fine! Lastly, Google him and the Wall Street Journal :)",1
Lyubar was a great professor and gave good feedback on assignments however she takes a while to put in grades after a few weeks. Most assignments are easy with only about two a week. Sometimes she is a little unclear but she responds within a day or two about questions. This is my second time taking a class with her and I hope to do it again.,1
"elizondo is by far THE BEST microbiology/anatomy instructor on campus. Do not be afraid to take her course based on what other students have said. YOU WILL LEARN THE MATERIAL. The class is tough, there is a lot of work, and studying is essential to passing. If your major is biology, your best bet is taking this course with her. don't slack off",1
The worst professor in my entire college career. Like others here I took her Hybrid ACC 240 class in Fall 2019. FOR 3 MONTHS she did not assign hw or do anything!!! She supposedly had technical difficulties and was sick all semester. She belittles the students when we ask for help. Got a C so will have to buy the book AGAIN and retake the class..,0
"Maguire is an old-school teacher.  Is very knowledgeable about the area he is teaching is.  Creates own lecture and does not follow the book.  Explains concepts in a very easy to follow manner, and teaches everything that is on the exams.  Do not miss the class at all, or else you will most likely lose a letter grade on test.  Have taken him twice",1
Allison is one of the worst professors I have ever had in my 4 years of schooling at GVSU. She is very rude and does not give clear explanations on any of the assignments. She is an extremely unfair grader and lectures are painfully boring. The way she teaches is random and unorganized. Do not take this course with her.,0
"She was an amazing teacher. The tests were a little on the tough side, but if you study and take notes you should be fine. ",1
"i don't agree with the last review, his class is beautifully unstructured. there's no standard syllabus, but he makes clear the material to be covered in the course. as long as you generally keep up with the readings, you will be perfectly fine. he explains everything extremely well and is very open to questions. he uploads utube vids, gives notes",1
"She is soooooo funny! (If you take this class you'll understand the reference). I enjoyed her stories and examples of metaphors far more than the textbook content.  She's sassy, open-minded,  and not afraid to express herself which is great for keeping your attention. This ENTIRE class is based off of metaphors. For an easy A, take this class.",1
"By far the worst professor I have had online. She was never understanding about anything. WAY too much reading and studying for each exam. There was too little of a time frame when taking exams, causing me to fail. My emails were never responded to right away, and when they were it seemed she gave ignorant response. I would not take this course!",0
"Prof. has his own textbook which I thought was great because it is almost identical to lectures. The material is pretty similar to psych 1010, with emphasis on certain topics. His tests were easy, but I always thought that his lectures were a bit unstructured and hard to follow (the textbook was my bible). Super nice guy and very accommodating.",1
He is very lecture heavy and moves WAY too fast during his lectures. You're better off learning the material on your own because he explains stuff in the worst ways.,0
"The man does not teach physics, he just shows you how equations are derived and encourages you to ""read your textbook,"" then gives tests which make up 90% of your grade where you mostly just do math. Gives ludicrous amounts of partial credit though.",0
"Martin does NOT follow the syllabus at all. She stopped following it the second week of classes. She cancels class often and does not grade papers on time. It took her way too long to grade three major papers and prompts aren't clear. For the self reflective essay assignment, she didn't assign it until a week before the end of the semester.",0
Good.,1
"Will is super knowledgeable in calculus but he is a really tough grader. His hybrid class didn't have formal exams, but he graded the weekly quizzes super hard which made them hard to pass. He also assigns many writing assignments and labs on top of lectures and weekly HW. He is good at helping 1-on-1 so it's important to visit his office hours.",1
"One of the worst professors I've had. Nothing she talks about in class is on the tests so if you don't memorize the text book, you won't do good on the test. All she talks about is sex because apparently she is a ""sex anthropologist"" -which would be funny if she didn't make the class so hard.",0
Don't bother to take the online class.  You will receive little to no specific or constructive feedback on assignments.  You will do tons of useless busy work.  She will have you write rough drafts that she will not bother to grade or provide feedback on before the final draft of the paper is due. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.,0
"Melissa is the saint of all saints, highly recommend taking her class if at all possible.",1
"Horrible teacher, easy tests. Don't take if you actually want to learn/are a business major.",0
"In lab or out of class, Mr. Dr. Woodard is very nice and approachable. Makes jokes and usually discusses things with you if you have questions/need help. In class, however, can be irritable to a fault and often changes mind about what material we are studying (I.E. changing worksheet for our weekly quiz about five times every week) Lots of writing.",1
"Dr. West is extremely knowledgeable... probably one of the smartest profs ive ever had. Real cool guy, knows his stuff. Tests are all essay and you must read. Only grades are 3 test. The tests are half from the notes and half from the reading material.",1
"Comes off as stereotypical New Yorker, loud, arrogant, and full of himself. This class is pretty much full of applied psychology pseudoscience and the main objective is to make you into a snake oil salesman. The exams are useless as you can simply google the answers. The grading on other assignments is very subjective, simply bow down to score high",0
"First of all, I might say he's EXTREMELY attractive for a professor. Second, for a professor who's still in he really knows how to teach. His lectures are great and he's a really intellectual guy. Presents things clearly. 3 essays, 5 quizzes and 1 final although it takes him awhile to grade things. But they fairly easy if you pay attention in class",1
"Professor Ramamoorthy can be a bit tough to understand at times, due to his accent. However, if you make an effort to communicate and truly understand what he wants from an assignment, it can be much easier. He grades very leniently and is very nice, and understanding. The key is to make sure you communicate with him continuously.",1
"Kim is one of the most laid back teachers I've ever had. She almost always ended class early, and didn't care if you got up and left halfway through class. Lectures were kinda pointless but that's just because WRT150 is kinda pointless in general. Super sweet and makes every student feel special. Definitely one of the best options for this class!",1
"Don't, I repeat, Don't take him. He doesn't care if everyone in his class is failing. He even told us that in a recorded zoom session. He flat out doesn't care. He treats this class like a MBA class--which it isn't. There is an absurd amount of reading and test/quiz over that each week-- 68 class average-RUN!",0
Her tone with the class is very awkward doesn't really connect well with her students. Quizzes are every class period. With the bad flood was forced to miss a class and wasn't allowed to make up work. Very poor teaching methods kinds jumps right in with out giving a strong foundation.,0
"While Sam is a nice guy and pretty funny sometimes, I really didn't like this class/his lecturing style. Don't take this class if you don't like Linguistics, and especially don't take it if you learn better with visual aids because there were no powerpoints at all! Overall, don't take this class if it's just for your distribution",0
"Her lectures are literally slide shows of pictures with no context, she expects you to read lengthy articles that have not assign and then has tests on them.",0
"Worst teacher ever!!! Tough greater, doesnt even teach but expects you to know everything and she will report you if you forget to cite anything. Shes absolutely terrible this lady should be fired, not a teacher at all!",0
"This guy is a donkey. I will never in my life on earth take this class again with him teaching it. He don't offer extra help In lab, you have to beg for it. He make rude comments trying to be funny. The professor takes mechanical pencils way too serious. Can't use regular pencils or pens. There was 6 people remainding out of 30 students. HEART LESS",0
"LOVED her!! She is the sweetest lady. I only took her for BIO lab 118 (for bio 112) but I loved every minute of it. I always found BIO to be so hard, but she made it fun and understandable. I was so sad to see that she wasn't teaching lab for 113! Take her if you can, she is super helpful and an overall good teacher.",1
Dr. Currier was an excellent teacher! I would really recommend her for this class. She wants you to succeed and she makes the class more interesting and manageable.,1
"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",0
"Dr. Noggle was awesome. There were two papers in the semester and two exams. If you go to class and pay attention, you will be fine. I'm not a philosophy major but I'd love to take another class with Dr. Noggle!",1
"He was a great teacher. Had him last minute  because  our teacher got injured in the middle of our semester,  he  did a awesome  job. The whole class loved him.",1
By far the hardest clas I have taken here. So much material is on the exams that it is impossible to remember all of it. He is a good and passionate professor but his class is extremely difficult. If you have to take this class make sure to go to every lecture and take good notes. The tests are only based on the lectures.,1
"She gives you the opportunity to complete most of your papers during class time so you can ask her questions. She gives excellent feedback when you ask her questions and on your rough drafts. She gives you clear instructions, follow them and you will get an A!",1
The best voice professor ever. She transformed my voice. Shes old school and you cant be one of those sensitive types that gets offended over any kind of critique. Pay attention to her critique because she is going to make you a better singer. I absolutely love her! I went from a not so great singer to a powerhouse.,1
"Her lectures consisted almost entirely of reading to us the concepts from the book that were going to be on the test.  Reading them.  Word for word.  And repeating them for those who did not have time to write it down the first time, even though it was right there, in the book.",0
"She is the most amazing teacher, I wih she taught all the science classes. She does everything she can to prepeare us for tests. She;s also very organized and gives us everything ahead of time si if you are lost or not prepared its only your fault. I never liked science in my life but she makes it so enjoyable, I've learned so much!Great teacher!",1
"He isn't the worst professor but his methods of teaching were sort of confusing. I am really good at math but I didn't take the class seriously because it was online. That being said, he made several extensions for assignments and he also did what he had to for us to learn. He could have been more organized, but again it's an online class.",1
"In this class I read an ""article"" of sorts and review a power point twice a week. The power point was super helpful and I probably wouldn't have done well without it. If you put in the work and turn things in on time you should get a good grade.",1
Take him as a last resort.  He wrote the book if that tells you anything.  His lectures are boring and the homework load is sometimes crazy.  The guy could make a paper mill a fortune with all the homework and handouts.  Only the gifted math majors should take him.  He does tend to have favorites.,0
"Professor Miriam Keller-Perkins is a nice teacher, but she doesn't know how to teach. When I take her class, only 1 out of 7 is passing her class. She said she won't fail you if you fail all her tests or quizzes, she will give you a D ( a passing grade). If you want a better grade, I hope you don't take her class ever again.",0
"He is the worst teacher! He claims that attendance is not mandatory but will not post assignments on elearn or tell you through email. He only gives them ""verbally"" so if you happen to miss class, your out of luck and points deducted He makes you do his work, by doing a powerpoint for him so he can teach the class with your work! Lazy awful teacher",0
"Honestly, so much of the assignments were busy work it was frustrating. Much of the quizzes on d2l you can find on google, and the assignments on Cengage felt very repetitive. I really felt like I learned to forget in this class.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS ONLINE CLASS. His readings are too dense and do not go straight through the point, he does not listen to students' complaints nor cares. He tricks you soo much on his quizzes it isn't even funny.",0
Very funny and very cool,1
"While Jeff Marks clearly has a love for Spanish, I had a difficult time learning from him. Nobody asks questions in class because he is intimidating. The way he grades and comments on assignments and papers is somewhat degrading. His tests are extremely hard even after staying up until 5am studying I found myself failing. I wouldn't recommend him.",0
"One of the most terrible lecturers in MIS department. I was forced to take two of his classes, and none of them turn to be a good experience. Extremely unorganized lectures, a lot of workshops and homework. Silly attendance counting method. 100% unrecocommended",0
"I liked Professor Perez and the class is easy enough. But his TA's are super arrogant and very disruptive during lecture. One of the TA's is constantly on her laptop during the lecture. Thankfully I had Brian as a TA, he was tough but his discussions were super helpful.",1
Great professor. She was super helpful and seems passionate about Geology. She tries in different ways for you to not just learn but understand the material she's teaching. She understands students work and are trying to go to school. This was the best science class I've ever taken.,1
"I had him for MKT 356 and 451... you learn a lot from his lectures but his tests are mainly based from the book, which is why they are so rough!!! Overall one of the best professors I've had @ GV!!!!",1
"Easy course as long as you take good lecture notes, keep up with homework and use the handouts he provides for tests. Remember calculator functions because tests will be easy A/B's if you use them. Doesn't answer emails, but answers questions in class and goes over anything you ask.",1
"I had to deal with having to guess what the requirements were for our essays. I barely passed the first one and failed my second one. There wasn't feedback to what could have improved. Her other assignments are simple, and she's nice, but her ways of teaching could REALLY be improved. My main problem was that she didn't properly give instructions.",0
"Stay away from any of her classes as much as you can! I used to wish that I could get hit by a car before going to her class. I cannot urge you enough to stay away from this professor. I may have gotten a decent grade but I had to fight tooth and nail for that. Please, stay away.",0
Dynamics was rough for me. Dustin is the reason I survived. He is able to explain things in a way that make sense to almost anyone. His course layout is the same no matter what class you take. He tells you up front what it takes to pass the class and provides a straightforward way to do it.,1
"Boring, notes are terrible & teacher is arrogant. Also, complains about students missing one class. Do not recommend!!!",0
"He's an amazing person and extremely funny! If you ever get the chance, take his class. Its almost impossible to not get an A. He assigns homework but I never did it b/c its not graded. There are only two tests and he lets you use a dictionary. He likes to joke and makes coming to class fun. TAKE HIM IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN EASY HUMANITIES!",1
"Alison is a force to be reckoned with.  She is the sole reason I am a success today.  Her course is very intense and time-consuming.   The goal of her class is, to make you as a student, ready for the intensity of NCCC's nursing program and I promise you, you'll thank her one day. She cares! So put on your big kid pants, and work for it:)",1
Great teacher. Extremely helpful and super energetic. She enjoys teaching and it shows. She doesn't like late work .  Show up to class because that's where most of her assignments are given and completed,1
"Very challenging class because it require you to think in new philosophical ways.  Their are many challenging readings that require deep personal thought.  In class discussions are very crazy, exhausting, but on a strange level enjoyable once you finally are able to make the connection",1
"Even if you have to move your whole schedule around to take Dr. B, DO IT. IT'S WORTH IT. Such a great guy, more than willing to work with you if you put in the work too. Even for an honors class, it was pretty easy because he explains everything thoroughly and gives you plenty of time to complete assignments. I cannot recommend him enough.",1
Orgo at TU is a great way to screw yourself. At this point you can take it with anyone because there is an equally likely chance you will get screwed. Jasmin can be pretentious in class to the point where asking questions are not even worth it. He makes up for this by being somewhat approachable in office hours. Average professor.,1
"she is very nice and helpful. At first, I thought she must be very hard, but actually she is super nice~!!",1
"His tests were almost impossible unless you reallllly understand Physics.  If you made a 7.5/15 on the test, you had a A.  The stuff on the tests isn't covered in class.  I would recommend taking someone else!  He is very smart however...too smart to teach a general physics class.  Has awards in nuclear physics, etc.",1
"Professor Hutton was a very tough grader, It was very hard to fix what she wanted on the rubric because she was not very specific on what she wanted she also quizzes you on what she likes. (EDU 104)",0
following notes on board is very tough. a lot of chicken scratch. grades tests hard. assignments are never clear as to when they are due or what needs to be done.,0
"If you don't go to class you will not pass the tests. Lectures and content is easy, it's just the listening part on tests that is what kills you. Very clear about expectations from the start, nice guy but comes off as kinda arrogant. Hard class to have as an 8am. Bring coffee or find a different time.",0
"This was the most disorganized course I have taken. Prof Lai did not teach the material well. He often talked about topics but did not explain the theory or solve any problems. The textbook chosen was also terrible, and did a poor job of explaining topics. He tries to make the course easy by giving lots of hints, but you end learning nothing.",0
"Heyborne is great! He's clear, concise, and clearly loves biology. What I didn't like about the class was it was so short, because 14 classes is not enough time to learn. The work assigned was mostly written, he honestly corrected the grammar more than any English professor I have ever known, with less focus on the actual biology concept.",1
"I cannot recall a time when we even used the book; because we didn't-- WASTE of money! Check it out of the library like I did and keep renewing it!! All of his tests are essays, no matter which class you take. Just be a deligent students and you will do well. And, do GREAT papers otherwise suffer the consequences of a bad 20% portion of your grade!",0
"I had a three hour into business class with him and it was a pain to sit through. He likes to tell a lot of uninteresting and off-topic stories. He does offer a lot of extra credit clicker questions, but they seem to be just because our class struggles. Very unorganized, and it's unlikely to hear back from him within the week if you send an email.",0
"His class was easy and had a routine schedule. It was easy to keep track of assignments. Quizzes and discussions are due on Sunday nights, but you have all week to do them.",1
"I thought Prof. Grant was going to be hard based on these ratings but she tried real hard as this year we had this COVID-19 and moved everything online. If you are really nice to here and willing to come for help, she WILL definitely help you one on one. I thought I was going to fail mid-semester but I bounced back and passed the class when helped.",1
"Makes you work for grade but very easy to contact, clear methods. Lots of assignments over all but helps you understand the lessons. 4 oral presentations, quizes after every chapter and tests. Some group tests. Go to class and do the homework. Very nice and very understanding",1
"Just don't. The first day of class he'll tell you that his passing rate is very low. I thought I would be ok as math is my favorite subject.. but no. You're not learning how to do the actual math here, he gets frustrated easy when there's too many questions because he goes so fast and doesn't make sense. uses a horrible textbook that hardly helps",0
I am absolutely not interested in Biology. I realized a month into the class I was naturally tuning him out. Curves & extra credit is how I achieved a B. Overall a polite & funny guy that gets the struggle is real; occasionally veers off course on a random tangent that is quite entertaining. Read the chapter Show up Take notes STUDY Ask questions.,1
"This class is a waste of my time. The book he uses is biased, as is he. You go to class so he can tell you exactly what you read in the book the night before. He is disorganized and never really seems to know what is going on...nice man, though.",0
Well so far the notes don't really match up with the test. Its as if he wants you to master all the info for every test. The book does not seem to help. The average for exam 1 was just above 70...most ppl I talked to made in the 50's... vary hard class lets hope it ends well...only take if you really really need to.,0
First of all its hard to understand what she is trying to say because her English isnt very good. She makes things harder than they needed to be. Yes she lets you use all your notes and past homework on exams but they are not helpful at all,0
"His accent is extremely hard to understand. I understand he is extremely smart and willing to help, he just doesn't understand how to teach or interact with the students. He has his back to the class almost the whole time writing problems on the board. It is extremely hard to pay attention and I would recommend finding another professor.",0
"He is one of the best law professor i've had at CSUN. Though I am a mkt major, I took BLAW 450 as an elective. Best decision i ever made. Not only was it interesting but it was also a breeze. Do all the readings ahead of class and listen to lectures and you will be fine. Take good notes since test are open. Read each question carefully!",1
"Professor Vonderscheer gives excellent feedback. During the German conversation voice chats, she adapted the difficulty to challenge me as a student and facilitate learning. The course structure was clear and the course materials were helpful. She is a caring and intelligent professor. I highly recommend her for German courses.",1
"He come across a little too laid back at first and as a result is hard to take seriously until you start getting bad grades. He does however care and will offer you plenty of extra credit assignments if he can see that you are trying and a good student. Take him seriously, if you don't, don't be chocked when you get a 'D' or an 'F'.",1
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
"Do not take this class if not necessary. I got the lowest grade so far from it. It is an interesting class, but exams and the research project are super hard. I learned a lot about psychology, and also learned that I am not that kind of superman who can handle all kind of classes.",1
I loved taking intro to comparative with Paler so I took her upper level. She is very passionate about the course matter but her expectations are too high. Expect 80-100 pages of reading per class. Gives pop quizzes which were unreasonably specific but you got 5 points just for being there. She values participation but it isnt always easy to do so,1
He is very strict.But he is a person who makes every effort to help their students. He has great patience and excellent pedagogy. I have learned a lot even though I have a condition such as attention deficit. Prepare your class well.,1
"I feel as if she leaves out information, does not have anything organized. Majority of the class dropped due to the lack of information presented. Take if you want to stress over tests that she created to purposely fail you. You get three exams and a final. You do get test cheat sheets but be aware as she does not specify, Its a lot, she's petty.",0
"He is the best teacher for students who want to study. He is smart and funny. He wants to help students, easy to talk or ask questions. I learn a lot from his class. It's not an easy class, but you will learn a lot. His passionate on teaching inspires me sometimes.",1
"Absolutely the worst course I have had. She makes the course and the material unnecessarily complicated. If it wasn't for the TA, I would have failed the class. Attending her lectures were the worst hours I spent on campus. She writes on a blackboard and her handwriting is just way too difficult to read and goes too fast. Take ECON3110 instead.",0
"One of the most sweetest professors ever! She really cares about you and is willing to help you on whatever you need. The labs were super easy and the only homework there was were lab reports and weekly quizzes that you could take up to 3 times. The class can feel like it's dragging at times, but it's worth it if you need a GPA booster.",1
Excellent Teacher! Final was overwhelming. Too much expected to learn and know at the last minute.,1
Professor Reynolds grading is very tough!,0
"She will take advantage of times when she knows students aren't going to do well and will have a quiz then (middle of midterms, day before/after reading week) which most professors are nice enough to not do, calls students dumb, does not give me help whenever I ask. She doesn't seem to want students to succeed",0
Group projects account for 40% of the total class grade. The first project takes about 2 weeks to finish and is insanely long.  This class isn't hard but has a ton of busy work.  Teacher gives very little feedback and the syllabus is confusing when describing assignments.  Teacher doesn't add to discussion posts at all.,0
"While he understands the material well and explains it ok, Kearns is unapproachable outside of class in is very unhelpful if you have questions on your project grades.  Good course but he is very unhelpful.",0
"All of the comments that say he's tough are not a joke. I didn't think this class would be too difficult since it is a review of FR601 and FR611, but I was wrong. Josh is tough. I know I improved a lot, and he is really good at making things make sense, but if you aren't willing to put in the work, I would consider taking someone else.",1
"Course grade was based on 2-4 LearnSmart assignments due right before each lecture, a community service project, some in-class assignments, and three (easy) exams. Lectures are online, but her explanations clarify the material. She isn't the most lively professor (probably cause she was at the end of her pregnancy this semester), but she's sweet.",1
"Leidig has many years of IT management experience, and brings a lot of interesting stories to explain what is happening in IT today. Very interesting topics. I heard I wouldn't like the class because the exams were extreme, but the midterm wasn't that bad, and the class really makes me think about my career in IT. I like the novels used in class",1
I was walking through MAK Hall after my MTH 097 class (we just learned how to use rulers that day--cool!) when this professor yelled at me from his classroom and asked what we do with the hypothesis when we're negating a conditional statement. How the heck should I know? I still don't know how to add fractions! Found out it was Fishback. Scary!,0
"Not really a cinema class, more of a study on social cultures and politics' effect on movies made worldwide. Some movies were genuinely a bore to watch but some were great films I wouldn't have seen otherwise. I made it through the essays, group presentation, and quizzes with only seeing 3/16 movies. The lectures were very boring as well.",0
"He is a great guy, and always makes jokes or has anecdotes that are relevant. The exams are a little tough, but they are directly from the powerpoint slides. He does not grade three questions of your choosing and does curve. Best professor for 306.",1
He tells a lot of stories that I think take away from what we are learning. To be honest I medically withdrew and I didn't want to do the work. I'm sure if you put in the work you'll be fine.,1
"Dr. Ayadi is a really nice professor. She tries to make the material understandable for everyone and always available for questions. If you participate and do the work, you'll be fine in her class.",1
"I don't know why all physics professors aren't like him. He is very practical. He knows what students should learn. After this class, finally I am able to relate physics with my daily life. His Grading is very clear and easy if you follow all of his lecture. Exams aren't that tricky, mostly from homework. Definitely recommend him.",1
Dr. Allison is amazing and extremely funny; if you take this class get ready for TONS of group projects. He is very caring and knows a lot about special education.,1
laid back. his lectures are hysterical.,0
Took a class on social movements with her and had a great experience over all. Each class was based around discussions about assigned readings along with two weekly reading logs. There are multiple 4-7 page papers leading up to a final project but you are given ample time to complete it. Maria is awesome so as long as you do the work you will pass.,1
"Dr. Markham makes this class harder than it needs to be. She is extremely intelligent, but she isn't a very compassionate teacher. I was scared to ask questions because she would make people feel dumb if they did. Tests are extremely difficult, but final was manageable. Easy course material but very difficult with this professor.",1
"Dr. Kosnik is terrific! The class was fun and interesting. 2 tests, a final exam, and 2 concert reviews that everyone got A's on. I never cracked the textbook, and I got A's on all the tests. The lectures covered everything we would have read. Also, Dr. Kosnik is an amazing pianist, and he does demonstrations on the piano during class. Great class!",1
not a fair grader. there is no partial credit. you can work as hard as hard as you want and he always throws wrenches into his tests. very upsetting when I get test back and IT WAS GRADED LOWER THAN EXPECTED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND,0
"if you want to get a good grade in CHM 230 do NOT take this professor. His lectures are done entirely on the white board and he goes back and forth in his explanations of things, making it super hard to understand. He is also the only chem professor who gives fill in the blank EXAMS. had to retake",0
"He's amazing!  I do agree that he goes really fast, but he's super cool. Going to class is imperative, and his notes are critical for his exams.  Best way to study for the class is by reviewing the notes and understanding them well.  Go to office hours!!!",1
"Such a great professor! Start on hw 2 and study for test 2 ahead of time, they were the most challenging. Get to know him, he's super knowledgeable and friendly! Study the ppts and practice questions (not too long) to study for the exams! It's a more memory based class than anything but I didn't feel overwhelemed often!",1
"Professor Liu was one of my favorite professors at BC. She was very organized and clear with her expectations. Each week, you will be asked to write a long discussion post and take a 10 question quiz so be prepared! She is caring and she wants you to do the best in her class. She also provides EC throughout the class. I hope you enjoy her class!",1
"He keeps the lectures entertaining. Can't really say to much about his grading-- he uses TAs. Ended up with a C+ in the class, but I hate Shakespeare. So, don't take if you're not even remotely interested in the subject.",0
Incredible professor! This is my second time having Dr. Cap and he never fails you! He is so caring and willing to help. If you're struggling on a topic visit his office and he will have hundreds of other ways to explain a concept. His lectures are straight to the point and so easy to follow with his textbook. He really cares about his students.,1
"I took Mrs. Dushman for a lab course, she would lecture for a long time and it would be confusing to understand the course material.",0
She is nice and funny but doesnt email back if you email her.  sent multiple emails and still waiting to recieve a response....,0
He literally expects you to understand the readings like that... He doesn't;t explain well in his lecture video he gives out... he uses words that are highly unintelligible & expects us to write ESSAYS EVERY DAY about the lectures most of us are so unaware of! Super disappointed because I expected to have another professor to have but I'm done.,0
Cool professor very likeable,1
Profesora Luna is literally a sweetheart teacher! Makes you feel comfortable learning the language. Definitely the best Spanish teacher Ive had! You have to take her or else youre literally missing out!,1
"Straight Up Awesoem Dude, made learning fun!!!",1
"just dont waste your time, the good reviews are outdated, its time for him to retire, he does not know how to teach an online class. The class feels like a punishment . never answers emails and has always seems like he doesn't know what's going on",0
"DO NOT TAKE, she is a tough grader and I did not enjoy this course at all. Reports students to honor council for collaborating with group members THAT SHE ASSIGNED. Sucks that my hardest class this year is a gen ed when im also taking chemistry and micro economics.",0
"It's nerve wracking that your only grade is 3 exams, but it's easy to get an A. If you take good notes during lecture and memorize them using graphs and knowing how to explain concepts you'll be fine. He grades based on how the rest of the class does, and there were a few kids that get 5 out of 30's on exams. 20 to 23 out of 30 per exam is an A",1
She is a very poor professor. Gives very little feedback; if any. She does not clearly outline what is expected from your work. Does not respond to any messages. Does whatever is easiest for herself. BEWARE she rates herself positively on here to make students believe they are taking a good class and will learn something from her!,0
"I graduated in 1979! I am so happy to see the good Dr. is still passing on his knowledge to Elon students.  I still value what I learned from him.  Now that I teach British lit. to seniors in high school, I get to pass on that love of British lit to others.  You are awesome, Br. Blake!",1
"He is a nice guy and willing to work with you but it is an extremely hard class and unless your are wanting to do a ton of studying/homework, I would not recommend this class.",1
"I didn't enjoy this class. It might be because it was completely asynchronous this year, meaning there were no zooms, just videos of her reading powerpoint slides uploaded to Canvas twice a week and assigned readings and homework. I found the lecture videos boring and unnecessarily long. Maybe she's great in person but online this class wasn't good",0
I love Spaulding!  One of the best classes I've taken at UDel.  Very thought-provoking and extremely interesing.,1
worst anthro prof at wcu. do not take. lecture heavy and makes you read a ton of boring books then doesn't even discuss them in class,0
Funny guy & easy class,1
"This was a super boring, but incredibly easy class. Mr. Franks gets off topic a TON and tends to repeat himself quite frequently because he forgets which class he told stuff to. Had 4 tests and 2 papers, class is an easy A. You can also get 5 points extra credit on every test, which is awesome.",1
"JD rocks!  Everyone should have him as a teacher at least once.  He is very nice and compassionate..all around a wonderful guy.  He gives awesome lectures and only teaches material you will use.  He doesn't waste time with busy work, the assignments assigned are for a reason. I hope to have him as a teacher in my graduate studies!  Great job JD!!",1
Worse teacher i've ever had he is not clear with his assignments he teaches one time for each chapter and the next class we move on to the next chapter the week that we have chapter 5 test he teaches for chapter 6 which is confusing he does not help at all never get responds from the emails ive sent he is not a helping or understanding professor.,0
"Mr. Hoover's 1020 was great. He's very patient, and will go over the material until you understand it. Always gives extra credit for the exams. He also goes over most of the homework. There's no reason to fail his class.",1
Maher was not organized in his lectures. He would include irrelevant material in his lectures that would not be on his exams. He gave tests that included essays and definitions that were ridiculous. He was not clear when asked what he was looking for in the essays. The only way to pass is the attend each class and take notes over everything he says,0
"I've taken many classes at UD, but this is the only one that's been a complete trainwreck. I have a bit of empathy because covid, but lectures are disorganized and assignments are unclear. The timelines are aggressive, we had a midterm followed by a homework and programming assignment all due within 5 days, only plus being deadlines are flexible",0
"Cool Professor, he's fair and helpful. Has an accent but he's still clear and easy to understand. Group projects, Lots of HW, and 2 exams (mid term and final) which are somewhat difficult. Only annoying this is his grading scale. ex. 93% is an A- rather than the standard 90% being an A-.",1
Loved his class. Do yourself a favor and take this class,1
"In reality he doesn't teach, he doesn't help with homework, doesn't even understand half of the homework he assigns. What ever you do, DO NOT take his class",0
She will teach you all of what you need to learn and know in Eng9293 class. She will encourage and guide you to be able to write an essay of your best. The class was very fun for me. I like this class. I suggest you to take her class.. :D,1
DO NOT take this teacher. He treated me so bad and it was only my first semester. He blamed me for his mistakes countless of times and had always called me out for mistakes he made on my page.  i have never disliked a teacher so much in my entire life. & i wouldn't want any one to be put in this class.,0
"Horrible teacher, don't take him EVER, don't take burgis either, they both suck.  He is worse, I guess. YOU WON'T LEARN A THING, waste of money even if yoiur parents are paying.   I can't tell you how terrible his teaching is and this is coming from a teacher.",0
Learn the programs bert,0
"Nice man, but the lectures are mostly him reading straight from the PPT, so you end up teaching yourself. Every chapter is usually 120 slides long, so if you do listen to lectures, it takes a while bcuz you're constantly pausing. Office hours were online only, which is hard in a math based course. I'd only take online again if i had no other class",1
Didn't have a great experience with Prof Watts. He grades pretty tough as I would try my best but never could get anything over a B. The compositions and oral exams were graded in a way that you cannot make mistakes if you want an A. Nothing we did furthered my learning in the class. Waits months to put grades into BB & isn't good at emails.,0
she is a really good teacher. she cares about her students. and i received an over-100%-A!,1
"From experience, I highly suggest taking someone else. Eileen is very rude and humiliating to her students in class. It's happened various times during the term I took it. She doesn't know what she's doing half the time and she doesn't help you, she insults you when you don't know something. Shame MDC doesn't have another Opera Works. professor.",0
"Very knowledgeable and loves what she does! However, she is a very hard grader. She is very willing to help and answer questions. It is much easier to pass if you ask for help and take advantage of extra credit opportunities.",1
Hes super cool. Great funny teacher. Hes very chill especially with assignments. Wish i got to take his class in person but it was still fun online.,1
"I regret going to class everyday. If this is a gen ed for you, don't take it. He goes off on tangents in lecture, and never sit front row. Reading the book is the only way to pass the exams.",0
one of the hardest classes ive ever taken in my life. he is no help at all and will rip you apart if you make a mistake. he may be a very smart man but just dont take him,0
"This is the worst History professor that I have met so far! she thinks that her class is the only one that we take during the semester, and make you read a lot for every single class. Avoid her at any cost!!",0
"This professor took long to get things graded and when you ask him about it he will blame it on his TA who you will never meet and does not even live in the same state. He will also not care about your grades. If he doesn't grade something right the first time, he never will. He will respond to emails but they are likely not helpful.",0
I have this class as a requirement and is hard she gives lots to study over the weeks and when you try to contact her she misses you or not respond. I wouldn't take her at all get another class people. Most of the work is online but if you don't pass the test in person forget it.,0
"I agree that the student who complained about this prof is angry because he is failing and the course is difficult. Should he even be at WSU? This is one of the best courses at WSU. I've never been exposed to this material before, which is why it is the best course. You learn a lot. If you get a good grade, you have earned it. Thanks Professor.",1
"Don't be so hard on yourself when you get a bad test grade from Heather, she grades her test very harshly. All I would recommend is study her power points, and take a deep breath before and during the exams.",0
"What an unbelievably disappointing class. She bases the entire course on class discussion, yet has us sit in lecture-style rows and talks for 75% of the ""discussion."" She's very easy, just don't come in hoping to learn anything like I did.",0
"Clear explanations and lots of enthusiasm for the content. Notes are not posted online, and not everything in the textbook is used or relevant to the course content. You must attend lectures to do well, but if you do attend you will have no problems getting a good grade in the class.",1
"Professor Schleiniger prefers doing a great deal of proofs to illustrate points. Office hours were helpful, but typically contained a few other people as well, so I found it difficult to get all my questions answered. (Bi)weekly homework, moderately tough exams. Overall, he's a kind and patient professor, but this was undoubtedly my hardest class.",1
Awesome professor. Was very helpful not only in class but also during office hours.,1
"I originally signed up for an Econ elective, figuring that Energy Econ couldn't be too difficult. Boy was I wrong. Prof Schwarz is a ridiculously tough grader and provides WAY too much information in the lectures/powerpoints. It's hard to pinpoint what to study for highly weighted exams. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you love to struggle",0
"Took an online composition class with him, quick 6 week course. Seemed nice enough when I had to email him but didn't follow syllabus well. If you can do your own research to understand the readings you'll do fine. Most assignments were graded just for participation so it's easy enough to pass if you just do the work and follow his instructions.",1
"Denny was a really nice guy, not a great prof. He only reads from powerpoints and goes off on tangents. He only has three exams (but you can opt-out of the final if you miss two or fewer classes) and a group project. His blackboard was especially unhelpful. He expects you to read the book for most of the information. Exams were fairly easy though.",0
"The WORST professor I have ever had. I would give her a 0 if it was an option. Some of the questions on the exam we haven't even covered yet. Homework is online, and we only get 3 tries for each problem. Doesn't give extra credit, a tough grader, and never answers emails. Please just DON'T take this class if you want a good grade.",0
Russo isn't very helpful. She takes a very long time to get back to you when you e-mail her and if you go in to see her for help she blames you for not understanding the material. In lecture she repeats herself over the same problem over and over. It's very repetitive. ,0
"Lacks a presence on husky ct like other professors, but compensates with his clarity and devotion to the students. He likes to have fun and is a great lecturer. No homework, not necessary to get the textbook, but can help clear up any confusion.",1
Best teacher you will have for this course.,1
Professor Z is a good teacher but this class is definitely not an easy A. She is a harsh grader and can sometimes be too harsh of a grader. Do not take her course if you don't want to put the work in. I had an A for pretty much the entire semester but then it went down to a B because she started grading harder. Do not take her!,0
she was a hard and confusing professor,1
Dr. Rogers made lectures interesting and was a super fair marker! He made physics (super boring and required) actually interesting. Would reccomend any of his courses!!,1
Awful teacher all around. Confusing lectures and very little enthusiasm.,0
"You will have to: A: Learn all material on your own, her lectures are not helpful, also a strong accent. B: Memorize the entire Calender: Her online scheduling is bad C: Not have any issues, Her email response rate is poor. D: Have the patience to do this for an entire semester, while worrying about your grade. Just find a new teacher.",0
"Dr. Mike has clear lectures and is very humorous. He is always ready to help in the Physics Help Room. He can get frustrated if you don't understand the material right away, but overall he is a good teacher. EXAMS ARE HARD.",1
Dr. Crawley is a great guy and professor but at times goes off topic during lectures which makes them hard to follow. You are expected to read the assigned pages from the textbook prior to class and will have a quiz on the readings every class. This does help retain the material and assure that you are keeping up to pace. Don't miss class!,1
"Don't take her if it is just for an elective. She does NOT respond to emails, and quite frankly it seems like she puts no effort into the course. There are weekly quizzes that are graded by BlackBoard, and the things she has to grade herself she has not graded in over 1.5 months. Absolutely horrible for an online setting.",0
"Kyle is the most dry prof I have ever had. He just reads directly off of a powerpoint slide the whole time and sometimes gets off topic with random rants that are irrelevant. I fall asleep during his class. The whole class is just tests, no assignments. All you need to do is look through the textbooks on your own time, and you are better off!",0
Good Professor. Really nice and encouraging teacher. Class moves along at an enjoyable but swift pace.,1
"People give this guy a bad rep, but I liked him as a person. He didn't make sense sometimes/rambled a lot but if you needed help, he would help right away. Most freshman aren't used to how profs teach so they just complain instead of actually trying. Never took calc before and got  a B+ just by working my butt off. Math is never easy to teach!!",1
He is an overall nice guy. He is very clear during lectures and cares about his students.,1
"All the class is about the tests, but requires homework and turning in scratch paper from all assignments. No real in class instruction.",0
"He is not online class material. The professor grades hard, gives unhelpful critique, and is hardly present out of class. He gives no space for exploration or mistakes in an open-ended and nerve-wracking speech class. He fails to accommodate. He will grade you unfairly when the reality is that he cannot be bothered, and less so during COVID times.",0
"Wouldnt suggest him. Very absent minded and unprepared for class. Also pretty unclear about what he expects for case studies and other projects, which makes the class way more challenging than necessary",0
Was not a fan. I do not request him.,0
I hated this class. I didn't like the professor. I love History and Paulette genuinely made me dislike it. I did my homework but for some reason she failed me. She didn't grade a paper and she said she wouldn't give me anymore chances. Her lectures were boring and not at all helpful for the tests. Avoid her!,0
"Luallen is by far the most difficult professor I've had at Tufts. Although he is a really nice guy who clearly enjoys teaching economics, he prides himself on being the most difficult teacher for the course and his tests are very challenging. I would definitely not recommend taking his section of microeconomics.",1
Susan is AMAZING. She has so much knowledge on the sect of pre-production and she makes every class fun and interesting. She will help you if you take inititive and ask! She helped me a ton. Best professor I probably will ever have!,1
"This is my first review on this site. The professor was THAT awful. Take my word for it and DO NOT take this professor. If you are thinking of dropping his class DO IT NOW, I regret not doing it. He's awful at teaching to be frank. He does not explain the topics well. He will write out answers without showing steps or explaining the foundation.",0
"Lectures are long and terrible. She gives no guidance, she just flies through them leaving little room for anyone to even comprehend what the heck she's doing.  She also gives NEW material for the test on ""review day"". Her tests are hard. Don't expect any kind of extra credit or help with your grades. FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER. ",0
"I found the class to be quite interesting and informative.  All the suff you need to know for the -=TESTS=- are found in his lectures and videos that you watch in class.  He gives you 10 essays questions to study, 3 on the test, you pick 2.  Quizzes come from guides.  Great discussion if the students want it, He knows an amazign amout about Vietnam",1
She is an easy A if you keep up with the homework and it's not over the top. Highly recommended. This course made me want to take other music classes.,1
"Dr. David G. Schuster gives awesome lectures. He is very passionate about the subject he teaches which makes the class all that more interesting. Only takes grades on four papers and two exams. Exams are all essay, so break out your pen.",1
His tests are very interesting as they're only short answer as in a few words and he really doesn't give much feedback because you don't see what you got wrong on the test and only post the marks,1
"Dr. Hwang is not the greatest professor. He speaks very broken English and is condescending towards many students because their beliefs differ from his. He spends most of the time lecturing about material that is not even on his tests. I would show up though, he sometimes gives extra credit to those who show up.",0
"Three hours of her going over everything you learned in lecture. Not a lot of hand on stuff, mainly just listening to her talk and not understand any of it. Young more tech savvy version of Palitinus.",0
"He is totally useless. Plain and simple. I never solves the examples, just gives you the formula then the answer and says solve it after class. Completely useless, worst professor I've had in all my three years.",0
"I wouldn't really recommend him because he has a thick accent and made it really hard to understand him a lot. Plus the material was really dry and he couldn't engage our class a lot. There literally was no sound in our class, just him talking. Take someone else!",0
"Tough in everything! Does not give extra credit He does not explain everything that he wants on the scientific article review and when you send it in he sends back the feedback then telling you what you were supposed to do. Would not recommend anyone to take this course, take this course with another professor please!!!",0
"Tests and section are the only grades you get, so attending lecture is a must. I never touched my book and got an A. He's a very passionate and funny professor, I love listening to him. A. I looked forward to his lectures every day. It also doesn't hurt that he's a total zaddy.",1
"She was a nice lady and the class was easy, but many assignments seemed kind of pointless. They didn't add to the understanding of the subject.",1
"Professor Hart was very scattered.  She never showed up to class on time.  She would make up our assignments during class, and would change topics frequently.  There was a lot of reading assignments and discussions involved.  Many small assignments could help your grade if you knew what she wanted.  A long paper was the bulk of your grade.",0
"She is possibly one of the best professors at SJSU for Public Health. She is so passionate about the subject and really goes out of the way to make sure everyone understands the material. Exams are heavy and are a huge portion of your grade, so study, study, and study more. If you have any questions, she will always be happy to answer it!",1
"I will never understand how such easy material can be presented through a course in such a difficult manner. Non-test takers beware, tests are worth 50% of your grade with no extra credit and webcam mandated. Every ""almost 4.0 student"" has that one class that dropped there perfect score... this is it. Proceed with caution.",0
"He takes time to ensure students are understanding the concepts, formulas and logic by giving as many examples as possible. He gives clear guidelines to follow and enough practice before students sit for an exam. He is highly skilled and teaches professionally. He is an Asset to Chattahoochee Tech and I recommend him highly to future students.",1
"This professor is very strict. He doesn't allow leaving the lecture hall during his lecture, unless you are leaving the class. He seems to get extremely frustrated when his lecture is interrupted by a question from one of his students and gives very short, harsh answers. There is no discussion or participation in class.",0
"He's a great lecturer. The hardest part about the class was finishing the tests in 50 minutes. The questions aren't tricky, just long. He gives a lot of partial credit though, so if you can get through the homework you should be able to pass pretty easily.",1
"He is a terrible professor. He is very knowledgeable in his field, but he can't relate it to students and his wife is at every class period and she is not useful at all.",0
"Brunner is a good teacher, but has a strong Republican Bias which sometimes shows in his teaching. Show up to class and take notes, and make sure to ask questions because they benefit your grade at the end of the year. Do the online practice tests he gives at least once a day before the test to retain most of the random material he tests on.",1
honestly he is super nice and he tries really hard to keep everyone engaged. He provided a 15 minute break for the class and most of the time ended with a video he wanted us to see. The tests were pretty fair but your screwed if you don't come to class. He asks random questions based on in lecture material.,1
"His class was a joke, the books he gave in the class were barely used. It was not worth buying them at all.  I would not recommend anyone take his class.",0
"Took his for Phys 2211. This class is a tough class, however, this professor makes it much tougher. There are only 3 Tests (60%), Homework (10%), and the Final (30%). The tests only have 3 questions which are extremely hard.  I beg you, do not take this professor. Wait a semester if you have to. Pick ANYONE else.",0
She was not all that clear when explaining material. You could not study for her exams because she would not tell you what to study and her tests were confusing.,0
Prof. Shine is a good professor. Hes very knowledgeable and understanding. His lectures are difficult because most of the time he will go off topic then switch back to the topic. Its nice to have the option to redo your midterm until youre happy but its tough when you dont know whats going on. Lost interest quick due to confusion.,0
"Avoid this class if its not mandatory. Assigned useless papers, took an easy class and made it as hard as possible. Would never recommend :/",0
"Brilliant man, witty, real, & makes you think. he knows when students aren't trying, don't patronize him, or waste his time.. he cares a lot about whether or not his students care. if you take good notes, and pay attention you don't need the book, he is really thorough. Don't text, go late or leave early. It's just rude and clearly bothers him.",1
"Extremely long, boring and repetitive lectures... multiple people fell asleep during class. Comes across as very arrogantobnoxious and sounds like a James Bond villain. Avoid this class!",0
She knows what she is talking about but cannot explain it to students. She will ask questions in class and then make a fool out of anyone whose answer is not 100% correct. The projects are extremely difficult. When I took the class it started with about 1,0
"Really great professor, and is straight forward when it comes to tests and assignments. Must come to class or will miss out on assignments, when tests are due or test review days. If you pay attention to her lectures than will get a passing grade in class.",1
"Well-paced in lectures, and has excellent control of the audience. He's very organized, although he could've done a bit more to keep the class interesting in discrete Fourier transform. That sucked. Excellent prof, but the EXAM WAS DIFFICULT!! And did I mention the exam was difficult??",1
YEA WHAT THEY SAID !,0
Best math teacher I ever had. I wish he could have taught all of my math courses. He explains things thoroughly. His pace isn't too fast or too slow. And he adds a touch of humor to lectures. Also his voice is very calm and soothing. He make himself accessible outside of class. Only con is that he doesn't give great feedback online. go to office hr,1
The class is a great experience but I find the Professor to be very condescending. He likes to belittle students. The quizzes are very hard read the chapters that are assigned.,0
"I took this class over the summer for transfer credits, and it was my worst experience so far. I learned absolutely nothing. There are no video lectures, no powerpoints, no anything, just a syllabus that guides you with what chapters to read. Weekly 2-3 page writing assignments, 2 take home tests. didnt read textbook at all except for definitions.",0
"Do not ask for help, you will not get it. (Even if your in the hospital for the entire first week of class). Dropped and took it at ICC, got an A.",0
It was her first time teaching here in Queens College. Avoid her by all means. In the beginning there were almost 30 people in the class and then after a few weeks there were about half left. Get ready to read a lot. Heavy heavy stuff. Honestly doesn't know how to teach well.,0
"Material was straight forward, doesn't assign much work and the work is fairly simple. Very lenient professor, would definitely take her again.",1
"Nice guy, assigns way too much reading, helped me a lot on the research paper, will work with you",1
I took this class online while living in the AV. It's a very difficult class that you HAVE to stay on top of and make sure you understand. The tests are online as well but you are required to go to the lab to take them. The class work is very time consuming so make sure you have the time.,1
"Overall, he teaches everything straight from the book so really you teach yourself, but everything is online, quizzes, homework, tests. You have three tries on the homework and then all of the quiz and test questions come literally right from the homework. So as long as you do the homework youre fine. Really not that bad of a class.",0
"This rude lady suck! Half of the class dont understand her ""English"". You wont know what you do in class. Give you suprise that she never taught you in class during final exam. GRADE STUDENT ON HER PREFERENCE.",0
run...,0
Only take this class if you are asking to add a failing grade to your transcript. The most disrespectful and rude professor I have ever had. Not willing to help his students succeed whats so ever.,0
I'm taking Dr Mukherjee for Calc 2 and he is one the worst professors I could ever have. Only 1 week left in this class. He doesn't offer to help students and never goes over homework or tests so you wont know what the answers are for exams. Blames students for not knowing certain material and he wont teach students. I'll never take him again��,0
"I think he's impossible. After four years of honors highschool math and the honors program at college, I'm struggling terribly in his class. He moves fast. The quizzes are fair but the tests are incomprehensible and unrealistic. Students are dropping out rapidly in Calc II. Maybe he's easy in the other classes but not in this one.",0
"Dylan Shields was totally cool.  If you're serious about becoming successful in the movie business, this is a great professor for you.  He brought in a lot of guests from studios and the real world of filmmaking.  VERY COOL.",1
"I have seen a lot of positive post about Professor Trant and I guess I will be the one to say he was difficult to get in touch with, a harsh grader, and overall does not care whether you pass or not. I took this class online and when I asked him a question about the assignment, he stated ""google it"". Do not recommend.",0
"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",0
I recommend not taking her.,0
Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce prof enseingne encore. il est vraiment sans compétance aucune... oh qu'il est médiocre ce type ....,0
"Ignore the rating beforehand. Deadlines are all on math lab, why would you ""expect"" extended deadlines? She provides you with power points, my mathlab, and is literally always there to help. Open notes on everything, in exchange for hw you can legit complete in class. I got an A and it was the best class I've ever taken, she cares.",1
Dr. Thrasher was very helpful. I enjoyed the class.,1
I took CALC 201 before with another professor and didn't pass so I took it again with Gove. To be completely honest it was easy but only because I had take it before. His lectures are boring and he doesn't know how to explain things clearly. He does curve though and replaces homework with quizzes.,0
AVOID THIS CLASS. Tests are impossible and short answer tests.,0
I was super nervous to take his class as I haven't taken a math class in five years. His assigned homework is ALWAYS related to tests and very helpful. He grades very fairly. He is an awesome teacher willing to explain and answer questions. Fast grading. Not to mention he's very nice and cracks a few jokes. He also brought treats several times :),1
"He has gotten a lot better at responding back to his students! I think it takes him around 1-3 business days to get back to you, which isn't too bad. There are short essays that require 150-200 words, 3 longer essays that require minimum 650 words. Which again, not too bad. Discussion posts (150-200 words) every week. Pretty simple. Easy Peasy.",1
"She is such a great lecturer. She shows her personality & makes the content fun to learn. She doesn't take attendance but she teaches so much information in a day it'll be hard to catch up. There's three exams, a paper, and a final. She does drop the lowest test grade, which is helpful. She has helped me look forward to this class. I recommend her!",1
"Professor Epstein is such a good professor! He knows a lot about China and will make his lectures very interesting and filled with information. Theres not a question you can answer to which he doesnt have an answer. There are a 4/5 quizzes, midterm, final and a research paper. Go to class and show that youre participating!",1
"Doesn't teach how to write syntax; primarily only C/C++ theory. The professor is very knowledgeable, but if your new to programming, your going to have a HARD time. I believe this class should be an intermediate course rather than an introductory one. You will NEED to study outside of class and learn how to code yourself.",0
This professor has been the worst one I have ever had. Not only can you not understand her; she does not care if the class average is under 60% and she does not have respect for anyone.,0
He talks A LOT.... but class is simple. Participation definitely matters. You work with him hell work with you. Come to every class.,1
He was terrible. I am great at math. I tested into MAT 116. Got an A in 116 with a diferent professor. Failed with a 36% with Chew. His tests are rediculously hard. They don't go over the same stuff that we did in class. He makes mistakes ALL the time. Not helpful what so ever. Attendance is required everyday and you don't get points for showing up,0
"Although this is Spanish conversation, you never have conversations. You mostly read from a textbook and memorize speeches.  It was a semi-easy A but if you are looking to improve your Spanish speaking skills, don't take this class.",0
"I really struggled in his class. I only missed a few classes and still had issues understanding what he was teaching. You can tell that he knows the information, it's just sometimes confusing to understand the way he explains things. He always offered to help me in and out of class, but I found it easier to get a tutor.",0
very hard grader but nice guy,1
he is a horrible teacher. he lost several peoples tests and hw throughout the semester. he grades the tests very harshly and the test questions are difficult,0
"Was not a fan at all of the class and material. R is hard and confusing, as with the other programs. Not a good class or really a good teacher.",0
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
"Very unclear with instructions, has an attitude, gives mean facial expressions, lots of work, not specific, tough grader , boring class , would not take again",0
Pretty cool class. Try not to fall behind. Do the weekly review!,1
"Ms. Fletcher is absolutely a delight to have.  She loves to laugh and always has a funny story to tell.  She makes Spanish so easy, tells the class exactly how to pronounce words and is always willing to make herself available if you need help.",1
"It was a very easy class, some of the in class projects are kinda weird but overall it was a cool class. And yes, the teacher is hot.",1
SHe was great and helpful. I have a career now!,1
"Love Avis! At first I was a little unsure of her because she's can be a little overwhelming. You just have to nod along sometimes, but it makes the class interesting. If you put in the effort and follow the criteria, she is a fair grader. Very helpful over email. I would recommend Avis!",1
"I would have rated her a 0. She is a harsh grader for no reason. BEWARE of exams with locked browser, webcam and no way to go back and forth. She is not helpful and will eventually ignore emails and won't reply. no matter how well you do on anything else, if you fail the exams: you will fail. Unclear grader as well.",0
Bill is funny and charismatic but he spends almost every single class talking about his own work and who he knows.  He doesn't offer much guidance in semester projects and gives zero feedback on assignments. He's also very hard to get a hold of out of class  and doesn't honor office hours as scheduled. I learned very little in his class. ,0
McCay was a good teacher. I am very stupid and I still could kinda understand what he was talking about. the only reason I got a good grade is because every week we had to answer a take home tests and I would stay after class and he would talk me through each question then give me an A on it. so that's how I would go about the tests if I were you.,1
"The worst professor I've ever taken. Incoherent, talks down to students, illegible writing, next to no review for exams, and the harshest grader I've ever seen (he awards 0 partial credit, even for answers that are 99% correct, you will get no credit). This guy hands out D's and F's like candy. Avoid at all cost if you want to keep your GPA intact.",0
This man is the reason I gave up engineering my third year into the program.,0
"I could go on forever about what a terrible teacher and person she is but let me help you pass. Half way through the semester I discovered Quizlet, I was failing up to this point. She likes Lewis Medsurge textbook so study from that and her lectures and do every practice question on the topic being studied on quizlet. NCLEX is easier than her!",0
"I'm terribly disappointed with this class. Very boring and disorganized. Loves to hear himself talk. Ignores students' comments and discussion. Gives very vague instructions for assignments. Bases the class off of random articles. Half of the class wouldn't go if attendance weren't mandatory. Maybe other classes are better, but don't take this one.",0
Pretty straight forward class. She gives feedback on everything and grades very quick and timely. Mostly just smaller writing assignments and quizzes.,1
"Professor Wallace is a good-quality teacher. He really encourages participation and for online classes, he has several writing assignments. That is besides the weekly TopHat quizzes. He gives a study guide for the midterm and final. He really encourages critical thinking.",1
"I don't understand the praise for Frey.  She is ok, at best.  After the first class, I started going to Buhro's section-wow, he's much better.  They are absolutely opposites.  She seems to care only about test scores, and not how the students are learning the material.  She is also not patient with questions and way too rushed.",0
"3 individual papers, 3 group papers/presentations, 2 memorization tests, group and individual online business simulation.  Professor creates an uncomfortable learning environment.  Half of the class didn't say a word the whole course.",0
"Oh my word, never had a more BORING prof! I could barely understand him 1/2 the time. However, if you study his printed notes you do fine on the exams.",0
"Very hard, her tests are nothing like the review and the questions are VERY VERY VERY hard and she goes through the material very fast. Very hard teacher, if you can, please don't take her!",0
Summer online class. WARNING! Requirements include a webcam that must be on you during exams and quizzes at least and wants to see the entire room you are in. No one can be in the room with you. Did not work for me as I have small kids in the house. No compliance  a 0. NOT HELPFUL! Did not respond to course messages. Requires Mindtap. I dropped it,0
"I honestly don't understand how he got good reviews. He is a very tough grader who can be very rude and mean depending on his mood. His exam is 85% of the total grade and I was never able to finish them (I studied a lot). I never missed his class or hw and still got B-. Even I take the same class again, I don't think I'll be able to do better",0
"To be honest, I have no idea why people are saying he's interesting.  I find him so dull, I've never seen people fall asleep in a class before, but kids pass out all the time, it's absurd. I love history, but Pierce does not cut it for me. I would definitely NOT recommend him.",0
"Terrible professor. Doesn't actually ""teach"" anything. He makes you feel stupid if you ask for help. Tests are super hard. Most boring person alive. I will not take a class with Esham ever again. I would highly recommend avoidng him if possible.",0
"It was so horrible. I had no idea that I alone was the reason for all the suffering of all women. Crazy. I didnt mean to. My bad, I wont do it again.",0
very interesting even when he is off topic. Very nice guy. Grades hard on papers,1
Awesome teacher!!! I took her during the summer (6 weeks fast track class-2401) It is intense & fast. B able to keep up with reading. DO THE ONLINE HOLES PRE/POST TESTS those really do help and basically read every word on the powerpoint slides! Gives Extra Credit-usually quizzes be on time for class for that!!!DEFINATELY RECOMMEND HER =),1
"His lab rocks! Most main-lecture profs are demonic in lab, but King is great! Grading is easy and classes are short and much less stressful than the other sections. Take this class!",1
"Dr. Kahan is a very nice, caring professor.  She expects a lot, but there are no surprises.  Go to class, pay attention, participate, read the assigned readings, and you'll do well.",1
"Boring, difficult to listen to lectures. You have to write exactly what he wants for papers, or you miss massive points. Avoid if possible.",0
I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in linguistics. There are no slides and lecture can be repetitive and dull. Attend class because your best bet is to repeat Sam verbatim on exams or you will probably be marked off.,0
Dr. Wang is a very particular grader and knows what she wants.  She responds immediately with email questions and is definitely there if you need help.  Lectures go very quickly and you can't miss one or you would fall behind.  Pick good group mates because that's your whole grade. I worked really hard but did learn a lot.,1
way boring class he talks way too much and keeps you in class the whole entire time,1
His classes are quiet fun but he is very difficult to understand. Poor grading and unfair.,0
Professor Michelle Lorimer is a great professor but she has very long and boring lectures. She is genuinely kind and caring to one's needs. There is a lot of reading but it is pretty easy. There are little quizzes that you have to complete but they are very easy. Make sure to take notes during lecture. Study the material before the test.,1
"he's a nice guy, work oriented. i'm just a fanatic of the field. i just wish he would take interest in all aspects of teaching both inside and outside the cassroom. i've cried i've laughed and i'm still breathing for the moment. take care sir. opportunity knocks at the door, but my knocking seems futile. this sample has too many associated errors.",0
I took this class for summer 2 and he wasn't the best at explaining the information. This class was very fast-paced and he didn't give any time to write down notes. There is also a ton of hw assigned. His tests were hard and were not similar to the examples given in class.,0
"I read the comments before I had taken Dr. Paul and I was a bit discouraged, but he turned out to be a very good professor. He is very clear as to what he expects. I worked in a group that was horrible and I was scared we would not pass. I reached out to Dr. Paul to let him know the many challenges that I had to face. He was very understanding.",1
"Best prof I've had in the math department. Actually, makes you understand the material is very helpful. Great being in his class and he does not over exhaust you with homework problems he gives you enough to be able to understand the material.",1
"Doesn't care much for students teacher does not help those in need only the ""teachers pets"" wouldn't recommend taking ANY classes from her",0
"I had Kim for lecture and lab. She's amazing in lab, but dismal in lecture. She would go off on tangents, then speed through the remaining slides expecting you to understand everything. Her final was filled with mechanisms she told us about last minute. If you try to get points back, don't expect her to be nice. Hard HW. Very unprepared for 3020:/",0
he is the best,1
"Loved her as an English teacher, couldn't have asked for anyone better!",1
"Run is right!!! he is the most unhelpful professor i have ever had!!! If you have nothing better to do than read like 200 pages a night, then this is the class for you!The people that like him need to get their head checked..",0
"Professor Grant is a terrible professor to take if you enjoy accounting. She doesn't teach the material at all and expects you to learn it all on your own. She spends every class period talking about herself ,how successful she is and how much money she has. Very mean to students when they don't do well on exams. She will ruin accounting.",0
"I thought Elaine was a very good professor overall. She was always telling people to ask questions if they needed help. She was even willing to look over essays and labs before handing them in. People saying she is a difficult professor are just too dumb to ask for help when they need it. I am a geology-chemistry dual major, and I would recommend.",1
Good teacher. Very dry humor but that kind of makes it fun. He knows what he is talking about. He is willing to help you out if you have a question. Their are random quizzes but they are over the homework you did. So if you do the homework then you passed the quiz.,1
I LOVE this man. I go to his office (he's also my advisor) just to talk to him and end up spending way too long there. Not only is he helpful but he also is such a fascinating lecturer. He can show you the other side of any issue. Highly recommended!,1
"This man will never shut up abut the Coke soda. He is an awful professor, and always says the same things each class (it doesn't really relate to the current chapter, only chapter one). his tests are impossible because its scenarios, not actual questions. If anyone can avoid this mans class, avoid at all costs",0
"He really knows his stuff and cares about making you into a great teacher.  Yes, the quizzes are a pain, but the rest of the class was really useful.",1
"I had him his 1st semester too, it was awful. big waste of time to be honest, I hope he has gotten better, for everyones sake",0
He is the worst teacher in the BCC he is confusing the time and inregular teacher,0
"This class has been the hardest class I have ever had. I came expecting it to be easy like high school and I got my ass handed to me by the first test. I needed this to build a decent work ethic and time management. Wingrave may be hated by a lot students, but for those who want be something in life he is a necessity. GO TO CLASS AND OFFICE HOURS.",1
"Didn't really like him. I'm minoring in history and am really passionate about it, but it wasn't really engaging at all. lectures were really boring, LOTS of daily HW. gave us a great outline for the midterm though, without it I would've failed. he's a sweet guy, but I wouldn't take it again. many like him though so who knows. kinda dryyyy",0
"I've taken her a bunch of times. She's awesome & the class is a very, very, very easy ""A.""",1
Her class is very straight forward! Just do the work and you'll pass!,1
omg. IF YOU ARE THINKING OF TAKING THIS FOR A BREADTH DO NOT DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU ARE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE MAJOR MAYBE BUT THIS WAS SO UNNECESSARILY HARD. She doesn't use canvas or sakai or have any online gradebook and just speaks out lectures so you can never miss. Just don't do it. She is very educated and nice though xo,0
dread going 2 that class. doesn't talk about anything that is on the tests just talks about 1 topic for more than 3 weeks at a time but than expects you 2 know all that is on the quiz/tests. extremely boring and has too many readings. each assignment is doing a reading from each book which makes things a little confusing. DONT GET HER FOR A TEACHER,0
"I love professor Ball! He's the best!!! If you need Math 0308 Please do yourself a favor and pick his class. He makes everything so easy, he's funny, he cares about our time, he has lots of patience, and makes everything easy and clear for you.",1
"Not accessible outside of class. She rarely answers emails, missed many office hours without giving notice, and does not post most grades. The tests and quizzes were very error prone so make sure you check all of your assignments. However, she makes it extremly difficult to do so. The class was much easier before we transitioned to online though.",0
unfortunately i think she is the only one who teaches this class. (fall '12) we had no assignments during oct and none until after thanksgiving. she didnt grade sept assignments until november. so she takes extremely long to grade. lecture is boring and almost 2 hours long. easy A though,1
Boring guy. FREAKS out over phones and laptops for some odd reason. Doesn't even let you take a picture of the lecture notes even though he skips through the slides with lightening speed. Attendance is mandatory so you can stare at him just talk. Unreasonable.,0
"4 ""pop"" quizzes (he announces them the class before, so show up), 1 individual project, 2 midterms+final.  Gives out the pdf of the book for free, but he's such a gem you don't need it. He teaches you everything in class. Take good notes, learn your calculator (do TVMCalcs), and you are set for an A. One of the best professors i've taken at SJSU",1
Wouldn't wish her on my WORST enemy.,0
"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before.",0
"Dr. Braun is amazing and a valuable asset to the University of Akron.  She is witty and funny and an expert in her field.  Expect a lot of reading, but class is structured to be part lecture and part discussion and she really does listen to what you have to say and expands on anything you find interesting.  She is a fair grader and gives feedback.",1
"BY FAR my worst learning experience at Humber College to date. This instructor was an absolute embarrassment to Humber's reputation, and should be removed from the faculty immediately. Only showed up on time for 2 out of 15 classes. When he did arrive he was arrogant and demeaning. He made me feel dumb for asking questions. Unprofessional bully.",0
"He is a really nice guy, but you need to stay up to date on the readings and take lots of notes in class to have a clue what is going on. Map quizzes and reading quizzes are easy as long as you put in work. There are 2 tests and as long as you do the outlines and study you will be fine. One research paper that he grades kinda harshly.",1
There are no words I can use to adequately prepare you for the horror you are about to embark on with Debruine as your professor. Be prepared to teach yourself complicated accounting topics and get ready to sit through confusing and misguided lectures. May the force be with you.,0
"Terrible, doesn't care.",0
I chose Psych as my minor simply because I had Sonja for 101 and she made it amazing. Same goes for this course. She has so much passion for psychology and it really comes across in her personality and lectures. She wants everyone to succeed and is so helpful. You won't find a more sweeter professor! ,1
"Lots of her ""stories"" were full of inaccurate facts. She is not the sharpest tool in the drawer...likes to talk about herself too much...boring.. teaches diversity class too, as if we need that info any more.  It's 2010 Ms. Rogers...we know their are other races, we just all want to be the same now...",0
"Dr. Maida is amazing! I took Calculus I with her and she was so clear. She explained the material very well, was always available to ask questions, and she did a lot of example problems on the board. She's the best math prof I have ever had. If I could take every math class with her I would! Take a class with Dr. Maida- she changed calc for me.",1
"Mr. Buckridge is a great teacher who is very passionate about what he teaches. Tips for his class: 1. DO NOT hand write your notes, he talks a lot and fast.  2. participate in class, he does grade you based on participation  3. create a short & simple study guide before each quiz and you'll get an easy A 4. he will tell you need the book, you don't",1
"If you're willing to go to every lecture and do all the required readings (30 articles per midterm and 60 for the final) then you'll easily pass with a high grade. If you feel like you need the lecture slides outside of class (although, I personally never did) then you can just easily take pictures of them in class. He's engaging and energetic.",1
"If you struggle in math and need a teacher that will break it down and make the process simple, this is the teacher to take. She is very laid back, funny and willing to help students that want to learn. The only thing that makes her mad is if you use your cell phone in class while she is teaching. I took her 8 week fast track class and made an A!",1
"Teacher uses 3 different websites to organize syllabus, schedule, and class materials.  Very unorganized.  Does not make projects very clear and sometimes the teacher doesn't even know how to do the projects he is assigning.",0
"He is a very difficult grader, but he doesn't seem too bad overall.",0
"This professor is very knowledgeable, but she spends SO much time discussing diet/food topics that are unnecessary for this specific course. Because she spent so much time going on tangents about nutrition instead of delving deeper into our A&P topics, I didn't gain much from her lectures. The class is an easy A, but you won't learn much about A&P.",0
"Tests are the majority of points in this class. Homework was collected somewhat regularly, but not an overwhelming amount by any means. Very clear explanations of concepts and examples. A good bit of theory and proofs behind the different theorems and concepts. Easy early on if you've had prior exposure to linear algebra; gets a little harder.",1
He is one of the best professors I have had at TCU. Lectures are easy to understand. The materials definitely helps you a lot in practicing. He's hilarious and makes classes very relaxing. Just take him.,1
"He is a nice guy, but does not make sense a whole lot. His hand writing is awful. You have to sit in the front to see what he writes. Tests are really hard even though it is multiple choice. Unless you know some economics prior I would not recommend taking him.",1
I took his class for 1301 & 1302 with an A in the 1st one & would have had an A in the 2nd but I messed up dates for a paper( Im human!). I reached out nicely about it and he was EXTREMELY rude and gave me a 0. I have immune issues w/seizures recently so thats been a lot to handle. Qs/Ts are over passing details. DBs are full essay length.,0
"King's class is based on attendance, so show up and you will be sure to receive a B. She is also very group orientated, meaning that over half the class is group projects/graded. This class is very focused on the now, so current events.",1
"Worst professor ever. Very boring and unorganized lectures. Adam has zero passion and doesn't seem like he wants to be there. Equation sheets aren't allowed on tests, no partial credit and review days are a joke. Material isn't that difficult but tests are you're whole grade and he makes them as hard as he possibly can. Avoid this professor",0
"Great teacher, very helpful. You need to really study though, because she goes through stuff pretty fast. You need to keep up and know the material. Only thing that kind of sucks is the online homework. Nadeau is hilarious.",1
"Though homework was optional, it is strongly encouraged that you do it because she takes exact problems from the homework and puts them in tests and quizzes. I received a 68% on the first test and got an A+ on the rest and got an A in the class. She gives a lot of partial credit and some extra credit on her exams. Should be an easy A.",1
"Dr. Chung is a very good professor and lecturer. Her BA 350 - Organizational Behavior course is not the easiest to master, but it is passable. If you take incredible notes during her lectures, you will find that most of the exam questions will derive from those notes. You should definitely attend class, or you will be lost.",1
He is pretty tough but if you show up and seem like you are trying he will give you a decent grade. I did horrible on the labs but the sign in sheet got me a B- in the class.,0
"She may be good in person but not online. She caught a student cheating and punished the whole class by not allowing us to backtrack on the test. She would also make the test on Sundays at certain times such as from 9 am-12 pm. Also, all the negative comments have been removed for whatever reason. I did all her homework and still got an F.",0
His tests are often confusing and he ends up dropping four or five questions every exam because they are worded awkwardly. There is an immense amount of reading that goes on in this class. If you are not constantly on top of the reading you will fail the exams at the end of every four units. ,0
"History of Ireland is a fascinating class and Prof. Murphy makes it even better with her being Irish. Fun class, reading not really important as she covers everything in incredible detail in class. Recommend all take this class.",1
"Ron teaches like the class is when he was a child. He can be kind at times, but his instructions are unclear sometimes and he doesn't explain them. Takes forever to grade stuff and has many small assignments that are sometimes pointless.",0
"I took this professor for an engineering gen ed, and it was amazingly easy. It was about renewable energy systems, and it only consisted of some short forums, true/false quizzes, easy homework, and two group projects. He graded really easily, and this was an interesting and easy class.",1
"Do not take Spanish 101 (5 week course). I get its suppose to be a lot of work because its cramped but Id recommend if you have to take a language, save it for the reg semesters. teacher gives out an absolutely insane amount of work.. everything is in Spanish.. even expects you to write full convos in Spanish by the first week. No Beuno! Lol",0
"Make sure you do the extra credit. I think a lot of people go in expecting an easy A. Well let me just tell you that the average exam grade was usually a low to mid B. Trust me, there are plenty of people getting below an A- in that class. Make sure you actually take notes and everything. It's not too difficult, but I wouldn't say an easy A",1
"The only good thing about this class is that he is a pretty nice guy, HOWEVER, I highly recommend never taking this course. Nothing is clear that he explains and if you ask for him to clarify he goes on a passionate yelling spree instead of actually clarifying. He gives no assignments other than like three tests which are short and very specific.",0
"Excellent teacher. Willing to help any time he can. He doesn't just read along with slides like other teachers, he actually understands the material. Very approachable, and honestly wants you to do well. Tests are mostly multiple choice with some short answer, and fill in the blank. Likes students who honestly try hard.",1
"She is neither clear nor helpful, belittles students for asking questions, and has convoluted grading criteria for exams, even the TA's agree. There is a quiz every lecture (basically for attendance) and homework before each lecture and in the beginning of the week in the morning, along with lab/classworks in discussion. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
This professor is the best. His lectures are interesting. He tells you what you need to know for an exam. I wish he taught more of my science classes. Take this profeessor; if you don't pass it's not because of him.,1
"talks too fast, very sassy, talks in third person.  Does not give partial credit.  If one period is out of place or a word is misspelled she marked it as wrong-- many kids are international students so this is difficult for them. I dropped the class and would not take her again if i can avoid it.",0
"With any other professor, this class is tough. With her it was a lot easier. I ended up getting an A without much trouble, an impossible feat with other profs. Lectures were from PowerPoint. Homeworks weren't too bad. Tests were hard but not impossible.",1
She is a big lecturer. She stands in front of the room and speaks. You pretty much have to write everything down that she says as well as read the textbook which is A LOT. The exam questions are very specific and she does not give any sort of study guide or anything to tell you what you should expect. Not impossible to get a good grade but hard to.,0
"Great down-to-earth professor. Lectures aren't ""mandatory"", but he uses clickers so you answer questions throughout lecture, however your answers aren't graded based on correct/incorrect, it's simply counted if you particpated or not which counts toward your overall grade. Online weekly quizzes (Easy As). Exams are easy too if you attend lecture.",1
Definitely take this course with her if you like for people to be condescending to you. Heavy workload. Assumes everyone wants to be a Pollution Manager...This course and instructor were so not worth my time. The material could be interesting if you didn't have to WASTE so much time being an English major for an Environmental Studies course.,0
This professor was impossible to please and learn from. I truthfully did not learn anything and taught myself the course material from the beginning to end. I DO NOT recommend this professor if you need assistance with hard grammar subjects. Prepare to learn on your own and be insulted if you don't get it.,0
"Professor Frey is a great professor who explains difficult concepts in an exceptionally clear way. Exams were very tricky, but as a whole, the class was not as difficult as I had expected based on what I had heard from other students/faculty.",1
"This class was very interesting and provided useful information. Professor Galindo is a great instructor. Grade is based on class activity points, four quizzes, midterm, final, two observations, and an adolescent interview. Everything was on Blackboard, except the final. Easy A. Make sure to read the book, attend class, and do those assignments!",1
I was just lost in her class.,0
"Best class ever! Dr. Johnson is a great professor, and she loves what she does. Her class is very interesting and she makes it fun. The textbook could be used for studying but is not mandatory since she provides Powerpoints. Attendance is important! She grades tests/assignments super fast! I would definitely take another class with her If I could.",1
HE IS THE WORST. i would never take him again. he picks favorites. when he lecture he goes all over the place. worst teacher i ever had.,0
"AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALLLLLLLL COSTS! SHE IS NOT HELPFUL, CLEAR, OR NICE. she makes studnet's feel stupid for asking questions during lectures and zooms through her lectures while trying to cram 3 sections in one. i have taken this class before (a couple years ago) and am more lost than the first time i took it. DO NOT TAKE HER!!",0
Very thick accent and hard to understand. She is very interested in what she teaches but doesnt make it fun for the class. She doesn't speak proper english and it is very annoying,0
"Good teacher, well-versed on the material. Some students get offended by him but it's not common. He's a solid guy that teaches well and doesn't take things too seriously. Just read the book and listen in class and an A isn't difficult to earn.",1
She is nice person but her exam very hard especially multiple chooses you have to study hard and you have to cover her power point and the book. Her lap very easy and too much fun.,1
"Class participation: mandatory. More writing than Ive done for any English class. Weekly articles & book Q&A to be submitted online/in person. 2 major written projects. Tests: pretty tough, even if you studied. Actual core info was super interesting learning about why people believe & do what they do, but I was constantly stressed out all semester",1
Excellent professor with organized and well-planned lectures...Very helpful..,1
"Dr. McDonald is passionate about what he's teaching, and I got the impression that he loves teaching his students and preparing them for what actually ""doing Biology"" is going to look like. However, this class should not be taken lightly. The final is 45% of your grade and can legitimately wreck all the progress you've made throughout the semester.",1
"Prof Jones is so awesome in every way. He is fun to learn from, kind, caring, easygoing, and interesting! His assignments are totally doable. He's so smart, but not arrogant. A real professional, great teacher.",1
She's awesome. Just do yourself a favor and take her class. You won't ever want to miss a class. Trust me.,1
"There weren't any tests so with only 3 essays your grade definitely depends on writing ability, but he doesn't grade too hard and definitely rewards what you do right, plus there's an opportunity to revise one of the essays for extra points. Show up to class on time and go to office hours when you need help and this class should be fine.",1
"This course was one of my biggest regrets in college. The major of this ""professional ethics"" course was spent dragging on about ethical theory that wasn't relevant to any workday of my career path. Even Dr. Field seemed to be bored and tired of his teachings. He was monotone, unengaging, and seemed to enjoy telling students that they were wrong.",0
"I was lucky that the majority of the class was online. She ""taught"" in class but all of the homework, quizzes and tests were online. I only went to class once a week because we had a lab. If it were't for the class being online I would have failed miserably. I do not recommend her unless you want to teach yourself.",0
Hard Tests. Rambling Lectures. READ THE BOOK.,0
Tries to make it the  most beneficial for students and understand other class work loads.,1
I did not like human animal. She is a tough grader and picks favorites.,0
"Nolan obviously knows his stuff when it comes to Philosophy, however do not take this class if you are looking for an easy A. He is a tough grader when it comes to your papers, which is the only thing you are graded on.",1
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The only available Comm 230 section was a 180 student lecture with Cindy White. Worst professor. Attendance is pointless because she goes so off topic and the Powerpoints do not help! Your grade is based off only 3 tests, not leaving you any room for mistakes. All she does it babble.",0
"I would definitely recommend this class for any health care major. It looks good and is fairly easy. There's a couple of opinion based reflection papers, and a super easy group project. She's quite the character, is funny but gets distracted easily. Would recommend.",1
Horrible preparer for the future. Often made us figure out our own problems.,0
"He's awesome! Would definitely take again. Super nice, gives clear criteria. Cornell notes are really annoying, but you can use notes on the weekly group quizzes (which are easy too). I learned a lot in this course, even thought I'm not a computer science major or anything. Focus is on Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint.",1
class is easy just show up to class and do the work he explains andy questions anyone has. You don't feel rushed taking his class.,1
"Pretty tough class. ALOT of reading, over 100 pages a day.  Three papers = 75% of your grade, 8 one page response papers. Lectures were boring.  TA, Stocksdale was not helpful and unclear about grading.  I do not recommend.",0
"If you have notes, you will be fine. Practice exams are very close to real exams. I did not go to the class but still able to get a B.",1
"He doesn't care about his students. His class is extremely disorganized, not enough materials, not enough example for the assignments. The class is already difficult and this professor is not there to teach.",0
"She's honestly not a great professor. I took her for almost every class she taught at Siena and I had to teach myself most of the time. She talks down to you if you don;t understand stuff right away, but she's a really nice lady. Super gossipy. Be careful what you say in front of her. The whole chemistry department will know.",0
Very helpful great teacher!!,1
LAW BUSI 2301.83448/93408 . DR. RANDY WATERMAN GIVES YALL VERY GOOD REVIEW B4 THE TEST DAYS. HE ALSO GIVES YALL LOTS OF EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS IF YALL FAILED THE EXAMS TO MAKE IT UP. THX PROF.,1
Seems out of touch with reality - John Walker would understand!,0
"She's very disorganized, so if you don't know much about the Microsoft programs, I don't recommend taking this prof. To succeed here you're better off only using the book, and not her instruction. It's an easy load, but you need to expect that she's very fly-by-the-seat, so nothing is set in stone. She's passable, but with effort.",0
Very Sweet but likes to talk a lot.  It makes for a long class.,1
"Professor Wood is one of the few math teachers that I've actually learned from. She is a specific grader but only to teach students the proper way to solve equations and inequalities. If use utilize the workshops she generously sets up in combination of attending class, doing assignments on time and engage you'll only be set to succeed! 10/10",1
"Avoid this woman.  She seems really sweet the first week but talks down to students and acts as though we are 3 years old.  She confuses herself while teaching and says the wrong thing then denies that she made an error.  She requires tutoring yet is unwilling to work with you if this does not fit your schedule.  Trick questions, no partial credit.",0
"feels like the class was moving so quick in one week we would finish two chapters plus you need to do so much homework, for every section it felt so over whelemed and most of the homework is not explained how to go about so i was loosing points. if you like RUSHED class with alot of HW then take this class.",0
In order to pass the class you just have to show up and study the learning objectives and you should be good to go. She makes the material really easy to understand,1
If you don't choose Pestana for PHI 102 you are making a huge mistake,1
"Very thought provoking. Very few assignments outside of class. Must always attend lectures. Reading the book isn't mandatory, but there are parts that actually help.",1
The first class I took with him was ok. But the secobd class was boring. Nothing but voc-prepositions ans NPR boriiiinnnnnnggggggggggg.,1
"I took all her classes when she taught at UCSD. She's genius and changed the way I look at everything, taught me how to think more critically. Lectures were fascinating. To do well, read all your assignments, show up, and see her during office hours--in other words, if you're a good student, you'll do well in her VERY interesting classes.",1
She can be a bit disorganized as far as class assignments ... she frequently does not give out a schedule for the semester.,1
I had great fun in her lab. She is awsome!!! Great professor.,1
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
"He's very lecture heavy and at times can get boring, but he cares about his subject. He is also very knowledgeable and you'll probably learn a lot. Don't bother trying to contact him via Canvas, he won't answer. Also beware of the KIVA assignment, it's the only thing in the class that I got less than an A on. Grading is a bit strange for it.",1
"Where to even begin. Class time was useless and the only reason for going is attendance, she doesn't post grades all semester long and when you email her for your grade she wont respond. Her study guide for the exam doesnt even cover some of the material on the test. Very unorganized professor who will honestly give you nothing more than a headache",0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. All her exam questions are trick questions; since her grammar is poor to begin with, this makes getting an A very hard. Put of a class of 60+, we averaged one or two A's per exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",0
"She is a very kind teacher, funny, kind and sweet. But her tests are extremely hard, she says that the test will be based on her class notes, but half of it is something you have to research on your own. I studied everything from her class notes and got 7/15!. . She is super kind but if your really interested in psych , dont take her class!",0
"Took both 1078 and 1088 with him, and I've definitely learned a lot. Homework is optional if you need the extra help, but tests are pretty tough",1
"Aleman was one of the worst professors I have ever had. Not only was he disrespectful and rude,  but is condescending to his students. During his lectures he talks in round about ways that make no sense at all about easy topics.  He calls out students and makes them look dumb if they do not agree with him. Avoid at all costs!",0
"Paul is a super nice guy but you can't understand him. He doesn't clarify the projects. I took this cause I had to for foundations and I would NEVER do it again. You basically just do random stuff. You jump from project to project, sometimes 3 at a time and your always confused. He's crazy with the way he only cares about that class no other one.",0
I am a math person and love numbers; I'm very good at what I do. I got a D in his class and am now in remedial math at a different university and acing it. Hm. Something doesn't add up.,1
"Professor Mantell is sweet, but there is too much information on the powerpoints. Grading for Lab is super easy. She does provide a study for each test. I highly recommend takin BIO before taking this class.",1
"A quarter of the class withdrew, and half of what is left is failing extremely bad. AVOID AVOID AVOID. glad i withdrew when i did. horrible professor.",0
"Great guy, always willing to help, wants you to understand, but moves fast.",1
"Dr. Quick is a very good instructor. Dr. Quick doesn't offer extra credit or practice tests for the weekly tests. But if you follow the study plan provided by Pearson, do the HW and then do the tests, you should have no problem passing. Dr. Quick offers feedback and responds attentively to questions. He is flexible with outside situations as well.",1
Don't Miss This Class- It is awesome and the professor's a genius with Pre-trial litigation. Some students saw some BS written in 2012- negative- BS. This class is great- it's not easy- it's complicated material- part of being an attorney- but he tries to get you the best info for real-life. If you're not going to get invested in this class-well...,1
"If you are an english ed major, this class will definitely benefit towards building your own ""teaching philosophy."" There is a fine line on teaching someone how to teach, and this class really puts you in the teacher's shoes.",1
She isn't a hard grader but she doesn't clarify things. The syllabus is different than her course content portion so the assignment was very hard to complete. She beats around the bush to answer your questions and never actually answers the question. The discussion questions were not clear so I didn't know what I was supposed to be answering.,0
"Not the most interesting lectures. Just try to pay attention to lecture, skim through the assigned readings and you should be fine. He discusses most of the material from the books anyways, so everything is really easy. Exams are in essay format questions. TAs grade the exams. Depending who your TA is, the class could be easy (most likely) or hard.",1
It is the beginning of the term. He has answered almost all of the questions people ask respectfully. I had to be the one to complain against him to have him update his blackboard assignments. He ignored students asking for updates on projects due. Everything was based on last terms deadlines confusing you if you need to make your schedule.,1
"Boring, shows pictures all the time that do not pertain to anything. Never clear about wat is going to be on the tests",0
Avoid at all cost,0
She is a very tough teacher. You can learn a lot if you dedicate the time to her courses. She expects you to come prepared to class. If you aren't she will scold you. Find another teacher for this class if possible.,0
"This class contains  lots of participation and group projects.  Attendance really matters in her class, if you miss a lecture it is hard for you to pass this class.  The textbooks were used everyday for this class.  DR. Mark went out of her way to help anyone with any questions they may have.",1
"Great prof, do as he says and you are golden, plus no midterms, YAAY!",1
"She is an awesome professor that will answer any and all questions you have. She is an easy A as long you do the work in a timely manner. I am taking her again for biology 2. When it comes to her labs, she will go over everything with students before. Also, DO THE STUDY GUIDES!! Print them out during lecture and use them as notes, IT HELPS SOO MUCH",1
Take another Professor.,0
"Kind of disappointed by the rate my professor when I first enrolled for this class. This class wouldn't let anyone of us breathe. Each week we had a discussion, 2-3 activities, 4 hw assignments, 10 pages of modules to read, 2-3 hours worth of video notes to watch and fill in, 4-5 quizzes, 4 exams throughout the semester, and a project. GL.",0
she was an awesome prof. one of the first things she said in class was 'im not going to stand up here and babble to you' but i really wish she had because i could listen to her talk forever. she knows her stuff and wants you to pass.  i would take another class by her even if it was over quantum physics.,1
Rushes concepts in a way that no student that isn't a genius would understand on the first try. Homework is insane and 9/10 times way more difficult than anything in the lecture.,0
"Kevin relies a lot on videos, and his lectures are pretty easy to follow.  I skipped probably a quarter of the class periods, and I still got an A.  Not much heavy-duty writing in this course (outside the midterm and final).  Take Kevin's class if you need some cupcake upper-division level history credits.",1
"Professor Neff is a great man. I could tell that he really wanted to connect with his students through lectures and office hours. He was so helpful to me when it came to writing a paper. Lecture drags a bit and I can't say I learned a ton, but that's how most IH classes are here.",1
"Lets you grade yourself, so you earn what you want. Just put in the work and effort. He did some really neat science lessons with us that I'll be using in the future. He's into the ""formal operational"" thinking stuff when it comes to science which was interesting for me to see. Let's students figure it out, rather than just being told.",1
It is necessary to work hard and attend her classes regularly to succeed.,1
By far one of my favorite teachers at SMU! She is so sweet and truly cares so much about each and every one of her students. I've had her for 3 different classes. She is very understanding and she really appreciates it when students work hard!,1
"She is extremely ignorant of special education  and grades as such. The strategy presentations are entirely Gen Ed and if you adapt for SPED, you get graded down.  Couldn't stand how fake she was.  I sat there entirely tuned out b/c she obviously didn't want to be there, nor did we.  Don't take her!",0
"He is really clear and organized in his teaching.  The class is difficult, but what do you expect from calculus?  He answers all of our questions and if you do the homework and check it, you will get A's on all the quizzes.",1
He is all over the place,0
Great class! The classes are always fun and you'll make an A just by showing up and participating. No homework but short readings and remembering lines. Take this class for your Art requirement! Your class become like family.,1
****er droped me from his class becasue he had a retarted senior who needed it,0
"I loved every minute in his class.  I had him for calc 1 and 2 and part of 3.  he is very clear and understanding and if I had any more math classes I needed to take, I would make sure I had them with him.",1
"She is a nice lady, However, her class was one of the worst classes psychology classes I have taken at Grand Valley. Her outlines are organized but how she explains them is not. She does not make sense and it is all random. All does is go over studies so I suggest you just read those studies on your own because she will not explain them very well.",0
"Lots of WA and attendance quizzes, but he's pretty hilarious",1
"Pretty typical science class, lecture and weekly tests.  He grades on the curve, so don't stress if you don't get excellent test scores, most students will still get an A.  All of the microbiology classes have interchangeable curriculum that includes an unknowns project and a group research/presentation project. He is friendly and helpful.",1
"As I was in my first semester of graduate school, this was definitely a difficult class. Dr. Lorton took time to answer each question without making you feel as though you were an idiot for asking. Be sure to do your homework! Test questions are similar to notes and homework problems. Often, homework is harder than the test. Best of luck!",1
"she cant teach very well, but it is so easy it doesnt matter. I always went to class but never paid attention. I got 60 points more than i needed for an A and didnt even have to take the exam.  She makes it seem like you may be doing bad, but everyone does well",1
She's a *insert profanity here*. You'll have a speech on second day of class and you won't get told how it's supposed to go. Good luck,0
"I  took Mr. Patrick online and in class. He is awesome, i would say online is much better, the quizzes and the test are like the easiest test ever. Awesome instructor. Very helpful, and very intelligent. ",1
He doesn't do much lectures and he gives short examples but most of the time he missed an example that we see in homework that we were not taught yet. It's very confusing but if you study hard and you'll pass the class & tests just fine. He does one day in computer lab to assist you on your homeworks and does other day in a classroom for lectures.,0
"This class, like many of the other reviews show, is a complete mess. There is no communication between temple and his TA's which led to one of the 3 graded assignments to be graded wrong. The only assignments worth grades are the 2 midterms and the final. He rambles a lot and goes off topic in lectures. I only learned from the book. STAY AWAY!",0
"Dr. Barton cares about her students' success. While the material can be challenging, esp. the 2nd half of the semester, she does all she can to assist her students. HW is very representative of the material you will see on tests. Put in the time and you will succeed in this course. Final exam is proctored, other tests and quizzes are not.",1
she is a nice lady but her directions are often unclear. Her tests are all online but have a short time limit and sometimes the material on the tests is not what was covered in class. There is one speech during the semester. You can manage to get an A in this class especially since she gives a lot of extra credit but i honestly didn't learn much,0
"Very caring, helpful & accommodating professor. Valuable to students entering the medical field. Lectures can be long but it's an upper level science so to be expected. She acknowledges they can be tedious. Focus on power points, study guide & short answer question prep for exams.  Labs are easy. No paper/presentation. Highly recommend her.",1
"This prof is very vague when it comes to explaining things to her students. She will also spend too much time covering basics (things such as periods going at the end of sentences). Work load is not bad, but she does not round grades. Understandable if you have an 89.45%, but unreasonable when you finish with an 89.99% (I speak from experience).",0
avoid at all costs,0
"This will be the worst Econ class you take at Creighton. Dr. Wingender will basically ramble on about Obama for an hour and fifteen every single day until the day before the exam. The gist, only show up that one day. Exams are taken over two class periods! Look at the test go home study for two days, come back. If you want to learn Econ, stay away.",0
"Great guy, just not a good teacher. Lectures were almost impossible to follow. He did more examples as the semester went on but still not enough. Exams are pretty difficult (averages were around 50%) but he curves strongly so that the average is around a B-. He does want you to do well. Just can't explain material well enough. Self taught myself.",0
"He has a thick accent, but when confronted he gets defensive and gets mad. He also doesn't like answering questions.",0
Professor Bethann Talsma is by far the worst professor I have had at GRCC!!! DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! she assigns wayy to much homework and does not give enough time for completion. She doesn't cover material for tests but rather makes you read the chapters because she doesn't know what she's doing herself. Very rude when I would ask valid questions!,0
By far the best teacher I've ever had. Tests are from lectures (so record them). Do lab questions before going to lab. If you're ahead of the game she will appreciate that. Always ask a lot of questions. She's extremely smart & a very impressive teacher. I learned so much from her. Highly recommend for future RNs. You won't regret taking her class.,1
Tough grader!,1
"Which one of you sick mofos gave him a chili pepper?? He's a sweet guy, and a good prof, but honestly...",1
"Excellent class - not your run-of-the-mill fake scenerio type of dialogue class, but understand the depth, breadth, width of dialogue. He is brilliant with his terms, and tying in the reading -- warning: if you don't read, you will not do well in any of this professor's classes! Read, write, and you'll do fine.",1
"If you have Temple the best advice I can give you is write down everything he does in his lecture notes. It's the only thing you'll be tested on, don't bother with the textbook or AATC tutors, they can't help. I asked if we could have a practice midterm and he said, ""no I've never taught this class before so I don't want to make 2 exams."" Uncaring.",0
"If you're looking for a passive history class to coast through this GUR, DO NOT TAKE GILL. She's under the dire misimpression that her students want to take the class seriously - THEY DO NOT.   Obscure questions, tons of homework reading for EVERY class, low quality preparation material before exams, often late to class. 2/10 would not take again",0
Useless.  Unpleasant.,0
"Long-winded kind of guy, doesn't use much visual aid. Lectures are exactly what the word means, and I would not recommend the class.",0
"He had no time for students' questions and constantly gave us the tutoring number and email from the college, instead of staying behind to help us get better at the material. He is too busy which made our class suffer in return because he gave us no time one on one for specific questions. The home assignments take hours long but are only worth 5 pt",1
"He is a terrible professor. Attendance is mandatory, but his exams (which are the only grade) don't relate to his lectures so there is little point in going. Study the book to learn the material, but if you can avoid taking his section, you'll be better off.",0
"There are no words to describe how good this professor is. I believe he is one of the very best! He turned my hatred for math to loving math because of his teachings. He makes sure you get it in a gentle way that is not forceful nor demeaning. ECC is not doing him justice by not placing him on full time. ECC needs more Professors like him, period!",1
Great professor. Makes you work alot but will help you any way she can. Fun lectures. She's a bit strict on showing up tp class on time and turning in assignments on time but otherwise she's nice.,1
"By far the best prof I've had at Rutgers so far. His book of notes is extremely helpful - study that + old exams, go to review sessions, you're fine. He keeps you awake in a difficult class",1
"Char could be pretty vague on what she wanted, not good with technology either. Make sure you completely follow the graph rules posted on her syllabus. You can turn a lab in early and make corrections before its due which is nice. Some prelab quizzes were annoying but manageable. I think ppl reported her bc she was suddenly nice at the end.",0
Good teacher take notes and read,1
"By far the best professor I have ever had! I highly recommend taking Duff. His lectures can be boring, but it's college we're talking about. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do well and improve. Loved him and wish he was my teacher for every class!!",1
One word sums it up: horrible,0
"I gave Rick a 3 instead of a 2, because he's a nice guy, and he really tries to help you out if you go to him. But he's not very good at teaching. He hardly ever assigns homework, which might seem nice, until you get to the exam and realize that you had no idea what was coming. I never payed attention in class, but he was a nice grader.",1
"shows preference toward kids who already know a little spanish already. not too tough of a grader though, fair. heavy textbook usage too.. If she doesnt like you , she will out you a bad grade (( dont take her class )",0
"She's clear about what papers you're going to have to do and what they weigh in terms of your grade, so make sure to not forget them. I forgot one paper and it caused me to get an A- instead of an A. Make sure to get the poem and short story done ahead of time. You can tell that she is passionate about what she's teaching. Overall, it was alright.",1
Dr. McClish is very fair.  He spends a lot of time on each student's essays and provides helpful comments for improvement.  He's very available to his students.,1
"He was extremely helpful on homework and pop quizzes. He had good lectures that caught your attention. Always made sure your questions were answered. I go to the math center and if he sees me, he will stop and ask if I have any questions. Awesome teacher!! ",1
"You've been warned, take another teacher. 4 quizzes and 2 midterms. That's all you need to know. Literally talks all class and then tests you on what he talked about...... mind you this is a 3 hour class once a week so you have to pay attention the entire time. Honestly pointless. He likes to talk about himself a lot.",0
"great professor, you definitely learn a lot. I usually hate history classes but I loved this class. Definitely take him! I'm taking him for World History II later on.",1
"He goes off on tangents & spends too much time on specific little things rather than broad topics. He rarely answers questions clearly & refers you back to an example that he's gone over 100 times, yet still doesn't explain clearly.",0
"3 Discussion posts, 3 quizzes. quiz answers online and discussions are extremely easy. Webliography assignment at end, takes maybe 2 hours to complete. Easiest course ever and I barely put in any work, just give a little bit of effort on the discussion posts.",1
amazxing man with a gold heart. very helpful and clear in his teaching manner. wants his students to do well and helps with anything that u need. def take him!!!!,1
"Lots of homework but after the midterm it gets easier and his grading is more lenient. The quizzes were challenging, as well as the midterm and final. There are a few group projects that are time consuming but easy A's. Should be an easy class if you are good at math. If not, be prepared to teach yourself the material. YouTube was a lifesaver.",1
Worst teacher ive ever had,0
"Dr. Westpfahl is the sweetest and I loved taking this class with him! He lets you ask random questions anytime and for however long you want. There are no tests in this class. Only group projects, homework, and a paper. It's really easy to succeed and his class is very interesting. He cares a ton about the students and is always willing to help!",1
"Prof Gilles is exceptionally well spoken, he does a great job emphasizing what he expects from you and providing examples or models for you to follow. His feedback is very helpful and his rubrics are clear.",1
"Teacher was difficult to work with, test are timed and designed not to be completed in given period.  Capstone project can be easily gamed, just google it (in the end no point and it is the bases of the class).  Text is out dated and very boring.  If you can avoid this teacher do so (and you can).",0
"History of Pompeii is the easiest and best class you will take at ECU. He wants everyone to get an A and lets you out early every day. He is passionate about what he teaches and gives the easiest exams you will take. Just show up and that's all you will have to do, graded on 3 exams.",1
"I thought this class would be interesting, but he provdides no chronological order to his lectures and its very hard to find a link to all the info he is giving you. A nice man but expects alot out of his students, and a hard marker.",0
"ACC 212 is a hard course to begin with but prof Grant is not good at responding to emails or putting grades in. Her video lectures are not easy to follow. It is the end of the semester and only 3 exams are in BB and none of the homework assignments, was told to basically calculate them myself to see overall grade. Avoid her as much as u can.",0
"Prof. Rathke is awesome! This guy really knows what he's doing. The only problem some people have is that he can be a little inaudible at times and his handwriting can be messy. Other than that, there are previous exams that you can study before each exam which are pretty much identical to what you will take.  PS - don't buy the book! waste of $300",1
"He thinks he is funny, always makes you feel that you are behind. Miss a class and get a zero for assignment. He cares too much about his heavy lecture but not you at all. He does not care if you learn or not.",0
"Lisa is one of the worst professors I have ever had, hands down. I have had for a few classes now and she is a good teacher when in the classroom but her online classes are some of the worst experiences I have had at school. She is the least helpful teacher I have ever had both in and out of the classroom.",0
By get ready to read I mean get ready to watch youtube videos. This guy is the worse. Not only is his lectures all over the place but your lucky if he shows up on time. If class is missed because its his fault instead of taking time to learn everything he bulrushes throw it all and expects you to know it. Get ready to spend a lot of time on tutorin,0
"Super great lectures! He's funny and makes history entertaining and not boring. Usually history classes are difficult and textbook heavy, but he doesn't use a textbook and as long as you show up and pay attention, you'll pass. If you listen and take notes and spend like an hour studying for the test then you get an easy A.",1
"Lectures include the ""value of a liberal arts education"" and Burton's personal past in politics, but nothing on the actual subject of the course. Course objectives were only met because of the textbook. Take a different professor.",0
"He does the bare minimum to teach, breezes through material & does not like to explain concepts. Also, we used a book that was mainly online & this was not communicated well. I did not know how to use the book until 3 weeks into the semester. Do not take if you have not had a math course in a while.",0
stay away from harry,0
"Chem 42. She was very passionate about teaching, and chemistry. Excellent at explaining what needed to be done, is understanding, and cares about her student's grades. Overall great teacher.",1
"This man is so dry and doesn't explain concepts in class, please note that he tries to make his class harder semester by semester.",0
"This class was a little difficult, but you are given all the resources to pass, on the first day. Yashica is very easy going and understanding. She gives a couple chances to pass the weekly tests. The textbook wasn't the best; I learned more from KhanAcademy, which is recommended in her syllabus. Just be ready to put in time with this course.",1
"Dana is one of the best professors I've had so far. He genuinely cares about his students and will work with you as much as needed. He does do in-class pop quizzes but if you keep up on the homework, they are very doable.",1
She is terrible and never seems happy. Looks like she is mad and serious all the time. I don't like that attitude in a professor. Her test are much! harder than what she actually teaches you. She also treats her students like its high school.,0
"Well, she's a smart individual and you can tell that she's a good chemist. However teaching is not for her, it doesn't mean if you're good at something that you're automatically good at teaching it, probably research is her play ground but NOT teaching. Get ready to be your own tutor!!",0
Nice guy..funny..he goes over tests after TA grades and makes them better,1
"I dont know why this professor has so many good ratings. He assigns over 100 pages of readings per week. Attendance and participation is required and if you dont participate your grade will spike dramatically. Additionally, he grades essays extremely harshly and is hard to understand in class. I do not recommend.",0
"Prof. Qualls is an amazing teacher. He is brilliant and deeply interested in the material. He is a tough grader, but will make you a better writer. One of the best profs at this college, hands down. Take a class with him, regardless of your major, you won't regret it.",1
"I would absolutely NEVER RECOMMEND this professor. She is the WORST TEACHER I have ever had. She want's people to fail. She grades extremely hard and hates to answer your questions. I didn't believe the reviews until I saw it for myself. I have a GPA of 3.6 and barely passed this class with a c. Students beware, RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!!!!!",0
"Susan sets you up to succeed! Go to class and take notes and do as much of the homework as you can and you will do well. She also gives practice exams before the tests and they're super helpful. She's a very fair grader, has clear lectures, and she's obviously passionate about stats, which makes it more enjoyable.",1
"If you are required to take Greek and Latin vocab do NOT take it here with Cerutti. Although he is very knowledgeable on these topics, we did not learn anything about Greek or Latin after the second week of class. Not to mention having to spend money on a work book that we didnt use. Although he is an interesting person I dont recommend his class",0
"He is a great prof! So much knowledge on what he is teaching and he makes is applicable to real life that is happening. Half of his grading comes from being in class, so make sure you can attend class before you choose him. His notes are a bit different but they make sense for the ideas he is teaching. Overall, enjoyed his class.",1
"Worst professor ive ever taken! No assignments and he grades the test like a complete moron. His teaching style is the worst ive ever seen, he just yells at at the class. The man doesnt even have an email, you have to call his landline and talk to his wife before you have to talk to him. You also can only miss class twice, please dont take him!",0
This class covers a lot of material but she does a good job to make it clear what is the most important and what is going to be on quizzes/midterm/final. She's nice and fairly funny-- a good morning person if you have to take her class early. She covers the readings in class very well so you almost don't even have to read the textbook.,1
He made me not want to take a Bio class ever again. ( he is not approachable),0
This class was not enjoyable at all. The lectures were boring and you have to take notes the entire class or you may miss something important. The exams were really challenging for no reason and always included questions that were confusing and unclear. Putting in a lot of work may not even get you a decent grade. Avoid this class if possible.,0
"Great teacher! I had him as my micro professor for my 1st term as a freshman. He made the course very durable and easy to understand. Just as a warning, he gives his exams a heavy weight so if you do poorly on one of them your grade might suffer a little bit. However, even still, as long as you pay attention in class & do your hw you will be fine",1
"grubb is an odd man. the class isn't awful he makes the material more interesting than it is...3 tests all essay, but theyre not really essays HE JUST WANTS NUMBERS, if you just regurgitate back the little statistics he gives out in class youll be fine. no TB.",1
Dr. Currier explains a difficult subject very clearly.  This class does require you to study.   Attend class and take advantage of the extra credit and C should be easily attained.,1
"I'm still using what I learned from ""Professa"" in the late 80""s.  Yes, caring and passionate about her field.  Wants you to do well and you will, if you work hard. She gives great notes...study them and you will perform well on her exams!!",1
Prof Dietrich is a not an easy professor but truly cares about her students! She's always willing to explain all questions and is very easy to find outside of class. Overall great class!,1
"Professor Al-Mallah has a great personality and is super into poetry, and overall is a great teacher. His class has easy readings but grading on quizzes can be tough, so really pay attention to lectures and do all the readings. Participation is also a big grade, so try to contribute a few times a week.",1
"Have never gotten an A before in college. Don is the best. He keeps class really interesting. Wish some of the profs in nursing were this good! No surprises. Just a decent guy, funny and obviously knows his stuff.",1
"Her class is not suitable for beginners. The instructions for assessments are not clear. The focus points on each class hard to follow. Unreasonable time management for each project. Hard to communicate. Useless feedback. When you ask her a question, her feedback is not what you asking, her feedback is what she wants to say, and this is not",0
John Shon's class was a pleasure to be in. He made Accounting interesting and showed he was very knowledgable about the subject matter. His grading criteria is clear and the quizzes and mid-term were easy if you studied and paid attention in class. A good man and pretty funny as well.,1
"Vraimenr ennuyant comme cours. Le livre suffit pour la matière. Les examens ne traitent même pas de la matière vu en classe, c'est seulement de la logique. Ce n'est aucunement du par coeur, mais du bon sens. Elle est très généreuse dans la correction des travaux et le cours est facile a passé. Personne coule.",0
She is boring and her tests are hard! She asks very specific questions about pointless facts. Worst class ever.,0
He doesnt teach you he basically expects you to watch most of the lectures and test are basically your only grade with averages around 40/124 on all of them. He also says he doesnt curve bit if he didnt no one would pass his class.,0
Had him for Calc I and he was pretty good. Took him again for ELA and it was one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Relies way too much on being able to do proofs on both homework quizzes and exams. I learned more from the book than I did from him.,0
"Professor Wallace was so approachable, he made clear how to get an A in the class, the instructions were clear and when many people were failing he got an extra assignment so people can catch up. Even though the lectures can be heavy i always tried to participate and he would always answer my questions. Thanks professor Wallace",1
"I took her 4920 & 4930 course, she is AMAZING. She cares about her students and is willing to meet with them (even via zoom). I recommend taking her any chance you can. She is one of my favorite professors at CSULA. I hope to take senior seminar with her !",1
"Prof. Maojoudi was a good teacher, he taught at a fast pace that was hard to learn, but he made sure we understood by asking us if we had questions . The examples he used were great and is related to real life. His quizzes were ok, but his exams were hard. There is a 2 page essay and homework that you would have to do every week. Great experience.",1
He is not very caring,0
Expect to receive most of your learning experience by reading the book. I'm upset this teacher talked about everything but accounting for most of class. Homework given but randomly requested back for grading. No study guides for tests. Interested in busting people on cells or talking than more than teaching. Couldn't learn.,0
She goes way too fast through the material,0
"Extremely disorganized would often forget what he was talking about, and then move on to a different subject or problem. Test are more difficult than they should be, in fact the class average was failing for all 4 of them. I would not take him again.",0
"I learned a lot and worked hard, but my grade did not reflect my efforts. The highest grade on assignments/exams is usually a B. Average grade is barely passing. You will learn a lot in her class, but at the cost of your GPA; no matter how hard you work.",0
"Deb is my favorite teacher I've had at Duke so far. Her French is fluent and crystal clear. She is very nice and she puts all her effort into making class a fascinating an educational time. As long as you participate and do all the readings, her class is fairly straightforward. After this semester, my French is a lot better.",1
He really wants to help you learn. Hes new at teaching but knows that and makes the class super fair. Im not good at accounting but this prof is always accessible to help you through the class. He wants you to succeed and get the best grade possible. He makes accounting class better by using real world examples. Hes very kind and approachable.,1
Whatever you do...DO NOT TAKE HER.,0
This teacher is so nice! I don't know why anyone would not want to take her. She is willing to stay after class to help you if you need help or you can stop in her office. She tells you what's going to be on the test so you can study what you need to study. I would recommend her to anyone. She brings treats for the class at times to. Loved her!!!!!,1
Eugene was really passionate about teaching and really cares about his students. Tough grader when it comes to the final project but he is only pushing you to do your best. Very understanding and wants to help you and see you succeed.,1
"I normally don't write these, but I felt it was necessary. Mike is the BEST professor I have ever had. He cares about every one of his students as if they were his own kids. He worked to have all our material online so we wouldn't have to pay. He also will do anything he can to make sure he does not miss class. UNR is truly lucky to have him.",1
If you dont take him for PPS you must want to fail it.  He's the man and always willing to help.  I had him at 8AM and it didnt bother me.,1
"Great Professor, not great class. I highly recommend Bernstock if you want an art history class. She is enthusiastic, knowledgable, and helpful. US Art from FDR to Reagan however had useless lectures and no room for class participation. I did just as well going to every class as my friends who went to lecture twice.",1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this teacher. I wish he taught Calculus as well!,1
"He's a nice, but not a strong professor. If you want to take the class because you want to be an auditor, you will not learn enough to make it. He's emotional. He graded one exam all semester. He did ALL the semester grading on the last weekend before submitting the final exam to the school. Never gave feedback on personal papers unless hunted down",0
Professor Jarcho is fine. The TA is the worst nightmare of the class. Gives your paper the lowest grade you would ever get in any classes and doesn't explain why. TA does all the grading so be prepare to fail.,0
"Professor Morgan is an awesome professor! He made sure that everyone understood what was going on in lecture. I had to retake this class and I would recommend him any day. The other professor I had was awful, they really do make or break a class. We had to buy tophat, but got extra credit for it! Also, just a couple test and quizzes, gives help!!",1
"You are graded by 3 things. Attendance, 1 paper, and 1 test. It sucks because you are not graded off many things so your grade can go easily down, but you have no homework. He uses words that don't even make sense and writes on the board and doesn't even organize it, its all over the place. Not a good prof, didn't learn anything.",0
"The good reviews for her are mainly because of the fact that she was kinda nice. Her exams were a different story. She does a review before the test but you're better off studying the whole manual. The exams are misleading, even when you study everything she says to. She also grades harshly and these exams can make or break your final bio grade.",0
"He sometimes is excessively literate, meaning most of the time no one even can comprehend what he is saying. Although, he is a very good person and respectful of everyone's wishes.",1
"She deducts points fast!  I wish she inspired me and all the other students in class.  Even though I passed with an A, I would recommend any other student to take another instructor.",0
i'll wait till i see my grade...then i shall comment. lol. nooo am kidding. seriously...he is a cool guy...very lax and seriously you learn alot of interesting things. Makes you think too. I loved the class. the whole 6 to 9 thing was a bit much though. But fun nontheless.,1
Don't,0
Je déteste son cours et le prof est assez spécial merci... Cependant il nous donne beaucoup d'informations utiles.,1
Taking this class during covid 19 pandemic. His setup is a camera pointed at the whiteboard. It is constantly unfocused and he stands in front of his writing making it very hard to take notes. I contacted the engineering department to help set him up with a digital whiteboard and was told he had one and didn't want to use it.,0
He's a really good guy with the best of intentions. He's always there for you if you need him. My only complaint is that he doesn't always answer questions straight. He answers with another question to make you think things through. This can be rather frustrating at times. But he's a very nice person and a strong ally to have.,1
"Because classes moved online the math dep. was very strict about time limits for quizzes and tests which heavily affected my grade. That being said, Dr. Vutha was amazing and did everything he could to make this semester easier. The notes he makes for his lectures are absolutely incredible and he is very funny. He replies fast and willingto help.",1
"Incredibly unhelpful, unprofessional, and uncaring. He seems to bully and ridicule his students to inflate his own ego. While hes intelligent, and knows his material, he has not the first clue on how to translate it and make it accessible for students. Avoid this professor at all costs, you will not have a good semester or final grade.",0
"Li was a very nice professor, but he was so dry in his lectures and had the hardest tests of all the calc 3 profs at A&M. Don't take if you can avoid. Studied so hard for his class and got straight Bs on everything. DO THE PRACTICE and HOMEWORK!",0
"I have taken college level Anthropology courses before and loved them, but this class was horrible. Dr. De Cunzo is very vague in what she wants from your assignments. She will not discuss the reasoning behind your grades. And she is also the department chair so you can't really do anything about it. I highly recommend you do not take this class.",0
Butt is super cool and a great professor. You have to go to class and participate to do well in the class but he's so interesting you'll want to go to hear his stories. The whole class is one big discussion of literature its cool,1
"His lectures are typical to that of other professors. He is a tough grader. Have to work for an A in this class. I would recommend, with a extra effort it is possible. I took him for management cluster.",1
Lecture heavy and most of what he lectures on does not correlate to the 2 exams you take throughout the semester. exams are hard but you can make up points through the 3 other assignments you do. He gives his opinion and if you disagree he will belittle you in front of the class. If you ask a question about anything he will also belittle you. awful,0
"Organic II can be a hard course, but it doesn't have to be. She's very nice, but as a teacher she lacks the ability to communicate material effectively. You feel rushed, as if Organic Chemistry is some trial-by-fire all scientists must endure. It's a ridiculous notion to expect most students to absorb the material given presentation style.",0
"Professor Gross was a very nice and patient professor, however the information that was given was a lot to handle for each test. Get ready to have 7 lectures, a few labs, and usually 6 chapters on each test. She curves each test which is very nice, but it is tough if you are not very interested.",1
Not a good prof at all. Rambles during lectures and goes off topic frequtly. Lectures are all over the place. Do not recommend her.,0
"One of the best professors at UHD by far. Pretty much an easy A if you put in a little effort. Never had a single boring lecture. Genuinely helped me with my fears of public speaking. 10/10 love this guy, absolutely recommend.",1
"Took ANTH101 online, absolutely terrible, would NOT recommend. All discussion posts are pointless, quizzes don't make any sense/have much relevance to what was actually discussed in lectures. I didn't learn much of anything about anthropology, yet spent way too much time doing work for this class.",0
Professor Cox makes Anthropology fun I was nervous going into this class having no knowledge of the subject but I was able to walk away with so much information and understanding of biological anthropology and the differences in the anthropology. If you are thinking of taking this class I recommend it but you will have to put the effort in.,1
"She talks about personal life more than she teaches. does not offer any help when a person is asking. she rely too much on student help. Her accent is heavy, so you wont understand what she says, and she don't repeat herself. I am not bad at math, its actually my favorite subject but she makes me HATE it. DON'T BOTHER",0
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
"Great teacher! Interesting lectures! Very inspirational. He knows what he is talking about and make it very fascinating to listen to! There are required observation hours in a school, but other than that the tests were online and rare hw. Would definitely take again!  Cares about students and wants others to care about kids with special needs.",1
"She is a very nice lady but her classes are extremely boring. The three exams are easy and for the research paper you get to pick your topic. The books are only needed to create study guides for her exams, however she takes information from them for the exams so they are needed. If you take this class, drink coffee before you go.",1
Dr.Nikkel was a fair teacher for the most part. He seems to really enjoy what he dose for a living. His class is mostly him running about the room and looking at these videos. I liked him cuz his work was stright to the point and he really wanted his studnets to learn. Also i got my best naps in his class.,1
"Philbin is a really nice guy and easy to get along with.  Class was very easy and there are dissapointingly few projects.  There isn't much film involved, or really production for that matter, maybe 5-10 days throughout the semester.",1
Good Spanish teacher,1
Overall a very good teacher. She will explain things 100x if needed and never gets mad. She gives a lot of tests but that's the only thing you have to do in this class. So no hw or assignments. You are required to get the textbook but you don't have to use it because she gives all the same info in her powerpoints.,1
She is an awesome teacher and I would take her for every English class if I could.  She makes sure that you understand everything before you take that final exam.,1
"Bill is one of my favorite professors I have ever had. Math is daunting to many people, and he really has a way of simplifying and demystifying algebra. His homework is short and easy, and he is a kind grader. Just be prepared to talk in class, as he is a fan of class participation on the regular. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
This teacher deserves an award. He is outstanding. Makes the material very interesting and loves his job. I have taken 2 of his classes and loved both of them. Would highly recommend.,1
"This class ultimately isn't that bad. He is super repetitive with things and mumbles a good amount, but the material itself actually is interesting. If you find it interesting beforehand and just study on your own, youll do fine. Sometimes class can be confusing because he assumes there is a majority of surfers in the class, and theres not.",1
"Wastes time on stuff not on exam. Forces you to talk in class. Rarely available for help, either doesn't answer email or takes a week, does NOT show up to open office hours. Takes forever to grade things - had over a month to mark a test and paper worth 40%, but only let us know marks day of the final.  Have to take his class? Skip, read the text.",0
"The worst teacher I have had in my college career.  I am not the best at math, and immediately sought out help for the class.  She repeats the same information over and over again in lecture, barely making it through half of what is required.  Went to office hours for help and she insulted my intelligence for not understanding. She is rude, no help",0
Make sure you have a good relationship with Mohun. She often grades based on how much she thinks you care about the class.,1
I took this as I thought it would be easy but it turned out to be one of the hardest classes ive taken at the university and ive taken organic chemistry so thats saying a lot.,1
"Ok so as a person, Kelli is great. As a teacher, she sucks. Meandering lectures, literally NO feedback till the last possible second, and she grades everything at the end of the semester when it's too late to change or help your grade. She's also not super reachable, often if you message her on Slack she'll ignore it till you @ her.",0
"You are expected to already know linear algebra, dirac notation and any other math required for quantum mechanics. He will half (at most) work through problems or concepts and then not understand why you aren't ""getting it"". He can be a nice guy and will take some extra time during office hours. He can be short and condescending.",0
"Professor Choi, (NOW BAEK, because of marriage), amazing professor, lectures are so clear, no-book, very, very clear notes, relates the subject to real life situations. Homework is assigned, but you get the solutions, so take very good notes! they're tests and a final exam, kinda forgot whether we had a midterm or not but I don't recall taking one",1
"People complain that Dr. Blackaby is hard because they don't know how to follow him and they don't bother to put the work into the class. If you are smart about the work, this class will easily be one of your favorite classes you take at DBU. Honors for a reason, but you won't regret it. Also, get to know Dr. Blackaby. He takes care of his students",1
"I went into college loving English, I have always passed my English classes with A+/100% as my final grade but this class? This professor makes me dislike English and makes me not want to write which is something I personally love to do. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR.",0
"Gives terrible feedback, misspells almost everything, demands too much for how little he seems to care about the students.",0
Awesome professor. She gives out a lot of helpful examples and is very helpful during her office hours. You do need to work for your grade but it's not too hard. You'll do well as long as you study and do the extra credit,1
"Mr. Hayes is a wonderful professor and human being! I always liked psychology, but now I love it. He does not just teach a class, he introduces you to the world of human behavior. He works for the good of his fellow man and not just a paycheck. SVCC is blessed(and should feel honored) to have a staff member of this caliber!",1
"Professor Killough is a very tough professor. I put lots of effort into her assignments and in return got poor grades with little to no useful or helpful feedback. She is also not easily approachable, as to when she responded to a question I had it left me feeling like I had no actual help, or I should have somehow known it already.",0
"lectures. all test/quizzes are on vocabulary. he's a conservative, so prepare to stand by your opinion if you're liberal. put together a montage about hamlet that he'll talk about endlessly. don't take his class in the morning, will bore you to death.",0
"100 level course, yet we were asked to write 3 page papers weekly.  Course load is heavy, but then the midterm and final are the only time the text book was actually used in the class.  Graded strictly on grammar, and marked down for things that were direct quotes from citations.  I'm now in a 200 level writing course that requires less.",0
"Very tough grader. Its evident how he tries to nail key Calculus concepts into your head. Workload is monumental. Hes a great person and will walk you through it, but will make you think more than anything. I thin thats his main thing is to make you think. Anyways, tons of work and deadlines will hit you in the face if behind. best of luck",1
"Amazing teacher... taught me to write. Oh, and he wears the BEST ties.",1
"Attitude, Class is always about Advertising, and really gets upset about a lot.Hope you like red marks on your papers, because thats what your going to get.",0
"I loved Dr. Peelers class! He even brought in his dog on the last day. Lays out everything you need to do to succeed and if you put in the effort, he notices. Gives great advice too! Cant wait to have him again for cell bio next semester!",1
"One of the worst teachers that I've ever had. Extremely difficult, tough grader, doesn't explain herself clearly... more than half of my class either dropped out or got an F because of her teaching methods. Do not take this teacher!",0
"heard this was an easier course but it ended up being the worst grade ive got so far in uni, he lectured & you had to write down what he said but he spoke so fast so its hard to get everything down. With the textbook readings and the novel, and with the course content itself was not easy. i had to do my midterm while packing to go home for covid-19",0
She doesn't clearly explain the assignment and grades extremely harshly. My friend took the same course with another teacher and I have been helping her quite a bit. She has managed to ace the course. I have put in a lot of work into my assignments and her topics are extremely boring and there isn't much room for brainstorming.,0
"Very nice person and great class! However, very disorganized.",1
"If you want to learn, take his class. He is a really good teacher who is always willing be happy to help students. You will see he put his effort to his work. You will learn and improve a lot from his class. However, if you look for an easy class and easy grade, do not take this class.",1
"If you know nothing about history, then be prepared to pay close attention. He expects you to have some background information on the subjects.  it is very difficult to take notes in this class because he just talks and talk and talks. funny guy but not a good teacher. ",0
"4 tests she drops 1. Has 1 assignment out of 40 that she grades harshly on. Makes you use lockdown browser for online tests. Test questions were hard to understand. For each test we have around 8 video lectures, each one an hour long. Hard to know what you need to study when watching the videos. Wouldnt recommend for a easy GE class",0
"Dr. Sachdev is very disorganized, and gave me an 80 for class participation when I had attended more classes than she did. I learned some things in her class, but I honestly felt that her class was very dull. I would absolutely not recommend her.",0
"I don't understand how he's even employed at GVSU, I have never had a worse teacher or prof. If you have questions in the class he wont really answer them. This was a synchronous and asynchronous class, his videos were never helpful and he never taught during our zoom meetings, he gave us homework on things that were never explained or taught.",0
One off the best Prof at GBC. I recommend you take this guy course he will change your life.,1
Seemed to expect us to be experts on everything before he even talked about it in class. Tests were very difficult and specific.,0
"Truly enjoyed the course! Well prepared, always willing to hold extra office hours. Prof. Katselis has a deep knowledge of the course material and he can easily simplify difficult concepts, his teaching style helped a lot!",1
"Compton is such a great happy person. I took College Algebra with him and I am awful at math, but it wasn't so bad. We get to have a page of notes and a take home part on the tests. The only downside is the tests are worth 90% of our grade and we have a quiz everyday that is 10%. On the quizzes we can work in a group though and he is very helpful.",1
"Gives ok notes and examples are mostly from the book. If you can learn by yourself, then you don't need to go to lecture. exams are like homework/in class examples but are still different. did a little below averages for midterms not sure about the final and ended up with a C with the curve.",1
 This is the hardest class i have ever taken. A lot of work and reading to prepare for tests. The tests are long and you only have the class time to finish. ,0
"Gives back hw months later and its all 50% bc he wants a specific way and never tells you or shows you. Exams are open book but you can get points taken off every little thing (lines, misspelling, conversion). Very old school and hard to get to because he has a hour long wait in his office because he cant communicate with students. miserable exp",0
"Funny, but lazy and class was an insane waste of time after the first test. If he didn't feel like teaching he'd just pop in a movie. Sounds easy but his tests were intentionally tricky to make it seem like his class was harder than it really was. Wouldn't take again.",0
"Alright, Ted is a great guy. Young, relates well to students, cracks jokes, knowledgeable. But he was very unclear and even confused himself at times teaching the slides; students had to correct his mistakes. His tests are ridiculously long and hard, even for a 50 minute class. Also, if you ask him a question during a test, he won't help at all.",0
Rudest and unhelpful professor ever. She's out of the country 2/3 of the semester and does not return grades on papers and midterms until almost the end of the semester. She never replies to emails and when she does she's so rude. The tests are impossible and not from the book. She does not care for students and does not deserve to be a professor. ,0
Don't take the class if he is the teacher. ,0
"His quarrels with Paul Koch were hilarious.  A super bright guy who knows a heck of a lot about Earth Sciences.  A little intimidating at times,  but really nice once you get to know him.",1
"Hes a nice guy but teaching is not his strong point.  He said he was ""trying something new"" and gave us 500+ questions to put into a notebook. Each question required multiple answers. Barely any review for exams and often gave us wrong chapters and pages to study.",0
"Professor Jaja was always available after class when I had questions that needed to be answered. You need to pay attention in class and study a lot. Its not an easy A , but if you work for it and asked questions you will do fine. She is very kind and approachable if you are respectful to her as usually expected by any professor.",1
"This guy is funny as hell and if you talk to him outside of class he will always help you out.  He also reminds me of Joe Pesci and curses almost constanly. He also doesn't put up with any crap either.  So, if you're a lazy ass bum like one person that commented earlier then don't take the class.  Probably the funnest class I've had because of him.",1
"Tends to use internet videos as a tool to teach students and requires students to participate in saying what they learned from the video. If not, a pop quiz is promptly given. Lectures given are over  PowerPoints that are recited word for word.  Doesn't express much enthusiasm in the field of psychology.",0
"best prof ive ever had at ud, takes time to explain material and genuinely wants students to do well. such a nice guy",1
good professor. easy class. you do have to read and participate though. if the class participates she excludes the final. I would highly recommend her.,1
Is not attentive to students. She does not answer emails. Grading is straight foward but assignments are beyond confusing. Textbook used is confusing as well. ,0
"Amazing teacher. Seriously, just go in and have fun and do the work. He's great if you don't have an ego.",1
"Do NOT take this professor. He is very unaccommodating and goes back on his word, said he would accept an assignment, then didn't. He says he cares about his students but does nothing to show that. He even went out of his way to make class SIGNIFICANTLY harder on his students once we changed to all online in the Spring 2020 semester due to COVID-19",0
"Is unfriendly and condescending based on mood, quizzes are memorization which dont help with writing or speaking the language. Midterms and finals are from worksheets but even after studying everything he manages to twist the exams so that everything the students studied for werent actually on the exam or were replaced with something else.",0
Awesome Professor,1
"The most arbitrary grade I have ever received. Most of the grade is his opinion on your ""participation"". I learned NOTHING in this class. The material was basically pop psychology. To hammer the point home again, Meyer and his class was useless in every sense of the word.",0
"I love this professor. He is helpful and neat with everything. He even decided to make the quizzes a group. When you do the clicker, it is just to show that you are present in class.",1
"Dr. Bhattacharya makes it very clear what you have to do to get an A in his course. He very much so cares about setting you up for a good career. If you need help or if you are struggling with your schedule, he will work with you. He is extremely understanding and his lectures are easy to follow. You should definitely complete the readings though.",1
"Dr. Lyall is a very good professor to take For intro to counseling. For the class you will read a self-help book and do a summary for each chapter (about 15 chapters throughout the semester). His lectures are funny, interesting and informative and you will learn the basics of a being a counselor in his class.  He's an easy grade and gives easy test",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you want to pass.,0
"Mrs. McGee is a great professor. You will have to work hard though, she grades the open ended questions pretty toughly, but she gives you study guides so you know what to expect. You will be able to pass if you put the work in, and she posts the powerpoints online so that you're able to stay on track.",1
"He's an easy A but that's all you'll get out of this class. You probably wont learn much if anything even though he loves to ask at the end of every class if you've ""learned something today"". I would avoid him at all costs.",0
Not my favorite. Test and project heavy. He rambles on and repeats lectures. Choose your group members wisely. Group evals have an important role in determining your grade. He is super passionate about the subject (maybe too much). He makes the tests way harder than they should be. No extra credit. I would not take him again!,0
"He is a horrible professor I really do not recommend anyone to take his class he talks down to you like if you are a moron, says horrible mean jokes, and his grading is just horrible DO NOT DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!",0
lectures were boring and he talked for the entire class. material wasn't super interesting and tests were hard,0
"Tons of reading, power points, and research.",0
extremely tyrannical in his teaching style and seems to like prostelitizing more than discussing topics from the readings. all i learned from his course was about the kenyon college plagarism conduct,0
Spanish classes are taught at a very rapid pace. somewhat unclear about assignments at times but overall an enjoyable prof.,1
I loved having Prof. Lamas. He came to class full of energy and looked genuinely happy to be there. His papers are the most challenging thing about the class as he really makes you think critically about them.,1
Best teacher I have ever had. He believes in us as students; takes our art seriously. He makes me want to put 1000% into my work and actually exhibit it. Also a great sense of humour.,1
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
"students do more teaching then teacher.  even if the student is wrong the teacher doesn't even correct the students. class average for midterm is 68%, most people are failing. I have two As and a B in my other classes and I am barley passing with a C.  takes forever to grade. only half way though semester and not liking it.",0
"If you skip assignments in this class or skip class in general, you are going to be in serious trouble.  If you are looking for a comprehensive U.S. History course, look somewhere else.  This class was very ""social issue"" driven and lots of important aspects and events in U.S. history were simply not covered.",0
"TAKE THIS CLASS!Great teacher. She explains things in a way that is so clear and easy to understand. She spends the class going over everything and homework is really easy. The tests are based off of practice exams that she provides a key for. She sets you up for success, as long as you try you will pass this class. I actually understand math now!",1
"Very professional and wonderful communication skills. Passionate in convictions and dressed smart, sophisticated and classy. I highly recommend this professor .",1
"Easy class, just do the discussion boards and papers and you will do fine. The papers are easy but sometimes left open-ended. This results in a bit of confusion, but just email him and he will clear anything up.",1
"Great teacher, best one I've had so far. She's so sweet and very clear and specific during her lectures. They might be a little long but they're very helpful. Goes over what will be on tests and will help you whenever you need it! I would take her every year if I could!",1
"I think Dr. Chapman is a great professor. I rarely go to his office hours, but I do enjoy his lectures. He really cares about the topic and will tell you what he expects you to know on the exams. His tests are hard, but only if you don't pay attention and don't study.",1
"Dr. Busch is a fantastic woman. She is very nice and funny. The class is never boring. She sings and dances. She's very laid back but still teaches very well. Not much work, only a midterm and a final and a final project.",1
"She always seemed super bored in lecture and sometimes wouldn't even know what she was teaching us or how to answer a student's question. She was not good at explaining concepts and once we got past the basics, it got really confusing. The midterm had stuff we never learned and I don't think she even graded our finals.",0
"He's a Harvard grad who's been teaching at UD for maybe 40 years.... Very pretentious and knows everything, and absolutely everything. WILL take up the whole class period, and go over. Make sure to read whatever is assigned.",1
Young is a very great professor.  He teaches from the book.  He is one of my fav. teachers.  He always remember me a year and half later and I wasn't even taking any of his classes at the time either.  He's really cool.  I really enjoyed the class.  You learn a lot.,1
"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",0
"It's a miracle I even passed the class; I'm still not sure how I did. He makes things SO much harder than they need to be.When you ask questions, he looks at you like your dumb. I quit going to class all together and got a tutor. Study by the sample test; they are IDENTICAL to his real ones. Good Luck!",0
"Difficult class for a gen ed, lecture heavy, but everything you need for the tests he WILL go over in his lectures. Take really good notes, and ask if you need help, he's very supportive.",1
"Attendance is a must. She is fun to listen to, and she will talk the whole hour on the text. But if you can voice your opinion and give good feedback, she'll be grateful. I think the final was a 6-8 page research paper. Easy A. Take her classes if you are interested in ethnic literature and British lit. And go one time at least to her office hours.",1
I believe Mr. Walters wants his students to understand the subject however I found myself trying to understand the expectation of an assignment taxing and never enjoyed learning the material. It was frustrating to spend a considerable amount of time to follow assignment guidelines only to be docked points based on an unwritten/unspoken expectation.,0
"Portfleet is great! She makes you think and really explore what she is teaching, you wont be just reading out of a textbook but rather reading straight from some of the greatest writers in history! She really will open up your mind and let you explore!",1
She is kind of hard to understand and doesnt really teach it just does examples she is confusing she even confuses herself but on the other hand the quizzes are online and if u miss less than 4 classes then u dont have to take the final,0
Dr. Wisotzki is a great professor. Definitely take her before leaving Loyola. She is brilliant and her lectures are interesting. You will want to go to class!,1
I took this class on webct and the questions were challenging but in the end he really helped me out. He answers emails ans returns phone calls not a bad professor.,1
"Pell is a nice person and is helpful and easy to reach via email, however she is the hardest prof, AVOID IF YOU CAN.  2 sets of homework due every sunday at midnight and they can be really long.  I strongly recommend you find a study group to help with the homework because they are alot different from what you do in class.  EXAMS ARE HARD",0
"Mr. Abutayeb was, and still is the worst teacher I have ever had. He kicked me out of the classroom because another person kept turning around and talking, then he thought it was ME he was talking to. I tried to explain to him the what happened, but he just called security on both of use. WORST TEACHER EVER!!! GOOD LUCK WITH THIS GUY!!!",0
Great professor! I took him for ENG 1101 and 1102 and passed both classes with A's. He's very professional and passionate about the subject he teaches. He has the entire class outlined day-to-day so you know when everything is due and what you'll be doing in class. I also feel he's very generous when it comes to grading papers.,1
"Gasparian is hard to understand. His explanations are not clear and he just brushes you off if you still don't understand. The tests are not easy, even though they are open book, open notes. I would not take this professor again. He was not prepared for any class, he just walked in and didn't know what was going on for the day.",0
"She is such a sweet woman, but her grading scale is ridiculously hard. The papers that were assigned had nothing to do with what was covered in class, which made the classes seem useless to attend. If you're looking for an easy A, do not take this class. I had done very well in English during HS, but she sure showed me that college is different.",0
took during covid 19. where to begin with this one. the teacher had us use MML by Pearson for the whole class. every week we did seven or more homeworks with a varying number of problems. for a full explanation go to google and search mymathlab reddit (cant post link so gl),0
LOVE HER! Take this class! It is really fun and makes you want to participate and write,1
"Tough course, but you have a variety of people more than willing to help. She moves through her lectures fast, but she offers outlines of everything she goes over. If you are taking this course you must have taken 67 A so be prepared to incorporate what you learned from A into B. Go to her office hours, tutors and don't be afraid to ask questions.",1
"If you have the chance to get another professor, do it. She doesnt cover over half of the material on her exams. You dont have to pay attention in class, just memorize concepts and figures from the textbook and youll do fine on the exams (she dropped one exam for my class). She also gives really vague instructions for the group project.",0
Prof. Lopez is a great teacher. He presents the material clearly and makes it applicable to every day things. Take him if you can!!,1
"Lisa is the most incredible professor I have ever worked with.  She is challenging, expects great things, and will push you to become the best teacher out there.  She cares about her students, and your future students, more than anything and will support you to the max.  Her classes require hard work, organization, and dedication; you will work!",1
"Decent professor. You will think you don't know squat based on the quizzes (pop quizzes, by the way). Study hard for the final and do the homework. The material might seem hard in the beginning, but it really isn't.",1
"Took Prof. Osoba two semesters back-to-back and not only did he remember past students, but he would also genuinely take the time to ask how you've been, what you've been up to, and will reference past class information. He's quite old-fashioned and is a very paper and pencil type of guy, but he's a fair grader, and the syllabus is easy to follow.",1
Great teacher who is there to help you find your way. 102 can be a tough course - don't expect to get an easy A. But Melissa makes it very straightforward to succeed. If you're in the Honors section be prepared for an extra project.,1
Mrs. Elizondo seems kind of tough at times but she is only preparing you for what comes next. She is an overall AMAZING Wonderful instructor and I can not wait to have her again for MIcro !  ,1
He makes class engaging with his fun stories and lectures are pretty straight-forward. He is not clear on assignments though. Quizzes and tests were hard. He expects you to basically memorize the book word for word.,0
He has been the worse professor by far at CSUB. I would not recommend him to anyone. I please advise you stay far away from him as possible. He talks a lot about himself and does not care about students.,0
"Although attendance is required, don't pay any attention to her lectures. Study straight from the book.She wants very detailed answers and is a little nitpicky when it comes to grading. She does curve, and if she doesn't get to a topic, she will delay tests. Everything is straight memorization from the book. If you're good at that, you'll get an A",0
mandatory lectures with exams that come straight from the book. tells pointless stories. makes everything super confusing. if you pull out your phone you will be kicked out of the class and failed. you basically sit there learning nothing and then you go home and teach yourself everything. avoid bijan!!! there are so many other amazing psych profs,0
"Madhu has specific unspoken criteria for assignments, even when you follow the syllabus she always finds ways to deduct points. Unlike other ECE profs, she does not accept missing assignments at the end of the semester, and you will get a zero for them. If you are having hardships in your personal life she isn't super compassionate or accommodating",0
"Professor Dank is cool but gives a lot of readings per class. Although this is a graduate level course, some of the readings are extremely long. Nevertheless, she is engaging, caring, and provides good lectures. I recommend taking her if you do not mind the reading load.",1
"Very kind and personable professor. She did go a bit slow at times, and I was often ahead of her myself. But it's an intro. class so you can't expect anything else. If anything she's a great professor for true beginners. Exams are easy if you do the practice exams she puts up beforehand. The class itself(labs)is challenging, but in a good way.",1
"He's a great teacher, very caring. Attendance is mandatory, do not take this class if you plan on skipping because you will be penalized for it. There are usually pop quizzes daily; do the homework and review notes. The tests aren't too bad except the final is killer. I would recommend him, but understand it will not be a cake walk.",1
Mr. Bannow is extremely condescending and borderline angry when a question is asked in class. He is obviously a very anxious person and when class gets off track he is visibly annoyed. He will shame you publicly if you give him the chance by asking a question about something he thinks he has covered enough already. You'll learn physics on your own.,0
Take CS 145. You will learn a lot of interesting stuff.,1
"He's pretty much crazy and entertaining during class but assigns SO MUCH reading for tests.  I had 30+ pages from his reading content. He babbles about nonsense in class and doesn't care if you show up. He has 15 or so journals assigned that are your own opinion. But the only grades are 4 exams, and that's all based on the reading.. way too much",0
"Miri is a genius.  Really knows the material, very willing to help students with problems.  Mumbles sometimes and will get distracted by students who ask interesting but irrelevant questions.  Quizzes and tests are modified HW problems.  HW is MasteringEngineering.com - not awful, could be much better.  Final was surprisingly hard.",1
"I, along with half of the class, dropped her class within less than 3 weeks of being in it. It's a hybrid classroom so she expects you to teach yourself literally everything and know it enough for a quiz the next day. And I am not just bad at stats, I took it at a community college online and did fine and understood everything.",0
"honestly save yourself the trouble and don't take this as a gen ed. not an easy A. also recitations are required and graded. homework is graded and if you get one wrong it brings down your grade even though you get 3 attempts. tests are also unnecessarily hard and super detail specific. seriously, don't take this class its not worth it.",1
Professor Head is hilarious. Makes the class very interesting. Has a lot of real world experience and the discussion is easy too. A must take class.,1
Mr. Tyson carries an extremely boring classroom. His prezies are not helpful at all. You need to be ready to put in effort outside of class by reading the textbook and interpreting it. Tests are tough and the questions are weirdly worded. Probably the hardest course I have taken at Missouri State.,0
Professor Waller is one of the best instructors I've had in my entire college history. She is approachable & respectful. She answers questions & provides great explanation. She had us do a lot of simulation & practice tests which were so helpful! her tests are fair & she spends time analyzing them & throwing away certain questions. she's amazing!,1
"You may want to throw a test rock in before entering her office. Sometimes she's great, helpful, interesting; sometimes she's stark raving mad (I mean ""Yellow Wallpaper"" mad).",0
"I've always been great at English classes, especially when it comes to a class like this where you write easily over 10 papers over the course of the semester. However, Professor Shannon was a pushover who wouldn't discipline anyone who talked over her or refused to pay attention to her lectures. She has such a quiet voice that is easily ignored.",1
the man knows a lot about the ocean but his lectures are as boring as watching paint dry. His knowledge of technology is terrible and usually put the opposite of what he says will be on the exam. the funniest thing about him was that he put his office hours around the same time as the class we had. Nice guy but you can tell he doesn't want to teach,0
"awful unclear professor, hard exams, unclear expectations",0
"Sam is honestly one of the coolest professors I've had. However, he does not use Powerpoint slides so you need to jot down notes during lecture + pay EXTRA attention because your notes will be your only reference. Lectures are discussion-based so you're free to interrupt and ask Qs. Homework are really helpful, exams are alright. Take the class!!",1
"This guy teaches at a 3rd grade level. Talks about who he knows even though, he often has never met these people. Brings in speakers for their benefit of trying to sell you their product. You learn nothing in this class and he is very unprofessional. Def not why I pay 40K to attend IU. Luckily, there's Kelley!",0
"Dr. Jinn doesn't care about long-term learning, and spent more time making fun of the students than lecturing about the content. He asked the female students inappropriate questions involving their romantic lives, and refused to answer good questions, such as ""why is ____ the case?"" All in all, I would not take this professor again.",0
DO NOT take class from this professor. He was the worst instructor I have ever had. I had to teach myself all of the class content from the text.,0
"The experience with Deyoung completely depends upon whether or not he likes you.  To some students, he can be helpful outside of class, while to others he can just make blatant attempts to make you look stupid and get lost in that.  The latter was my case, and I went from liking physics to despising him and the subject.  Don't get on his bad side!",0
"She was by far my least favorite college professor. She is extremely condescending and rude. If you do not agree with her, then you are wrong in her eyes. She is so closed minded and beyond unorganized. DO NOT TAKE HER!! She also makes it impossible to get an A (95%  A). She basically does whatever she wants and is always right. Take anyone else!!",0
"Masterson is do-able.. but I recommend that you have some background of calc before taking him. He can be unclear and confusing. I took calc before and I got a B+ after taking him. Don't freak out, just do the practice problems from the book he gives you, they are similar to  the ones on the test",0
Very poor teacher. Expects you to know the material before the semester begins. Won't help you in or outside of class to understand what the material covers. Has a holier than thou attitude towards his students. AVOID.,0
"Dr Chang teaches Probability Theory in a way that is plug chug. Does not go over the meaning of the topics in this course. Only shows how to compute Problems. The book chosen is a great book (Degroot), however, it can be hard to read at times. Due to Chang's teaching style, the proper book was not chosen. I will not be taking any courses with Chang",0
Horribly unorganized. Loses things often. Unclear. Handwriting is horrible and almost always makes mistakes so he has to go back and erase. Unclear grading criteria. He does give credit for trying but a grading scale is nonexistent. Only take him if you are good at math.,0
"I was really disappointed after taking this class. Dr. Misruda makes this class unnecessarily difficult for no reason. There's absolutely no rubric for assignments. He talks the whole lecture time without any participation, so it's really hard to pay attention. He will cover a needed topic one or two days before an assignment is due.",0
"Luley is an amazing professor. You absolutely do need to do the reading and homework as he does check for it, but I averaged about 8 hrs of HW time a week for his class and had to study very little for the tests. He's incredibly clear about his expectations and there are never any surprises about your grade or a test. I highly recommend his classes",1
Lectures are not effective at all! I took all exams without following the lectures and I got an A-,0
"Great professor and easy class. Although it was an online class, we had zoom sessions and he had guest speakers. Amazing lectures and extremely helpful professor. Easy class.",1
"Dr. Solano is a great professor. The class time is used to effectively explain the topics in the homework and everything on the exam very completely. He is very willing to help with any issues you have and is always willing to meet outside of class to help whenever needed. Definitely take his classes for OM 1 or 2, you wont regret it.",1
"Surprisingly dumb, how she got a Ph.D. I'll never understand. Can show a bit of a liberal bias in materials used and comments on Dems/Repubs, but if you can take that, it's pretty easy stuff.",1
"She is very tough, her grading method will hunt down your grade. She says that she is tough, and the test will be tough. You study very well, and you know the material, but the questions in tests are so specific that you don't know what she is talking about. Be ready for a lot of tricky questions. DON'T FOLLOW HER STUDY GUIDE, just study everything",0
"I took her remote class in the pandemic and it was rough. She graded nothing of mine until after the semester was over and she assigned multiple 100-400 point essays that were not only graded late, but also harshly. I also drowned in weekly assignments. She was laid back on due dates, so much so that it only became damaging to everyone in the end.",0
"Absolutely Hysterical, Really do your readings though! He likes to mess with your head on tests. watch family guy he loves it! And for the love of anything don't say good things about UCLA he hates them",1
"If you are interested in German, take her class! She makes sure that you understand and won't move on until you do. I've already signed up for her class next semester because she is such a great instructor.",1
"I took his online summer session College Algebra and it was way more work than I expected, but it was after all, a semester crammed into 9 weeks. I loved the detailed videos and his clever use of colors. If he was graphing, it was a color dedicated to each equation and he'd even do the written math in that color so you'd know later on when studying",1
I'm gonna get strait to the point. Lovely woman but definitely do not recommend taking her class unless it's mandatory. I often find myself showing up to class and doing other course work during her lecture and getting all the info I need from the slides come exam time. Her labs are incredibly convoluted and barely relate to course material.,0
"Attendance is mandatory. She'll take off points if you're tardy, miss class, or leave early. Her assignments are easy if you listen to her directions. She's strict, but it's only because she doesn't want students to take advantage/walk over her. If you want an A or a B in the class, you have to work for it. She wants you to be detail-oriented.",1
Somewhat disorganized and tends to get off the subject to talk about things that interest her.  I didn't really get anything out of the class.,0
"This is my second time taking Bijan. Had him for 160 & failed, so decided to try him again. If you want to do well, you need to teach the actual material to yourself. He always curves exams. Great guy with a lot of wisdom & experience. I loved listening to him talk about life but if you have a hefty schedule I would not recommend.",1
great class and prof,1
"He's a nice man and he does care, but he can be incredibly harsh. If you're sticky on a subject, he may call you out and it doesn't feel like constructive criticism. The worst part though was the questions on quizzes and exams were impossible. As soon as I thought I studied well, the exam threw me for a loop. He's not 100% bad, but not my favorite",0
"Une vrai Joke, y connait meme pas sa matiere.",0
Very uninterested in success of students,0
"Doesn't feel like an Econ class, doesn't feel like an Econ professor. Grades consist of 26 page scientific research paper based on assigned reading of 5 of the most boring books I have read, a 20 minute project based on a single concept dealing with agriculture, and then attendance. He rambles over the hour and a half every single class.",0
"Singleminded, not helpful, poor presentation, has huge favorites/dislikes",0
"I found her to be a really good teacher, but at the same time, she assigned a lot of homework. Plus, there was a quiz every day! Also, in class it seemed like she would try to make students look bad when she asked them questions. She was good when you went outside of class to see her though. I wouldn't take her if you can help it.",1
"Jacqui is the best English professor/teacher I've ever had in my life. While she's a tough grader, she makes the grading criteria very clear. Her lectures are amazing and she made herself available to every person in class by adding office hours and even staying after class.",1
"Because working with children is so crucial, learning to Observe Behaviors is a required skill. Professor Sgro, offers a variety of literature and we are tested on all assignments. She provides excellent feedback to make sure you're on the right track. 100% participation is expected in class and especially with the internship course work.",1
"As many have said, brilliant physicist, horrible teacher. First day he gave assessment exams because the uni told him his fail rate was too high. There are no 'pre-tests' anymore, no kind of study guide given, just told to do the homework again (loads of homework at that). Only three tests and a final, with no curve.",0
"Overall, not impressed by his teaching style (online). Be prepared to teach yourself everything, because he provides no lessons and little help even if you ask for it!",0
"She goes through material very quickly, without giving many examples. She basically expects her students to already understand what she hasn't taught. She does not grade homework so your entire grade depends on how you do on the tests and quizzes. She grades extremely hard, if you don't write out every step she doesn't give you credit for it.",0
Awesome professor! Enjoyed his online class. Puts out all the work and you may complete it before due date working at your own pace. Take him you wont regret.,1
Good teacher. Kept it interesting and is fun. He really knows his stuff.,1
The information she provides in the lectures is rarely if ever useful. She is not helpful if you ask for advice regarding studying. The tests are incredibly difficult and specific. They cover everything from the book and the lecture. Also the powerpoints are not uploaded to webcourses so take notes and pictures!,0
"Absolutely the best professor. Dr Cleveland's passion for marketing is infectious, and he sprinkles fun anecdotes from his life experiences into the material to help explain difficult concepts. His exams are difficult, as he requires you to recount both textbook & lecture material quicker than a Catholic reciting a Hail Mary. Work hard  good grade",1
The exams are based mostly on the readings. I went to every class and studied my notes and skimmed the readings and it was a mistake. The amount of effort required for her teaching style is unnecessary.,0
just don't do it,0
The 2nd worst professor I have had as a student.We were always a period behind in the readings. Tests covered the minute details and not what was talked about.She gave no real practical applications and too many group projects. UNORGANIZED and no time management. The only thing that made it bearable was the other students' trying to help each other,0
"u cant believe an exactly 100 class is hard like this, as a starting course in university. It's heavy on both memorization and thinking, which means you need memorize tons of stuff and apply them quickly -- 50 questions per 75 mins for midterms, 80 questions in two hours for final. AND the professor has a ridiculous accent, can I say dirty words???",0
"Not an interesting class, does not give an accurate discription of what will be on the tests, all over the place in class.",0
"Professor Westover is one of the best instructors I've ever had! He gives great and immediate feedback. Is respectful, willing to work with you and very knowledgeable. Weekly assignments. As long as you read all of the information, you will do great. All open book, open notes. Gives ample time to complete research paper! Would take him again!",1
"Tough lady and intimidating at first, but then as the class goes on, you realize that she's actually really cool! She's smart and really wants to hear your thoughts on things. Turned out to be one of my favorite professors. And definitely one of the more ""normal"" honors professors.",1
Narcissist,0
"A pretty awful professor (her lectures/powerpoints do not focus on what is on the exam at all -- it's like you're taking an exam for a different class). Goes on tangents about the importance of not being stressed but just stresses you out. After we went online due to virus, she completely abandoned the class and only did weekly ""check-ins.""",0
Can't teach and hard everything is on your own.................. never had professor like this,0
His homework requirements sheet is vague and everyone could come up with their own interpretation but you will be graded based on how close you can get to his interpretation of the question and close to someones solution he thinks is the best. His grading is very strict and unfair at times.,0
"Not prepared for classes, seems to only read off a powerpoint. If asked a question which is not on the powerpoint, she is lost and continues class without answering the question. She expects you to know the material without ever being taught it, and she is by far the worst ""teacher"" I have ever encountered. It's a shame she is the only biochem prof",0
"Dr. Rayor can come off as mean at first, and while she's certainly tough, I really think she's a good professor. She makes you work hard, but she's fair and wants you to learn. Go to her if you need help and she'll give it. Her lectures are great and her passion for the subject is amazing. Ask her about her poetry translations!",1
"during my course the professor required quizzes on a weekly basis which is an accelerated rythm, it prevented me from fully assimilating the chapters and since i had classes twice a week, I couldn't accumulate good grade due to almost 8 quizzes one midterm and one exam . we all know the law of large numbers however we don't need extra pressure.",0
he didn't teach us anything he just talked at us for an hr and gave us 30 hw problems a week. Test were weighed really heavily too so if you did poorly on the mid term you were screwed.,0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
"Steve is the best, kindest math teacher ever. He takes time to help with homework, tells you exactly what to prepare for on tests, gives partial credit, and his lectures are detailed, clear, and easy-to-follow. He clearly loves what he does and is happy to share his gift of teaching math with his students.",1
"Tom is a great guy! Very fun! However, the tests are somewhat difficult and you dont really learn any textbook material during the class periods. The class is more about memorizing definitions and ideas than it is about actually learning. If you do an extra credit then you still will get a good grade.",0
"Every test is easy except the first one, and that one screws up your whole grade.  I earned an A with the extra credit he gave, but he never counted it.  He gave me a B and avoided me when I tried to call, e-mail, and visit him during his office hours.  Very rude.  He wears the same clothes every day and wastes our time talking about things that don't matter and telling jokes.  I'm sure he is a good man with good intentions, but I didn't like him.",0
"He is an amazing teacher! I took this class as a hybrid and it worked really well with my schedule. His work isn't hard if you take the time to do them. If you listen and follow his instruction you should easily get an A. I will take more classes from him. I would highly recommend, we didn't take any test, we just did the 2 major papers quizzes, hw",1
"Kovarik is a one of a kind professor. His knowledge on topics of media history and the law make you wonder why he's even teaching students--he could be out there doing other things! At the end of the day he cares for what he's teaching. Although a tad on the unorganized side, he always announces what's going to be covered for the test.",1
The class material is very simple especially if you have taken health in high school. The key is to read the book and take good notes. Other then that the class is very straight forward. Sutton is annoying but you'll get though it just put your head down and do everything thats assigned.,0
Very helpful in class,1
"He keeps class interesting by doing some little fun activities. However, taking notes is hard because he doesn't give a power point,  just and outline. A suggestion I have is to write down every example he gives and evaluate them with the outline.",0
"If you're stuck with this prof , attend every single class but bring your book and read the entire time. His slides and lectures are pointless. Memorize the book word for word and maybe you'll get a C. I AM AN A/B STUDENT! But now i have to look forward to my first D thanks to this NON teacher. Who hires these teachers?",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. She locked down my final semester grade before she had graded everything yet. Suddenly I ended up with a C instead of a B. She never replied any emails, dont even bother to try to email her, she wont respond. Give you bunch of videos to watch. You can find them on youtube and teach yourself.",0
"Fully Online Pros: You go at your own pace & don't need to attend recitation. Cons: You go at your own pace (you need to have good time management & be strict with yourself). Advice: Don't freak out, just get things done ASAP. Do all your HW & go to tutoring center at least 1x per chapter. Get tutored 2x before each test. Don't need to read hw.",0
Worst professor I ever took this semester  she's disorganized and confusing ended up getting a D in her class BIG MISTAKE!!,0
"Dr. Wong is a very tough professor and assigns more work than seems necessary for the class. She is incredibly sweet and understanding though, and she really cares about her students doing well. If you show up to class and participate thoughtfully, you can definitely do well. When she says don't wait until the last minute to do assignments, don't!",1
"I love Dr. Zlesak! He is funny, enthusiastic, and makes learning about plants fun and exciting! I would highly recommend him.",1
"291 is one of the harder COB prerequisites and she does everything she can to make sure we are learning. A lot of these reviews are definitely from the slackers who didnt give this class the time of day. Tests are definitely hard, but if you study and do all the practice problems you'll pass. Other than that its 4 excel homeworks that are easy As",1
"I have enjoyed how the professor has taught, his sincere and his joy for teaching.What is not good about this class is all the cheating that goes on.Actually in the entire department.  People just copy from each other while gathering the ire of us hard working students who do it the right way.Beware of the class and any other graduate economics cla",1
The assignments are not well explained and she does a poor job of working through the lecture. Would recommend finding a different professor.,0
"Fantastically hard teacher, yet among the smartest ones at Rhodes.  I only recommend her for very good students, but it will be entirely worthwhile.",1
"Great class. Fantastic teacher. She is very enthusiastic in the material & often explains material several times. Study guides,several animations & videos.Its her first semester so she needed to find her groove  but great ending.Several students missed a lot of class.I attended every lecture.Even gave extra help when my comp. crashed & lost notes.",1
Do not take this class unless you are extremely passionate about writing poetry. 90% of your grade relies on the poetry you write. Everyday is the same routine which gets boring. The prompts are difficult and bringing in poems every week sounds relatively easy but isn't unless you can manage work for all your classes.,0
"Prof. Boetcher is really nice and helpful if you have a question. Took an 8-week online course, she answered all emails quickly. You do need to do the reading and it's a lot for 8 weeks, but if you do it you will be able to get a good grade on your essays. She takes time to respond with long comments to all of your written work which I find helpful",1
"The worst experience ever. She doesnt help at all, you ask her a question,  What does your book say? Will be her response. The amount of work expected is excessive. Please save yourself the time and pick another professor. She expects you to know 8 chapters worth of material for her tests, no multiple choice questions either. Just horrible!",0
"Pattern of class is very clear and it's easy to get into a rhythm with the work, Dangerous to fall behind because work can piles up, Tests are written fairly poorly, but they are multiple-choice and she gives you two chances so you can usually figure it out, the KEY to this class is taking notes on EVERY chapter (mostly the main terms and summaries",1
"He is VERY passionate about what he teaches! I HIGHLY recommend taking notes on a computer because your hand will DIE. Also, his tests are all essays, but he gives you the questions beforehand. He also lectures in such a way that it reminds us how important history really is in our daily lives. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"TERRIBLE. I didn't have a major, and she talked me into taking upper-level classes as a freshman, saying I didn't want to close anymore doors for myself. She talked me into taking Bio120 when I was in no way interested in science, and I got a D in it. She also made my schedule more or less by herself - I could have done that, I wanted ADVICE.",0
"Maybe it's because I didn't study hard, but I do not like her, she doesn't cares about students too much, and she always get lost what she is talking in class, sometimes couldn't find an answer. She is a mean teacher.",0
"Cons: Lectures and class discussions are dense. There is a lot of reading.  Pros: You learn to think about things in ways you never have before, and you will come to understand your own thought processes better. She is SO INTELLIGENT, that it will make you want to be smarter and less ignorant. ",1
"If you care about your GPA, avoid taking the class with her.",0
He's a pretty fair grader and the course it set up for students to succeed. The only thing I would criticize is that he's a little scatter brained and isn't really too organized.,1
He's an awesome teacher but he is also a hard teacher. Loved the class and learned a lot.,1
Contradicts himself and then denies it. Very disorganized. Gets defensive when you ask him a question and takes things wayy to personally. His tests are much harder than the material he presents in class.,0
SHE IS BY FAR THE RUDEST PROFESSOR! like why be a professor if your going to have that rude look on your face when students seek for help. I highly don't recommend this professor,0
She is a very good professor who focuses on the needs of her students.,1
"Zhang really cares about his students, but it's obvious that he is struggling with distanced learning changing the way he has to teach. If you take him online, you will really have to put in a lot of time to do well in this course. There is no room for error, you have to watch every lecture, do every homework problem, and come to the live lectures.",0
"Professor Vavova made me interested in philosophy. She's one of the smartest people I've ever met, and she really values her students. As a philosopher, a big part of her job is to take things that aren't stated clearly and extract meaning from them. That skill comes in wonderfully when she's helping us explain our complex ideas.",1
"His tests are easy, but if you  do a small mistake it's ok for him to get nothing. He is not organize at all. It's hard to communicate with him.  When he grade your homework he will focus about some small stuff that will make you get 50% on the homework.",0
boring,0
"Condescending, Egotistical, Self-absorbed, Unclear. He constantly disrespects and makes fun of his students, prefers women to men, objectifies students who are not physics majors, abhors questions, and he writes tests the do not represent even 20% of the material learnt. He deliberately teaches theories and history tests on practical knowledge.",0
"I wish I had listened to other reviews about her being a slow grader. It was week 4 before we had grades from week 1. This continued throughout the session.    She leaves feedback in odd places that no other professors use, so it's hard to locate.   Zero content in the class ""resources"" tab.   5th professor I've had at APU and by far the worst.",0
"He was very hard to listen to lecture. He rambles and gets nervous a lot while he is speaking and gets off topic quickly. He loves what he does and know a lot about economics, he just isn't good at explaining it. If you aren't an economics lover, I wouldn't recommend!",0
"Loved everything about Intraub and her class. I took Cognition with her, it was hands down my favorite course I took at Delaware. Her lectures were interesting and she is more than willing to take the time to explain the material. She was always willing to meet for extra help especially with online learning. Truly the kindest soul. She really cares",1
"honestly the class wasn't very hard. the main problem with him is that he does not even bother to respond to his students, he had a 'discussion page' up since the beginning of the year and RARELY answered it. When the exam came around there was a page to ask questions about the exam and he didn't respond to a single one. he was barely a teacher",0
"The professor is really good, but the assignments are insane!! They expect way too much for just an intro class! Don't take it if you are looking for an easy class/a class to fulfill your gen ed requirements! It's not worth it…it's also kind of boring.",1
"She makes everything MUCH more complicated than it has to be. She gets absorbed in the proofs of the equations and doesn't focus enough on what we'll actually need to know. It's not as bad when you get used to her style, though.",0
"Fun Class, Hard Tests.  You gotta read the book and take notes forthis class.  He is a gret entertainer, but his tests can be very hard. you gotta work for an A in foresty wildlife and fisheries.",0
The best professor! I loved the way he teach and how respectful he is ! Would love to take a class again with him !,1
She breezes through the material as if it's review for everyone.  A lot of the time she posts graded iClicker questions that she has barely covered.  Absolutely horrible; avoid at all costs. ,0
"Old school type professor. LECTURE ONLY, limited interaction with students and NO INTERACTION BETWEEN STUDENTS. His grading system is based on HIS KNOWLEDGE only, and zero empathy for students struggle to understand his ways. It seems that giving a low grade gives him a leverage of what a GREAT TEACHER! I do not think he is.",0
Read homework. Do the essays. She does not b s. Around in class. Tough but fair.  Expects students to be serious and will call out those who act stupid. Not a class for immature idiotsdoes not give out class notes. Take good notes. Don't email her with 1000 excuses why you can't come to class. If you can't come to class its your grade going down.,1
It was boring to me.,0
Professor Carson is an amazing teacher. He is so sweet and funny. Definitely take his class if you can!! You wont regret it!,1
"Just the worst. Had her for Bio 244 lab. All she does it read off of the powerpoint and if you have a question her usual answer is, I don't know. Weekly quizzes have nothing to do with what you did in class the week before. Avoid at all costs.",0
"DO NOT take this professor. I only have 350 characters to describe how bad he is and that is not enough at all. He's unfair, grades your work as if he gave you a detailed grading rubric (which he does not), if you ask him a question he can't even answer it completely and he is VERY rude. Terrible grader, and doesn't make his own course content.",0
"Great guy! I wouldn't say the class is super interesting but Holt is just an exceptionally nice, honest guy. If you put in a little bit of work, talk in class every once in a while, and show reasonable effort and understanding, you will get an A.",1
"Easy A, the only thing good about this class. Videos takes place of lectures. Assigns projects that hold little relevance to the actual subject matter. Be prepared to present every project, also in lieu of her actually teaching the class. She hasn't read an updated version of the textbook in years and her tests are on the older version.",0
"Not a very good teacher, annoying, and tests you on your ability to memorize the name of songs rather than actual understanding of the material. She also picks only songs she likes and has been known to play the same songs over and over again (5-10 per class). Definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend.",0
"Doctor Weiner is a very tough teacher to have for such a tough class. More than half of my class dropped the class before it even hit half the semester. I had a huge issue with him and that's why I dropped. He screamed at me in front of the whole class and didn't even let me explain what happened. After that, he constantly brought it up.",0
This guy is the worst. If you take his class you won't learn anything at all. All he talks about is flying planes. I wish he would go back to flying planes instead of teaching because he really has no clue. He also gives horrible grades and is hard to understand.,0
"Seems like a nice guy, but that means little when 90% (his #, not mine) of students fail his classes. He moves quickly, and you take TONS of notes. By the time you finish writing something, he already moved on. I know everyone makes mistakes when doing math, but we have to correct him 8 or 10 times a day. He uses ambiguous wording on tests, too.",0
"Worst teacher Ive ever take in my life. Strict on grading, no matter how hard you try he will always find some problem to lower your grade. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
"He is a man of utmost character, full of positive energy, British sarcastic wit, and near infinite caring. As much effort as you give you will get back; pay attention to his lectures and do the straightforward online homework and you're guaranteed to pass. The beginning, the end, the one who is many; prepare yourself for the Monahan experience.. :)",1
"If you're in the MBA, take him as a professor. While his class is not easy, you will learn a lot. The book is mandatory as it will help you out and make sure to keep up with the homework. While class attendance is not mandatory, he gives many hints about the tests. 2 Tests counted as grade nothing else.",1
"Class is self taught, but he is an awful teacher. He plays computer games the whole time and doesn't follow the course guidelines of the project when making the final project course. Would never take him for a professor again",0
"I did not enjoy his class at all. The lectures are extremely boring and vague. He doesn't give many assignments but when he does, he grades them toughly. So if you do take this class, I recommend putting lots of detail into your papers. Also the mid term and final are 50 min and difficult and out of 54 people, 2 got an A on the midterm. Good luck!",0
screw this class!!! worst class i have ever taken at ucr. ridiculous group paper and 4 HARD HARD HARD tests! she is rude and thinks she is better than everybody else,0
This teacher is extremely hard for 100 level beginners spanish class. Wish i knew that before taking her. Although she is hard she is really thorough and does a really good job at explaining and helping you understand the chapters. Make sure you do every assignment possible and go to every class if you want the best possible grade (obviously).,1
"Be prepared to give much detail to your answers when she asks questions, if not she will make you feel that your answer isn't good enough, even when you are right.  Has no sense of humor and is not helpful at all.  I advise you to read your material before coming to class. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
"the only teacher that gives multiple choice exam on science subject, no partial credit of course.",1
Not a fun class,0
This guy is the man... period.,1
"She's funny, witty & caring like a mom, but is a hard grader. I think she's allergic to grades 85 and up. Class is not boring but limited to Canadian culture. Knows the course she's teaching but more on the Canadian field. She's not racist but sometimes her emotions are biased to side more with the white (caucasian) students. Loves group work.",1
"Overall, a really great guy, though not always perfectly clear (especially in-class discussions). Then again, Old English and Chaucer isn't the easiest. Understands a student's workload, and gives extensions with no problem. I would recommend him to anybody.",1
Where should I start? just know you need to eat the book and teach yourself everything. lots and lots and lots of homework. does not understand the situation of his students during the pandemic.,0
"They made all the FIGs sound really interesting and geared toward freshmen, so I decided to take his class. Big mistake. Nothing he talks about in class is on the test. And the tests are ridiculous. Unless you have a pretty good grasp on politics and your own views in general, i would not take his class. Lots o' rambling.",0
"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",0
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. -1/10 for me.",0
As long as you watch the videos he posts you can pass the class with an A without ever using the book.,1
Does not input grades so you wont ever know your grade. Changes grades constantly. Rants in class. Least specific professor I have ever had. Kind of rude. Fun to listen to in class though.,0
"Triggs was brand new to TCC and did her best to work with us and adjusted due dates around theory. The hospital experience was not great but she did what she could to make it work for everyone. I learned a lot from her and hope TCC will keep her on staff full time. She's fairly laid back and funny, def recommend. Has a lot of stories to share.",1
"HORRIBLE! I could not wait to take Spanish but after her class, there is NO WAY that I am taking Spanish 2. This woman cannot teach. Talks a lot yet says nothing. If you aren't willing to eat,breathe and sleep spanish 24 hrs a day,then don't take Fletcher's class. This is THE ONLY CLASS you will have time for.Don't do it.Take Sign Language instead.",0
HOT HOT HOT HOT MAN,1
There's no homework and no quizzes. Three big exams determine your grade. All the material is in a yellow book and a blue book. Lots of students in each class. I personally had a tutor just to make sure I'd pass with a high grade. He dropped our lowest grade if we got a C- or higher on the third exam. He lectures the whole hour and is a funny guy.,1
"He starts class with what he will be doing for the week. Then he goes through the lesson with plenty of examples. Homework is optional, but I would encourage you to do it to get a better understanding. He is a GREAT professor. He has like 6 quizzes and lowest grade is dropped plus a final. If you want a easy A take this class.",1
His exams are really hard no matter how much you study you still fail. Dreaded going to his class. He is nice but hard.,0
"This teacher is hard to understand and you can't learn from her lectures. She struggles getting her point across. there is a group project where she praises on of her former student's project, but if you follow it exactly like hers, she will tell you it's wrong. The project is too in detailed for an intro class and her exams are slightly difficult.",0
"Dr. Foster is fairly average professor, in my opinion. The class mostly covered French history and other cultural topics, but I found it genuinely interesting. The work might become too much and her tests were some of the most difficult I have ever taken outside of math. However she gives clear directions and if you do what's needed, you'll be fine",1
"Such a great and passionate professor. She made class so interesting. It is not an easy class however, she really makes you work for your grade and learn the material.",1
"Online class. quick response. Over all very nice. Interesting course. He says you don't need a text book because he writes his own lessons but a some test Q's are not mentioned in his version but they are in the practice quizzes. DO THE PRACTICE QUIZZES 20+ TIMES IF YOU WANT TO PASS. only graded on 5 things( 3 exams, a paper and final)",1
HE IS BY FAR THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD. I DO NOT KNOW WHO HIRED HIM BUT IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING TO DO! THIS IS A POLITICAL SCIENCE CLASS! HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH PS. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM! CLASS AVERAGE ON EXAM 1 WAS A 31!,0
Random speeches about nothing. Unclear grading criteria. Lecture has nothing to do with the material. Calls out students randomly.,0
"We are currently a month into class and I don't think the class as a whole is keeping up. We had a journal entry due today and when she asked who *didn't* turn it in, 80% of the class raised their hand. This is not a class problem, but a failure on the part of the professor to properly communicate what is due. already dreading the rest of the year",0
"I'm so thankful I transferred cause I wouldn't have known such an inspiration. Ronda is so helpful with everything, her knowledge in what she teaches doesn't go unnoticed. She helped me gained my confidence in designing again after transferring out of the art institutes. She's the most amazing teacher I've ever had and forever grateful for her.",1
He is awful,0
"You go in blind to all of the exams and final. There is no study guide. When asked, she does not even divulge how many questions there will be and if it is multiple choice. All she says is that whatever is in the book, lecture or previous courses is fair game. It is a incredibly difficult class and extinguished my interest in accounting. ",0
Hesford didn't recognize that she was teaching a freshman writing class.  She expected more than we were able to give her.,1
"Took over the summer. Did not learn anything from lecture, learned every the material on my own, but attendance was required. Spends too much time on a problem when stuck, and shows that he did not review materials before lecturing. Lab was a mess, did not explain the procedure or setup, and left us 10mins to do the lab at the end.",0
TOUGH grader. Like super tough. And doesnt seem to care about the wellbeing of students.,0
"He is one of the worst teachers at the school to take math with. He is not helpful at all the way he grades is tough. If you don't do it his way then he marks it wrong, even if you have the right answer . This was the only class i didn't pass this semester I got all B's in my other classes.",0
"I took Geveci for MATH 252, don't take him. His accent is extremely thick and I did not learn a thing in his large lecture. His class is basically a self-study class but the only good thing about it is that the problems in his textbook contain the exact problems that are going to be on the exam!",0
It was a fun class but the whole observing a child in their home thing was no easy task. I had to go 5 times to someone's home and it felt kind of intrusive. If you can't find a child to observe then don't bother taking this class because you need to the class is solely based off observations. Overall Corona was a fair grader and I recommend her.,1
"He is a tough teacher who at the beginning tells you what exactly he is expecting you to do to actually pass the course. The wording of his tests are advanced. If you're  in for the challenge go on ahead, but besides that I would suggest you to find another teacher. In order to get some points at the end you have to speak up and answer questions.",0
Jackie is the best teacher ever ! She is the best teacher ever ! Shes SUPER FAMOUS cause of her kindness and always respect her students. She always makes me feel so thrilled every time I attended in the class. She makes me feel like I WANT TO ATTEND TO THE CLASS. Thats the truth. She gave us so many games n if u pass it u will get HW PASS ��,1
"I took this class online and I was incredibly nervous about it bc of reviews I read about Rodgers on this website. However, this course is NOT horrible and it is not impossible to do well on lab reports or tests. He is such a helpful teacher and doing well simply means really trying and putting forth an effort. It's hard work but an A is possible",1
Just awful. I really hated this class and I think the fact that this guy is gonna shape the minds of future filmmakers is super depressing. The guy is so high on himself and is a pain to deal with. The exams were ridiculous and he is a tough grader. The fact that I got penalized for being sick just is the cherry on the terrible sundae .,0
"Sharma is an excellent professor who effectively describes very abstract concepts in simplified, concise terms. His tests are NOT hard - just do the HW/take notes in class. He is easy to talk to and will always try to help you succeed. Very responsive via email. No idea why he has a low rating here on RMP but it is unwarranted. Take his class!",1
"SHE'S AMAZING! I'm taking her for winter 2016(2 days left). By far the best English teacher I've ever had! Not only is she supper clear about what she wants, she willing to help!! She helps broaden your horizon! ENROLL IN HER CLASS!!!!! I PROMISE YOU'LL LOVE HER!!!!",1
Worst professor I've ever had. Sits in front of the class and reads of a packet. Does not teach anything. Seton Hall is better of paying me to do a better job,0
"This class is difficult (400 level), but it IS possible to do well if you study. Prof. Haas is incredible, he lectures completely from memory and with no power points. You must take notes from what he says during class, therefore you will behind if you skip. Rent the book to follow along in class, but I didn't read for homework like he suggests.",1
Avoid at all costs if you can. He tries to be a nice guy but I have never met an adult that is so unorganized. He will get your grades back to you a year later. Tough quizes,0
Take Mr. Lockhart's class!!! You won't regret it. Very helpful and he is sooo nice. If you miss an online quiz he'll reset whatever you need to be reset. Very understanding and caring of his students. ,1
My man. Best math prof.,1
he teaches nothing that is on the quizzes/tests,0
"Worst class I have taken at Valley so far. The lab was easy and if you followed the format the lab write ups were not difficult. No book to refer back to, test are all essay and your grade is based on test only. If you are not a Bio major DO NOT take this professor.",0
"So, any good comments must have been writtenby this prof; clarity is absent; speaks in phrases, not sentences. There is no cohesion. Should be a libray science instructor or a scheduler for author appearances at bookstores. All her classes are EXACTLY THE SAME! DOesn't anybody check what goes on at ECSU?",0
Dr. lyall is amazing and very funny! class is easy because he gives u things that's gonna b on tests I had fun in this class and loved counseling I learned a lot and I would love to take him again you must take him,1
I always tell fellow science undergrads to take a class with Anne. Incredibly passionate and thoughtful teacher. Definitely would like to have her as a professor again.,1
"His class was definitely not for me but I wouldn't call him a bad teacher. In class, we talk about the philisophical side of technology, and how it impacts humans. The homework has little to do with class discussion, and a text book is mandatory if you want to pass the quizzes. Sometimes you have to build things. There are no due dates.",0
"Sweet man. Records all his lectures, so you dont have to attend. Tends to go on and on about a topic, so sometimes loses sense of time. Otherwise gives good examples and is pretty clear in lectures. 4 multiple choice tests, absolutely no assignments.",1
"One of my favorite profs at Calvin. Very witty, I was always laughing in his class which made me look forward to it. Take this class if you have room in your schedule, everyone can benefit from it. This class does have a lot of group work though. ",1
"I'm not learning a single thing in this class, as I am having to teach myself everything. He does not explain anything well and skips over a lot of information. He is hard to understand and expects us to know things we don't. Exams and homework are nothing alike. I hope I actually pass this class but I'm losing hope. Definitely do not recommend.",0
This teacher makes ineffectual attempts to lecture on material out of a textbook that the class doesn't use. The entire class consists of two papers (67%) and attendance (33%) as grading criterion. The material required for the paper is not covered in class. The information covered in class is completely unnecessary. The attendance grade is however,0
During the class we gave a few speeches -- we did not receive any feedback and the grades were posted minutes after giving the speech (indicating there was no true thought process behind the grade). Mr. Gentry could be quite harsh with students and there were times I felt uncomfortable being in the classroom. It was an okay class but was not great,1
I am a full time student and employee. I have test anxiety and this professor is patient. He will let me sit in on other lectures if I miss any. As well as is flexible with letting me take tests later on(and I haven't even told him about my anxiety). He is very nice. He isn't one of those professors who takes a bad day out on you. Very proffesional,1
"Dr. Bond helped me whenever I had any questions.  He goes out of his way to answer any questions you have, if you have any after listening to his awesome lectures.  His hair is also pretty awesome!",1
Coolest band director ever!,1
"Excellent professor. His class is not hard and his lectures are great. Even though I had his class at 8am I still enjoyed showing up. His exams include some topics that are discussed in class and not only in the slides and reading, so much sure you show up. He is very friendly and funny!!",1
"He makes his sections of the class harder than the others, and openly admits that. Not the most interesting guy either. Only positive thing is the 15 point grading scale.",0
NEED to go to class - he grades on attendance.  Several papers to write throughout semester.  Need to read books he assigns - everyone has to lead a class discussion on assigned reading and nobody knows when they will be picked.  Lectures a lot about history topics even though it's an English class.  Very slow on grading.,0
hes not very good in office hours either,0
"I can't with these people complaining about her. Mrs. Trombley is one of the best teachers in LAVC. She is accessible anytime you need, she's helpful if you have questions. And her classes are very informative. It might seem easy because it's online class, but actually you have to work hard to keep up with the schedule. I might take P66 with her...",1
"Worse 101 to take @ NYIT. Do not take this professor, she gives at least 4 pages of notes per class. Makes you write essays from a book with garbage. Her mid term and final are stupid, you won't learn anything here. You be better off in a English class than her trash class. Oh yeah btw she has a project which is stupid along with final so GL.",0
"This teacher has an awful system of grading papers, that includes a detailed 12 page style guide that is whimisical, not based on anything factual. It's used to just dock points at will, not to mention there are 7 books required for a 1.5 month course. This is the hardest teacher at JMU and the least enjoyable to take a class in.",0
This professor can care less about your journey into the medical field. I pretty much taught myself in this course just to get hit by impossible tests that the professor creates. There are no study guides for tests and half of the test is fill in the blank where you get zero points even if you got the answer correct but you misspelled it. AVOID HER,0
My first essay was a B+ and no matter how much I went to the Writing ctr I get the same grade wc is frustrating she's really nice and kind you have to participate in class and AVOID being late bc she doesnt like it the only thing w/her is w her esay instructions its quite confusing and no matter how you change the roughdraft its the same grade,0
"The vast majority of students seem to like Professor Russell, but for whatever my opinion counts, I feel that she lacks to proper knowledge to teach her classes. She consistently makes rather large factual mistakes and often teaches directly out of the textbooks; I would have learned more if I just read the books and never showed up to class.",0
"I don't understand how this instructor got good ratings on here. She is by far, the most least qualified and horrible professor I have ever had. I don't think she would even be qualified to work at a McDonalds. This professor not only did not know how to grade correctly, she would miss class all the time, and you never had an idea of whatwasgoingon",0
"Class gets much more interesting later on, good teacher, makes class fun, tests are not difficult though all q's are open response.",1
"He is very practical about teaching and learning, stresses active participation and regular attendance. I learned so much in the class, for example, making podcasts, video production and editing and digital literacy in general. ",1
"Not helpful, not responsive",0
"This class will vary from person to person. I got a B. Nice guy, lectures aren't difficult, however, you have to put effort into understanding the material in the book, because his tests are hard. If you're in 201 to begin with, you obviously need to know it for your major. If you don't want to know the material, take at ICC.",1
"Love this woman! She is very fair with her grading, and gives you several paragraphs on her opinion of your papers. She uses all of the textbooks (the entire thing). According to other students I talked to, she teaches different things that other ENGL 101 teachers dont teach. She is very interesting and loves her students. A must take class!",1
I would have rated this higher but the instructor pushes political beleafes on you. That said he is an alright teacher but only has experince in civil engineering and not in Mechanical engineering so his examples are onesided.,0
"She seems to be a nice person and tries to help her students. Its just a shame that for our Calc II class she tries to get us to do more teaching than herself. I often also feel unprepared to do the homework, and she doesn't offer much guidance.",0
"I took this class during summer session 1 and I know that there is a ton of information in a short period of time, but this guy did not teach me anything. The entire class was spent doing the questions at the end of the chapter, then him giving us the answers. No explaning of the problems, no teaching of the material. I mainly taught myself.",0
COD didnt reflect what his course was about...lots and lots of reading...goofy yet intertaining,0
"Oh so boring.  I slept and read a few extra books throughout lectures.  I thought he was unqualified at the beginning of the class; but he seems to know his stuff.  Lectures are boring.  I'm sure part of it was the material this class covers, but he could have done more with it.  Did I mention his lectures are boring?  Well they are. Very much so.",1
"He is a great professor who cares about his students and also he tries to accommodate  everyone. He is one of the best teachers you will find at ECC. Before any tests or quiz, he goes through review with you and also he breaks down his work step by step",1
Curtiss will do her best to help you succeed. You can tell she really has a passion for teaching.,1
If you need anything he is there for you. He loves his job and it shows. He wants people to succeed. I would take him again. There is no assigned homework in the class. ,1
"For someone who teaches about accommodating students with disabilities, he sure hates accommodating students with disabilities. Every email was met with blunt and rude responses. No flexibility, harsh grading policies, vague instructions. I thought it was just me because of his super high rating on here, but if you feel this way, you're not alone",0
Consistent lectures and light hearted. Easy to pay attention to.,1
AWESOME!! He makes class interesting and makes sure everyone gets a good grade. He also brings treats almost every Friday. His stories are hilarious and you can tell that he is super intelligent and passionate about his work.,1
"She is a good person, but I feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc. She always wants MORE. There is no way to avoid her. Put it this way, I would rather take Human Neuropsychology than take a class with her.",0
"Very rough teaching style. This is the kind of teaching you would probably expect at senior or grad level, not a beginner level course. Spent the whole semester asking him or his TA's for help on all the material. Very hard to understand slide descriptions on class work and homework. Study hard, and hope for very smart TA's.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. Thick accent to the point you can't understand, and he doesn't slow down to pronuniciate his words. Makes all concepts so difficult and literally speeds through everything. Tests are 60% of the grade so you better know what you're doing. No extra credit & lots of homework only worth 10%. Take someone, ANYONE else.",0
"Dr. Simms is very knowledgeable of the subject, but he is not good at explaining things to people who do not understand the subject. He's hard of hearing, asking questions during class is kinda hard unless you literally yell. There was a paper to write, and there was no clear idea of what he wanted, AKA no outline.",0
Syllabus says you are not allowed to contact the professors. Backtests aren't relevant to what you will be tested on. PILOT tutoring wasn't helpful. 3 exams make your entire grade. Grading system unfair and system to ask for a regrade basically doesn't exist. I took an exam in October and no one ever responded to my regrade request.,0
"She's a great french teacher. I came into the class planning on fulfilling the requirement, and now I'm seriously considering minoring in french. Not too much work, and the class discussions are usually very interesting!",1
"Lisa is GREAT! She has a really good knowledge of the French language and really wants everyone to be successful. We did fun activities, ate food, learned the culture and the language. I totally recommend taking her class!",1
"Awful professor. Speaks too fast, makes mistakes on what he says. I literally have to watch his lectures backwards to take my notes, because he changes things and mis speaks so often. He allows his phone to ring while recording, and doesn't do anything about it. At least once a week it rings. He doesn't answer the problems he goes over.",0
Terrible teacher. Take A201 with a different professor over the summer. Much easier.,0
"Don't expect to know your grade ever. He is usually all over the the place and always cancels class. He grunts a lot too. But if you are struggling, he will help you, but only if you ask him for it. He gives a lot of extra credit though.",0
"He is NOT a hard professor. Every test comes directly from the notes. If you look over your notes at least once, you are going to get an A. He also is more than willing to repeat himself or further explain a slide if it is unclear to you. I highly recommend him.",1
"Brown is fine. He keeps his voice low and is very reliant on slide presentations that have a LOT of material, and if you miss a day you miss a lot of information not included in the actual pres., but WILL be included on the test. I found him interesting enough, but the class was very boring with him. Tests have a lot of material on them.",0
His concepts are not clear and he simply answers doubts vaguely. Teaching is monotonous as if he is frustrated with his own life.,0
Take any and all classes that Doug has to offer. Best professor at K-State.,1
DIFFICULT class but great professor!!! Really cares about students and always willing to stay late to help u understand material.,1
"ATP was a great professor. Funny and engaging. Definitely have to work for your grade. Attendance is not mandatory but Iclicker points are in every class (50 total for semester) so if you skip, you lose points. Super helpful and always willing to answer questions. Highly recommend this class. Don't buy the textbook but DO buy lecture notebook.",1
"She assigns multiple readings/videos per week. I couldn't get higher than a 68% on any assignment, even after following her feedback from previous assignments. Wasn't engaged with the class at all. The content was not what I expected it to be. Wouldn't take another class with her again.",0
Wonderful instructor. A lecturing goddess. Very eloquent & beautiful. Little book usage;gives rubricks for papers. 311 tests are all essay; take this instructor!,1
She doesn't remember what she has/hasn't told you so there's a lot of material on the test that she didn't go over or expects you to read in the textbook even though she didn't teach it. You really have to study hard to pass and make good grades.,0
"Shes a really sweet who takes her time to assure that you can do your best in the essays. The essays are not too hard if you know what you're doing, and so long as you keep up on the homework, you'll be fine",1
"Really boring. Icy and unapproachable, uses ableist language in lectures. I honestly couldn't tell you anything she taught us because all she did was show us google stock images and rant about barnacles and how her entire family died from strokes. Don't take this class.",0
"To be fair, this was a hybrid class before even going online. Students teach themselves and then meet to do group work 1x/week. You have to show up for each class or grade will drop dramatically. It really wasn't bad until you didn't understand something, because you'd fail the quiz and be dead weight in group work -- no lectures ever...",0
"i failed this class and do not know why or how. i am currently going through a grade appeals process. i never got back my grades for anything which made me very mad when i received an F. he is very very very very very hard, doesnt respond to emails, doesnt help at all and does not cooperate with the grade appeals process when he knows he is wrong.",0
Nice prof!,1
"Professor Schiavone is a nice, sweet, person, but her lectures can be a bit disorganized and confusing. One on one, though, she is very caring and takes the time to explain things. Phonetics isn't too hard, it just takes a bit to figure out the concepts. Daily quizzes, midterm, cumulative final, and two projects. Don't freak out just participate.",1
Online homework and lots of it. Tests have too much material on them gives review for them but they are not very helpful. Class could be easy but she makes it hard.,0
"This guy is a jerk and a half- he seems like he knows what he's doing in lectures but if you talk to him individually, he'll treat you with utmost disdain.  He shows up at class like 10 minutes late and then blames class being late on the computer and projector and then treats the repair people with comtempt.  What an a$$h0le of an individual.",0
She really isn't the nicest lady. Pretty rude as well. Leaves class mid lecture to take phone calls for what? I don't know. There are days where she's pleasant and then days where she's so nasty you can cut the tension with a knife. If you just go to class and do your best you'll be fine. It's just not a pleasant experience though.,0
he does like to flex his vocabulary muscles - but that's a good thing in a philosophy course.  i love his classes because they are so challenging.,1
"I couldn't imagine anyone having a hard time with her unless you truly did not put the necessary work into class. One of the best instructors I've ever had. The class was consistent, you knew what to expect. Grading was clear, lectures never had filler, and she gave you no reason to not pass. I did not ever enjoy science, but she made it fun.",1
"is making an effort now, but her way of interacting with the class at the beginning of the term was very negative. I like the material but i'd suggest not to take this course as an elective, you won't get a good mark with this prof",0
"She is amazing. She tries to help you understand, she will brake down hard stuff for you to understand better. She really wants her students to pass. She gives the handouts and you will pass  just studying from there. I would definitely recommend her.",1
She is an awesome teacher! Her tests are straight forward and if you miss a few days it won't kill your grade. I recommend her to everyone!,1
"She is really nice . But she takes this course way to seriously. Do not expect the easy A's you should be getting out of this course. All the assignments are marked hard as if they are upper level English papers. Students sometimes received 0's on assignments, in foundations. The class is interesting as well but it is not an automatic A class .",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM! He grades based on his thinking at that particular moment. If you don't have quality participation he'll probably fail you. Also gives way too much homework, for a 1000 level course.",0
"Don't take 302 with him if you have other difficult classes. Homeworks take a minimum of 10-15 hours a week. Rarely gives enough examples to do well on homework, since he focuses on explaining theory in class that you don't have to repeat. Really smart guy, but makes the class way more difficult than it needs to be.   Overall, very disappointed.",0
He was a really hard teacher to have for a low level class. He wasn't really a bad person but just be ware that he grades kind of hard.,1
Professor Wilson is so unorganized it actually begins to take a toll on your grade. It took him nearly 4 months to grade assignments so getting feedback on how to improve in the course is completely up to the student. His explanations often leave students more confused and he doesn't skip to the syllabus. He adapted fine to online learning.,0
"Unless you are majoring in philosophy, it is highly suggestive to not take this course. For a gen. ed req, the work is overpowering as well as difficult. Not everyone could grasp such concepts so easily, and she is very critical with her grading. Tries too hard to seem like a good prof. when half the class is complaining that they are failing. Sad.",0
Professor Bratcher conducts zoom meetings for any student that has questions about the course. He also gives an opportunity for his students to earn extra credit.,0
"Yeah so if youre a good student, you better be more than that.. he is absolutely brutal on tests and leaves no room for extra credit. Good luck",0
"Study and you will still fail, this class should be for financial majors not undergrad business level students.",0
"Very tough class. You'll understand all her lecture notes and the textbook, but the tests and exams are taken to a whole new level.",1
She is often unprepared for class and none of her directions are clear. She expects you to know things without telling you. She literally makes no sense.,0
"so nice, def structured like a high school course. Just do the work and you'll be fine but not an easy A",1
Loved Prof Spaulding and def one of my favorite professors here at UD. Took this course as a breadth and am really glad I did. Hes one of the most respectful professors Ive had who isnt afriad to talk about certain subjects without overstepping boundaries. Make sure to participate in class every so often. 3 essays and an easy take-home final!,1
"Nice lady, didn't retain much information. Wish she included translations on the screen of her lectures as her accent is extremely hard to understand. Not hard at all if you moderately apply yourself. She's pretty clear about her objectives and doesn't assign much work. Its really up to you to study. Take her for the ""A"", don't take her to learn.",0
"Wonderful professor! I had him for ceramics, and I loved this class. He gives really helpful feedback and really cares about the outcome of our pieces. If you put time and effort into his class, he will make sure that you are happy with your artwork.",1
"SHE IS SO AWESOME. She is caring and so funny. She even plays Spanish songs at the end of each class . We dance sometimes, too! I would retake her classes 100 times if i could.",1
"You need the txtbk, group project was no fun because my group slacked off & made me do extra work because they didn't do their part on time; informed teacher. Time consuming work, 3 crisis pass for late work, very helpful when in class, emailed or in office hrs, has a personality unlike other prof. Read carefully for the quizzes; they can be tricky",1
"Maureen teaches an amazing class, and her ideas are inspiring. But she is genuinely senile. She has so many things she requires that are ridiculous, takes forever to give back assignments. And she marks hard on the first assignment and then easy on the rest, somehow making it look like her students have improved when they haven't.",0
Connolly was the nicest teacher I had in my first semester at college.  She helped so much in the adjustment period!,1
"I liked him a lot. Would definitely take him again.  Yes, lectures can be pretty boring sometimes, but he's not a tough grader,  his group quizzes are overall pretty easy,  he posts previous semesters' exams so that we can practice, and the exam questions come straight from the in-class exercises and quizzes. And he has a good sense of humor.",1
"Not very clear on majority of assignments and grades really tough. Makes her political views known, must be politically correct. Wouldn't even consider having her as a teacher again.",0
"Great guy!! Helpful, understanding, encouraging",1
"I really hated the subject of this class, but McGivern is a good professor. He really cares about the students and wants them to succeed. He offers extra credit which is really helpful. I was often lost in lectures mostly because the class is so long its difficult to pay attention. He gives you study guides which the quiz/test questions come from.",1
"Calls himself ""Lib Daddy."" If you dont have an interesting class to go with this professor, the class is terrible. I had a VERY difficult time even going to this class because it felt like such a waste of time. but the assignments are easy, the hardest part are his quizzes at the beginning of the semester, you really need to read/study for those.",0
"This Professor is epic. Instead of memorizing bunch of scientific names, he wants you to learn how to think and apply the practical knowledge. He is a true modern science Professor. He is very patient, polite, has a sense of humor, and intelligent. His lab is more like a club rather than a class. It is very entertaining.",1
"She was not helpful at all and never returned anything. I had no idea what my grade was, and she always gave random pop quizzes. It was a very boring class and awkward, because nobody ever participated in the discussions. Don't take her if you can avoid it!",0
"Seems a bit eccentric at times. But hes a great guy and hes honestly just very passionate about what he teaches. U can learn a lot from him. Took him during the summer and he was very lenient with grading. Heck, I handed in papers late and he didnt mind. He just wants u to get something out of his lectures.����",1
"BEST professor. Not an easy A but, I learned how to write a good essay with significant evidence and examples. Home/bookwork ties in heavily to essays and class discussions, best to pace yourself and stay on top of readings. Take notes on essays, instructions are translucent and formulaic. Replies quickly through email and very helpful to everyone",1
Fun class. Pay vague attention and you don't need notes. Knows more about movies than you do. Don't be afraid to be publicly humiliated. It is very hard to do well on papers but it will make you a better writer.,1
"He is amazing! He cares about his students, explains in detail, and helps students become successful at critiques. It is time consuming, and you have to put in your best effort, but if you do, he notices, appreciates it, and helps you get better. If all professors were like Fish, I would go to school indefinitely.",1
Great instructor! Lots of fun and variety in her class and she knows how to give you a good workout.  I recommend her if you a semi-boot camp workout.,1
Van Horn does not teach at all. The class was done entirely over Gmail??? He claimed grades would be given over Brightspace but its mid November and I have yet to receive a single grade which absolutely ridiculous. The assignments were sent out on a Monday as well as whatever extra readings and due Wednesday at 5 pm so you had little time to finish,0
"Very nice and experienced professor. You will be graded by only a few things on this class. Although they are not difficult, if you don't want to be worried about grading during the whole semester, don't fail any of these tests.",1
"The lecture aren't mandatory and are pretty useless since she rambles for half of the lecture time about examples that don't make sense to the unit. The homework is cumbersome, but it isn't particularly hard. Overall not a very good teacher, and someone who I wouldn't recommend.",0
"Mostly discussions followed by a quiz, per week.  Not very involved with the class, dishes out assignments with no specific lecture/power points.  Just A LOT of reading. Not very involved with the class.  Final was difficult, did not even provide a prep sheet or study guide and most of the questions were not part of earlier quizzes.  Not great.",0
"Must come to class as she doesnt post notes. Must read textbook in addition to notes from lectures or you wont do well. Took forever to mark, never answered emails, and cancelled class/had substitutes often. Gave little to no information about what to expect on the midterm or the final. Would not take a class with her again.",0
I took the AP Scholars Intro to Bio class with her.  It was an odd class because there was pretty much no lectures.  There were a lot of modelling activities (along with the worksheets for them).  She did not communicate very well what she expected of us grading wise and communication with the LA's was poor as well.,0
"Allen is enthusiastic and the class is pretty good overall. Definitely not a complete ""easy A"" and requires some studying, but easier than most Berkeley classes. 2 hours of lecture and no discussion for 3 units makes up for the annoying field trips.",1
"Dr. Baddar is amazing! You will read stories that deal with different types of people and then discuss them in class, and write papers on the human condition elements that were the most meaningful to you. If you read the few short stories, do the hw, and pay attention in class you'll pass easily. Best professor ever!",1
"If you aren't a serious student, avoid Anne. PAY ATTENTION, she moves fast (carpal tunnel syndrome mid-semester). Doesn't believe in multiple choice so you better attend those generous study sessions. Don't like writing? Move along. She loves those long, grammatically perfect essays with pesky footnotes. Intimidating but a wealth of information.",1
"great professor, funny and helpful",1
"He can straight up be extremely rude at times without realizing it. He cares a bit too much on what everyone in the class is doing. Most homework is on what you will learn in the following class after it is due. Very tough grader, might as well be a writing class. If you don't put a lengthy sentence after your answer, it's wrong. Not recommended",0
I'm a senior year grade A student with a 3.94 GPA. She's very rude and a very tough grader. Before taking this class i went through this website and was skeptical at first since this is a class where you constantly have to talk and contribute to discussions and keep writing so much only to realize that you have received a 70% on the homework,0
Not very helpful outside of class.,0
"Professor is nice, helpful, and will give you extra assistance in her office at the drop of a hat. Check her office regularly if you want help, because she's often in there outside of office hours working on this and that. Very nice prof.",1
"I've never met a professor who absolutely refuses to answer emails before. Sure, a few might take longer than others. But to NEVER answer and then blame you for misunderstanding something? She's ridiculous.",0
She was fair. and gave us  a lot of resources for the class. This class uses alecks which obviously there will a a lot of hw. But it will be alright if ur focused and dont fall behind.,1
"Very confusing, goes off topic a lot, it is very hard to get clear notes. Never know what to expect on the exams. Wording on the exams are difficult to understand. Doesn't care much to help if falling behind. It is not just this class that was difficult with him.",0
Am not a fan of Professor Hoffman. She is a very difficult grader who thinks she makes herself clear but doesn't. Somewhat cold if you meet with her outside of class. I realize not everyone will agree with that but that is what I've gathered so far. Class is reading court case after court case. Very dry and dull course I wish I had not taken.,0
The worst professor I've ever had. She is awful and does not take feedback from students at all. Tough grader and is very unclear about all of her instructions. Do not take her,0
"Great class, Great teacher. Learn actual useful information for your future. Heavy use of excel. Lots of homework, tests every other week. You have to work for your grade.",1
"He is a highly educated person with good intentions. However, his classes are a waste of time. His facts and data are usually wrong.  He talks in circles and most of the time makes no sense.",0
"Super insightful lectures! If you're interested in ASA at all, this class is extremely thought-provoking! There is definitely a good amount of readings & analysis involved with the course, but I enjoyed it.",1
"Yates is a wonderful human being. He's very down to earth and funny, and totally cool with giving extensions. However, I hated the material, and mostly struggled to stay awake during his lectures",1
"Very helpful and always accessible. Always gives good and positive feedback.  If you have a passion for Math, you will definitely enjoy every single class with him",1
The material is irrelevant & idiotic.  It's basically a basic Excel class w a scoop of Access on top.  Pure fluff. Tests are poorly worded & will include examples from class.  Quizzes are copied from text; her time limits guarantee that you have to skim the chapters beforehand.  Project was easy w extra credit.  Tossed book in trash. ,0
"Nice teacher, but tough grader. I found French 101/102 to be quite challenging for an introductory course. Just be prepared for a full immersion experience and to randomly be called on.",0
"Do yourself a favor and do not take this class. Kumar is such a tough professor, if it is not his way you will lose points. There are many excel projects and he does not explain them well either. A lot of extra credit, but you cannot pass on that alone. There is not a book which is nice, but maybe one would help..",0
"I don't recommended taking this class with this professor if you're planning to transfer. She will NOT take the time to answer questions, go over exams or  review for any major exams. Her grading criteria is confusing to which makes you believe you'll  pass.  ""I don't know"" is her signature phrase.  I",0
"Lectures are fast paced, Chooljian goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the course. She expects you to already know what is on her lecture slides. The time given in the lab exams are so inconsiderate of everyone's learning abilities. You literally get 30 seconds per question. This class will cause anxiety & jeopardize your mental health.",0
Poor Dr. Folk is so old he could really go anyday. Hes about 82. He is one of the worst lecturers I have ever seen - hes just too old. I feel bad for the guy. He has no business teaching at this point in his life.,0
"This class had an extremely large amount of work to do for an elective. It is very difficult to do well as it has to be perfect and exactly what he wants to hear to do well. There are 4 weekly assignments ( which you have to buy a $100 textbook for) and also a weekly live video session. On top of this there are 3 major assignments, midterm+final.",0
"Fantastic teacher and will definitely take a class with him again. He has a few set rules that he mentions in the very beginning; no pen clicking, no food and beverage near work spaces, no phones, and absolutely no recording. Gives tremendous lectures and great feedback, makes a three hour lecture really interesting",1
"Take this class during the summer if at all possible. The lab and lecture are mixed which help with some of the reviews I have read. The only issue I ever had was that she sometimes didn't 'teach' the class. Sometimes it was a 'figure it out' sort of thing which sucks. Overall, she was a decent professor who will eat your lunch if you get too sassy",1
"Dr. Dan is a great man of God! He is compassionate towards all of his students and will even get to know you by your first name. He provides you with the guidance you need for all of the exams! If you review the material he gives you before you take the exam, you will get an A! I highly recommend Dr. Dan to anyone who needs to this class!",1
Very unorganized. Does not grade things until the very end of semester. I did not receive a grade on things that were due before spring break until the week before finals. She also gives no feedback on the grade you receive. Announces different directions and due dates than what's listed in syllabus. Very confusing and doesn't respond to questions,0
TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! She is always so enthusiastic and happy. She curves all of her exams and gives lots of opportunities for extra credit. She relates everything back to things that are relevant to college students and can be quite funny! I never kept up with reading but instead crammed the night before (it sucked) but could still get A's! ,1
I dont understand his teaching at all .he is not a friendly and very difficult to understand his subject especially business students as we do not have an idea in International relations .,0
Brother Dalton is a great teacher who really cares about his students. His dedication to the language makes it easier to learn and he explains concepts in a clear way. I highly recommend this class.,1
"He's the best teacher I ve ever met. It explains everything with details and example. Besides, he tells you his experience and inspires everyone to grow up. I never wrote a review, but he deserves it.",1
"Terrible teacher. Didn't grade any assignments until the middle of the quarter. I didn't know I was doing a bad job, so I didn't know I was supposed to improve. I had to drop out because of this. Very late grader, insane amounts of reading and participation. IF YOU REGISTERED IN HIS CLASS, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Especially if you're a freshman.",0
"Dr. Pringle taught the second half of the course, focusing on fungi, diversity of life, and plant life cycles and biomes. It was her first semester teaching any class. She can be quite out of touch with the students sometimes. The things she presents as interesting and hyped up just are not. She asks belittling questions that nobody responds to.",1
"He provides examples of what he is looking for, so it's easy to know what is expected of you. He just talks forever sometimes about off topic things and sometimes wastes time. His feedback is sometimes arguable. You can turn them in as many times as you want. There are only 2 quizzes. Check email before class, he cancels. (He doesnt enter grades).",1
"5 Quizzes with extra credit and you are able to drop your lowest quiz score.  I got 100% of all the quizzes because they are pretty clear as long as you study all the material.  Reading is optional.  Focus more on the powerpoints!  Exams are a little more difficult but if you put in effort, you can 100% get an A!  Online lectures are available",1
"Online course and hes still using prerecorded lectures from years ago, literally update your prerecorded lecture if you are gonna go over new content in your course outline",0
"I was derading Chemistry - Dr. Nelson made it okay. It was still difficult for me, but he was available to answer questions, provided interesting labs and analogies. He made it much less painful than it could have been.",1
"If you don't like science and need to take a gen ed, DON'T TAKE THIS. My advisor scheduled myself along with a few others in it and it is one of the hardest gen eds I have taken at PSU. Everyone I knew in this class struggled. Bill is super nice and funny, but meteorology is definitely not for those who aren't science oriented.",0
"She's merciless with her deadlines. I had a family member taken to a hospital on a life threatening emergency during the semester, and when I asked for an extension on the assignment, I got nothing but a big F as in F You.  Stay away",0
"If your goal is to learn something, dont take this class. If you dont want to talk you are screwed, and if you get the answer wrong get ready to be made fun of. Its her way or you get the question wrong. She adds too many steps to everything for no reason. Simplifying is no longer simple. More than 12 people dropped. You teach yourself.",0
"He is great. He knows what he is teaching. He talks a lot thou. Once he picks on u  he would have it with u the whole entire semester. But is fun, he is great and his assistant wendy too.",1

She's a pleasant lady but she expects you to remember waaaaay too specific of material that isn't relevant to archaeology. It's more just memorization.,1
"If you are not a political sci major, don't take this class. It's a ton of work and its not actually that interesting (its mostly just theory). She is also a strict grader and her system always seemed a little vague to me. She also cares a lot about things like passive voice in your journal entries, so if you are not a grammar nazi, watch out!",1
She was an amazing professor she was cheerful and focused on what we needed from her to pass the class. Definitely recommend :),1
an extremely difficult class for a breadth requirement. i transferred late into the class and never received credit for iclicker points. he only gives 3 exams with essay questions and I have never been able to review them. his class is hand note based and he refuses to put his material on sakai. he is one of the most frustrating professors at UD.,0
Best writing professor I had.  Reason I'm still writing!,1
"After reading the other reviews here, I think we can all agree on the fact that she's absolutely horrible at answering Piazza posts. She never actually answers your questions, she only dodges it, asking you to find the answer yourself (I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't need clarification!!) Lazy and very rude with her comments. One of the worst.",0
"Professor Bowler is nice, but her class is very boring. 3 group essays that combine for 10% of your grade and gives you about a week to write them. Remaining 90% is 3 in-class essay tests (30% each). She is a tough grader in general, but gives you 6 essay questions in advance and then three out of those six on the test. You pick one of the three.",1
Professor Green is the most unorganized Professor Ive ever had. He told us about tests and quizzes just a few days in advance which was extremely unfair. His lectures made no sense because he went on random tangents so I purely had to use the textbook to learn anything. Id never take him again.,0
"4 exams composed of questions requiring perfect memorization of several philosophical persons. He personally attacks you for not reading or being incapable of answering his questions. NOT OPEN-MINDED AT ALL! Utters inappropriate things in class and is just an all-around bad professor. More than half the class dropped the first week, but I couldnt.",0
She flies through her notes and is very hard to understand if you get lost once you're screwed for the test... ,0
She is one of the greatest professors I ever had! She explains material clearly and very simulated. I love being in her class. Not a single day that I want to miss her class!,1
DO NOT TAKE HER this teacher is terrible. She grades homework but doesn't tell you what you did wrong just to look at the notes. The notes are no help just all letters with no descriptions. I've held a 3.5 GPA but not after this class. This is the only class I have failed or gotten below a C. SHE IS TERRIBLE!!! Better be ready to teach yourself!!,0
"Great guy, but he makes us take the quizzes before he actually teaches the material, so they are tough. 7 online quizzes 2 tests and a final. You have to read case studies and be prepared to talk about them because he will call on you and that is what participation points are based on. He starts with a joke everyday. Its hard but I recommend him!",1
Tests are extremely hard and unfair to the students. If you have had no prior chemistry classes you will struggle. He keeps his office open for students to ask questions but he always seems annoyed. Rushes through subjects in class thus resulting in you becoming lost. You learn more than you would from Davis but it's much much harder.,0
"I was super excited to start this class. However, after working hard on papers and going by her rubrics, my grades were very poor on analysis papers. If you have a question, she seems very rude when she answers. Also, I wouldn't take this class if you work full time or are a full time student.",0
The class wasn't all that difficult and it is my fault for slacking off towards the end. But he was easily the worst CS professor I have ever had. I'm not sure if it was just me but the way he taught the class and interacted with students made me feel very unmotivated to participate. I would avoid taking a class with him at all costs.,0
"This professor is overrated.  I don't know how his clarity is so high.  He's hard to understand and doesn't explain enough.  Not terrible, but expects you to know too much.",0
Great Professor. Class was fun and pretty easy. He made the class way more fun than it probably should be. Make sure you show up every class. Participation is huge.,1
"I took him for computer illustration & desktop publishing my first year. He was very specific about details with everything you did right down to sketches. Then I took Graphic Design & it was better with giving us more time on a project. He is old so he is not up to date on things, if ur designs are advanced & new he will not understand ur concept.",0
"very organized, plenty of opportunities to obtain points.  Show up every class period and you'll do great.  Prof is willing and appreciates answers being asked and helping students during office hours.  (he even came in on Sundays for reviews)",1
"This class was a great experience. Not too hard, but challenging. She gives many examples of what she wants and is generally passionate about what she teaches. I recommend Zuidervaart.",1
I loved taking Dr. Sweet's class. She's really great and this course taught me a lot about non profit organizations and how they operate. Take her if you get the chance!,1
"Jerry grades promptly, tests were not overly difficult.  I would highly recommend taking him for Business Law I. ",1
HOnestly I have taken manuy online classes and have a GOA of 3.74 before before I took this professors class. She is hard to please if you get a bad grade and you question her she will give you details but when you apply her notes to the next assignments she will just add more issues. This professor is seriously the worst professor ever. STAY AWAY!,0
"Very rude and nit picky. Can be ridiculous with test expectations. You cannot write over a given line or you will not get points for the question, so make sure you write small.",0
Professor Vainberg gives you good opportunities to improve your grade. He drops the two worst quizzes (you get like 9 total) and the final can replace your worst grade. The sample problems are almost the exact same problems on the test. Came in not being too good at math but got an A in the class. Just have to study,1
He isn't clear at all. He's an awful teacher. You don't learn anything but the stuff he gives you is already all in French.,0
"Easily the best math teacher I've ever had. HW is mostly for extra help if you need it, and the tests are pretty tough. All around a great instructor",1
Not very helpful. Takes days to get a response from him and this class was online. The classwork was tough but trying to figure out what he wanted us to complete was tougher.,0
Frazel is really funny and makes class really really effing hiliarious... totally sarcastic and totally helpful. He made latin poetry interesting enough to get up early for class.,1
"Being a psychology major, I had taken her previously last year (first class on campus) and have noticed a significant difference in her demeanor and teaching rapport. Communication with her is rare at best and instructions on assignments are susceptible to changing weekly. Only recommend to those with lots of open time for studying.",0
"This semester was different from the pandemic (DUH), but it really gave us a chance to see professor's true colors. Professor Draper was terrible. She didn't support us in this internship class. She added more work than she should have, given how stressful this semester was. She left me feel unsupported in this class and I would not recommend it",0
This man is very sweet but very out of touch. Online teaching is definitely not his format of choice. He rambles a lot and I found myself doing better by not attending lectures.,0
She is the best psych professor ever! Her lectures are fun and she gives you everything you need to know on the test through the notes she has you write. Her class is just so fun and enjoyable. i never knew psychology was so much fun. Her tests are based on a few chapters at a time. Just go to class and take your notes and youre good!,1
Talks about race too much....knows a lot about math but doesn't know how to teach It,0
"Rob is extremely lenient, understanding, and easygoing and unlike a typical professor he treats you with realistic expectations and knows that ""life happens"" sometimes and is realistic and not unforgiving. Only downfall is talking in front of the class and multiple group projects! No textbook either - he provides it! I took multiple classes w/him.",1
Great class and teacher. Pay attention and show up. It's mostly essays but what's expected is made obvious.,1
Not a very good instructor. He makes things more difficult than they have to be.His tests include material not covered in class and he hardly ever shows up for class to begin with. WHen he does show up he is always at least 15 minutes late. Might as well be self study for all he cares.,0
Moshe Barach is such an inspiring speaker. He brings so much energy into each lecture that he makes the class interesting. The material also changed my view on business strategies and I learned a lot of important concepts. This is an I-Core class so it's nearly impossible to fail but it's really hard to get an A. Just keep that in mind.,1
"Professor Perkins is one of the best professors at Fordham. I took both of my theology courses with him and would take another class with him if I had the time. I really like his style of teaching &he picks texts that are relevant, and fun to read. He has interesting lectures and really cares about his students. Honestly can't recommend him enough.",1
"HORRIBLE communicator, never answers emails and is very unclear is specifying what he wants for assignments. Never take his class if you want to keep your sanity. The workload is huge and he is far too particular when grading. No creativity at all in the assignments because if you don't do it to his liking, you will get a bad grade.",0
Worst teacher I've ever had. It was an absurdly hard class. All of her tests except for the department test (which she did not create) were not anything like what she was teaching. Her tests were impossible to do well on even with Google. She was rude and unhelpful. This class killed my otherwise great GPA.,0
"She was nice, her TA, CJ on the otherhand was a straightup jerk! interesting class though. she's not boring at all. test's aren't hard, you just have to make sure you know every single poem, who wrote them and what they're about. If her TA isn't CJ, then you should be good with just her!",1
"HARDEST 100 LEVEL COURSE  HE EXPECTS WAY TOO MUCH FOR EACH EXAM; THEY ARE ALL CUMULATIVE, CONSIST OF EVERY KIND OF QUESTION.. SHORT ANSWER, FILL IN THE BLANK (NO WORD BANK) , MULTIPLE CHOICE, TRUE FALSE QUESTIONS SOMETIMES DONT EVEN MAKE SENSE  ALL MEMORIZATION  I DONT EVEN THINK HE  WOULD PASS HIS OWN EXAMS  FINAL IS THE SAME FORMAT ",0
"Do not take her, take another professor f possible. she does not even teach correctly, it is more of a self learning class",0
"Professor Vandenberg is great! She's really makes an effort to know every student in her class, and although she sometimes comes across as a little brash, she's a hilarious prof and an awesome person! She assigns a ton of reading, and as long as you do it, you'll do well.",1
"Excellent teacher.He knows Chemistry and he really cares about the students;he even has students over at his house for lunch EVERY Sunday.A difficult but worthwhile class.He's opinionated,but it's clear that he's not trying to force his opinions on to others but comically inform them of his own.",1
I love this class and this professor!,1
"Laura's class is extremely unorganized. She introduced a software that we were required to use a week before the end of the semester. On top of that, the assignments are tedious busy work that do not translate into additional learning. She tends to shut down questions when asked, so don't bother. She takes a difficult concept and makes it harder.",0
"He gives 300 question study guides for a 50 question test and you basically have to memorize every single question. Three exams and one final note test. The class is structured very weird, lectures and then go home and teach yourself the material from the textbook. I should have dropped this class when I had a chance.",0
"WORST PROF AT WPU!! DO NOT TAKE!! I cannot stress this enough!! I'm a straight A student, went to speak with her in person & she took an instant dislike to me when I told her how important school is to me & purposely made my semester difficult. She's rude, condescending and truly loathes her job. She's miserable and takes it out on us. STAY AWAY!!!",0
He is meticulously thorough in everything he does. Some classes get longwinded and there is no such thing as a short stop by office hours. He is very bright and very fair on tests and grading. Great professor.,1
He was a really great professor for the whole semester. Classes during the pandemic are hard but he was always available and answering emails almost right away. Does not give a lot of work to do but to pass you have to make sure to turn in assignments ON TIME and just be aware of everything he posts. Overall easy A and an interesting class.,1
Great teacher! He is very clear and will explain everything completely. He is very patient and will go back to anything you didn't understand.,1
"I tried to give him a chance throughout the year and not be mean on this website but he is  the worst professors i have taken my entire 3 years in college...... WAY to much work, unrealistic expectations for class, and in my opinion is your students are consistently failing your test and you have to cure them by 30 plus % then something is wrong!  ",0
"If you learn well from a teacher who sits behind a projector all class, scribbling on paper, she's your lady.  Half the time you could barely see what she was writing when she was going through examples. Horrible class.",0
"Great professor ! Clear grader ! You must understand the readings before taking the exams ,this is a MUST . Do not simply Google the answers or you are sure to have a tough semester . I highly recommend this professor ! ",1
WAY to picky!!!!!!!!,0
"A great all around person/professor. She's amazing, easy to work with, understanding, attentive, passionate about her subject, etc. The material was great (3 essays throughout the semester). She never ever made the class boring. I seriously love her and worked my schedule around so I could take her again, she's just that great. Please take her!!",1
"Very interesting class because of the field trips. However, He is very confusing during lectures and contradicts himself on the information he wants us to write about on the tests. The information is very theoretical. His grading scale is crazy. He says its basically impossible to get an A. DO NOT TAKE.",0
"Although I had absolutely no interest in operations going in, Darwin was a great teacher who made the various topics interesting. Probably one of the top MBA classes I've taken because it exposed me to something I had no knowledge of previously, and his very dry sense of humor made it even better. Definitely take this class with Darwin!",1
This professor is so funny and his lectures are super engaging while adding to the class material. The class was based entirely on 3 exams all of which were take home and short answer essay question based. I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed learning it. Amazing course.,1
"His class is not easy, but hes a good guy and cares a lot. Show up and study and youll do well.",1
"Simple straight forward class, took it online. Please do not complain and cry about how many assignments are due. It's a very short online class, 20 assignments altogether - 3 exams (with reviews) you can easily pass them if you do the reviews, the other 17 things to do are simple. Easy A",1
"My favorite teacher of freshman year. Cancels class more than most teachers, tells great stories, is funny and keeps you entertained. Quizzes are really easy.",1
"Dr. McKenzie is overrated. Everyone said to take one of his classes because they're ""fun"". This was a 100 level class but he treated it like a 400 level class and I had to teach myself everything from the book.",0
"Take professor Deason! She is an amazing professor, one of my favorites at UWL. She is very personable and engaging with her students. She gives study guides for the exams and they are spot on. Fill out the study guides and you will do perfectly fine!!! Also she does a lot of 5point discussions that are nice grade boosters.",1
"I hate this class. Group work, forced class discussion, and a lot of homework.",0
"Great teacher, he's a common sense kind of guy don't ask obvious questions, tests are easy if you study, he's willing to answer questions if u need to, do you homework and you will do just fine on the test... sit in the front, and just follow along. hes a pretty chill guy and every now and then will say something funny..",1
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
"Tests and quizzes were only about quotes--not anything you actually learned. Quotes matter, yeah, but they don't tell you about anything you learned. So basically, you're memorizing nothing. Lots of reading and the textbook was hard and terrible. Long, old English, boring even for Philosophy majors. It was also an 8:30, two hour lecture. THE WORST.",0
"Very clear instructions, wants everyone to participate. If you read the stories and attend class you will receive a good grade. Makes class interesting and choosing books with great topics. Overall a great professor.",1
"I loved how organized the class was, and you knew your grade at any given time. His exams were quite difficult, and I found myself studying for hours just to get a B. However, there are lots of ways to rack up points with easy class quizzes and labs. You definitely learn the material well in this class, and I suggest finding a study partner.",1
poor poor poor,0
When I took this course I didnt know I was expected to already be an expert. His teaching is rare. He judges you from day 1 based on what you look like. I had to get my own help and avoided him as much as possible. I tried reporting him several times but soon found out that its no use. They dont care. Very Sad for SMUs CSE Department.,0
"Amazing! One of the most engaging lecturers I've ever had. Very clear, concise, and actually rather entertaining. The class is pretty intense - lots of reading and attention needs to be paid - but with a bit of effort the course is really worth it. I would recommend it to anyone.",1
3 mc exams on definitions found in the textbook. 5 easy hw assignments. he grades on participation and attendance but as long as you show up you'll be fine. he doesn't allow any electronics. you don't need to pay attention long as you memorize about 50 terms each exam. he's approachable and always willing to explain more. kinda boring lectures.,1
"Overall, I enjoyed this course. It was interesting and relevant to my field of focus. Dr. Gilbert was helpful for me with responding to emails fast whenever I had questions for him and was always willing to help. The only big critique I have is his lack of uploading grades on Blackboard to allow me to see my progress throughout the course.",1
"Took this course as a birdcourse but it was NOT because of the prof. The course content was SO easy but the exams and MARKING was UNFAIR. I think Natalie would be a better prof if this wasn't an online course, she was helpful during the ""field trip"" but was so hard to reach through email. The quizzes, test, and field trip really boost ur mark tho!",0
"lovely human being. wants nothing but everyone to do great. fantastic speaker and conveys what he needs to efficiently and does not waste your time. i really enjoy this professor, and i have taken all the classes that i was allowed to take- provided i was not a business major at all. great guy would rate 10/10.",1
HES THE WORST TEACHER EVER AND VERY DISRESPECTFUL,0
"Very fair, gives you many opportunities to pass with extra credit papers.  Will meet with you on her own time to give more instruction.  Expects you to give an effort and if you do you will pass.",1
"Class is really easy but she is a terrible prof. Cancelled class and moved tests the night before or 10 min before. Extremely unorganized and grades the tests months after taking them. You have no idea of your grade the entire semester. Don't even try emailing, she won't respond.",0
"Easy A, but the class is taught like a high school class. You have to show up to lecture and do worksheets. There is a lot of busy work.",0
"Class is boring and goes the whole 3 hours! Hard to stay awake. Tests are some MC (hard) and 1 or 2 math problems that are exactly like the one he did in class--easy if you memorize how to do it. Seldom available outside class because he's doing his own real estate investing, even has his assistant write emails to the class on his behalf.",0
"THIS CLASS IS GREAT, SHE'S SO NICE. YOU DO ALOT OF FUN THINGS AND JUST KICK BACK. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!! (TAKE HER)",1
"Grading criteria is never clear. Susan has developed a bad attitude towards students and if she doesnt like you, you will know. You have to participate to get in her good books and even then, if your opinion is doesnt match hers she wont like you. She has no passion for the industry at all anymore.",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had, I hate history classes but she actually made me interested and kept me awake. What makes her such an amazing professor is you can just tell how intelligent and passionate she is about what she's teaching. Highly highly highly recommend her!!!",1
"No matter how interested you think you are in this subject, trust me, it's not enough to justify taking this class. Impossibly hard.",0
Professor is negligent and gets off topic. Teaching methods are absurd. Expects too much from a 200 level class. Don't take any classes with him!!,0
He is great at explaining things so that you understand them. The class is pretty easy but he makes it easy to do well and goes over lots of examples in class so you can be prepared for the test. He has a slight accent but is not hard to understand at all. He is a good prof. and i would recommend taking his class. he also usually offers EC on exams,1
"I have never had a teacher that grades so ridiculously, she has no clear rubric for how she grades at all. I wholeheartedly believe when grading she takes into account if she likes your or not (your attendance/attention in class). She try to make it near impossible to make a high A, only allowing a 95 as highest grade on discussion boards.",0
Online class - Prof is very vague and incredibly inconsistent in stating what he wants and in dealing with students.  Not in touch with the real world at all.  He's a classic example of someone who is probably book smart but has no common sense.,0
"His class is a nightmare, everything he teaches you dont need to know. But everything he says 1 time write that down! Its gunna be on the test! His review covers 10% of whats on the test even though he says at the end of his review thats everything on the test. His hand writing is awful and labs good luck figuring it out yourself.",0
Really good guy who is very passionate about what he teaches. Movies are usually somewhat dark and thought provoking.,1
Dr. Curtis was my favorite teacher during my first semester at Salve! Her tests are VERY tough but get a tutor and you will get a great grade in the class. This class with her should be mandatory for everyone at Salve Regina. I wish she was my mom because is the coolest.,1
"This class is a joke. Lectures do not make sense and is him just going on and on about some rant. Have to make 86% on final not matter if your overall grade is an A. So basically, nobody gets an A because his tests are all hypothetical. He clearly knows a lot about biology, but he does not know how to deliver that information without ranting.",0
Boring subject material but very straightforward. All tests open book. Great guy but horrible material.,1
Get her if you can! She is super nice if you work hard and show up for class. I have always hated giving speeches and she made it fun.,1
"Taking NRM 462 with Neil was very fun and intellectually stimulating. Neil is a huge nerd and is very good at teaching the subject. NRM 462 labs were mostly outdoors, featured hands-on activities, and included a few fun field trips. 10/10 would recommend Neil as a prof",1
"She was the sweetest and most caring professor. I got an A- in the course, which I think I deserved. She always gave good feedback and basically gave me all ideas for the midterm and final paper during her office hours. Not too much homework. If she fits in your schedule, definitely take her because her classes get filled up pretty quick!",1
Prof Yamazaki is a great and very knowledgeable teacher.  The subject matter can be a little overwhelming at first.  But if you study and know what she covers in lecture you will do well on the tests.  She gave extra credit for the tests and gives in class and pre-class assignments which will help you keep your grade up.  ,1
just study hard,1
"I took Dr. Godshalk expecting amazing things from these other reviews. I have always been an A student and this class was just a joke. He is unorganized, scatter brained, and more. He would constantly mess up on his quizzes and get content backwards. This class was a waste.",0
"Dr. D'Sa truly cares for all of his students and it shows in the way he teaches and makes sure that everyone understands the material. Unlike most classes, he actually relates the content to real life. There were 3 easy tests, a final, 10 short homeworks, and a short case study.",1
"It can be tough to get a good online instructor who responds promptly with clarity and actually communicates with you, rather than just two word answers. Sondra was the best online instructor I've ever had. Her assignments are thought-provoking and on topic. I felt like she was in the class with us and not just some abstract identity.",1
"Dr. Mescioglu is an excellent teacher who is very knowledgable in mathematics. Also is the easiest teacher ever! I took him for Finite, Decision Science, and Systems and they were all easy classes that I learned a lot in! Highly Recommend!",1
I took this class this semester and it was very easy. I showed up only for test days. If you take the quizzes multiple times before a test then you'll do fine on tests. He also offers a lot of extra credit so its an easy A class.,1
"Miss class and you will not pass. She is a Pro Public Speaker and wants everything done EXACTLY how she says it. As long as you do the work, work hard for the grade you will pass the class. She is a tough grader, points deduct if you do not follow her outline. WILL NOT pass this class if you do not do your speeches. I got like 6 assignments a week.",1
"This could be the worst professor on campus. She has no leniency so anything late is a 0. She makes you read out of a pointless textbook on a weekly basis, and then asks questions on quizzes that do not relate. This teacher is terrible and I highly recommend that you do no take this teacher, every other public speaking teacher is better than her",0
"He is not great at explaining things. You will rely on the textbook, classmates, or SICE tutors when you're confused. He has plenty of office hours available but he can be kind of... aggressive. He allows you to make up any HW and retake tests so it is possible to get 100 in the class. Beware: to make up HW you must write the entire code by hand.",0
"Way too many assignments for an elective course. He also marks too hard with little to no feedback on the assignments. Each week there's 5 assignments to do. unless you have excess time on your hands, it's difficult to complete. Replies to emails really late and does not take into consideration the fact that students have other courses. Avoid!!",0
Dr Harland was an amazing prof. Math is not my strong suit but Dr Harland made this course a lot easier than it could have been. His videos explaining the topics were very thorough along with the examples done in class. He made sure to answer any questions anybody had and was overall a course I enjoyed attending.,1
JOKE. I learned more about time and territory management during my summer internship.,0
really a very enthusiastic prof. Made class really interesting,1
"Russell is awesome. The class was a little jumbled because it was her first time teaching it, but it wasn't that bad. Very little work and interesting discussion topics. Only criticism is that the TA grades papers and there's very little variance in grades regardless of quality--it's going to be a 90-92 regardless, which makes an A (96) difficult.",1
Great professor overall. James gives good lectures that are very clear and intellectual. The labs assigned provide knowledge in the course material and his grading is more than fair.,1
She is very straightforward with what you need to know. Just study for the exams and attend all the lectures.,1
"Dr. Palkovitz really knows what he's talking about and has a lot of life experience, which is nice. He tries to be funny in class which is kinda painful to sit through. The exams are so much more difficult than they need to be.",1
"Never have I ever had a professor this wonderful.  She is not only an excellent teacher, but is a also one of the best human beings I have ever met.  She has made me love spansih more than english.  Only fools would not love her.",1
Best. Teacher. Ever.,1
It seems impossible at first. u need to go to class everyday&take good notes-i recorded him on my phone which I HIGHLY recommend. 2 exams on a lot of material. I got As on both purely by memorizing. He grades papers hard but they don't really matter(i got cs on them). In the end I'm really happy I took him. u actually learn in his class. just study,1
"Very nice instructor, go to her office hours and never hesitate to email her with your questions. Work hard, everyone can get good grades.",1
"I dont undetstand how he would be hired at this school. Trying to understand him is the least trouble, he doesnt know what he is teaching, doesnt know how to explain anything he says. Basically the whole class is self thought and youre paying to sit down in a pointless class. Gets so bad that we had to correct his answers multiple times. GPA ruined",0
She is nice and gave us extra credit options but talks supper fast. Did give an exam study guide that helped. A bit reading heavy.,1
"I kid you not the absolute worst professor I have come in contact with. I know how to work hard and get good grades in even the toughest of classes but this class by far was so poorly tough and I received the worst grade in my college career. If you're taking STAT 200, take it ONLINE and NOT with this cruel man. Hope you read this, Tony.",0
"Dr. Markham has the best intentions, but COB 291 is a hard class. I have learned a lot from her, but she is very picky in regards to grading. She seems to be very tough but once you get to know her she is actually very sweet.",1
She is the worst professor I have ever metshe doesn't respect student and humiliate student in front of everyone else,0
"Yeah, Terry's a great guy. I don't know what a couple of these people did to him that they see him negatively, but truth is, if you're working hard, he's right there with you trying to help you achieve your goals, whatever they might be. He's an incredible person and - as someone else said - a world class, uniquely gifted musician.",1
Facile!!,1
"I really recommend taking her bio 126 class. Mrs Williams is so smart, but kind and gives you all the information you need to know. She always encourages you to give answers in class and really engages you throughout lecture. :)",1
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
"DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS WITH THIS MAN... Dr. Davis is a extremely personable man. I respect him very much as a man, he tries very hard to allow students to voice opinions and attempts to be fair. However, he is VERY disorganized and unclear with everything he does, unless you meet with him and get to know him you will probably get a bad grade.",0
She's really smart and knows her stuff but she is very dry. Make sure you bring your clicker or you can't take the pop quiz you have EVERY CLASS. She gives online work to do on Fridays but get ready to spend 2-4 hours on it and I didn't think all of them were super related to the course.,0
"The professor is a nice, fair and great teacher. At times, he gets off subject here and there, but he is always on track.  He knows his subject.  No quizzes at all, only mid-term and final exams but you must study, study and study for those exams.  We do have class projects on case studies but it isn't hard.",1
Do not take this professor under any circumstances. For some reason she believes her students should dedicate most of their time to her class despite it being a Miami plan class for most. The tests are filled with ambiguously worded questions which cause averages in the high 60's and essays are expected throughout the semester. Do not take her.,0
"Dr Jamieson has a good heart, and is a nice man, but I did not feel that he had the qualifications to teach my course. Additionally, his lectures were virtually pointless and not supportive with the rest of the course. Most of the semester was taught by students(via presentations).",0
"WAY too many assignments, but I liked her lectures and she helped me understand the concepts easily. Her tests were straightforward and not confusing, as long as you show up to class, pay attention, and actually study! I hated the Mastering Biology homework - it makes you want to shoot yourself. This was the sole reason I didn't take her for Bio 2.",1
"Really good.  Explains concepts really well.  There are no quizzes and only 3 homework assignments that were collected all year.  Assigns homework that is not collected, and will go over it at the beginning of class if anyone asks about a problem.  Tells you what you need for the test, which is alot like the homework.",1
"I would not take this man again. The man runs away from you if he sees you outside of class. In fact, while in class, he rambles about his daily life and things unrelated. He usually brought toys to play with in class and had us hold them and made us play with them too. He pulled aside one of our classmates, who was an old man, to yell at him.",0
the worst professor ever,0
"He's a really nice guy, and knows the material well but as far as explaining it, the message won't get across. You will need to go to the lab because taking the class alone won't help you. He reads off the PowerPoint ",1
shes so nice!! loves what she does and cares about her students. awesome accent not hard to understand what shes saying. take her hist of arch class if you need to take a history class!!,1
"I took this class and made an A.  However, it wasn't because of her.  I needed help constantly because I couldn't understand what she wanted on the assignments.  She never e-mailed back, and I mean NEVER!  I didn't even know what I was making in the class until the last TWO WEEKS!",0
I found this Prof ro be very helpful.  I enjoyed her classes.  She seems to care about the students but holds a high standard- I learned my stuff,1
"Gives you samples for midterm and final, similar questions. Online quiz and homework, easy A if you are following, attendance is mandatory first several classes. The book is not required.",1
"plays favorites, hard grader",0
Pawkett is amazing.  He knows so much and more than that he knows how to teach.  He's not a show off even tho he could be and he just makes it easy for you to understand the material.  Guitar is something a lot of people **** up and he just makes it seem so easy.,1
It's hard to put a bad rating for this professor because he cares and could potentially bring so much to the class with life experiences. Although he didn't really teach and thinks all problems are trivial for a first time dynamics student. Multiple choice tests are lazy and unfair in my eyes for an engineering student. Don't expect it to change,0
If you are considering taking Devcomm please do yourself a favor a take this professor. She is an awesome professor and a beautiful person. Her teaching style is very good and you will learn so much from  her lectures. I had a very nice experience taking her class and learned so much. I highly recommend her to everyone.,1
"Dr. Lee is such a nice person but I would not take his class again. His exams are so hard, I failed every one. HIs lectures don't help, you are basically teaching yourself. Nobody even shows up to class. You have to read the chapter before class and that doesn't even help. Maybe tutoring would have helped me. HARDEST CLASS, PICK SOMEONE ELSE!",0
"GRMN200 is a generally straight-forward course if you are at the 200 level - and Frau Thibault doesn't make it any more confusing.  Attendance is mandatory and there are weekly assignments, as with other low-level language courses. Even though Frau Thibault sometimes treats students like little kids, take her instead of Riehl.",1
"I am a Semester 4 student of the paralegal education program and Ms. Pemberton is by far the very worst teacher at Humber College. She is very anal, she does not mark your valiant efforts well, and she is far too strict. Take another else for Criminal Summary Convictions and your grades will be great!",0
Not will to help you understand information. Rushes through lecture and expects you to learn information not cover in class on your own. Tell student that they should not be working if they are taking his class,0
Dr. Derrick made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I had a 78% right before the final paper. I ended with a D- overall. That's more than a letter grade. He tells you that he didn't receive your work even though you have proof that you gave it to him. He is horrible and I refuse to take him ever again.,0
"USELESS NOTES & BORING  IF YOU DONT GO TO THE CLASS, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE",0
"This prof is terrible. He is the most horrible prof I have never ever seen before in the school. All he can do in the class is to only read PPT. Everyone can be a prof if only reads PPT. Also, he hates to answer your question. I take his morning class everyday but leart nothing. Do not take his class unless you want to fail this course.",0
"Trier is a funny dude, but his teaching method makes exams extremely difficult.",0
"A wonderful teacher and person. You NEED to take her for 115. She is so helpful, don't be afraid to ask her for clarification. She is so sincere and wants her students to succeed. Wonderful!",1
"I thought this class was very interesting but the work load for the class exceeds the credit hours granted. I do not regret taking it, however I would not recommend the class unless you have lots of extra time to read the millions of articles required.",1
"The subject matter was difficult & the class was time-consuming, but the teacher is excellent, and if you are willing to put in the time and do the work, you can get an A.",1
This guy is a total jerk....Really offensive and demeaning.,0
SHE IS SO AWESOMEEE!!SUPER EASY CLASS GUARANTEED A !!SHE IS THE MOST UNDERSTANDING TEACHER EVER :) LOVE HERRR WOULD TAKE HER FOR EVERYTHING IF I COULD :) TAKE IT!,1
"Online CS-1400 from Professor Jingpeng is pretty easy if you have previous Python experience. You do weekly textbook assignments, 7 Python programming projects, and 3 exams you can take from home. I liked how he sent out weekly announcements. This class is a textbook-reading class, but if you need help, Professor Jingpeng is willing to assist.",1
"My favorite professor I have ever had. Her class is very difficult but if you make it a point to establish a relationship with her, go to her after/before class and make friends with the smart people in the class you'll do fine. She is a tough grader but her goal is not to see her students fail. Taught me not only science but life lessons.",1
She lectures so fast and throws so much information in at oncit's as if she expects us all to know how to do calculus already,0
"If you take a class with Daniel, you better be prepared for a lot of group projects/presentations and a ton of weekly reading. In the classes I've taken with him, we always do weekly reading responses. These usually consist of 3-4 reading that are 20-40 pages each. Also doesn't allow technology in-class to refer to the readings for discussion.",0
"This professor is ridiculous. I was in his first online class, and he told the class to give feedback on how he could improve the course. Soon we all realized that his teaching method was incompatible with almost everyone and asked him to help us out and NOTHING CHANGED. The class is VERY reading heavy, and the readings are not very organized.",0
This man was so caught up on the fact that this was a 300 level class that it didnt matter how much work you put into it. He would just put random grades on the top of your paper depending on how he felt. One major project which he doesnt tell you the requirments for but figures that you should know them. horrible! i would never ever get him.,0
Great Professor; his projects are interesting and his lectures are helpful,1
"The lectures can drone on forever but go to the pass sessions in order to get a clear and cohesive summary. Adams is hilarious and tells you exactly what is on each test. Even lets you bring an index card on the final. Does not use technology whatsoever but still has office hours early in the morning. Intimidating at first, but easy to talk to.",1
"This professor is excellent and very easy to talk to!  She goes over the material thoroughly and doesn't hold your hand.  She expects students do their work.  She's strict with deadlines and expectations.  Projects are self-explanatory and kinda fun! Tests are ""open notes"" on 3x5"" cards only - double-sided. Very fair grading scheme! Enjoyed it!!",1
Professor Stone seemed to almost check out from teaching halfway through the semester. She hands you worksheets on new concepts and will not give much information as to what to do. She is extremely vague when you ask for help. Good luck to anyone who gets stuck in this class.,0
"Rebecca has truely left a great impresson. I hate speaking in front of people, but she is really helpful. She is indeed quirky, and very fun. I wouldn't ever miss her class because i enjoy her lectures so much. Definiately take her for comm, she's great.",1
"She makes BIO 131 bearable! I liked her so much I took her for BIO 132! She is very nice, energetic, friendly, helpful, funny, & easy to talk to. Her exams are difficult but if you study the powerpoint handouts she gives you, you can pass this class. It requires a lot of time and effort on your part but that is true with any science class!",1
"I loved having Birkett as my professor, her lectures are interesting without deviating from the information, she adds an interesting neurological spin to PSY 101.",1
Great teacher and even better guy! I took his class and learned a lot!,1
"If you have the patience to sit in silence for an hour and listen to her go on and on, this class is for you. I love the material, and the only work at all are to create diary entries. No exam. It is a super easy class, literally no work involved. However, her lectures are the most boring hour of my day. ",1
"I LOVED Perucci and loved this class. I truly learned a lot and Perucci was hilarious and caring. Attendance is mandatory and most of your grades are comprised of essays, but all assignments are more or less easy and enjoyable.",1
"It's a shame that such an interesting topic can be ruined by such a monotone and unenthusiastic professor, never mind the fact that his class is disorganized and often crammed. He gives zero feedback on graded assignments and it is hard to take a professor seriously who constantly makes grammatical errors in his lecture materials. He is very nice.",0
Have to study a lot because she puts questions on tests that she didn't even talk about. By the end of the semester she had not gone over 4 chapters which were on the HESI. Had a B all semester then her final was extremely hard and ruined my grade and she would not round it by .5 points.,0
"He is really hard to understand. He contradicts himself during lessons and confuses himself a lot, which makes it hard for his students to understand. He is forgetful and spends most of the class mumbling.",0
"Professor Billings is not a professor you take for an easy A. She's a professor you take because you want to learn. She makes you work for your grade, but if you put in the work you will get good results. She is by far the best professor I have ever had at Grand Valley so far. Take her if you can.",1
"Better be good at spelling, and writing. very tough grader, AVOID at all costs.",0
Girard is awesome,1
"Too easy. If you are someone who is wanting to improve on grammar andor their writing skills, do not take him. He plays too many movies in classes, which I find to be a waste of my money I am putting towards the class to earn the credit. He could be rude at times to some. I would not recommend him.",0
"really nice guy, wants you to succeed so going to his office hours about the projects is super helpful because he goes through the answers with you. attendance is mandatory or you wont have any of the notes or know how to do the projects, do well the entire semester because at the end of the course the final is OPTIONAL!!! Very nice guy all around",1
"laid back cancelled class when he felt like it, just like not showing up, or being an hour late, raised all our grades on a curve, i lucked out and got a B. he was very very relaxed. No homework ever, used text book once entire semester.",0
"I took Calc 1 and ended with a C-, took Calc 2 with Jennifer and ended with a B+ . She really cares if you are understanding what is going on in class, in fact her whole teaching style is structured around that. She goes over material in the beginning of class, and goes around w TA to each group giving them 1:1 help. Extremely recommend taking her.",1
"Homework and in-class problems do not prepare you well for the quizzes and tests. Homework is ten times harder than anything you talk about in many cases, and I already took calculus and learned a lot of the information for the course in high school before coming to her class. Don't be afraid to ask others for help.",0
This class was made a LOT more difficult than it needed to be. Participation points in her class were 10000x more difficult to get than in any other of the French classes.  She also was very impatient with her students and got frustrated very easily. This class should have been an easy A but unfortunately this wasn't the case,0
"She gives more work than I've ever had in any class and only ever gives negative feedback, basically everything you do is wrong unless its exactly what she asked for. Prepare to spend 8 hours per homework assignment and its all repetitive. Theres no book, but articles to read for every class on top of huge assignments.",0
"All we did was write 4 reflection papers. He is extremely unclear and unorganized. He didnt even upload the syllabus or readings until the 3rd week of the semester and the paper was due that next week. Honestly, an easy class as long as you just write the paper. You dont even need to do the readings as long as you can answer the prompt.",0
"This professor isn't really a professor. His involvement in the class is close to nothing, aside from posting bizarre due dates that don't have any pattern to them. I taught myself the coursework online.. why does he get paid for doing nothing? Don't take the course if you need help or your hand to be held.. he's a slow responder. Just tedious.",0
"Professor Casimir is amazing!!! He makes all of his tests, and homework online. Even his final exam is online. You will only have a couple of quizzes, but you can use your notes. Easiest science class in Howard.",1
"Avoid, boring, spoon-feeds material, opinionated and dry as dust",0
Absolutely terrible!,0
Mr. Battaglia is the best professor at SUNY Fredonia. He will teach you to be a professional bowler in no time.,1
I am surprised to see how good of reviews this guy had.. When I was taking his class he was a pretty bad professor tbh. He rushes explanations and doesn't really get to the point of what we need to know.. Isnt practical by any means.. He knows his stuff I dont deny him that.. He just is not good at teaching the material IMO. The exam was hard.,0
"If you are taking this class for theories (ACS 330) don't be nervous or scared. Make sure you study for the quizzes and read through the chapters. Heads up: MEMORIZE any lists of stuff that are mentioned in the book and he gives extra credit- always over NPR. Amazing teacher. He is genuine, honest, and inspiring. TAKE HIS CLASSES NOW!!",1
"Come to class prepared. I took it in the summer so it was 5 weeks. We read through 4 THICK books before the 5 weeks ended. You MUST come to class prepared (have read) otherwise you will fall behind very quickly. This class is not for you if you think you can breeze through undetected. Good professor, is willing to help you if you help yourself.",1
"Hilarious guy! Love the energy he brings to class. He is easy going but gets the point straight across. As long as you get your work done and listen to the information, it's an easy A. No tricks about this class. I hate presenting but this class was great",1
"I think he is a unfair grader, He has in his head what he wants to see from you and you have to read between the lines. His curriculum is to complicated, even for him.  All his grading is subjective on papers and essay, you will never get a paper without some comments. He may even mark up his own paper. The material is not hard. He makes it hard.",0
A really nice person but not a nice professor. The class is poorly taught and the textbook is useless. Homework problems are often impossible to solve and tests are for creative mathematicians. Almost depressed by taking this class.,0
If you have the chance to take him as a teacher I would avoid him. He makes makes things WAY harder than they should be. He gives plenty of worksheets and practice problems to prepare us for tests and then makes the tests unnecessarily hard. Elementary Math should not be a hard topic to teach but he makes it more complicated than it should be.,0
"okay so i am currently in her  class and all of these other comments are completely exaggerated. when she speaks she sounds so unintelligent and she really has no clue what she is talking about. does not explain much and her voice is really annoying.and the first thing she says every class is ""have podium, will travel""..i dont recommend her.",0
She is extremely opinionated!!! She is rude if she does not like you or your art. Student's attendance is mandatory but she was ALWAYS late. Easy A if you do the work though.,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAMP! If he is the only professor available, wait until next semester. He seems great and wonderful until after the last day of dropping the class before having to pay. On one writing I decided to try and be a good student and find the entire book of the section the reading came out of and he counted off, DONT TAKE HIM!!",0
"Professor Ryburn is the absolute best. She is caring of her students (awesome enough to learn everyone's name), has a great personality, and will help you out whenever you need it. I strongly recommend taking her for Precal if you must take the class.",1
The lectures were disorganized. 200+ pages reading a night before the class not discussed. Very tough grader. DONT TAKE HER CLASS.,0
"On the downside, she assigned group work during online learning, which is a bad move. But she made up for it by being extremely flexible and understanding. She didn't have hard deadlines on nearly anything, which was nice. She also was very accessible, I've sent so many emails and she's responded within a couple hours every time. She clearly cares.",1
"Great teacher, really makes you comfortable.",1
"She might be a good therapist , but a horrible educator . One of my worst professor forever",0
"Plain and simple, if you aren't an economics major/if you are looking to fulfill the requirement and not be depressed, do not take phil heap. He's an acquired taste. You'll either love him or dislike him there is no in-between. He uses fun examples to engage the class when he teaches like beer, cigarettes, etc. He knows his stuff. He's just tough.",0
"Please save yourself the trouble of taking this teacher. He is very disorganized, lost my essay the last day of class, made me buy an online tutor program which we didn't use, and grades very harshly. He teaches only through powerpoint and is not very good at it. I learned nothing in this class.",0
"Take him for the sake of your GRADE, all you need to do is put in your very best. He has a thick accent, everyone will say that but all you need is an amazing professor who will not be so hard on you nor make the class harder than it already is. If i could take him again, I will without thinking twice.",1
"Prof. Masterson is not a mean man, but is a terrible prof. I am a decent math student and this class was extremely difficult for me. He talks very low (both in volume and pitch), which makes it difficult to focus. The test questions were 10x harder than the examples in class and if you didn't solve it exactly his way he would mark it wrong.",0
"Amazing amazing. I took my first philosophy class, and first college class with him - life changing. His method will definitely get you to think - and make you realize you need to think. Tough grader, but man is it worth it. Everything you go through seems brilliant and flawless at first, then he tears it up - till you master that same art yourself",1
"I have to say, I'm not impressed. This is the easiest graduate class I've taken, which makes it hard to feel like you're getting your $'s worth.",0
"GREAT professor. Runs great class discussion, passionate about teaching pedagogical and writing issues. I learned so much from his class. He is clear and thorough about assignments. A lot of reading and short response writing-- you definitely have to earn your grade. Is tough, has high expectations, but gives great feedback on one-on-one meetings.",1
"Dr. Barb has very good prepared her course, which is very interesting and quite useful.",1
Don't take this class! He doesn't teach a thing in the lectures but once a week he'll have one where he acts like he taught everything and no one has any clue whats going on! His tests and lectures are like two completely different classes. The first midterm the class average was 44%!!!,0
He doesn't take any questions and assume you have know everything already,0
"I do have to say, I wish he gave us more assignments for grades. Our only grade was the final. And if you dont do well, you fail. For the amount of notes we took we shouldve had more assignments for grading. Great teacher though and will help if you ask. Take notes on everything he says!!!",1
Mike is a great professor who really cares about his students. This is his last semester at Volstate and easily one of my favorites.,1
"LOTS OF HOMEWORK!!! She sends ""What's Due"" emails after each class. No tests, but if you don't show up, you WILL fall behind. She's very busy, but responds to emails very quickly. She's pretty awesome in general, and really interactive.",1
He is a very GOOD professor! He's interesting and he is clear about what he wants on his exams. He has a very special way of teaching the material-one that captures your interest and makes you understand the material. He's great!,1
"Class is just discussions, not hard. Read plays, easy to read. Have to attend a few performances, kinda sucks. Class is easy but he's kind of a hard grader, doesn't make it clear what he's expecting.",1
Lectures are so unbelievably boring and dry. The quizzes/tests are so specific. You could study for days and still fail. One of the TAs who is a phD candidate took one of the quizzes and got a 35/50. How are we supposed to do any better? All of the study guides he gives are so long with multiple grammatical errors that are very difficult to follow,0
lovely and explains very well,1
Dr. Burd's lectures and exams are very easy to follow. She tells you exactly what she expects and what to study and is extremely helpful inside and outside of the classroom. She's also very caring!,1
"his class kicked my butt, read the text and do the reviews and you will be ok!",0
"Gets angry that people don't take her class seriously, and acts incredibly demeaning to those who ask questions. I wouldn't dare ask a question that she might think is stupid, out of fear that she'll give me a snarky response in an annoyed tone, making sure the whole class knows that ""you should know this"".",0
"Super unclear about her expectation especially with the final group project. She also makes all online reviews inaccessible the night before an exam, even if your exam isn't until 4pm the next day. Lastly, BORING! Save yourself and take this class with ANYONE ELSE!",0
He will work with you should you run into problems. He called me when he did't see my midterm in webtycho. I had sent the test questions by accident but not the completed assignment.,1
"Ina Markham is by far the worst teacher I have ever had to work with in my entire life. She is disrespectful to those who do not understand the content. She does what she wants and cares only for the goodie goodies in her class, and assigns exuberant amounts of work over the weekends. If you can avoid her DO IT and if you have to take her I'm sorry",0
Terrible attitude toward students. Unprofessional. Severely unorganized. I would avoid this professor completely.,0
"Be ready to put effort in. Dr. Burghart is very old school, so make sure you know what you're getting into before signing up. He is from the North so many southerners don't take his tone in the right way, but he means not harm by it. Lots of reading quizzes and lecture heavy, but overall a great class if its what you're passionate about!",1
"Best professor I have ever had. Words can't describe my adoration, respect, and appreciation for him. Taking a class from him is the best decision you will ever make.",1
"This class annoyed me even as someone who speaks Spanish. Homework every night and very nit-picky grader on the tests. Not an effective way of learning the language. At the end of 10 weeks no one could speak more than a handful of phrases in Spanish, let alone hold a conversation. Not an easy A.",1
"Really great online course. I was very hesitant about taking this course at first (have to buy some of the films). But I really enjoyed it. It's no easy A, but it definitely is manageable. I didn't realize how much I enjoyed film until I took this course. Hopefully I can take her next Spring before I graduate!",1
"Dr. Carlisle is the best professor at CSUB I have ever had.  The material is difficult and kinda boring to most people, but his sense of humor and incredible knowledge of his discipline make the class much more enjoyable than I expected.  Engl 319 is the most useful class I've taken in college, and that is largely due to Dr. Carlisle' teaching.",1
"This is a horrible class. Sue will spend the entire class talking, but nothing that is important for the test. Her power points didn't help either. They are crazy tough graders. It's almost impossible to get anything higher than a C on the essay exams. I would not recommend taking this class.",0
Didnt buy textbook. Attend all lectures take good notes and youll be fine. She gives essay exams but tells you the six questions a week before so you can prepare. go to her office hours that week and shell tell you what to include in each answer. Also has extra credit essays,1
"I've never failed a course until I took this class. I know at least 6 others who failed, and not for lack of trying either. Early in the term I expressed concern for my grade, and he just told me to drop the class, pick another major. He grades tests and essays on an unbelievably hard scale.  I no longer even want to major in psychology.",0
AVOID @ ALL COST for sensation&perception he teaches from middles school book & teaches @400 level tests all writing/long answer no matter how much detail you put he wants more. treats students who don't understand like idiots/talks down no attendance taken but gives popquizes Extrapolates from book @ rate that's not followable NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!,0
"She is very nice, clearly cares about her students. If you go to office hours have specific questions ready. Tests and projects were good, effort is required but they are fair. The subject was challenging for some people. I hope to take her again, she creates a really good learning environment!",1
I have no idea what is going on in this class he does not even use D2L ! Do not take this class he is very rude and not accessible outside of class. He doesnt use his email but instead uses Skype.,0
"class was absolutely useless, so was the homework. Read the book in each and every detail, because it will be asked on the exam. HORRIBLE teacher, do not take Stats with him.",0
"Pretty nice guy. He stops at every slide during lecture and can talk for hours about whatevers on it, so sometimes he rambles on and ends up telling you irrelevant info. His pronunciation of Greek words bother me. Hes a bit of a tough grader but hell mostly heckle you for grammar. Dont worry if you miss a class bc his notes are always online.",1
Show up and pass.,1
horribly boring professor. not helpful.,0
the best of the chem profs,1
"Professor Liggin is an amazing professor. The lectures are exciting. attendance is not mandatory but if you skip class, you won't pass. Professor has a bold sense of humor that will keep the class engage if you have questions ask he will answer!!!! Take him, best professor",1
"He is outrageously unapproachable and he always talks down to people. I almost cried one day after office hours. Homeworks take forever and he's a harsh grader, but all the tests ended up being take home which wasn't too bad. I don't think he likes his job very much",0
"I really dont think its fair to hide a students progress and grades from them the entire semester. He put no grades in blackboard making it impossible to see our progress, and it was pretty much a surprise at the end of the semester but of course its too late to change it. Think thats unfair and should not be allowed.",0
I really liked her. The class itself is really not that hard. She reminds you of the fact that you have assignments coming up. I would work ahead though. It helps at the end of the semester if you already have things done. Overall if you need help she is there and she does give really good feedback.,1
Had a very negative experience with this professor. The class goes for the full 2.5 hours and is unbearably slow. Bases her teaching off slide shows and is VERY lecture heavy. The premise of the class is to build up skills and give a mock-lesson for the class. The professor basically verbally bashed us in-front of the whole class. Not proffessional,0
"Hes a great guy and really cares about each and every student. Sends 1000 emails a day, this class is his whole life.  BUT its impossible.  Averages were always 60s and the material is just so difficult, and he increasingly makes the tests harder than previous yrs. Help sessions with prev students is the only way i got a B.  Have to study SOO much",1
"Terrible. This prof wasn't engaged at all, just assigned work with not real follow up. Wouldn't take any of his classes again.",0
"I took his class over the summer so I knew it would be rushed and we wouldnt finish everything, but he was just awful. We were a week behind by the 3rd week. His handwriting sucks, his alphas looked like 2s, almost every example he made a mistake, he couldn't decide an answer to my Q about the final until the morning of, no idea what to expect.",0
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD. And that says a lot because Ive had a lot of other bad profs. Ur better off taking a chem or bio class for ur science credit. Not understanding at all, save yourself the stress and dont take her",0
"The lectures are so worth while, Professor Love is straight forward and always very clear. Some of the readings weren't my cup of tea, but that's what happens with ideology.  I wish we would have spent more time on the ""other"" ideologies. Only bad thing: her TA is inept at teaching. The Friday sections- useless. I wish we had another lecture instea",1
"Natalie is a very passionate teacher and really loves her field of study. Come prepared to learn and do your work, though it isn't too hard and she gives you a clear syllabus so you know what's coming. Talk lots during discussion; she likes to hear student reactions to what you read.",1
"She's just like any other tough bio teacher. But she's nice and will grade you fairly.  But her exams are not easy.  I hate ssaying so, but there are no easy bio classes here.  You have to study her material everyday, otherwise you'll fall behind.  so far i'm half way through the semester and i have a D.. but shes still a pretty good teacher.",1
"Good: free points for attendance, labs, hw. Notes are short and sweet. Bad:  since I can only type 350 characters I'll just mention the main topics. Thick accent, purposely makes tests tricky, grades harshly. No partial credit on a test problem when I left out a number, just ""-10""! In my opinion, a little arrogant and likes to make you feel dumb.",0
"This class was difficult but like all foreign language classes it takes time and effort to earn the grade you wish to get. Attendance is mandatory and it's also necessary that you do online homework daily. Overall, he was a fair grader and expects a lot out of you as a student.",0
Professor Bulson was a really good teacher. We hardly used the book. The quizzes and tests were easy. Homework was assigned in class and not posted on blackboard so it was important to go to class. If you skipped a class he was good about letting you make up work. Very easy to get an A.,1
"I took this course in summer and everything went very fast so you should practice a lot, time flies in her class. She's a picky grader, very helpful and funny. Quizzes every day, 5 labs, 4 tests, 1 final and 1 short presentation. I really learned! Book is not required just for extra credit exercises if you want to, but lab manual is necessary.",1
"Dr. B is a great professor, very inspiring. His grading may be confusing but it's very hard to fail his class, she give extra credit for EVERY EXAM .",1
"Not thorough. I am a very rigorous studier and, after giving it my all, I still felt I didn't understand. He doesn't seem to understand his own class! Unfortunate that he is the only one teaching ochem2 @ OCCC. My advice - take it somewhere else.",0
"This lady is supper sweet, but she clearly has nothing else to do than make you so homework. She seems to forget that this is a 100 level course and that we take other classes. She assigns too many readings, projects and essays. Do take her unless you like that.",0
"Math sucks. Let's be honest. But Professor Ryburn makes math suck a lot less. She is extremely helpful, nice, and willing to help. You have to finesse ALEKS in order to get good grades on the tests, but her lectures are clear and concise. She does everything she can in order to get you a good grade in her class. 10/10 would recommend.",1
Dr. Lin is one of the sweetest professors I have ever had. I always felt comfortable in her class and enjoyed coming. It can be a tough subject but Dr. Lin always makes sure everyone is on the same page. I can't say enough good things about her. I wish I could take all my classes with her.,1
"I feel like Dr. Hahn gets a bad rep from students who aren't willing to try as hard as they can. If you work hard for a good grade, he respects you for it and is open-minded. He often praised my efforts one-on-one and said he'd miss having me as a student. If you are willing to strive for an A in his class, remember this review, not the others.",1
"Professor Boris seems like he is passionate and knowledgable about Philosophy, but I did find it hard to grasp what he was trying to come across most of the time. I also couldn't focus too much because I was constantly writing notes and trying to transcribe all the ideas he would constantly throw around.",0
"She never explains her project expectations, frequently uses profanity in class, and is heavy on favouritism. She grades difficult to make her classes seem more intense than they actually are. Surprised if she runs her 2 hour lecture for longer than 45 minutes. An easy way to get a good grade is to just go along with her jokes.",0
"Dr. Palfai is a hilarious, adorable old man. Attend lecture because class is pretty notes heavy, but he still does takes information from the book to put on the exam. Also, EXTRA CREDIT, DO IT! He offers 48 extra credit points. That never happens so take advantage of it. I got B's and B- on most tests and got an A because of it.",1
Considerate,1
"She is awesome! The class is tough but she made it so easy to see her outside of class and was very helpful when doing that. She explained things well in general, easy to learning from. She kept on topic and always made sense. Love her!",1
I found the teacher tough but fair. Good feedback on papers and he will read drafts and comment so you can get a better grade. Incredible lectures. How is it that Dr. Solari is not a regular member of the faculty of N.C. State?,1
"For US Politics, Lois is really easy. All you have to do each week is fill out a ""Study Guide"" and that is mainly graded on how well you cite your sources (Use Chicago or APA). It may seem useless to do them each week, but the midterm and final are completely based on them- so study them and you'll do fine. If you want an easy A, take her",1
"Rick Knight is unlike any professor I have ever taken. He is caring, passionate and has a knack to be able to connect with his students. He is extremely enthusiastic and makes the class one you won't want to miss. Textbooks aren't required and the material can be easily taught through lecture. Take this class.",1
"For MTH 207, there's 3 quizzes a week, so don't plan on skipping. Also, he doesn't explain things very clearly and he'll work through the easy problems, but leave the hard problems for you to do. Dr. Eager does make you feel dumb if you ask questions at times and he's not always around when his office hours are suppose to be. Wouldn't recommend him",0
"This class was amazing!  I went into it not interested in greek history or mythology at all, but Dillery made me want to know more.  He taught my discussion section himself, which really helped.  He took a vasted interest in my grades and made sure I was on the right track.  Overall, he's a GREAT PROF!!",1
The only reason lecture is mandatory is because of participation points. Otherwise you could do it all from home. She posts all assignments online. There was only one in class assignment worth 50 points. Lecture is very scattered and hard to follow. She just gives a little outline of the reading assigned. She assigns weekly online quizzes,0
"Okay, despite my various low gradings on Jonas, he is not so bad.  He is vague, and can neglect the basics of art (which I believe are essential--such as basic techniques of shading, etc), BUT you just have to GO with him.  If you go with him, and work hard or THINK hard, you'll like the class.",0
She's awesome! Very approachable! She grades essays really easy. We played a lot of games! She makes everything fun and interesting!,1
"Terrible teacher, thinks he is going to change the world with his economic input.  Tries way too hard to be cool and talks down to people who do not know as much as him.  He makes the test questions confusing on purpose and admitted to that.  Don't take.",0
"Stephanie is passionate, but not a good professor. She is all over the place, constantly forgetting things, she doesnt really give homework and when she does its insanely out of our skill level. She also only gives a few quizzes and 2 exams- not scan tron. Also dont hold your breath for your grade. She has taken over 2 months to grade our midterms.",0
"Dr. Corcoran is by far my favorite professor I have taken at PSU. She is incredibly intelligent, caring, and absolutely hilarious. I have never been more inspired in my entire life to follow my passions, and she has motivated me to minor in Indigenous Nations Studies. I can't say enough about her-- take her classes, you won't regret it.",1
Dr. Shannon makes research enjoyable and non-threatening.,1
"Sweetha really cares about her students. There are quizzes every week, but they usually get easier as she gets more chill with the class. So sweet and funny",1
She's inexperienced and it shows. She doesn't know how to give a good writing assignment or run a class. Her grading process is absolutely nuts!!,0
"She is really hard to understand on her video lectures. Also, she often times works on the homework in her video lectures and gets the question answers wrong.  That's worrisome. She takes forever to upload her video lectures. Really nice person, but not the best professor. If you don't like doing HW and quizzes last minute do not take her. ",0
Absolutely no direction from her. Assignments are convoluted and not well explained. First bad professor I've had. Truly disappointed.,0
"Professor Nikkel is very knowledgable and intelligent. He explains and covers his materials thoroughly. He is not like some professors who teach one thing, and when you get to their tests/exams you wonder where did he/she get the info from. What he teaches in class is what you get on the exams.",1
If you pay attention and do homework you will pass.,1
Toughest grader I ever had at JMSB.,0
"Please do yourself a favor and stay away from her. She will ruin your grade for one research paper even if you had a good grade, she will drop your grade based on how she wants to grade the paper even if you follow her directions ""explicitly"", she will still mark you down. Do not recommend her to anyone.",0
Professor Madsen is the best! He wants all of his students to succeed. Go to office hours!!,1
He is the best professor I have had in a while. He really cares if you pass and gives you plenty of opportunities to do so. I hope to take him again next semester he gives extra credit and has old test in library to study from I Would not of been able to get through A&P 1 if it wasnt for him. Take him you will enjoy his class.,1
"Worst professor I have ever had. He is lazy and only cares about telling stories about his childhood. He has nothing important to share and shouldn't have a job teaching. He doesn't care about his students, and he complains about others not doing their job. I regret taking his class more than anything I have ever done.",0
"I thought this was a great class.  Really made me think and work harder than I have in most classes.  Prof. De Young is tuff, but she is fair and very helpful.  Treats you like an adult, not a kid.",1
Notes are unclear as well as her lectures are pointless. Avoid.,0
"Danae is an amazing teacher, and has so much passion in her teaching. She is one of my favorite teachers. I took her class Tuesday nights and expected it to be and learned so much! She is an amazing teacher, and made the class very interesting. I loved everything about the class. And homework was enjoyable. I really recommend this class with her!",1
Great professor. Loved her class. very clear and concise. explains things in great depth and easy assignments.,1
"Dr. Katz is like the Emeril of HUM... exciting, volatile, VERY knowledgable, with a funky sense of humor. His class is hard, but worth it from how smart you feel afterwards.",1
"He's a good teacher, but kind of boring, as is expected from Chem instructors. If you take his class, do not buy the book - not even for just in case. He provides slide notes in paper, and the online assignments help you practice. Google search works too. I've never studied from the book. I had a 90 by Final time, still waiting on the grade report.",1
"The BEST math instructor I ever had in college. If you pay attention and do your work, you will pass. She is mellow and all about teaching us, Making sure we understand the problem. Recommended.",1
I think he is a great prof! He is super nice and gives us a broad range of info on the topic we're learning about. He is good about letting us voice our opinions on topics as well!,1
"Fair professor. Make sure you actually practice Arena in your own time though or you're screwed. Keep up with the work he assigns, or you will be lost. Nice guy though. Takes attendance.",1
"He loves to talk about american politics, how great Trump is, and american involvement in other regions rather than the actual curriculum. He also loves to talk about the booming oil industry(its not, its actually beginning to decline)... he isnt very clear about whats on tests and quizzes but hands out a quiz ever class period.",0
Worst professor at Uconn. I am regularly an A and high B student but she gave an absurd amount of papers to write and even as a good writer I struggled to get good grades. She acts as though this is the only class on your schedule. Emailing her complaints about the situation and she doesnt care. You have to agree to her beliefs & opinions to pass.,0
Amazing professor. Well organized lectures. Makes accounting easy to understand.,1
"Smart but tough. I'm not a bad/lazy student but I do struggle in this class. Midterm & final assignment are worth a huge chunk of your grade. If you don't do well on one or both, it is unlikely you will be able to pass. He can seem arrogant but will sometimes clarify. Very tough. Take notes/pay attn. Not super awful but I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Story and Structure. I didn't like her much for this class. I felt like I didn't really learn anything. She was very unhelpful when I was having issues with a paper and told me it wasn't going to matter much, but then I got a D on the paper and it really brought down my grade.",0
One of my favorite teachers. By no means is the class easy if you decide to miss class or not pay attention. He is very helpful and if your interested in the material and listen you will do great! very funny too!!,1
"Ward's class is straightforward and interesting. ""THEO and ECON"" is the best theology course that you could take at Marquette because it's so interesting and applicable to your life/other studies. If you read bare minimum and participate, it's not hard. She gives out potential questions for tests, has extra credit, and easy points. Take this class.",1
"Dont know why this lady is teaching. Grades very harshly. Ruins your grade even when nothing was wrong with your assignments (paper worth a B  a D- to her). Nitpicks at tiny tiny things to make you fail. Extra credit only if you buy it on ATI and its only 1 point. Stay away. She is bitter, cold, & entitled. Rude & will not help you at all.",0
Don't waste your time if you actually want to learn.Very unclear and does not grade assignments for a long time and no feedback whatsoever.A shame he's the only social work teacher there because people are forced to take him.,0
"Mr. Clark is a good professor, if you show up to class everyday and do the homework you should pass. your final grade is based on only three test grades so it is imperative that you do not fall behind and study a lot for the test. He posts past homework problems on blackboard and slides from class. There is homework every night never takes long.",1
Class can be completed at your own pace. He doesn't except late work but the work is pretty easy.,1
"Erin is the worst professor at this school. She is inconsistent with her expectations and does not care about the students. She refuses to accommodate students who need to move a test because of a ""policy"" which, upon talking to the head of the math department, isn't a real policy. She does not want students to pass this class.",0
Dr. Wells' class had extremely inconsistent structure. Some days we were given handouts to work through and other days we stared at him running Maple code all class. Your entire grade depends on a portfolio at the end of the semester and to get an A you have to do your own project outside of class. The grading to me feels extremely subjective.,0
"TAKE 220 WITH HON. Yes, you have to read and write a fair amount of essays, but he's a fair grader and really helpful during office hours! The class is discussion based but the readings are pretty interesting!",1
Not as bad as prior comments make her seem. Its a hard class and i DO NOT recommend skipping lecture. If allowed to make not cards keep up on them and organize. Keep with it and she usually gives a little extra credit towards the end if in lecture. I got a B so if i can get a decent grade most people who at least try can too.,0
"Professor Selph is an excellent teacher. He can be a bit quiet at first, but he makes an effort to reach out and help students understand the material. His grading is very fair and gives students the best opportunity to succeed. He makes himself available outside of class, and is always helpful. I absolutely recommend him!",1
"I loved this professor. I had zero interest in anthropology prior to this class, and her passion and enthusiasm made all the difference. Now I wish I could major in anthropology because of her.",1
"Overall professor Mattox was a great guy, I knew almost nothing coming into the class and he was always available for extra help and loved answering questions. It is clear how much he enjoys teaching and it radiates to the students, highly recommended.",1
"The class consists of you hearing her lecture 99% of the time. No in class assignments. She uses powerpoints to teach but they have no words which makes it hard to get notes. Shes very loud and talks like a 16 year old. Theres 10 quizzes with readings, 2 tests plus final and 2 essays. Wouldnt take her again, her way of teaching isnt for me.",0
Only 5 days of class mandatory to attend. Very simple assignments worth 40% such as a 2-3 min Research Project Report on a controversial topic and a Cultural Plunge to get you to feel different cultures. The other 50% of the class is making sure you have good remarks on your Teacher Evaluations. Much less work than ED-201,1
"She's the worst prof I've had. Sweet but cannot teach. My friend and I compared assignments and we'd have the same answers but one of us would be wrong and the other right. Expectations were unclear, lectures boring, extremely unorganized and if you ask for clarification, she just repeats herself. You have to teach yourself. I don't recommend her.",0
The only upside is her final is a group project. This professor barely knows what shes doing.,0
Easy class. Very slow pace and he postpones deadlines several weeks. Tests are simple and straight from lectures. Labs don't take very long if you take notes in class because he gives you literally everything you need. I don't understand all of the negative reviews here- probably people who aren't suited for compsci.,1
"Cassells is tough, a hard grader, assigns a lot of readings, has a strong accent, snaps if you asks questions, & singles out students.  The class was FULL, then 2 weeks later, there were about 15 students left.  Everyone in class hated her & felt that she was of pure evil.  If you take her class you will end up leaving a comment like this.  BEWARE.",0
"My whole life i thought i couldnt math. I took steinfort for 98+107 and absolutely loved it. I built history with him and look forward to his class. I sit front row and always ask question. With math, you have to put the time in to get good results. I see it inspires him when i understand new material. He wants his students to succeed. PRACTICE",1
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"Professor Lipson is obviously a very knowledgeable person, but his soothing voice and his tangential lecture style makes it hard for me to stay engaged in the class. Ive learnt a lot from this professor from the first half of the semester, but as the semester progressed I felt he was pushing many claims without a strong base of evidence.",0
Great.,1
"This man is awesome. He makes the class easy. The homeworks can be challenging but you can ask for help always and whenever in his office hours. The first three projects can be tricky but again he helps in his office. If you want an easy A & a stress less class, take him.",1
I feel sorry for anyone taking him in the winter semester because the fall semester is literaly half fantasy football league.  You won't learn anything and they clearly just need someone to teach this for a theme.  You can't get a bad grade but for some reason he wont let everyone get A's. A way for GV to take money from you and waste some time.,0
"His class is a lot of discussion and some nonsense. He is extremely easy. U can rewrite your paper, but it will never be as good as an A. If u don't pass his class u need extra help.",0
"A very good professor. Anyone who can't hack-it in her class is a joke. Easy class if do your part. Just show up on time, be respectful, and do your work. Compared to the demanding math and science faculty, though not her field, here at ccp, she is one of the easiest professors.",1
"He can't teach properly. Unnecessarily obfuscates the material.  Doesn't answer questions properly, not helpful in office hour.  His teaching style and method is hugely flawed.",0
Too worreid about HER looks instead of your knowledge.   Just read book & get notes from her powerpoint.  DO NOT choose her for clinical.  May be bipolar!,0
"Hope you can teach yourself Excel and Access. No lectures, no notes, no discussions, grading: lots of issues with items on quizzes and the case studies (heavy points!) that were not covered in the textbook. I had to email the instructor weekly or more (not something I would do in any other class ever).",0
"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Amazing feedback, hysterical lecturer, clear instruction and expectations. Three meaty papers and you walk out with a solid portfolio. 10/10",1
Her main aim is not only to make you understand math through practice but also to pass. She knows we all make mistakes. She helps correct them.,1
This class is an easy A if you do the reading from the textbook. His weekly quizzes + assignments are directly based on the reading! I highly recommend to review the quiz answers before taking the exams. Extra credit opportunity at end. Overall very clear and straightforward class and nice guy!,1
"Professor Epstein goes above and beyond in his commitment to academic research, his students, and to the courses he teaches. His notes are such a valuable resource in studying for his classes, but the accompanying lectures and the conversations that they provoke are why one should really try to take at least one course with this professor.",1
"Seems like a nice person but he takes an archaic approach to everything. Teaches in such an outdated way that he is basically doing more harm than good. His lectures could be boiled down to 1/5 the time, his resume expectations are straight outta 1985, he doesn't understand current majors and will expect you to present on bizarre topics. Avoid him.",0
"Not a good prof.  Materials she teaches in class have nothing to do with Management Info Systems.  You will learn nothing in her class.  She will give you directions on how she wants assignments done, then she will still punish you anyway regardless.  Very unnecessarily cruel and evil prof.  Shame.",0
"Lecture did not cover half of what we were studying. Quizzes every week. Does not give clear explanations of anything that he expects you to do. Very ""out there"" Good luck if you take the class!!",0
"You would expect a professor who teaches an online class to respond to her emails... Well at least that's what I expected. The course is designed poorly, but the exams aren't too hard. The labs didn't really make sense and were unorganized. Blackboard is copied and pasted from past years and there are a lot of spelling mistakes. Do not TAKE!!!!!!!!",0
"I am now in a PhD program in human development and teaching classes in my area. Dr. Sarver's classes have been so helpful- I remember a lot of the information in his classes because (1)his lectures were entertaining and I enjoyed going to class, making the material easier to remember, (2) I had to study my ass of for his essay tests, and it stuck!",1
"Great Professor.  The material isn't earthshattering or really hard to understand, but expect to work hard.  The things you learn in this class will be of use to you throughout your life, whether you go into business or not.",1
She's a great teacher. Will really try to help you understand it. The issue is the course weeks. It should be longer seeing how its a lot harder than Math 3. . The only downside with her was the way she gave quizzes. Quizzes were handed out at exactly the starting time of class. Do not be late or you will get a zero.,1
"She... sucks. She's not a good proffessor at all. She will spend 70% of class time rambling incoherently about her life in Spain. Very liberal. She's immature and disrespectful if you dare to counter her liberal views. Tests are hard. Spends last minutes of class doing what we're supposed to, and keeps us there assigning last minute past class time",1
"Professor Hersh was a nice lady however she gave way too much work. I don't think she considered the fact that students have other classes to worry about. We had to write a 4-5 page reflection paper every week. Yes, every week. There was a lot of reading and writing. If you take this class, you need to be able to handle the work load.",0
"Learn from the book. Didn't buy the finance calculator. He doesn't know how to do the problems without it, so if you can't teach yourself. well good luck. Review is not helpful. He cannot give formulas or extra help unless it is directly from the slides given to him. Why pay for a class when the teacher can't teach?",0
"He was very nice but a very difficult class. I took this class first semester of freshman year not really knowing what to expect/not knowing much about economics. I struggled a lot and did not understand the material at all, and his lectures didn't really help me personally. He calls on you randomly too, be aware of that.",0
Dr. Duncan is not a competent professor at all. She is usually unprepared for class and is easily distracted.She is a poor professor who lacks intelligence and thought.,0
VERY VERY work heavy. I would recommend the class to start a group chat because the class gets confusing. VERY LECTURE heavy. He can talk the whole hour and a half. He grades the paper essays easy but just be prepared for lots of work. Hes a very cool guy and cares for his students. Just participate and talk or else he will get angry,1
"She means well, but fails at every other aspect. She assumes the class understands what's going on bc she really doesn't. She constantly is second guessing herself which doesn't help the class progress,& she rarely covers a topic before the required lab because she spends too much time taking attendance or doing something wrong. Take w another prof",0
"He doesn't curve, very hard class... Take his class with caution",0
"Hedda Fish is by far my worst professor (out of my 6 current professors). She has little to no knowledge of technology, but you can't blame it all on her due to her prehistoric age. After making obvious errors that the entire class notices, she attempts to blame it on the students by coming up with whimsical excuses, never accepting any blame.",0
It's your typical useless credit course. He is  guy who quizzes on reading retention (useless) and his paper is unnecessarily difficult - minimum 6 pages and we can't use the Internet (WHO DOES THAT). He is a little pretentious and thinks he is above all else when his class is just a course people take as a required course. Lectures are good tho,0
"Professor Saudino is, by far, the worst professor I've ever had. Seek an alternative class. Her style is awful, her tests are ridiculous with material being taken from oddly specific examples, and her lectures are so very boring. I'm so glad this semester is almost over and I hope I at the very least get a C-. If you do end up in ps241, don't skip.",0
"Dr. Keralis has a very laid back personality, & seems easy going. His weekly quizzes however are a joke, never stating the quiz questions could have more than one answer until a student pointed it out in class (halfway thru the semester), which he shrugged off. If you don't read & beat the material into your skull, you won't pass. DO NO TAKE!",0
"professor Andrews , he is a good professor I like him and he is very easy .I like his class and I encourage other students to take classes with him.",1
"Took this online class with Gosling and Pennebaker. Loved it. No final or midterms. Eight question benchmarks at the beginning of class, open note.  Benchmarks are normally easy as long as you take the class seriously. Would suggest rewatching lectures and skim the readings before benchmark time.",1
"After grading essays, he doesn't point out the mistakes you made. He expects you to use your rubric and compare it to your essay to find your OWN mistakes. Letting him review your essay before the due date does not always help. barely learn the correct way to write at college level. you are basically teaching yourself. A VERY TOUGH GRADER!!!!",0
"Prof. Hickey is the one of the smartest and nicest professors here at Assumption. His tests and quizzes are extremely hard, and I took two of his classes my freshman year, but it was worth it, because I learned a ton. He has a grading curve which is very helpful, and don't be afraid to go to his office hours, because he might bump up your grade!",1
One of the nicest teachers i've ever had.  Let me make up all the work I missed at the end of the quarter and didn't take off any late points.  Just do the homeworks and its an easy A,1
Professor Cardelus is very intimidating and self-righteous. She often belittles her students and likes to threaten their sense of well-being. Very confrontational and very dry personality. Her interests are the only ones that matter and she will make your life miserable if you don't feign the same level of interest. ,0
"The instructor is passionate regarding the subject,but a little overboard in expectations for a basic class. His attitude that knowing what may be on an exam might cause one to focus on those points, rather than focus on the entire presentation suggests that the exams are based upon what he considers important,rather than on what one has learned.",0
"Dr. Lima is a cool, funny guy. The class is enjoyable even though there's a good amount of material. Every test has 10 bonus points worked into it- really buffers your grade. Study the power points, DON'T buy the book.",1
"TH 115 with him is probably not your best option if you are not a *decent* dancer.  He is fun, knows what he's doing and will answer questions if you have them, but this is more a class for those with at lease some experience, not ""little or none"" as the catalog states.  With a class of 25, it's hard for him to see and correct your mistakes.",1
Worst prof ever.,0
"awesome teacher, super-cute and her classes/readings are usually pretty interesting. Definitely take one class with her before you graduate!!",1
He is a Great Professor! I learned more from him than anyone else in the department. He also inspired me to be a teacher of Communication.,1
"Agreed with the person below. Moe is rough. He definitely weeds out, he even announces that to those that make it far enough. Keep on top of reading (except he hates the book) and tape lectures. He changed his lecture style halfway through because of the drop rate. He loves quizzing on the little stories he tells. Stay in his eye: office hours!!",1
"Mark truly has a passion for what he teaches. His lectures are engaging and fun. I am not huge into religion, but I would definitely take another religion course if it was with him.",1
"I learn nothing in his class, spent countless hours outside class studying for his obscure exam formats. He creates hypothetical ""bizarro world"" situations and you have to decide whether or not something about it would be plausible, or if based on REAL Biology it would be impossible. Literally makes no sense and does not test content he teaches.",0
"Intro to programming and problem solving. Midterm: 30% and final: 35%. Probably the toughest class to take. Assignments 20% but there's no help. There's no tutorial or anything, and book doesn't help. He expects you to figure out java coding by yourself. Lets just say if you have no idea about programming then you will fail.",0
"She's great.  She tries to make things interesting and fun.  It was a bit of work at times, but it was worth it.  Can wait to take another one of her classes!",1
"Took an online summer class with Professor Hegbloom this year. I never reached out to her, so not sure how accessible she is. A lot of reading and a lot of papers, BUT she gives very clear instructions on what she wants. Read the material, follow her instructions and you'll do well! Just FYI she is a later in the semester grader.",1
She goes out of her way to degrade those who don't perform up to her standards and acts like people want to do bad on assignments. The assignment/exams are not like what we did in class even when she claims they are. Hands down worst professor I have ever had.,0
"I'd heard such great things about Dr. Anitori and was sorely disappointed by his teaching. He puts the most random information on his weekly exams, which are only 20 questions. You are not allowed to study from previous tests for your cumulative final, you can't question him or else he humiliates you, and there is a lack of organization in lab time",0
"What an amazing class, three tests are your grading criteria and the review sheet is the exact test. Spoon feeding the information on tests, Yes attendance is mandatory but, you almost never stay the full time and sometimes get let out almost 40 min early. He is a great guy and understanding of any special circumstances. Definitely take him!!!!!!!!",1
he was okay i wouldn't recommend him if you speak absolutely no Spanish. hes boring too,0
"Dr. Jorgensen is a great Professor.  He helps facilitate students to think for themselves, not just do research.  He strives to keep students interested by leaving assignments open ended so students can choose something they are actually interested in.  I definitely recommend taking this course or any course with Jorgs.",1
This class was kind of difficult. Your grade is determined pretty much off the midterm and final and a few other homework's. You have one small presentation by yourself that is about 1-2 minutes so not terrible. Does random in class participation so showing up would be beneficial. He is very strict on rules. Idk not my fav,0
"Dr. H was a fantastic professor. No lecture was a bore, from intersting stories she tells to the few films we watched. She does assign a chapter of textbook reading weekly as well as two books and 3 projects during the semester. Just stay on top of things and pay attention in class-- it'll be an easy A.",1
"The enthusiasm displayed in every single class. It was one of the few classes that held my attention throughout the class period. The ratio between the real life examples and going through material related to readingexams was great! Didn't read from the bookppt, and didn't get off topic either.  3 exams,  56 quizzes and one paper. ",1
Do not take this professor unless you want to teach yourself everything. He yells during a four hour lecture and is honestly not very nice,0
"Max makes some good jokes in class but he is hard to approach for help. He'll make you feel really dumb when you're asking for help. He doesn't use a textbook or post any practice questions. There is no clear guideline for tests, the average for the midterm was 23% curved to 46%. He calls on you in class and gets mad when no one answers him.",0
Gives you quizzes on things you didn't learn and grades them really hard. She's terrible please don't take her this is the biggest waste of a class i've ever taken. The class is 3 hours long and she barely gives you a 5 minute break and gets off topic onto the worst tangents then blames students for not knowing material. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!,0
"She does not care about students. This old hag only cares about picking up her  salary. She is very offensive if ask for question. She deserves a big ""F"".",0
"I loved Professor Rice. While he does have a dry sense of humor, he teaches at a very basic level so everybody can understand. Do the work that is required and just show up to class and you will have no problems passing this course. The only way you will fail his class is if you don't put in your required effort.",1
"Easily one of the most boring classes here. He was a really nice guy and did his best to make his lectures bearable, but being that they were 3 hours, it was tough. He gave out study guides before each test but they did not help much. Class was always more than half empty. One group project that is super easy and just a way to get more points.",0
Shes not helpful when you go into her office or ask for help during work time during class. The beginning of the semester seemed like a lot of busy work which didn't help at all. I don't recommend taking her because she's not helpful and her lecture days are just her rambling on about useless information. Only good thing is she split up the project,0
"I loved this class, Boni is a great teacher. I don't know what other students are talking about, I found her to be very unbiased; she doesn't bash anyone's religion. She made the class very interesting; if you read the book, it's a very easy class.",1
"Span. 101 5 wk course in the summer. The professor seems like a nice person where she will answer emails, but I would advise NOT to take her (or maybe any other..) language class during the summer semester, its intense and her workload is insane. Remember, you have to memorize a language in a matter of 5 weeks. Do not recommend.",0
Dr. D is such a caring and funny person. She teaches in a way that you remember the material and is wonderful about helping if you dont understand. Such a smart lady but so down to earth.,1
"She would try to engage the class, but I don't think teaching is her strong point. The online Cengage program is ridiculous, the textbook reads like it's catered towards high schoolers, but the material in the exams online is nothing like what we learned. I barely passed them, despite having a strong interest and background in abnormal psychology.",0
Traci is difficult to follow and her expectations are inconsistent among students even within the same class. For her part in 1130 the test was wildly inconsistent with the teaching provided.,0
"Professor Peters is one of the nicest professors you will have in college, I cant say enough great things about her. She made the material very interesting and did her absolute best to engage the class. She is also extremely understanding and kind. I dont really understand why the rest of the reviews are negative, she is an amazing person!",1
"This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not know how to teach. He will lecture the whole class on random information and then give you a pop quiz that doesn't even have to do with anything you learned. He doesn't post any grades. When checking in with him to see what my grade was he said ""I don't know calculate it yourself.",0
This professor seems not to care. He is not organized. He is a lazy or slow grader. I don't know why he gave out essay exams when He didn't have time for to grade them. We are almost finishing the class and we don't know what has happened to our paper grades. He is not responsible at all. Lots of students are waiting patiently for their grades.,0
"She is one of the best instructor, very helpful.",1
"I really think the world of John Butt and of HUM200!! The way he facilitates the class creates this beautiful community that is essentially a book club. Read the books! Get the most out of your education. If you bring your paper ideas to office hours, he loves to talk through them. By far, my favorite class I've ever taken at JMU, cannot say enough",1
Did not like her as a teacher,0
"I got A's on every assignment and test but ended with a grade that did not represent that because I missed four classes out of the entire semester. Goodwin just likes to hear himself talk and his classes lectures get off topic every class. The material is extremely easy, but he is so unclear about assignments, I dreaded this class.",0
"Despite being in the midst of a pandemic, the class examinations turned into a set of quizzes which in turn is not a great way to administer exams. Furthermore, he doesn't curve.",0
"INF 100 is an awful class, however, Prof Klatzke attempts to makeup for this, and with it being a 1 credit hour class I cannot fully analyze her as a professor, but I did enjoy talking to her. She is definitely a professor I would take again. She gives really good feedback on assignments and really cares about you.",1
"finished this class today and wow, I really don't care what I get. The class was made sooo difficult. just glad Im done. ",0
"Professor Fox simply wants you to regurgitate his exact thoughts in papers and exams, and even if you do this he will take points off arbitrarily. He will completely stop reading your paper if he disagrees with something, even if you disprove it two sentences later. Doing everything in your power to do well will be fruitless unless you ARE him.",0
Good class.,1
DO NOT TAKE GENETICS AT UIC. It is way harder than it needs to be and they make sure you don't succeed.,0
I had a very bad experience with this class. He is very bad at lecturing. The lectures were useless because he just read the textbook word for word and barely did any practice questions that would actually help us on the quizzes. He also yelled at students everyday and was very rude to everyone. He was rude in emails and in class. Terrible prof,0
Dr. Nelson is the best professor in the college of business. All of his upper level courses consist of student presentations for the whole semester. These are not hard but very informative and Dr. Nelson is interacting the whole time with great insights. He is one of the smartest most experienced people you will ever meet.,1
"Great teacher! She is enthusiastic, fun, and really well educated on her subject. Pay attention to her and go to class and this class is pretty easy. Keep up with the reading also, there is a lot of it but reading it really helps on her tests. She's open to questions and ready to help students understand.",1
"Dr. Feige was so much fun. Just be prepared to work hard, his class is not easy. He was amazing as we had to switch over to online because of COVID. He's super patient and he's so much fun to be around.",1
"Ouyang is nice, but a really difficult professor.  He reads straight off the slides, offers no real explanations, and the project work is insanely difficult.  If you take this course, pair yourself up with someone strong in accounting, especially if your new to the topic.",0
"He made all lectures interesting, class enjoyed participating and working together.",1
She's very understanding and easy to talk to. Loved her class. Taught me a lot about writing.,1
"Dr Cohen is a great teacher and cares about her students. That being said, you really do have to work for your grade in her class. Her tests are not multiple choice and she really expects you to know and understand the information. Her tests consisted of material from class lectures and scientific papers covered in class. Be prepared to study.",1
Avoid having him as a teacher for LAS.  He is too constructive.  He makes LAS too political and doesn't give enough time for assignments to be completed.  He also is too nationalistic and looks down on students who don't agree with him.,0
"he was amazing and lightened the mood, kind of a fun class when you did preforming arts and debate",1
"Uses class time to chat and if you ask for help inside or outside class, you will not receive it. The class is a joke though.",0
"Great professor, very nice and interesting. I enjoy her lectures, they are very informative and useful. One of the best course in the College of Arts and Sciences. A great class to take. She is very elegant and stylish.",1
LOVED his class! His lectures don't always make sense but they are interesting.  Tests are take home and you just write a paper on one of the books you read.  Easiest class I've had so far.,1
"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",0
"I don't understand how she is better at Anatomy than Physio. She talks too fast while going over detailed slides and diagrams. It was just overwhelming. She's pretty picky on the short answers on her exams. She doesn't let you know what DIAGRAMS will actually be on the exam. To be on the safe side, you need to study everything on her study guide.",0
This class requited a lot of background knowledge of the world. If you are taking it just to fulfill a Gen Ed and you are not interested I suggest looking elsewhere. It was a lot of work and very hard to do because I had little interest in the topics. Lectures were really long and it was hard to take notes because he did not have presentations. ,0
Docked me points for knowing profit ratio's not mentioned in textbook in the Discussions (its bad to know more). Online Group work was miserable and worth literally 50% of grade. The project instructions are not clear and got docked. She changed the grading rubric unethically after submissions! And yes she is very disrespectful like everyone says.,0
"I took this class during winter session. So it was a 6 week accelerated course, with a lot of information to take in, in a very short period of time. She did an excellent job of covering the material so everybody could understand it, and was willing to help students personally if they were confused on anything.",1
"Her class consists of 1-2 quizzes a week they' re kinda difficult. Her lecture videos for the quizzes are from off YouTube, there is usually 3-4 of them that are 15 min long. Study question assignments: 3-4 reading assignments with questions to answer. Always one discussion due every week and to do that you usually have to watch a video or movie.",0
"He created the great environment for students to study from each other. I think it is the correct way to study: learn from each student, instead of professors. Definitely, the professor plays a role of instructing. We posted academic post to discussion board and exchange different ideas. The professor gave us very valuable suggestions and insight.",1
"Unbelievably easy class. Good if you just need a class to pass easily; however, you will not leave the class with a clear understanding on the important subject of Sociology. Sweet lady.",1
Writes in-depth comments on written work.,1
"The homeworks were a joke and attendance wasn't mandatory, but if you did attend class you'd get extra credit points. The exams were impossible and not even based off of in class lectures. 95% of the exam content came from video classes, so if you didn't watch them you were probably gonna fail the exam",0
"This was a 1 credit course that was super interesting. Nic knows the city of Rome like the back of his hand - extremely knowledgeable and well respected. Take a class with him, and go talk to him in office hours. He's a pretty cool dude!",1
Absolutely loved her. Learned a lot in her class and felt at ease. Truly a gem of a person.,1
Way too many assessments. One week I think we had up to 5 pieces of work.,0
"I really enjoy professor lee,she is amazing at breaking down the math problems to makes for easy learning with constant practice.",1
"This class was extremely confusing as there were 4 different professors for the one course (literature, art, music, history.) I like the professors as individuals don't get me wrong.. but I would NEVER take this class ever again. The lectures are extremely heavy and on boring subject matters. Quizzes every week. Felt like a condensed course.",0
She is by far the rudest professor you will ever meet. She doesn't even teach in this course. You are basically on your own. Whenever you want to go talk to her in her office hours she has this rude vibe to why you are in her office. She belittles her students. I wouldn't recommend this professor to ANYONE!,0
Professor Sommers is awesome. His lectures are engaging and interesting; he cares about his students and will go above and beyond to help them with matters both related to the course and outside of the classroom. He has a great sense of humor and does a good job of presenting/teaching the material. The best professor I had this semester!,1
"His lectures are boring. For our semester, he threw the BitTorrent project on us without warning, while saying he was going to change the project at the beginning of the semester. Project and lectures are not connected in any way so there's no point in going to class. He and the TAs don't really answer questions in a timely manner. Exams are okay.",0
"Definitely an easy class. Kind of annoying and tedious at time, but interesting nonetheless. Weekly two page papers are almost always opinion based and super easy, and the tests aren't terrible as long as you do the study guide.",1
"You must go to class. She does not put the information on PowerPoints, she only gives verbal lectures so you have to pay attention and take notes fast. No textbook, only some online readings that you have to write responses to but it's easy. She gives a study guide before each exam, overall definitely recommend.",1
"""Russians in the Gulag had a better chance of making it out than someone coming out her class with an A."" She has ridiculous standards. Requires students to read 10+ books, at least one book a week. Several papers. FAR more requirements than any other section of the exact same class. I am considering myself LUCKY to make it out with a C-.",0
Majd is an outstanding Prof. He keeps things light and is very fun to learn from. Majd understands the material that he presents and effectively relays it to his students. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Majd this semester ... and he's completely adorable.,1
"So this professor isn't great by any means. Yes, he is kind but only in person. I take online classes because I work a lot and I had to go see him if I had a question because he is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at responding to email. I never received an email. He also didn't start grading until the quarter was practically over. He contradicts himself.",0
Honestly I wouldn't take her again if I had the chance. She was alright but she was rude when I asked her questions about the material one-on-one. HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS: having a terrible grade the entire semester but then getting a final grade of a B or B+???????,0
"She is a really nice person who is very passionate about her subject. She does lecture a lot, but she will slow down if asked. Even after taking a lot of  American history classes, I still learned a lot of new and interesting things in the class. You also watch a documentary in class to write a paper on. Discussion & attendance taken on Friday",1
"By far the best teacher at KU. She's smart, funny, and knows her stuff. She simplifies the material and breaks it down into layman's terms but then follows up with the appropriate vocabulary just so all the students fully understand what is going on. ",1
"Very good teacher. He goes through everything in class and is always willing to help. He may come off as picky and mean at first, but he is an extremely funny and smart teacher.",1
"Dr. Rhoads is the nicest guy so I feel bad, but he is the hardest grader on the planet and his exams have material on them that you didn't even learn! He is accessible outside of class and willing to help but it doesn't matter. You can study as hard as you'd like, get tutors, and practice and will still fail the exams unless you're a chem genius.",0
"Dr. Graham is one of the best teachers I've had. He explains things in a clear fashion, often explaining in a "" how I would do it"" fashion. Never shoots down students ideas or questions, but explores them. Lots of pop quizzes, but you are able to opt out of them if you want. He does not assign homework either. I highly recommend that you take him.",1
"Clearly a very intelligent and capable professor, but he expects a lot. 6 week summer course and there were 3 novels and textbook reading, plus 4 discussion assignments, lots of audio lectures, an essay, reading quiz, and 2 writing heavy tests. Really brutal for a lower division course. If you work a lot, this is even more of a struggle.",1
"Duane is a very good teacher. He is very intellegent and is able to get the information to his students well. He can be very tricky though. Read his questionS THOROUGHLY!! His tests are good, and he is a big picture type of guy, meaning understand the concept, not the little details.",1
"I enjoyed the Reacting to the Past model for her classes. Focuses on 3 major historical events.  Each student is given a role to act out, and you get what you put into the experience. I wasn't sure about it at first, but once you get into the games, it becomes very involved & interesting.  Not your typical boring history class. I learned much more.",1
"Didn't feel like I got enough out of the teacher. The class was great and I learned a lot, but I wish the teacher would have helped more. Constantly had to ask for additional instructions. I was extremely ill and he gave me a redo on an assignment, but only for a couple more hours. I wrote him when I was super sick.",0
Good lecturer loves teaching history and is energetic about it. Best thing to do is participate and do the assignments. Provides test guides for every exam.,1
"Different teaching style but once you get used to it, it is very clear.  All the work and problems given are relevant so do the work and you wll be fine. Also shes extremely sarcastic, which can be very entertaining. Loved this professor.",1
Professor Shannon will tell you one thing is acceptable but will take it back the next class and totally forget she said anything about it. I sat down with her for an APA formatted paper to make sure I had everything correct because it was my first AP paper. she told me everything looked great then proceeded to mark me down on my formatting.,0
"Midterm is 45% and final is 55% of your grade, so pay attention. Textbook super helpful, lectures even more so. If you're thinking about law school his classes will let you know if you want/can/should go to law school.",1
"Organic Chemistry 2 is a hard class regardless of the professor you take. Grabowski is a great choice because of his very informational lectures. His exams are tough, but fair. I loved going to this class to hear the dad jokes and extra information he would give us. Practice problems and you will pass.",1
Awesome class - easy A ! Great GPA booster as long as you do your work. Boyer is an awesome teacher wish they had more like him in the AA program. I've taken three of his classes. Wish I could take more.,1
"I am impressed really nice guy, tells funny stories those stories are very relevant to the tests and help you remember just review the notes read your text book let him know u are making an effort and you will get a good grade",1
"I would 100% not recommend this class; If there is any way to avoid taking Abrams for Econ, avoid him at all costs. He did not prepare us for the exams at all. He read of the slides in a monotone voice every class, which came from the Connect website to begin with, and based his exams on questions and ideas we never went over in class...",0
"She's a funny and kind professor. She curves exams, gives extra credit, very helpful when asking questions. This class is alot of work and studying time but it's doable if you have other heavy load classes. Its all about time management. I recommend a week before the exam to study. She's picky and detailed but overall, she's great w Anatomy!",1
"Most of the coursework is the workbook activities and discussions. There are few assignments youre being grades on, which makes it easy to do them on time but if you dont do them your grade will suffer. The quizzes are fairly easy as well, so overall the class should be easy to get a good grade in.",1
"She has an accent and she repeats herself a lot, which makes the class boring. She use Aplia and Google Classroom, there is no physical textbook. Take this class only if you dont mind Chinese accent. Other than that, shes an experienced teacher and can help you in class.",1
dive for dreams or a slogan may topple you (trees are their roots and wind is wind) trust your heart if the seas catch fire (and live by love though the stars walk backward),1
I took MTH 242 this summer amid the pandemic. The coursework was quite heavy because it was a typical semester class that I took in 6 weeks. Dr. Chang is very upfront about the demands of this class. Her grading policy is very clear and fair. Statistics (MTH 242) is somewhat of a difficult class but Dr. Chang is willing to help you in any way.,1
Does not teach. Just rants about OS's he does not like. ,0
"Somewhat of a jerk to students that ask questions.  Don't really like the way he teaches, doesn't seem like its worth the money.  However, it is an easy class if you have any computer background, despite his ridiculous grading scale (other people's grade counts for part of yours also).  Bearable, but far from good.",0
"Laura is an excellent teacher. She loves her job and is VERY helpful. She teaches with enthusiasm and never misses a class. Her essays, quiz's, and text are all worth it. By the end of that class you'll have learned how to clearly write arguments of all sorts and have read really important novels in relevance towards American society.",1
"Don't expect him to really care about/help you much (like most of the profs. at UH math, they leave you to fend for yourself in Calc 2). Spent a lot of time in class looking at the chalkboard trying to figure the problems out when he was supposed to be teaching. He also promised a grade curve that ended up helping 2 people in the class. Beware.",0
"No enough words to express how amazing this man is. He is incredible. I have taken 4 classes with him & planning to take the 5th. He will assign books to read, but is very CLEAR about what he wants in his exams, which are usually a midterm and a final only. One term paper. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. His Classes fill out QUICKLY, register as soon as you can!",1
Mark basically sets a teaching benchmark for other professors in CS. His ability to deliver a lot of material and keep the class interested in every lecture is outstanding.,1
Margarita is the best!!!,1
"I took math 115 in the summer with him and let me tell you, he should NOT be teaching.  He may be a good tutor but he is NOT A GOOD TEACHER.  He does expect you to just know the stuff and he doesn't teach anything.  I ended up having to drop the class and waste the $400 I paid for it... Not a happy camper!",0
"I took this class expecting for it to exhaust me through out the semester, but over time realized this is not as hard. As long as you take the time at least once a week to read the new modules, and study for the exams.",1
"Nothing stressed me out more than taking a class with Sun, I often left lectures feeling very confused. There are also daily quizzes that you only have two minutes to complete. Throughout the semester he also gives 9 exams. On some exams he'll mark you down for mistakes and some he won't. Literally the only reason I passed this class was tutoring.",0
"I cringed every time he laughed at one of his own jokes and didn't really like his personality, but the class isn't bad. At least go to the beginning of class for the clicker questions, but otherwise lectures aren't necessary. Neither is the textbook. Use the powerpoints to answer his study guide questions and you should be fine.",1
"If I could go back in time and choose another professor I would. DO NOT take his class  he is monotone, unclear with his explanations, and at times it felt like he was trying to shove his religion towards his students. Take -a n o t h e r-professor. I barely learned anything. I was interested and fascinated by philosophy until I took him.",0
"Hope you like waiting hours on end for a reply back via email or message. Also, this is  the only online instructor who I have taken that has exams open at a certain time and terminate 10 min after. Missed the 10 min window? Too bad, no make-ups!",0
Incredible teacher. Really there for students !! Recommend  her 100%  for any Accounting class.,1
"Jaymie Heilman is an incredible, engaging, and REFRESHING professor. She has the ability to make history come alive in her lecture and you can tell she cares so much about what she teaches. If you have the chance, I highly recommend you take one of her classes (especially HIST 127!). She's always incredibly helpful one-on-one and speaks concisely!",1
"Very simple class. Only homework is online quizzes which are fairly easy. Grading is pretty much the tests. Ace a tests, get an A.",1
He was nice at first but he clearly wants there to be a hierarchy of grades in his class. It's like he doesn't want to give out A's to people that log on for class every day and TRY. He's rude & queeny and sometimes he makes offensive & shady remarks. His grading is very nit picky and he loves giving you a borderline grade. Take with someone else!,0
"His lectures are confusing. No examples shown. He might ask you to try to carry out a titration or two with specific conditions, but he won't go step by step to show you how it's done. Get ready to teach yourself. Tests are decent but you have no extra time so work efficiently. Students didn't finish the first two tests due to time. ",1
"The best professor I have ever had. This professor is super nice and super easy. If you really want to learn I highly recommend you to take this professor, he is very professional and the most important is that he is willing to help you. Everybody will pass his class.",1
"Good man, good teacher.  Dr. Lorenz is helpful, kind, and always entertaining with a subtle wit in class.  I credit his courses on govt and policymaking with helping me advance in my career in public service.",1
"She was ok. I felt that her direction was not very clear in the grading and course work. She did more english than history for the most part. I felt she got thrown into this class because they needed a professor. We watched a lot of fictional movies of World War 1, though nice , completely irrelevant.",0
"Amazing professor. Had her for engineering 102 and I wish I had taken her for 101. This class was not super easy, there was plenty of work to do, but she made it interesting and was really helpful with anything I needed help with.",1
"Dr. Haas is a very funny, passionate elderly gentleman. He has absolutely no online resources, so you have to go to class to take notes and get updates on exams and such. The entire grade is comprised of two 60ish question true or false exams. The questions on the exam can be almost a paragraph long, and hard to understand. Get ready to read cases",1
"Phillips was quite rude for the duration of the course. His teaching style is not accessible to all students, as he lectures by mouth only and is against repeating himself. Being graded on only 3 tests and a paper for the year is not a fair representation of learning as the tests are the most obscure questions possible.",0
"This class was awesome. The lectures are so interesting and he's good at ensuring you understand the material.  His test format is great - you get to take the same test three times and he gives feedback each time to help you master each topic. Due dates did change a bit, but wasn't his fault and was always to give us more time. Def take this class!",1
DON'T TAKE HIM!!!! Unless you wanna fail... Lots of studying outside the class for the exam since the explanation in the class is not that useful... although I attended all his classes and recorded the lecture on my phone to make sure not to miss anything and studied really hard for the exam I still got a C with a lot of hard work...,0
"If you're taking this for a breadth, it's a little harder than it looks. In-class exams are almost direct reflections of the study guide, so they're somewhat easy, but lab tests are hard! And the only grades are tests, so if you're not a good test taker, this isn't the class for you.",1
he has us do so many Tableau projects that are peer-reviewed and graded pretty harshly. On top of that you have many readings and you are not allowed to email him or he will lower your course grade. Who does that?!,0
Today was my first class with him and he very passionate on what he is teaching to students. He is a Sergeant after all! Already I can tell he truly cares about his students and will be there for you if you have any questions or concerns. Excited to be taking this class I know it'll be great! And no the textbook isn't required!!!!,0
"MTH 210 with Prof. Boelkins shaped me as a student. I loved it. It was so hard, definitely not a commitment I would be up for every semester, but invaluable as a one-time experience. Learned more than I can quantify: math, discipline, self-educating/self-learning, work ethic, and how to meet high expectations.",1
His syllabus contained errors and ambiguity for dates and grading policy. Additionally he failed to post timely topics for participation posts (although syllabus stated he would).  He really is an egomaniac.  Make sure you compliment him if you want a good grade.  His feedback was de-moralizing and destructive.,0
"I was excited to take geology and now I dread it. She's not the worst teacher; she has a few good moments but don't take her if you can avoid her. The homework takes me two hours and no matter how long I study, I can't pass the tests. There is also wayyy to much work for a gen ed class.",0
"Professor Shields is one of the main reasons I am graduating with an AA in cinema production this year!! His classes are fun & informative! He has great special guests & he even made time for me when I had a movie deal going down to give me some insights. He is a great guy! His mountain man beard can get outta control, still a brilliant producer!",1
I must admit the tests were very difficult but I did enjoy the class. She expects alot from your answers and the discussion is great (SPEAK UP IN CLASS). She is sooo helpful at office hours and truly caring about students. She doesn't believe in multiple choice. Expect to study! Not an easy A class but worth it and enjoyable looking back on it.,1
He goes to fast and it's hard to follow. He seems more like an honors math teacher than remedial. Only take him if you are good at math.  He gets really intense when he is working on problems on the board. Nice guy ,0
"Not as easy as I originally thought. The Professor was good and all, but the tests weren't as easy as I thought. The exams aren't easy and are more complex than the lectures.",1
"Peevish but knowledgeable professor mainly interested in research. There are three strictly-graded essays which make up your grade. You will find absolutely no leniency in Kello regardless of the validity of your excuse, so research well, follow the rubric, and use professional writing. Lectures are very interesting, but attendance does not matter.",0
Really great professor. The projects are difficult and will take time but if you spread it out you will get finished. He gives really detailed feedback when you ask and grades exactly to what he's asking of you.,1
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN. materials he teaches doesn't make sense.,0
Hard grader,0
Awesome Diff Eq professor and by easily the best professor I've had at Kettering. Make the subject interesting by relating it to real people and real life problems and he had a very light hearted vocab. Smartest man I have met.,1
The final was 5 QUESTIONS and 30 PERCENT of the class grade!! This is a good representation of how awful the CS department is at UWEC.,0
"This professor messed up my GPA. He expects you to know a lot. If don't know to write an essay well, you're done. He repeats everything and isn't very helpful. He is really nice but a harsh grader. Avoid him. You been warned..",0
"This class was real hard and Sara doesn't exactly teach it the best, but she is an awesome person at heart. I've taken a class and performed in a show with her and she's a cool person to work with, so it helps if you get on her good side. Also, if she sees that you are putting solid effort into the class she won't be so critical of your work.",1
"This class wasn't as great as I hoped. The entire first half of the class talked about genocide, which could have been covered in 2 days. It was boring at times, but in the end it wound up being enlightening. I would recommend taking this class because it opens your eyes, but don't get on Custers bad side, he can be a real jerk",0
"Good teacher overall, but very tough grader.  Be sure to be very attentive to grammer, APA style writing etc. She was a fast communicator and would reply to emails quickly.",1
"Very helpful, and gives out CANDY!",1
"School should've definitely made it mandatory to take this course immediately after finishing MISY225. He absurdly expected every student to be a coding pro since day one. When in this class, you're thinking about it all day every day, especially if you're not a natural coding whiz.. Even without procrastinating, I spent hours and hours on the work",0
"Very poor grader - She doesn't have a real rubric to go by. She takes off many points for miniscule things. There are four assignments in the whole class with one discussion each week. You have 3-4 days to post, not the typical full week. She takes weeks to a month to answer emails and grade assignments. She is very unhelpful.",0
"Most people don't like Dr. Jones because her class is ridiculously hard. In reality, it's only hard in comparison with Troy's other biology classes. This class weeds out the people who simply don't have what it takes to be a doctor or scientist, and I respect Dr. Jones for having the guts to be the ""bad guy"" in order to prepare us for reality.",1
Easy class. You actually have to try to do poorly in this class. Will give you a second opportunity to do almost any assignment (including tests & compositions). Textbook required. Lecture heavy. Not many opportunities to converse in French.,1
"Dr. McAlpine is awesome. He may get a little monotone every once in a while (maybe more often than I like to remember), but he's a great teach nonetheless. Easy.",1
I dreaded this class every day I had to go. I hated Mondays and Wednesdays because I knew I would have to sit in this class. DONT TAKE HER. im warning you. skip one class you will fail. She talks about stupid things just so time will pass and it will make you want to rip your hair out. Assignments are a waste of time and useless and so much work.,0
"Some people don't like him becasue he's hard, but he's the only teacher I had this semester that made me think.",1
"had him for inro to lit. studies, romantic, modern british, and victorian...he's a genius, hilarious, and extremely helpful.",1
Great professor. He is funny and knows what he is talking about. This class was very helpfull...,1
I actually loved this class. His exams were pretty easy if you listened to him. He tells exactly what will be on the exams. He repeats himself so we know what he will test on. Very funny prof also. He made the class fun in my opinion.,1
The. Worst. Teacher. Ever.,0
Talented. Bright. Funny. Hot!,1
"Very incompetent professor - does not give reasons for her grades given. When asked about grades for a course her response was merely, ""Don't worry, you're passing."" NEVER take her online course!!!!!!!!!",0
"He is a great young professor from Germany. Once you get past the accent which isnt that bad, the material flows quite easily. Just ask any questions when you have a problem, and he will help you. We used Connect for all of the HW and quizzes. However, quizzes didnt mesh well with lecture notes. Overall, one of the better picks for intro econ.",1
"It seemed like this was the first time she teached in a classroom, but obviously not, after reading everyone else's comments.  She was always at least 5-10 minutes late to class, unorganized, WAY too much work for an intro class, and she couldn't keep the non-interested students from bothering the ones that wanted to learn.",0
I took her class on spring semester. Be ready to Give 100 percent of your attention if you miss even a minute you will be lost. Tests are relatively easy if you pay attention in class I recomend you dont miss a day or you will be lost. pop quizzes are given but she gives a heads up. Listen closely because she has kind of a heavy accent,1
"Makes everything very clear, will sit down for hours and discuss everything you need help with; you must read before class to fully understand the content, there is also a lot of dad jokes and examples during lectures. Be sure when he pauses before he says something, you write it down. His tests are very easy if you read. A great professor honestly",1
"By far the worst prof I have ever taken. She has extreme mood swings. If she's having a great day, then class goes smoothly, if not, beware. She talks down on students. Overall, very disrespectful & rude. I would never recommend her. She screams at her students as if we are children. On top of everything, she gets off topic to talk about herself.",0
Study guides for test are nothing like the test,0
Definitely best professor I ever have. You will learn a lot from her class. Come to class and be prepared.,1
"Dr. Maillart is an unfriendly person, treating teaching as a chore. The class was set up asynchronous, with a zoom lecture once a week. The zoom lecture became useless quickly, but the incentive was tophat extra credit for going. After the second exam the department changed the policy so that a D- is needed to move onto 1071...",0
"Professor Fleshman is not necessarily ""hard"". But he can make it hard in some ways. He is soft spoken and hard to understand at times. Will mess up while giving notes to the class and have to correct himself, throwing the whole class off. Consistently late grading the tests which make it hard to monitor your grade. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Only gave him a ""1"" rating because they don't let you rate ""0"".",0
His online lectures are incredibly long and monotone. The quizzes are supposed to be questions from the lectures but its unclear. There's question's from the book but the syllabus doesn't say anything about reading sections. And heavy assignments for basically no points.,0
Not a difficult class. Tests are straightforward. Basically the whole class is lecture of pictures from ppt and then tests from the book.,1
"This guy is the best teacher in PBU! His quizzes and papers are really easy, but his exams are MONSTERS! You will have to EARN your grade in this class, but its the most rewarding class in PBU, regardless of your major.",1
Weekly HW assignments take about an hour + each week. 2 timed take home tests and 2 timed on-campus tests. The content from the tests are from the weekly HW assignments.,1
"Professor Cotsell is really nice and knows the material well. Class can be pretty dry, and attendance doesn't really amount to much. He's a reasonable and easy grader, just three or four short papers throughout the semester comprise your grade. Honestly I got an A and was never in class. Really nice guy, would recommend.",1
"Mrs. Jackson is a good professor. She is easy going and cares about her students. She gives lots of group activities. Do your work, and get an A.",1
"He will not answer questions about homework in class. He insists you write your questions on Blackboard as if it is an online class. He reads his powerpoint and then gives you complex problems to do in class almost every class, before you feel you have learned the concepts. He does not respond well to questions on the fly. ",0
He will not acknowledge your effort. Very particular about essay writing and will take a lot of points off your essay for trivial stuff like page number and headings. I don't recommend Kohut.,0
"Mr. Logan is a very helpful and patient teacher. He can be quiet if you are in the back and has smaller handwriting though, so if you have vision or auditory issues it's good to sit towards the front. Ultimately he is a very clear and thorough teacher who takes his time during and after class to ensure we understand the methods and theories.",1
"She is very smart and quite demanding. The text is hard even for native speakers (I met one on an airplane and asked for help interpreting). There is a lot of writing, like 3-5 pages, in french. Her english communication is not great so it's hard to ask questions for clarification. She'll never remember your name, even with only 8 people in class.",0
"Her lessons are all over the place, you never really learn anything from them. It really never did me any good to show up to class because it never helped me learn any better the material that we were learning.",0
"Extremely tough when grading tests and quizzes. If a student makes one mistake, all work following it is worth 0 points.",0
Good teacher. Be ready to read BEFORE going into class or you might be awaken with a surprise that you will not like. He gives extra credit and will help you along the way in this class.,1
Very aggressive,0
Very good teacher,1
"She sucks!!! She gives assignments that are unclear and your grades will reflect this. She is innaccurate. Hope you like math, because you won't be doing much of anything else. It would have been nice to actually do some things besides math, like maybe learning the terms and testing procedures.",0
"I took intro to calc in high school, and good thing I did because his teaching style was so hard to understand. Gives you one to two examples depending on the topic in his lectures, but you don't even get tested on those kinds of examples? Talked like that sloth from zootopia I'd rather bang my head on the wall than listen to him.",0
"Makes class fun, but doesn't really help that much. Overall I liked her.",1
"He is mad boring...it's like watching paint dry..hes a nice guy, but hes an accountant not a teacher so he just tells you how it works instead of teaching it to you..",0
"She explains with longs powerpoints, a totally confusion. She only says the date of the exams in class no emails. She in kind but doesn't help too much. Drops the lowest grade.",0
"Raul was awesome! Participate in class and you'll do fine. He assigns a few papers which are reflections so they aren't too difficult. There is quite a bit of reading but to be honest I didn't really read and I did just fine. The two exams are a little bit tougher and you do have to study for them in order to pass. Overall great, nice, fun teacher.",1
"He is enthusiastic about the topics in class; heavy readings and the slides for the class are not that helpful (he has his own logic but I don't really understand), participation policy is strict, hard grader for papers and the exam is extremely difficult. He is a humorous and intelligent lecture, not very concerned with students outside the class.",0
"Seems like a nice guy with good intentions but gives an ungodly amount of homework, has trouble articulating the questions on exams, and gives unclear project instructions. Overall, very disorganized. Would not take again.",0
"Prof. Poindexter is very nice and understanding. There is very little assigned homework (online Heinle). As long as you study the vocab on your own, you can get a good grade. Often she will have graded classwork (10pts), especially when attendance is low, so come to class. The exams aren't bad, and the oral exam was easy. Take this class!",1
"Really an awesome person and scholar. Hilarious and engaging, Shearer is one of the absolute best professors I have had at UD. His readings are guidelines, and your grade is entirely derived from three papers, typically 10 pages in length. Fantastic teacher and person.",1
"Do not take this course if you are not extremely, wholeheartedly, 100% passionate about this subject. Dr. Boden pushes his passion on the subject too much, causing for way too much information, homework assignments, and overall workload. All of his assignments can pile up easily if you're not caught up with the class. Watch the lectures and read!!!",0
"Dr. Deegan's class was the most intense and stressful class I have ever taken. Everything is done online which is great . All exams and quizzes are open book and open notes. Quizzes are based off of the book and the midterms and final are based on lecture. Go to class, ask questions! He curves grades at the end, fantabulous! ",0
HE is extremely boring,0
Very nice and helpful but very difficult. he makes class very interesting. very heavy accent but you'll get used to it. go to each class and don't skip out!,0
"If you are considering taking ISAT 112 as a Gen Ed, don't. For a freshman level course, it feels like you need to be an expert on everything, especially chemistry.",0
"Maher has been great for me in both Mammalogy & Bio Stats. Very laid back teacher but at the same time he knows how to enforce his material properly. A lot of it is straight from the book so buying the required book(s) is highly advised. He has some good humor, is very approachable & good at answering questions. Would take again. -NL",1
"His quizzes, are 5 questions and they are hard. When he says he gives partial credit, it 4/10, and he doesn't really give feedback. Tests are about the same but at 10 questions. Must go to office hours in order to get more time for understanding material. In lecture he speeds through it you have to ask questions. Do not be scared to ask!!!",0
"Even though I received a C, it was not her fault.  She is very helpful and very kind.  Good teacher.",1
"Took online sociology marriage and families. Avoid this professor for online classes, his syllabus is in broken English, he is not responsive to messages, and he does not have anywhere regarding the assignments throughout the semester, just sends weekly messages of what is due. Maybe a good professor in person, but awwful for online material.",0
"Dr. Hansen is a wonderful professor who cares about his subject and teaches it in a clear, fun way. He gets to know each student. He gives his students lots of opportunities to get involved in hands-on learning, through field trips and soil labs and other ways. He is so, so kind. He is a very fair grader and very understanding.",1
the worst class. So BORING. you cannot understand a word he says and he doesnt care about teaching at all. very nice and seems like he cares about sustainability but not good at all. his voice will put you to sleep and i gave up and used this 2.5 hour class to get homework done for the week. everyone fails exams so he will curve like 20 points!,0
"Aced his class. But if I had the choice to take it again, I would not take it with him. I learned a lot about the course material but none of it was from him. He takes 10 weeks to discuss Relational Calculus/Algebra and intro to SQL, and gives the last 5 weeks to work on a project (which has to be industry professional or he fails you). Hard pass",0
"In lab, he was always willing to help and he was good at giving explanations and clearing things up. Overall, he's a great professor. It seems like he wants everyone succeed in the class unlike most other professors who make it clear that they don't care.",1
Worst class ever.  I'd rather get hit by a car than take that class again...getting a headache just thinking about it.,0
"Tests and quizes every week, packets of homework every day on top of an inconsistently due online homework set. If this class conflicts with any other assignments learn on your own or fall behind. Most unprepared class and teacher I have ever had.",0
"I would not take Professor Aguilar again only because her lectures are not really lectures she speaks about the reading but she tends to go off topic a lot. If youre not much for writing papers do not take her, she only has about 4 assignments and theyre all heavy graded and really long and does not take late work. A lot of research is involved",0
"Many love his classes, but I find his credulous assent to every Marian apparition, save for the most obviously bogus, to be very burdensome. It's one thing to have devotion to Mary, but he borderlines on a kind of blind fanaticism. Also some of the texts you read are highly dubious and are not at all rigorously reasoned. He hates to be questioned.",0
"He is a nice guy  but lectures are long and boring and he goes off on tangents too often to follow. Exams are tough based mostly on what he says in class, hard to know what to study.",0
Tough grader and is unclear on weekly assignments for what is due and when its due. Can take 24+ hours for a response. Shes sent up to 5+ emails at a time for changing assignments around. Can be very sarcastic and not very forgiving on homework. You need to be in contact with her often through email and in class if you want to do well.,0
"Absolutely amazing.  Keep up the wonderful work, Norma.  I hope to do exactly what you do some day.",1
a lot of online homework. so hard. he did not teach very well ! he answer the questions and did not make anyone to answer with him. I will not take with him again.,0
Cares what students think.,1
"Very nice guy, very poor teacher. I'd advise taking another professor for finc312",0
Elle fait des PowerPoint très clairs et explique bien la matière. Je n'ai pas du tout lu le livre de la session parce que ses ppt sont très complets. C'est mieux d'être présent en classe pour comprendre. Matière semble compliquée à priori mais c'est en fait très simple si on suit bien en classe. Pas très dynamique ni captivante mais explique bien.,1
"Of all my profs this semester she is the only one that took the time to talk to me like I was an equal.  Her class is someplace you want to go when its time for class.  Don't let her fool you though, she is smarter then anyone I have ever met but she isn't condensending EVER. I have never had a teacher I would want as a friend, her I would",1
"Although her lectures can be boring sometimes, this class is so easy! She makes sure everyone understands everything, and grades much easier now. If she likes you, you will do well!",1
This professor is not helpful at all. All he does is just send notes and homework without explaining any concepts. Do not risk taking any class with him. Take it at your own risk :(,0
"Dr. A herself is really approachable and genuinely wants students to succeed. Her Women's Studies REALLY infiltrates her Good Life class, though; would not really recommend as a HUM2305 teacher unless this is something you are interested in. Very long readings about gender issues that at times were tough to relate back to the idea of the Good Life.",1
"Never comes out from behind desk, sends students to colleges tutoring instead of works with in class, yells at class when scores on test low. First Test Class Scores: A=2, B=5, C=22, D=9, F=8. Seriously?",0
"With Dr. Douglas, it's all in the readings (lectures are weak). Seasoned econ students will do very well and learn lots from the fantastic reading materials; new ones will be hand-held in learning how to do econ (papers, for example). The ""dry"" subject of 335 (demographic econ) may make it tough, so I gave difficulty  4; but I found it fascinating",1
"So rude, just do yourself a favor and dont take her",0
"Dr. Lane is a great person, and very funny. However, his rubrics are unclear, and he grades extremely harsh. Expect hours of work, for a B grade at best. Go above and beyond the rubric if you want a mediocre grade. The class requires a lot of work, and is not worth it. Take a different honors sequence.",0
"Loved this class! I originally didn't want to take critical thinking, but he made the class very enjoyable! Overall, very easy class. There are only two exams and weekly assignments, and he gives out extra credit.",1
"Terrible. Unclear lectures, exams too long, no sense for basic things like class prereqs/posting homework solutions before exams, talks too much about how simple the concepts are/how everyone should get them (several times/lecture). Homework was lectures ahead of us conceptually more than once. And all this was *before* classes went online.",0
"Dr. Isenberg is a kind, funny, and easy going professor who will work with you and answer questions or concerns. Content heavily neuroscience based, so if you are not a psychology major it may be hard. The class lecture is based off power-points, but are not uploaded into canvas so be sure to take notes. There are no study-guides for quiz/test.",1
"Are you looking for an awesome English professor? well look no further because you have found her. Mrs. Jessica Zbeida is my favorite college professor! You have a total of 4 writing assignments. She is very sympathetic and understands that life happens. Show up and pass, that's it. Did I mention that shes awesome?",1
She's super sweet and very helpful. Homework isn't required but it's the basis for all the quizzes and tests. Gets confused a lot but she goes over things in class and makes everything clear. Always available for office hours &allows one page of notes for each test. Do the work & you can have an easy A in the class. Best math teacher I've ever had.,1
You need an 87% average on the three tests to be able to skip the final; he boasts that he'll show you the final beforehand and you'll still fail. There is a financial analysis project done over the course of the semester and he is very unclear in his expectations. He also goes over the material incredibly quickly so get ready to frantically write.,0
Very little correlation between lectures and exams. He is very bad iat explaining topics and overall a very bad teacher.,0
"No lecture. Asynchronous. One discussion/quiz a week. Weekly assigned readings/sometimes film. Easy workload, interesting assignments, the amount of stuff you learn is amazing and you never get bored. Favorite class I've taken. Prof has a pretty passive role, gives class as a whole feedback, quick email responses if you reach out. Easy A.",1
He talks way too much before each lab on content with no relation to the work he has you do. This professor also grades very specifically and is not fair/equal on his grading.,0
Listen to his stories and don't bother reading the text.,1
"most confusing professor I have ever had. Many students in class are education majors, not all, but he only teaches through the education lens. Grades based on ""thoughtfulness"", whatever that means. Doesn't actually want your opinion and never actually teaches ANYTHING. Don't ever expect to learn or receive feedback on how you're doing in class",0
Prof Gartland is a sweet lady & a very kind professor. I took her fall of 2016. She lectures the entire time every class. She also gets off topic sometimes but pay attention these are her extra credit questions!! Attendance is not mandatory. She also provides you with study guides for each exam that are basically the exam lol.,1
"Pr. Wheatley is absolutely fabulous. She knows her stuff, and is incredibly open to student interpretations. She's always available to talk and is an overall sweetheart. She's my favorite professor at W&M; she'll push you to be your best.",1
"I've heard that she is a great professor, so that's why I believe that it was probably just an issue with transitioning to online. That being said, this is the single worst class I have ever taken. I knew it was bad when I went to sleep crying and woke up crying. Most of the people I talked to got horrible grades. She just didn't explain the topic.",0
"The tests given were extremely difficult. He tried to be personable and funny, not a bad person, just not the greatest teacher. ",0
"He's great. A fair grader, and not too tough. He's quite knowledgeable, helpful, skilled and very kind. He's almost like a father figure (comforts kids when they get a bad grade, etc.). He'll give you the grade you deserve and tell you when something isn't working/ looks bad, but he does it in the absolute nicest way possible. Highly recommend!",1
"Dorothy Fujimura is a tough teacher. Her lectures are based off of some examples from the textbook and then she assigns homework from the entire chapter so you have to teach yourself or go to tutoring. If she thinks you don't meet the algebra requirements she will ask you to leave her class. One midterm, 4 quizzes, and one final.",0
"Run the other way! This teacher is insane. She is an extremely hard grader and the only way to do good on a paper is to buy one offline from someone with their masters. I couldn't wait for this class to be over. Nice person, but a pain as a teacher.",0
"Not a nice experience, she is very unpleasant and mean even to those people working very hard. You will regret taking her classes.",0
"he is not very good at explaining the material.  gives chances to ask questions, but takes the whole class time to try to explain, and you still leave confused.  he does assign homework, he will check it all before the test.  doesn't grade for right or wrong answers. if you take this class be ready to learn on your own.",0
Terrible professor who does not teach. She is easily the worst teacher Ive ever had in my life. Its sad that she s better than the other comm professor though. The T.A. Carter is amazing though. Her study hall is what gave those that could pass a chance. I dont think Ive ever had a more useless and pointless professor in my life.,0
"Somewhat funny. However, he changed the project criteria throughout the class and was always unclear about the requirements. You could skip class, and just read from the book or slides. Do problems somehow. He said from now on he wants make the project weigh more and use the book less. Overall he's quite inexperienced and unclear. Curves at the end",0
"Dr. Mitchell was very loud, funny, and outspoken (can be seen as rude). No homework, 4 exams, and 10 labs. Labs are worth 200 points, since he drops the 2 lowest. Do labs for an easy 200 points. First two exams are very hard, which weeds many students out. Stick to the final 2 and they get much easier. Drops lowest exam. Hard but passable class.",0
His class is very dry and boring. His teachings don't align with anything learned in prior circuits classes. He teaches from power points and has grading issues.,0
"If you're scared to take stats, TAKE THIS CLASS!! Professor Herring is a sweetheart who makes every chapter approachable and easy to understand. I absolutely hated math in high school, but truly enjoyed this class. There are 10 homework assignments, 2 exams, and then the final. If you do the work, it would be hard not to pass this class.",1
"Very demanding, but if you listen closely to his instructions, you will learn alot. Bring your papers to him to look over before the due date.",1
"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless.",0
"Heavy workload, most of which is busywork. Acts like he's trying to get feedback from students but really will end up doing what he wants anyway. Journals are horrible and he marks you down for not having enough personal reflection. Keep checking due dates because he sometimes gets them wrong in class, and if it's late he won't accept it.",0
"Were halfway into the semester and the only thing I have in the grade book is attendance. She always cancels class, sometimes at the last minute too.",0
I really like this professor. He shows his respect to his student. The lectures were interesting and helpful. Class materials were organized.,1
Always seems stressed and high strung in class. Communicates clearly though.,0
"Dr. Jay Ou... he's okay. Thats it. - Doesn't teach - Doesn't give detailed information about the assignments. It's kind of like ""okay, here's the assignment... do it"" - Your grade is based off 5 quizzes and 2 assignments, so if you miss an assignment or do bad on a quiz... your grade is down the toilet Like I said he's okay...",0
"She dismissed class late every day and was difficult to understand. All of the homework was online, so we received very little feedback. This is an incredibly lazy teaching method and made me less passionate about mathematics! I'm now in linear algebra and have never had a professor as awful as her.",0
"This is for the Social Cognition class. 90% of the grade was made of 3 tests, which puts on a lot of pressure. They were open-note, but timed, and the questions were tough and specific. She assigns a lot of scientific articles to read and helps you understand them through the lectures. She cares about the well-being of her students and is friendly",1
"This class was online so I never actually met the professor, but he was not very helpful. You were kind of on your own and the class was extremely hard for an online 100 level class. If you're thinking about taking this class for a gen ed, definitely do NOT.",0
Easy A and loved his lectures. You have 1 apa paper and chapter take-home quizzes. I recommend renting the book if you want to fly through without too much effort. Definitely would take again!,1
"Fascinating personality & extremely articulate. Presents material in an organized, thorough manner. Witty sense of humor. Caveat: very tough grader. Even with studying and attending all classes, it's still hard to get a B. Overall, wonderful professor.",1
Dont be fooled by the fake charm. Mean in her core.,0
"Prof. Muir is very well educated in the class I took- Income Tax. He is easily approachable. Uses the textbook and homework in Cengage. Class is easy and informative. Group paper at the end of the semester. Make sure you have a team, he almost forgot to place us and only gave 2 weeks for the paper to be completed.  Would def take him again",1
"Best collegiate band director in the northeast, she changed my life for the better and I value every second of being in the UDMB",1
Andrea is an ideal perfect professor she gives great feedback and wants to see success in her student body. She puts in extra hours all the time and gives plenty of options if you need to make up for a missed class however don't make them up you won't pass which you wouldn't deserve to this is COLLEGE! Loved her she's funny and very smart! :),1
"Great class, tests aren't too difficult and you learn a lot.",1
"She never clarifies what exactly to study and the whole class is her ranting about her life. She's very outspoken and kind of funny at times, but she's bitter. She does NOT take any excuse for hw or test make-up, even if you were in the hospital or in a car accident, she DOESN'T CARE! would NOT EVER!Take her class again, i like my teachers to care.",0
"He was so bad I had to drop his class. Grades quizzes and exams only, assigns homework, but wont grade it so it cant help offset a bad exam. He is nice, but his lectures are confusing to the point it looks like he has never taught. I talked to ex-peers and they all told me he is pretty bad and were at major risk for not passing.",0
"Duba is an awesome guy.  If you ask a question, he will answer it...  for the most part.  He tries to teach you how to find answers for yourself rather than just giving it to you straight.  He wants you to learn, not just to regurgitate information for the final.",1
"Worst professor ever. The lectures are USELESS but attendance is 20% of your grade. Homework is 50% of your grade and she unlocks assignments not even 48 hours before they're due. Even if you do well on assignments, the final, and attendance. You're grade still probably won't be great because she makes it so the class average is 2.5.",0
"Abdulkarim was first my tutor and then he became my professor in Elementary Arabic I. He is a great professor. He uses wonderful powerpoints, and he is always well-prepared.",1
Jeanette's class has been my hardest at IU. She didn't like my style of writing so I failed two assignments. Still ended up getting a B+ in the class. Useful information taught. VERY nice lady. Grading did seem slightly arbitrary. Hardest business honors class hands down.,1
AWESOME TEACHER!!!!! She wants you to pass so everything you need to know is presented to you in the book review test and in class lecture. If your a visual learner then she's the teacher for you!! You will learn and enjoy coming to class. Don't miss a class or you'll get behind. Don't be late to class either. Best teacher I've ever had!!!!!!!,1
"Dr. Mike is a great professor at U of M. He actually cares about hoe well students understand the material. He is one of the only physics professors that takes the time to review before exams. Although the exams are pretty hard, Dr. Mike takes the time to go over any questions students have.",1
Brian is amazing! If you just do the work he will like you and work with you. He can be ornery but he really does care and will go out of his way for students who show him they want to learn. The total grade is one 7-page partner paper and three essay exams. The readings and lecture will all be on the exam so don't skip chapters!,1
"She is the best teacher ever.  She explains everything very well, and make the class so fun.",1
"The class should be easy if you study with a group. He might be good at teaching CS, but he is terrible at teaching math. He consistently misuses definitions and gives handwavey solutions and proofs. If you ask him questions in office hours, he sometimes gives you the wrong answer, so beware. Easy pass, but don't expect to learn rigorous math.",0
I didnt like her because she said she would make the class easy so when you tryed to ask her a question she made you feel dumb and wasnt very helpfull or nice about anything.,0
"Probably one of the worst professors I have had in my entire schooling career. Extremely tough grader with absolutely zero feedback on anything. Thankfully for anyone reading this he is retiring after next semester so you will not have to deal with the absolute horrid ""teaching"" this man provides. 1 out of 10.",0
"It would have been a good class if she had given feedback. Grades were not posted - not in 48 hours, not in 3 weeks. Emails go unanswered, questions are left hanging. Even emailing several times doesn't help. It sounds as if she is a good teacher in the classroom, maybe. Online, not so much. I would not recommend anyone taking this class online.",0
Most unapproachable and pompous professor I've ever had by far. Gives unhelpful and often very antagonistic feedback on assignments and when asking him basic questions or clarifications. He put minimal effort into the course and assigned a ton of readings every week. Luckily TA was a very easy grader and graded everything except the group project,0
Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,0
"He's really helpful and want his students to pass. Very passionate about the subject and knows his work. He talks all throughout his class time but his stories are interesting. Attendance is not mandatory but you will want to be there, 4 exams notes come from the textbook and his own notes/worksheet packets. Awesome professor. Highly Reccomend!",1
Dr. Trent was helpful. She provided study guides for exams. She also was good with sending email reminders about important due dates.,1
"She's was nice but very unorganized and was always going off topic. Everyone in the class had to ask her to stop and stay on topic and stop giving us useless information that she even says ""even though this doesn't have to do with what we are talking about.."" The class test average was a 60%, so it was not just me.",0
He is a really nice guy but his lectures can be very boring and I found myself zoning out a lot. Accounting is a boring class itself and he doesn't make it much better. There is a lot of homework that you need to do online as well.,1
"Only went to lecture once and got an easy A. The T.A.s will literally review everything on the midterms and final in discussion, so you never have to study for more than two days before the exam. The tests are free response but they give you 5 prompts and you only have to answer 3 of them plus an EC question on the tests. Also discussion quizzes.",1
I withdrew due to bad grades. There is no Web Work in this class so you would not know what to study. Practice tests are nothing like the real test. One of the worst math teachers in my whole life. I would not recommend this professor. DO NOT TAKE EVER!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!,0
"I absolutely loved Professor Doonan and was very sad that Corona virus cut our class time short. Amazing lectures that I never got bored in, and the funniest professor at Sac City. Super unique sense of humor and he made you want to do well. Wish I had taken him sooner, got my money's worth!! Love this professor!",1
Questions on exams and hoemwork seemed to be worded to confuse you or required that you had prior knowledge of an unrelated subject. Gives few if any example problems. Most people did poorly on the exams yet he did not take responsibility for it. ,0
Very nice person and very helpful.  2 extra credits and to very easy assignments as well as 4 exams. You do have due dates but the assignments are so easy that you can do them with in 30 minutes and turn them in at advance.,1
"Highly recommend avoiding professor at all costs. He teaches Math as an English class. Tests and quizzes are based on how well you know definitions. By the end of the course, I couldn't apply anything I learned, I just knew definitions really well. Professor is very smug and doesn't treat students nice when visiting during office hours.",0
"Kata is the top professor in the entire language department. We did not have any exams. Most of our grade came from 300-400 word responses to the readings (graded very nicely), and a final essay written as a group. Rather than smothering us w/busywork, Kata focused on creating lively discussions and making us think critically about the world.",1
What an ego! I aced this class but the structure was awful and he only seemed concerned with all the work he was going to have with the grading and editing the final product. Not really what the students could do.   He doesn't respond to emails. Rarely gives anybody besides other tenured professors the time of day. ,0
"It took a few sessions to get get a grasp on his teaching methods.  In the beginning I found him tough to hearunderstand. He lightens up as class progresses. Readpresent alot of cases (says 1, but you end up doing all).  Grade is based on participation & exam; fair grader.  His book is used and it's well written & worth reading to prep for class.",1
"Professor McCarthy was one of my favorite teachers this semester, she made the class fun and genuinely cares about her students. She leans on the tougher side of grading, but she gives out clear rubrics and good feedback. There's a lot of readings and short homework (like reviews) in this class but if you do them you'll have no problems at all.",1
I just took his class last semester. He was great with teaching materials but was NOT very understanding with his students. He called people out like teachers do in high school. He also took points off for attendance even though I missed for a funeral. Left his class with a B instead of the A just for missing an extra two days.,0
Murtuza will work with you to make sure you learn. He will let you take the test on another day if you feel unprepared or are unavailable during the night time exams. He wants you to learn the material more than he cares about testing you on the material. Anyone who gave him a poor rating honestly didn't try or pay attention to him.,1
She does a good job of getting students involved. Definitely a passionate professor. Would recommend,1
I liked his class at first but It all went down hill when he was snarky to me because I used my phone in class to take a picture of the board when he asked us to. Since then I wanted to attend the class less and he was rude more and more and is extremely passive aggressive to me outside of class. If you don't live and breath chem he's not for you.,0
"Professor Levenburg is a very smart person, but not a good professor at all. This is my first time ever writing a review in my four years at Grand Valley. She is a professor who is relatively easy but not worth taking. She is disrespectful to her students when they ask a simple question. Constantly makes mistakes when going over examples, no good.",0
"This is by far the worst professor I have EVER had. He's almost 80! His lectures made NO sense whatsoever. He didn't TEACH anything, he automatically expected us to be able to figure out how to do problems in the class. Like what is the point of having a TEACHER if I have to teach myself. He assigned homework before the topic was covered in class.",0
"I had to battle with him and eventually got tossed aside to the math director b/c Zhang wouldnt admit that he was wrong. I ended up being 2 wks behind b/c he didn't post the WebCT correctly. Self-teach with only your classmates to help you;his plan I think b/c he wants to give you a partic. grade. Tests r hard, but passable. No extra study games.",0
"While the class is not for everyone, I think Professor Bernstein is a fantastic lecturer and teacher, we often spoke politics in the morning before class together. Only three grades for the entire class, but he is willing to ditch the first grade if the last two are improved, definitely study and take detailed notes. I had three full pages a class.",1
"I swam for many years and took this for an easy pe credit. I like him because he swam for a good part of his life and keeps swimming, but is also very intelligent with every stroke and many, many drills. ",1
"Interesting lectures, empathetic professor with a great sense of humor. would definitely love to have her again.",1
"Easily my favorite professor at CNU. She is so helpful when you visit her office hours to discuss papers/assignments. She's definitely a tough grader, but I've never felt so satisfied with a final paper as I felt in her class. She tries her best to make the class more interesting. Overall, a fantastic professor, I would highly recommend to anyone.",1
"She seems very nice, and I feel bad saying this, but she is very boring. This class was extremely hard to stay awake in, let alone pay any attention in. I feel as though I have not learned much from this class. She does not provide clear expectations of papers. There are also only a couple of graded assignments within this class.",0
"Prof. Gentille is amazing. Took her Child Life course, and she's terrific. The weekly modules are easy (usually readings and maybe a DB post), there are 2 major hw assignments, 2 tests, and a final. Likes short answer questions, but tests are short and easy. She's very knowledgeable and involved in Child Life, so, if you want the best, take her.",1
"Worst English course/professor I have had in my 5 yrs at GVSU. She is always off schedule, but does not update the students about the schedule changes. She based more than half of our grade on a final project she did not provide an assignment sheet or guidelines for. She is rude to students and arrogant-though not very knowledgeable. Avoid her.",0
Fun and easy spanish class. Especially if you are not a spanish minormajor. There are test corrections. Tests are OKAY. Lectures can drag on but he is very funny. He loves what he does. Very helpful. Would recommend for spanish.,1
"The class isn't the easiest, but she's the best professor to take it with.",1
She is great. Plain and simple. Tests are essay with identification (definition) questions. Fair grader and a great teacher. Very interactive with the class. Wonderful.,1
pedantic and a bit obnoxious with his diction. lectures jump around and are hard to follow. nonetheless he is an intelligent man and knows what he is talking about.,0
"I took his online Econ class, and it was the worst class I've taken. Unless you are an excellent test taker and like to teach yourself the class, steer clear. He posts zero lectures or any other original material, grades everything on 2 proctored exams, and tells you to buy an extra textbook--that he wrote. Save your money; take the CLEP instead.",0
Awesome class.,1
Professor Kopperl was really great! This honors course is very easy if you're a good writer because it's graded almost entirely on writing papers. Some semesters his section has a mid-term but he provides a study guide which pretty much spells out what you need to know for the test. He's very helpful in and outside of class. Highly recommended!,1
"Shes sweet, her assignments are fine, go to class, sometimes on fridays she does give it optional to come. She is a hard grader, mostly looks at grammar mistakes. 8am with her is a little boring especially if you commute. JUST GO TO CLASS AND DO WORK AND YOULL BE FINE. For essays make sure to ask others for help besides her.",0
"I took her online Abnormal Psychology class in the Spring Semester, and I liked it. The content was really interesting, and theres not too much work. Theres normally a discussion and a fifteen question timed open-note quiz on the chapter each week. Overall, I would definitely take it again.",1
"only take this class if your hands are immune to muscle cramps....because you will be taking notes non-stop and you won't be doing anything else. she was unhelpful and boring. she knows her history well, but she has no teaching skills and isn't very understanding of different learning styles.",0
I think this may have been the first math class I sort of enjoyed. I love Prof Keefe. She's so clear and engaging and hilarious. She gives lots of extra credit as well. Definitely recommend.,1
"A nice guy and really cool attitudes.  I join BPA and went to national out in california and had a chance to hang out with Ron.  
 
 easy easy class, i play games and serf the web most of the time in class and still got an A+.  Take Ron if you need a A, take another class if u need knowleadge about MSCE.",1
"He's a good teacher because he makes himself available, but DO NOT take his remote class, do the online class instead. In his lectures, he repeats himself over and over and uses the whole lecture time to tell students stuff they learned in the 1st class. He doesn't actually teach anything in the remote lectures.",1
Be prepared for A LOT of work. At least 4 quizzes a week along with assignments and research projects. One week alone we had 6 quizzes and 4 assignments that were not simple. She will help out with resumes and internship questions which was good. Other than that you need to dedicate much time to this class. Look for books online-they are expensive!,0
"Dr. Creed is the most dedicated professor at CofC, hands down. He is highly intelligent and will make sure you understand what you need to improve on in his class. I struggle keep up with his class but he is an amazing professor. He is extremely accessible. As long as you work with him, he will work with you. 10/10 recommend as long as you work!",1
"Professor Edwards is the man! He gives homework's that are hard but the tests are way easier. If you don't understand a concept, his office hours are very helpful so go to them. He also grades to how the class does so the curve is very generous. I got an 87% in the class and ended up with an A-. Highly recommend him.",1
"Well,this guy is indeed controversial.But I would say he is a GENIUS!BEST professor I have ever had.In the first few weeks I didn't know what was going on with the class.He seemed to talk nonsense all the time and enjoyed himself.Thanks to my awesome TAs,I survived.Anyway, the stuff he taught you is extremely useful in you career as an architect",1
"Quizzes every week on questions pulled straight from the homework. Lectures are pointless, but TA sessions helped (Ferrante). I spent a ton of time in the MLC solving the HW problems over and over to prepare for quizzes/tests. Drops 2 quizzes if you attend the TA sessions, and a small bit of extra credit for homework grade. Tough class.",0
Explanations are unclear. Gives problems on tests that have not been covered in class.,0
"Not a good lecturer whatsoever, but an extremely easy class.",0
"Class was great. The lectures were all online 40+ page powerpoints in case you missed class &  were also your studyguides for the final. Cut his three hour class into two, which was a bonus. ",1
"Many people ended up dropping from this class for a number of reasons. Some of those reasons being very unclear grading criteria, as well as having an unreasonable way of grading many assignments, and just being very unpersonable and hard to approach.",0
"Hard teacher. Sister took this class, she did something to make him mad at her, when I took this class, he took it out on me!",0
"He deserves his name in Mentor Circle. He's such a great guy. Class attendance in MANDATORY - miss 3, automatic fail - but he's very understanding. Course material was very helpful applying/perfecting it in everyday life. Outside the class, he's very nice: gave great advice. Overall, take him!",1
"This is the second time I was forced into taken this professor. He is probably the hardest professor on campus to date. I have never had someone grade so harsh before. Paragraphs on paragraphs of explaining for every test and if you do not use his ""lingo/ notation"" you might as well accept nothing above a C-. Never take him",0
i was awful at the material in this class and handy made it easy to understand and works with you to help you figure it out. she is a sweetheart and even helps students she has no obligations to. you don't even have to have her for a class and she offers you help.,1
"Easy A /B+, but Prof Baum even stated that a lot of what he says isn't what we need to know, and he will ramble on about information that is not relevant. This creates an overload of information that is harder to process. He also doesn't explain anything well, if at all. Nice guy but arguably the worst professor I've had at GVSU, and I'm a junior.",0
"He is VERY smart and can lecture for hours without looking at his notes.If you are not an auditory learner, I would not sudgest this class. However, he is a VERY hard grader. But if you do the readings you should be successful.",1
Great professor! I wish I had more classes with him. I would take him again.,1
"Lectures are not organized. He starts from the end of chapter and finishes with beginning of it. Most of the time lectures are not helpful. Often when asked questions, he answers evasively and obscurely, so have to figure out things myself. Never gives specific examples which makes it super difficult to understand the concept.",0
He has an accent. He assignments homework which is not for a grade but instead to help you understand him. He will have quizzes every week so do the homework. He also sends a practice exam before each exam it is recommended you do it because the exams are just alike,1
"He is the best teacher in TRU, my major is business, but I had so much fun in this class!",1
"I love this guys class! He is generally upbeat, but he slips in (somewhat dark) humor when you least expect it, and it catches you off guard every time. There is quite a bit of writing to do, but not in the research sense  He gets you to study by having you write your notes several times. I would take his class a million times over.",1
very straight foward on tests. If you're  a cram studier you should fine she gives reviews for first 3 tests but 3 days at most before test. last test study all the power points it's a lot I think it was 10 chapters compared to 5 for other lecture tests. lab is easy if you do assignments make copies of it so you have material to study for it.,0
"He does not give specific directions and then deducts a bunch of points when you don't tell him EXACTLY what he wants, even though he didn't tell you. I'm an honors student, a month into the class, and I'm getting a C already. His lectures are unnecessary and not always correct, just read the book. Unable to properly critique/grade papers.",0
"If you're genuinely interested in what she has to teach, she is the best you'll get. It's definitely not an easy A, but you'll learn a lot from her so it's totally worth it.",1
If you can I would recommend taking this course with another professor. She is extremely disorganized and doesn't follow the syllabus because she is always making a bunch of changes to it. Then she doesn't tell us directly what these changes are til the last minute. If you take her class be ready to always be confused by what's going on.,0
This guy was absolutely the worst teacher I have ever had. That includes grade school and 2 colleges. He gave absolutely no feedback on anything. The lectures were only opinionated and story time for him. I never got back my midterm or either of the two book reports that I wrote for him. I have no idea how he got a job at ECU. Avoid him at all cost,0
Great professor. Interesting. Lots of work but it is an English class. Generous grader and gives you the option to rewrite papers to get better grades. I learned a lot from his class.No textbook used which was great (no money spent.) Uses examples from current times which makes the class more interesting. Gives you 3 absences before he docks points,1
"You HAVE to go to class, the extra credit and in class assignments are the only reason I passed. Hard tests but if you talk to her or the TA about some stuff they'll give you points back. Pretty big group project but it makes up a lot of your grade so that can be good or bad.",1
"Putnam was a decent professor, but if you don't like legal theory, pass on Just 401. Lectures were a bit dry, but it's a pretty easy class as long as you show up.  There are easy iclicker quizzes almost every class and his doesn't post powerpoints so if you don't go to class and refuse to read the book you're screwed.",1
took in the summer.3 tests. 5 essays. no classs on friday! He gives review with terms to know  before and gives the question and answer when you ask. I got an A.,1
The best teacher in UNCC Mrs Hubbard is very helpful and is super nice,1
He dropped me without any notice that I was failing. Didnt try to send me a email or tell me to come to office hours so we could talk about me increasing my grade.,0
"The first professor Ive ever rated 5 stars. I absolutely enjoyed myself in his class. Attendance is mandatory if you want an A and doing the homework will save your life on the quizzes. It took some effort to keep an A in his class, however, he really made learning the material exciting and hes always so willing to help. Favorite professor by far",1
Avoid at all costs. He pretends to want to help you and then destroys all your ideas because he doesn't understand them. Lectures are extremely boring and participation is worth 15%,0
"If you can get past the language barrier, this guy is great for DE.   His tests come straight from homework, he grades incredibly easy, and you can bring ""cheat sheets"" with you to the test.   Plus, he's a pretty cool guy.  Highly recommended.",1
I DO NOT recommend this professor.,0
"Terrific professor.She grades hard, but fairly.Very interested in her students doing well.The added benefit to taking her class is that if you learn the material,it can help you get a better grade in future classes that require any sort of essay writing.TOP RATE professor and I would definitely take her again.",1
"Great professor, if you put in effort you will pass. Pretty easy and straightforward. You have a final project which he gives u a month before notice. He helps you when u need it. He also has few assignments which are in class but you just have to follow his directions. Easy class overall if you put in even a little effort.",1
Brutal,0
"Great teacher!  My writing is horrible, but I learned a lot.  He is really able to put writing in to a formula that I can learn from.  He tells you exactly what he expects in your paper, so if you put in the work then you will get an A.",1
"She's a super-professor! Always willing to help regardless of the situation. Her lecture tests get progressively harder, but her lab exams are equally difficult (just have to learn a couple more items as the semester progresses.) Take advantage of the extra credit! The textbook is useful, but not required. In-class lectures are very helpful & cool!",1
Awesome guy- extremely friendly and happy. Material is HARD. I still don't understand half of the material and it's the last day. Don't take this class unless you are a neurologist or biology major. It's not a psychology course.,0
"Dr. Maida is a rock star; she knows her math inside and out, and is always accessible and willing to meet. Homework is assigned straight from the textbook, and up to 5 extra credit points can be earned by doing test corrections on exams. She is very inspirational, and explains difficult fundamental math concepts exceptionally well.",1
"I had a difficult time through her class. I study days for her tests and still only receives C. She requires hundreds of pages to be read for her tests. Thankfully, she gives you a good amount of writing assignments to help your grade.",1
"Weber was extremely intelligent. He knows a lot about geology and no doubt is qualified. But, he taught this introduction class like it was a level 400. Also, he is quite boring, so it's hard to pay attention. Overall, do not take this professor unless you really care about geology.",0
"I'm in professor Hartman's math class and all we do is get on the computer, on this website call Aleks and do work on there. There is so interaction with the class, no blackboard work or powerpoint and no text book. Please do not take this professor class you will be learn nothing at all.",0
He was a really nice and helpful prof. He gives you tests ahead of time so you can look over it and make sure you study the right stuff as there is a TON of material in this course. There are a lot of readings to be done. His lectures are interesting mainly because of his enthusiasm and passion for the topics.,1
"One of the absolute best professors I ever had. Runs rings around the ""tenured"" faculty. Professor Solari knows his subject matter, is able to engage students and makes the material very interesting. I learned a lot that changed my view of things from when I came into the class. You need to do the reading to get the most out of the class.",1
"Professor Sokchea is a very nice guy and knows a lot about economics. But this class was very difficult, his test were very hard and he wasn't very good at preparing us for the test. Also DO NOT forget to do a homework, you'll need those points.",0
Hands down best professor in the chemistry department at OU!,1
He is a nice guy but he doesn't understand how to teach. Just do the homework and take the tests he gives enough extra credit to save your grade.,0
"Her quizzes are difficult, her exams are impossible, and her explanations are generally not helpful.  She's always late to class and takes extremely long to return assignments.  Avoid.",0
"Yea, what the guy below said. Stay away from professor nemat. he's ignorant, and he doesn't care about students learning. Everybody literally cheated, and he doesn't even know it. Dumb old dude.",0
So Prof. Gillespie is an awesome professor. Always willing to help and his class is extremely clear. That being said cost accounting is an extremely hard subject . Even though Gillespie makes it clear make sure you practice! Finally make sure you do the HW problems because some exam questions maybe based on it!,1
"Please do not be fooled. He is average at best. I took him and his lectures are the blandest thing you will ever attend. Puts you to sleep every time. The only reason I kept going into class was for attendance points. # exams all consisted of learning 45-55 definitions, so if you can memorize it should be an easy A. He is not a good professor.",0
"Dr. ODonnel is a terrible teacher. She believes that everyone should ""bomb their quizzes because it will help them in the long run on the tests"" so she makes them impossible. I know people who attended all of her office hours and studios for extra help and she wouldn't even raise their grades 0.56% of a point so it would go up a half letter grade.",0
"There's a reason why this class was still available to add a day before school started! Constantly passive aggressive and will talk down on you. Semi easy, but it wasn't a fun semester at all. Creates a bad environment for writing stories. No talking to classmates, no music, no fun. If you like journalism, go somewhere else.",0
"Lectures are boring, tests are extremely hard. She gives homework a lot and gives extra credit with the homework, but tests are only out of 25 points with 2 bonus questions. She posts the notes on D2L and cancels class a lot.",0
"One of the best and most interesting professors at MDC, the lectures are amazing, the exams are not hard, but you must read the book, do the homework and attend class to understand the material. Would take him again !",1
This is my 3rd year of post secondary and he's by far my favourite prof! He really cares for his students and always willing to help. Everytime i visited his office it was like i was going to a friend for help. Hes a funny and nice guy to have a chat with. And he always you to redo 1 question after each exam! Got an A in the course,1
"Assigns a lot of homework, but it's all beneficial. Really prepares you for the social work career. Full of experience. Expects a lot of his students. A few tests from the text book and lecture, and then assignments are the rest of the grade. Their easy, just a lot of work. Take him! You'll learn a lot.",1
Must do assignment. Not allowed to go against her ideologies,0
"just stay at home, read the book, u will be fine",0
Tancredi is a great guy. He clearly knows his stuff very well and clearly loves sharing it with others. He is crystal clear on everything and isn't hard so long as you pay attention. He is easy to talk to and approach and will help you out with anything if you need it. Also an amazing musician. One of my favorite professors.,1
"Shes slow on grading, she doesnt put in all grades, she didnt put in my class midterm grade so no one knew where they stood, and the final grades were posted 3 weeks after the date they were suppose to come out. This was literally last semester FALL 2017.",0
"Jody is an not that good of a prof. She's very strict and not understanding at all. There are so many assignments and so much reading. You are expected to remember every single detail for every quiz. Be prepared to pull all-nighters for this class. I usually love/look forward to english, but it pained me to come to this class.",0
"Plays favorites. Doesn't explain anything. Gets annoyed if you screw up. One of the worst teachers I have ever had. If you are looking to enjoy graphic arts, find a different class with another teacher.",0
"This teacher is terrible.  He doesn't teach you how to write any type of essay but instead assigns mindless book exercises, and is a very harsh grader.  He is sexest against men, makes crude comments about sex and or ****rgraphy, and grades with a bias. Not a bad guy just a bad teacher.",0
"Worst professor I've had in MAE and gave a bad impression for what to expect from the department. Homeworks were extremely difficult with really tough math, office hours are treated like an extension of lecture such that if you can't make it to both, you're going to do poorly in the class. Exams unrelated to homework, super hard, worth 50% of grade",1
"Dewald was really boring but really easy....he doesnt use a textbook just literature...which you do not need to buy...incredibly easy, seems like a good guy, my TA was horrible though....easy A",1
Shes amazing!,1
"She started on topic A then jumped into B without satisfying questions or concerns of students.  Quite moody at times, rolled eyes when asked questions.  She was all over the place, scatterbrained.  Very confusing.  Did not give partial credit for answers on exam which were close but not on point. You either wrote what she wanted or you are wrong.",0
"VERY funny professor, makes everything super clear, and does a great job of relating the topics to his students. Great class!",1
"Boring professor that can even become vulgar at times. Add in that she's a tough grader, and she's one to avoid...",0
"He is a terrible professor. He treats you like you are in second grade, calls you out if you have your phone out, and grades you as if you're in an english class rather than a history class. If you do not cite your sources correctly or even put a comma where its supposed to go, he fails you. He was most likely a loser in high school and still is.",0
"My biggest regret was not attending his classes whatsoever after midterms, and I only did not attend because it was an 8am class. He is the sweetest, most optimistic guy! Probably one of the best teachers on campus. Get him if you can and you won't be disappointed!",1
"When I took his online class, I would have to email him 3 or 4 times before he would respond to me.  The class material is easy, but he is not helpful at all.",0
"He's the worst professor I've ever taken. Treats his lectures like its a performance, the TAs don't like him. If you have never taken a film criticism course DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Doesnt spend too much time teaching how to analyze films properly, so you will fail. Doesn't prepare you for any of the exams and you only watch old white people films.",0
"Mollie was super nice! Just take notes, show up to class and you're fine. She reviewed for tests and was very helpful!",1
"This professor is horrendous. I emailed him and messaged him through canvas multiple times and did not receive a single response throughout the entire quarter. Course load was ridiculous, spent at least 4 hours a day on this class to keep a 4.0. He would 100% be unemployed if his wife was not head of the Psychology department. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Its like the class sets you up to FAIL on the TESTS. The lecture material was VAGUE.  What was on the midterm asks for MORE DETAIL than what was lectured. A LOT wasnt even mentioned in the lecture PowerPoints at all! Class mean for the 2 quizzes & the midterm was a 68! Curves class at end, not each individual testquiz. Final is cumulative. ",0
"Three crucial tests, six quizzes, questions are too difficult. Make sure to solidify your attendance and don't skip any courses. Solid choice for a math professor. No trick questions on the test and the format of the questions are similar to the examples in class.",1
"Not helpful at all! Avoid this professor at all costs. When you ask her a question, she turns it around on you and then talks in circles and never really answers it. She's very rude and acts like she's better than everyone. She was not helpful with the research paper and offered hardly any feedback. The in class assignments were also useless.",0
"Milena is the worst Professor Ive ever had in my life, she always make to find the things in the books to give the students. Fired her!",0
"Awesome Prof. had issues submitting an assignment, and she didn't doc points for it being late. Very helpful in deciding on topic for research paper. She kept the discussion board alive with insightful questions. Would take other classes with her in a heart beat.",1
She is very good at keep the class engaged.,1
"HE was horrible, I hated his class, never returned assignments and made us to stupid random stuff, I will never take him again",0
"Dr. Hug is the BEST professor I have ever had. She is friendly, helpful and really interests you in the subject. She is always willing to help students when they need it. Her grading is fair, and while she is not an easy teacher, she is more than willing to help you succeed. I highly recommend.",1
"Love that teacher, however it was the hardest class I've ever taken. Lots of quizzes. Lots of tests. Grades really hard. And he expects students to memorize everything just as he has, but he doesn't take into account that this is only a level 1 class. Wouldn't take it agai. ",1
Do not take this class if you aren't passionate about music. She is an inexperienced professor who does not structure the class well for those who aren't familiar with musical concepts. Discussions aren't helpful for the quizzes and she doesn't post lecture slides. A lot of the people in my class agreed this class is too difficult to be a GE class.,0
Attend every class. There were 3 quizzes total instead of a midterm. As long as you do all your readings and follow the instructions she gives you for the paper you will definitely get an A. She also gives extra credit.,1
She is an easy professor with a thick accent. Runs through the powerpoints quickly and her test are timed online. Strict on attendance. Had to drop this professor because she would not let me miss class for a family matter. Was very rude to me and hard to contact her through email.,0
Good guy. Not a good GenEd teacher. Most of our meetings are 20 minutes of him ranting about unclear directions and hammering on the same points and the remaining 30 is a lecture that gets cut short and is filled with conjecture. The workload is unreal for a gened and the projects have strict guidelines/prompts yet are impossible to find on canvas.,0
"The work load for this class is very heavy including forum posts, quizzes, listening quizzes, and tests for it to be an elective class. Play close attention to due dates. He is a fair grader. If you stay on top of your assignments and due dates, you will be fine. He is going to make you work for an A!",0
10/10-- would recommend Gurung as a professor.,1
"He's a great professor, I absolutely loved his class! It's easy to get a good grade as long as you are willing to put in the effort! ",1
"Nice guy, but has a hard time communicating his knowledge.",0
"Ronda is a wonderful teacher, very highly recomended.  Although she can come across as a bit reserved in class, and have strong opinions on the right way to do things, she is always open to listening to others ideas (and often says she learns something new),and is always willing to help with projects.  Very inspirational teacher. Highly recommended",1
Just dont take her. I walked out of each test thinking I got an a ONLY TO SEE I GOT A C EACH TIME! She is terrible and vague. Lectures way too fast and doesn't seem like she cares since she only teaches this one class on this time slot.,0
"You will have to study hard to be successful in this class. A lot of material is covered, and every class period is utilized to the very last minute. Prof is very passionate about plants. Barely opened the textbook, you don't really need it, just use the lecture packet.",1
Professor White was very kind. Theres a lot of rewriting and extra things we had to do with each papers we had to write. First half of the class was always spent talking about things I personally found irrelevant. Gives minimal time to do peer editing which stinks because I found the peer edits to be very affective. Cant miss over 4 days.,0
GO TO CLASS. His tests are always straight from the lecture. I went to lecture and took notes and did no reading outside of class and got 100s on the tests it's so easy to get an A+ in his class. He also makes the lecture interesting so I actual enjoyed the class. Highly recommend him if you are willing to go to class.,1
I took this class online. Soooooo much work! I mean I get it it's college but we had 2 or more quizzes every week plus an assignment on top of that. Quizzes only worth 10 points of total grade. A lot of group work too. Would not take another class of hers,0
"Felt like he has a hard time with the online format. Confusing and not updated due dates for assignments. Responsive to questions. Very little feedback on exams, but this seems almost epidemic in online courses. Pleasant instructor I got the impression he cared. He should work harder on the online class preparation I think it would help him out.",0
"he is the man, always lets you turn things in late without killing your grade he teaches if you listen and ask question or even try you will have a good grade but don't take advantage of his lecture by not doing anything or saying anything else your know as one that's not trying",1
Professor gives a lot of assignments with poor and outdated examples. He does not give clearly instructions of what to do in assignments and he is a very tough professor. He makes access difficult to get maximum grades even if you understand his lectures.,0
"Be ready to write two hard papers. King is nice, but boring. Papers are difficult but tests are easy. READINGS and quizzes on them were the WORST. He doesnt use canvas and rarely is available. Class is not an easy A.",1
Jeff is awesome! You can tell that he really wants the students to succeed. Jeff was extremely helpful and responded to emails quickly. He was also really accommodating when we switched to online classes. The material can be tough and you'll have to spend a lot of time studying outside of class but Jeff does everything he can to help you do well.,1
"Not many positives here. No feedback that's worth anything. Due dates and actual content of assignments flipped about every time we had class. In fact, that's what the majority of our class time was spent on. Changing the assignments. Horrible grading criteria, no follow up. Fairly lazy, but expects you to follow the arbitrary deadlines he changed.",0
Unclear about class he's teaching & unorganized.,0
Judith was a playwright who steals ideas from her students.,0
Professor Connelly is an incredible professor and possibly one of the best professors at this school. He will make you work hard on papers but besides that he doesn't assign that much reading. Don't shy away from taking his class. He is really helpful if you go and see him outside of class and he knows so much about the topic. Strongly recommend.,1
She was super nice and friendly to start but then after a few weeks she became really strict and classes were boring and tiresome. Lots of information in the notes that if you don't get you won't do well on the tests. Do bad on the tests and quizzes and you are done for. Best of luck!,0
She has a good way of teaching that makes it easy to understand.,1
"It's calculus so no matter your prof you have to go to class and do hw in order to do well. Vainberg has an amazing grading scale (85-A, 72-B, 52-C). The study guides are pretty close to the test and there's weekly quizzes that are like the hw. He posts all the lectures in moodle and wants you to do well in class. Would take again",1
"Marek has a very successful engineering career and he has a very wide knowledge of the industry. But when it comes to teaching, HE IS TERRIBLE. He gives you general information about very specific stuff - and he expects you to know everything. His marking system is unstable and unfair. Lack of clarification is his the biggest problem. 3/10",0
She arbitrarily takes points off for small things that don't even affect the final answer. Very confusing and rude when students ask her questions she thinks they should know. It's tough material but she flies through it and doesn't help that much. She was also gone for a month and we had a sub and she didn't review what we all basically failed. ,0
"This man changed my life, he truly is on a much higher level of consciousness than most other people. If he someone finds him hard to understand it may well be because they are not developed as to what life is about. Dr. Lombardi has attained wisdom and an understanding of the true character of reality.",1
"She is beyond the nicest, greatest professor you could ask for!! Seriously-she is GREAT! I will try to take her every quarter. This next quarter will be my third with Margaret. You will love her, just make sure you actually read. If you read and do the easy journals and the many extra credit options...it's an easy A.",1
Melissa Logue is a true gem. She is a very kind and respectful professor. Is very good when it comes to responding to emails. Also is understanding that college students have lives as well. Her class is basically composed off homework quizzes and test. Which are all not difficult if you properly prepare.,1
lecture notes are confusing. easy calculation problems become very hard due to weak explanatory skills. She's experience and all with her field but she needs improvement in explaining topics in class.,0
I have had nothing but good interactions with this professor. As long as you participate in her class and do the work you'll pass.,1
"Class isn't too hard, but its definitely not easy either, and you still learn a lot",1
"Prof. Infante is a wonderful professor, very engaging and fun to listen to.  He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed.  Awesome teacher!",1
"I like the way he teaches but he is pretty hard and semi-strict, however I learned a lot and I would take him again",1
"Easy A. Quizzes, weekly discussions, 1 and 2 page papers every other week, and a final exam. Veerrry easy grader. Don't need the book. Discussions are majority of grade. Second time taking Dr. Larson",1
"She's rude and doesn't feel the need to xplain things because as she says ""we should know this stuff"". I did pass her class though.",0
"Great Teacher, would take again",1
"He was kinda of boring, but knowledgeable. Just a midterm, final, and discussion attendance determines your grade. You don't need the book since he has handouts. Hope you get a good TA, since they grade everything. He has a very very generous curve!",1
One of the best Biology teachers I've had at Truman! If you're a person who is able to learn from lectures and study from your notes the tests will be a piece of cake. She does get very specific into the material. Does a lot of multiple choice/True-False on tests. Expect weekly quizzes in lab- usually pretty easy.,1
"The professor seemed cool at first, but he doesn't care about opinions. He is hard to understand and his class was extremely disorganized. He struggles quite a bit with technology. He chose a book for the course that he blatantly conflicted all the time, making it hard to study. This course was much harder than it should have been.",0
"Professor Caramento, is very nice. He gives very good feedback when it comes to assignments. Would recommend his class if you are interested in African studies or if you need an elective. If you make the effort you will get a good grade in his class",1
"Exams are pretty easy, you have 3 they're online & all problems from the homework. The exam will only have 3-5 questions though and he does not give partial credit if you made a typo. But Wiley will give you partial credit if there are a few boxes you need to fill in. HW is optional and he goes over every single problem. Do homework for grade boot",1
I took this class in person but everything was an online setup. Extremely book heavy since all the assignments came from them. An easy A as long as you did the work and turned it in. Only go in if I needed help on an assignment. If you had trouble she would always try to help. Turn in dates were very flexible.,1
"Professor Gibbons was very hard to reach beyond class; she seemed to always have an excuse. Readings were a bit dense and lengthy, but were always discussed in class. On paper assignments she was a tough grader. When I finally meet with her to discuss the papers, she tore them apart and offered no constructive criticism. Would not recommend.",0
So sweet!,1
"You should engage in the class discussions!  It will help you understand the material better.  McKenzie likes students that are willing to speak up and converse.  Class is entertaining, especially this past semester.   Read the books, participate, show up for the quizzes and tests and take your group project seriously and you are gold!",1
"Dr. D is very friendly and caring. Her tests reflect the content well, and she incorporates lots of examples/related activities in the lectures. Very enthusiastic & quirky. But I also think she is a very average professor - not too extraordinary or mind-blowing.",1
"I cant believe I registered for this class without checking her rating. If you have a chemistry background already, you might be okay, but if not.... youre on your own. She does provide template notes to print out, but they dont explain things well. Quizzes and worksheets in discussion are difficult and easy to do awful on.",0
"Nicest guy you will ever meet but worst prof. Don't let his charm fool you! he has a strong social game that will make you like him and forget how bad a prof he is. Exam 100% textbook, his lecture is fun but 0% exam. Expect to work twice as hard for a grade that is half as good from a prof that does not know how to teach.  For your own good AVOID.",0
Dan was by far one of the hardest teachers ive ever had. he is not helpful and does not care about his students. he doesnt teach the class very well and doesnt make sure the class is understanding what he is saying. dont take him!!!!,0
"Took Hamilton for Math 246 Spring 2020 semester. His lectures are very fast and he rarely stops to take questions. If you miss one step it is impossible to catch up. It did not help when we switched to online classes because of the virus. Not sure how other professors are, but would not recommend his 246 class.",0
"This whole class is graded on 4 exams, case studies, and the final. Lectures are dry, heavy, and lengthy and she just reads through them. Definitely study the study guides she gives you and try to ace the case studies. She is really lenient with grades if she sees you putting in effort so actually show up to class!",1
"Best. Language Class. Ever. If you've heard that Chinese is super hard to learn and are worried about taking this class, don't be. Yue Laoshi is an amazing professor and you can really tell that she cares about teaching. If you're looking for an easy A, this isn't the class for you but if you want to learn Chinese, there isn't a better class.",1
"There are better ways to get humanities credits, it was a waste of time.",1
"I dont know what to say about this course... It was DECENT but her Case Analysis and Reflection papers were RIDICULOUS beyond disbelief! Also, not to mention the quizzes she gives are HARD, like who gives 25 minutes for 25 questions!!! You cant even refer to the book or anything because her exams and quizzes are done in lock down browser. She OK!",1
"This guy's lectures are crazy and sometimes not even pertaining to class but you always get something out of them. He doesn't make you go to class at all, or read but there are tests at midterm or finals",1
"compared to other prof provided for the course, take geveci!! You won't have to take notes if you have the book& bring it to class. tests are similar to the practice exam. do all the homework (only assigns it for half the semester). 3 exams, 1 final, 1 dropped exam. TRY to ace the FIRST exam& you won't stress that much for the rest of the semester.",0
She's alright,0
Horrible teacher! Don't know why csun hired this man! Gave us 2 midterms one we never got back to see our score! He then never graded our homework! His lectures he gets from another teacher and takes an 1:15 to do one problem! Sucks at calculus and screws up every problem he does! Your process may be right but he won't give you any partial credit,0
"Shes caring and all but if you're not good at math don't take her class. She teaches differently and is more advanced she told me to basically withdraw from the course since I wasn't understanding her way of teaching. She expects you to already know everything and move on to the next lesson after a week, also too much homework.",0
Professor Stevens is the best! If youre trying to take Math 80 look no further. She is super reasonable test grader and will always help you to get the most credit possible. Her lectures cover all the needed material and she hands out really good handouts that will help you study a lot. Homework is not that challenging and it is due every Sunday.,1
She at first makes you think that class will be easy saying there won't be any tests or quizzes.  you don't actually have to pay attention but even if you wanted to her lectures are all over the place and none of it makes any sense. if you want to actually learn you have to read the book. There are 3 lesson plans that she grades harshly!!!! ,0
Expect to put in the work!!! Witty humor lightens information packed lectures. Fair grading and respectful. Highly recommend purchasing an anatomy coloring book. Lab is by far the hardest part of this class and it is 1/3 of your grade so you better put in the time to get a decent grade.,1
"Dr. Creed is one of the best teachers on this campus. This class is hard and he makes you work for a good grade. But if you put in the effort and get on his good side, youll be golden.",1
"Sara is a very nice person at heart, but as a teacher I think it is hard to have her. Her grading system is very confusing and doesn't allow for students to keep track, and she makes the class very lecture heavy, which often leads to boredom from students. There is definitely a way to make the class more interesting. Wonderful person, not teacher.",0
"READING is a MUST! Don't wait til the last minute to cram stuff. No multiple choice tests, but essays, matchingidentification, maps, etc. Expect pop quizzes & short writing assignments. Read his instructions very carefully. No D2L slides, so take notes. Awesome teacher! Engaging. I learned a ton. I'd take another one of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
"I took intro to Journalism thinking it would be he basics in journalism, it was the farthest from that she acted like we already had a background in journalism which many of us did not, I endned up dropping the class. do not go into her class expecting to just learn the basics, and she is very particular on her editing, she critiques too much!",0
"Just give her salary she earns from this class to the textbook company because the only way to learn anything is outside of lectures. Horrible, boring teaching style and expects you to already know calculus when its not a pre requisite. Trust me do not take her class .",0
"Fantastic. Very good at explaining the material, and his enthusiasm for it is overwhelming and engaging. Fair amount of reading, but same as all HH104. Get him if you can.",1
"Avoid at all costs. Refused to answer students questions on designated exam review days, because he ""didnt know if the questions would work out"". Lectures last an average of 20 minutes",0
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
"If you don't show up to class, you won't do well on the exams or quizes. Will reexplain previous lecture next day before starting a new lecture. Homeworks are actually quizes & answers can be found in the book or lecture notes. She mixes her lectures on power point and whiteboard. 1 writing assignment based on case studies.",1
"By far, she is the most warm and welcoming professor I've had in college. She provides great feedback and excellent story telling when it comes to lectures. I couldn't imagine taking psychology classes with anyone else.",1
"She is a very nice prof, neat, organized and has very positive attitudes. Not really a tough grader but you need to show your efforts. She's very helpful inside & outside the class. Really glad that I spent a whole year with her.",1
"Awesome, caring, funny professor. Gives great feedback on papers that will help you pass, and he truly wants all students to succeed. Probably the most available professor I've ever had, he will always make time to sit down and help you. He is somewhat of a tough grader, in that he wants to see his students take their writing to the next level.",1
"Online classes beware- You can tell immediately that the online classes are neglected as he is too busy to be engaged. Emails were responded a week and a half later . Poor English and grammar, how is he a grad teacher? His criticism levels are unprofessional and unhelpful. One of the worst professors I've ever had in my academic career.",0
awful...seems nice in class but not helpful at all! NEVER responded to emails regarding my grade on a test. tests were so random and you had no idea what would be on there..awful!,0
"He's a very odd guy, but knows his stuff. I didn't open the book once and just took notes in class. Test questions are directly from the notes so pay attention. I got an A in the class. (:",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT MEMORIZATION !!!! there was so much to remember 200+ terms from the textbook, textbook chapters that are like no joke 40 pages long, plus lecture slides. Don't get me wrong he is a great person but his class was a bit unfair by just grading based on three tests without even having a study guide.",1
"This man looooves to waste trees and give the most amount of worksheets. In my opinion, this class is a very easy A, but the material on homework, quizzes, and tests is very inconsistent. He is very scatter-brained and all over the place with his explanations. He's funny and all, but I learned nothing about how to teach kids math",0
This was by far the hardest class I have taken. All of his work is close together. The good thing is he realizes that and works with you on the time frame. Be prepared to STUDY!!! He does not allow enough time for quizzes and exams and they are extremely difficult!,0
"Dr.Long is horrible! He reads from wikipedia print outs, and is unprepared. His TA should teach the class, since the TA does more work than him. He is horrible about returning papers,tests and quizzes. You compete for your grade w/ the rest of the class. He is really particular on quizzes and sometimes what is on them isnt in the book!",0
I had Ross for 152. I dropped his class because he was very rude and obnoxious. I do not recommend him. Stay away from this man.,0
"Such a sweet man. Only five, three page papers the whole semester. He is a very easy grader. Brought in a lot of inspirational guest speakers and got snacks once a week. Deep discussions and illustrated a lot of topics seen from different perspectives.",1
I would take his class again. He makes you interested in what he is teaching. Be prepared to write lots and lots of notes. Make sure when he tells his corny jokes to laugh and make it seem real. Even when they are not that funny. Overall he was a great teacher.,1
"Material unclear, readings extremely difficult, but he leaves room for you to make up bad grades.",0
SHE IS THE WORST PROFESSSSSSOR! A TOTAL YOU KNOW WHAT...AND I HEAR EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO GET HER FIRED...HOPE IT WORKS BECAUSE SHE IS TRULY HORRIBLE!,0
"Dr. Jones is by far the best English teacher I've ever had. She motivated me to write about a topic I truly care about, and was really supportive and gave great feedback throughout the semester.",1
"His lectures are really boring because he just reads straight from the slides, but the class is extremely easy!! don't listen to bad reviews on here. theres 3 quizzes that are straight from the textbook and 1 take home test. this class is an easy A!!",1
"Pretty easy class, funny, lectures not boring but are important.",1
Great teacher. She is super helpful and really cares about her students. It is a flipped classroom so you learn at home and do exercises in class.,1
"She is such a caring professor. I didn't have any confidence in my ability to write until I took her class. She not only took the time to work with me and help me with my writing, she made me truly believe I was a good writer! Great person, great class 10/10!!!",1
"Sheldon is a fun guy, but his PS101 class was huge and he recorded all of his lectures and put everything on blackboard so it wasn't necessary to come to class. Didn't like the huge class because you don't get the chance to have one on one with the professor. Additionally, the only thing you're graded on is the exams, which is tough.",1
I did not have a good experience with this professor. Her teaching methods are weak & she is not an understanding professor. If you can avoid taking her class please do.,0
"Dr. Boden is the only reason i use rate my professor from now on. taking his 100 level class was a great challenge and even though many hours were spent doing homework, lab reports, tests, quizzes, and taking notes i ended receiving a C for this class. never had participated in such a hard 100 level class, no extra credit avilable. not recommended!",0
"Fabulous professor. Truly caring, builds confidence in students, makes herself available after office hours CONSTANTLY. She encourages students to come for tutoring from her! She is amazing. Would take her again if she taught the courses I need.",1
I took this class online with Dr. Fitzpatrick and it was fairly easy. Her exams were easy and she has IBP assignments that require some reading but it's not too bad. She is very understanding and cares for her students. Just stick to reading and meeting deadlines and this class will be a breeze.,1
"Dr. Shartin is a very nice guy, but not a very good professor. He was very unorganized. The class was pretty difficult, because of the readings, and he did not help very much. The class wasn't impossible, but very frustrating.",0
"Her lectures are useless. She points at models and babbles off a whole list of anatomical terms leaving everyone confused. Her quizzes invoke anxiety because you have to answer 1 question in front of the whole class. The cadavers are cool, but she tricks you on the practicals. That makes her lab very hard to do well in, very frustrating.",0
"Anderson is great! He's always willing to help and makes class interesting. Latin is a tough language to learn but if you go to class and do the translations you will do fine. If you take Latin, take Anderson.",1
"Ms Young is great! If you struggle with math like I do, she is really helpful! She can talk too fast sometimes, but just let her know and she will slow down. If you need help, she responds to both texts and emails. She gives great feedback, and is very patient, which is great for someone who struggles with math like me.",1
not so great teacher.,0
"Best teacher I had at this school. Very helpful, always available if you need help. Great advice for transfer students. Funny and easy-going but knows when you're bsing his work so don't! Makes class fun and willing to listen to suggestions for future material. Ran out of classes to take with him but wish I hadn't!",1
Professor Heyrman is such an amazing professor. She cares about her students and makes US History so much more interesting. She engages the class by reading about 5 or 6 novels and not a boring textbook. She also understands that we are going through alot and makes the class college-leveled but as easy as possible for you to pass. YOU MUST TAKE HER,1
tough,0
"Im not sure what all the negative feedback is for? Easy class. 4 exams and a final and they are all open book. For someone who is not math oriented, I did fine in the course!! I would not recommending skipping class EVER. The notes are very valuable and hard to understand if he is not explaining them directly to you.",1
"Very good professor. Her slides are good. Lectures are enjoyable, clear and to the point. 4 written HWs and 1 CPU scheduling algorithm programming assignment, all are which were very manageable. Before the class, I thought 143A was gonna be one of the hardest class but turned out to be a very fun class. 100% would recommend this professor.",1
"I took her grad class at Penn State. I am a prof now, and never forgot what I learned from her--both in course substance and in being a passionate educator. You will work and you will learn.",1
"Classes were OK and informative.  Professor's delivery was fine.  However, students with less knowledge about programming and theory might find the classes difficult.",1
"I hate giving speeches, but this teacher made it very simple & easy going. Most laid back classroom atmosphere ever. One of the best teachers I've had.",1
"Books: Originals by Adam Grant was fine, Lean Start-up book was so so and hard to read, ditch it quick.",1
"He was awful, the class is so boring, he has minimal notes on the screen during lectures, I studied for 11 hours for his exams to get C's. Office hours are so inconvenient and he has no interest in helping, do not take this class with him.",0
Professor Hersh makes things extremely unclear. It is impossible to know exactly what she wants from you unless you ask (the syllabus is impossible to comprehend) and even then the guidelines are hard to understand. Several essays and three assignments in which you must watch movies at home and answer study guide questions. Nothing is on canvas. The syllabus is more strict than she is. I've never done more unnecessary reading in my life.,0
"Clear about what he wants from his students but its alot. Way too many quizes that require meticulous reading of 20+ page almost every week. 2-3 essay assignments each semester on top of that and lots of memorization (ALL of the quiz answers, plus notes) for exams. Too much for a core class even though he lectures well.",0
"I took online, had he is VERY hard to reach by email, he'd take more than a week and a half to respond; sometimes the thing I needed from him was already passed. 4 quizzes,2 exams, 5 discussion boards, and 8-10 page paper. There is an extra credit class on a Saturday; just go it is super chill. QUIZZES ARE HARD, READ BOOK!!!",1
"Easily the best Econ teacher I have had at UD. He makes funny jokes throughout class and enjoys teaching. His tests are very similar to the practice tests, he does pass an attendence sheet around so you should go to class. there are homework assignments every class, but are very simple and checked for completeness. overall great guy!",1
"He's a great professor. Not afraid to contradict you in class, so you'd better have tough skin!",1
"For being an online professor, Kenneth Smith is amazing at helping teach the material. In the programming class, he is very skilled at deciphering my code, and being able to tell what my bugs are, and give me very helpful and easy to understand feedback. If my major was computer science, I would definitely look for his name again on my class list!!",1
"Seemingly teaches the high level ones assuming you already know the material. She'll explain things infrequently and jump around so that retaining what you learned is impossible. Also cancelled classes excessively and solved problems incorrectly on the board, stopping to correct herself after you've written everything down. I don't recommend her.",0
"She is a wonderful professor and human being. She sees her students as her grandchildren and gives everyone a chance at learning Russian. She understands it's hard and always lifts us up if we don't do well. Your final grade is determined by homework completion and your final, so don't fear your grades throughout the semester, just improve.",1
"To be honest, I really don't think this is that bad of a class but the work load is intense. What makes it worse is he expects a lot on the papers so the class average is always around a B. We get a lot of projects to do and around five quizzes. If you do the work and try, you'll get a B. I think there's 1 or 2 in the class with an A-",0
"As a teacher, he is actually really bad. He does things like pick favorites, which makes everyone outside his ""Circle of Trust"" feel really bad. He also has no clear grading criteria and expects you to come up with not only a useful web app, but useful in his eyes (he has a very peculiar judgement).He doesn't even teach ANYTHING in class!",0
"Horrible teacher, makes you feel small, rude, treats you like a child. Would never recommend him. Makes you think and ask questions but never truly answers you, he just asks other classmates what they think.",0
"Monotone voice, gives long lectures before and at the end of class. Talked all class period once and then made the class stay after to draw. Gives a lot of homework assignments, and rarely gives A's.",0
"adult student class. come to participate and you will learn. sit on your hands you will complain, its that simple with this guy. I hope they give him another class, I'd take it.",1
"pretty easy, can find a lot of material online.",1
"Well, I'm probably going to get a C in what SHOULD be the easiest class of the English Dept. I think my soul is slowly being killed",0
I actually really liked this professor. PAY ATTENTION TO ONLINE HOMEWORK AND SLIDES FROM LECTURE WHEN STUDYING FOR TESTS!,1
Horrible Instructor. Does not communicate whatsoever. Pretty much getting paid for setting up blackboard & leaves you on you own afterwards.,0
"She is a very good and easy teacher. If you do  your homework assignments in a timely manner, it's a must ""A"" class.",1
Doesnt teach Bad,0
Literally the WORST teacher I have at the moment. Find someone who will actually teach you and help you.,0
"Dr. Mac makes classes fun. Hes a ""I don't give a crap"" teacher. That however can turn bad. His tests are SUPER HARD! It very easy to fail and fall behind in his class. The only extra credit is Socrates contest and that it. Don't ask him for any. ",1
"Great teacher! not great at math so scared going into this class but she has group cw, after the lecture, which makes it easier to comprehend so your not all alone. GO TO THE TUTORING SESSIONS she mentions bc they are exactly like the test (the only reason I got higher than a C). hw heavy but doable! grades attendance by cw so don't leave early",1
"Very good. Provided a lot of real life examples. It was very helpful. But I was in a large class, and hence it is little difficult to participate, otherwise good.",1
"Dr. Meadows treats this course like its a 400 level class. She also happens to be very rude, as others have commented on here. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Please let me know why this guy has such great reviews. Honestly. Only reason I took it read because of the reviews saying take him, youll pass yeah No. he doesnt care about whether you pass or fail. I attended almost every single class and did everything I was supposed to. He is so boring and dry. Acts like tests will be easy and theyre not.",0
"I took a hybrid class, and not once did I learn any information from her in class or through her lectures. She posts documents online, expects you to complete them before class, and then does not teach you the information. She's a horrible. Always has unclear directions and no guidelines for you. These other reviewers must have had a diff professor",0
"Worst teacher without a word of a lie l. Barely passed the course (usually As). He makes you look like an idiot when you get questions wrong and simply doesnt do well at explaining concepts. If he had his way he would fail everyone, he said 90% on success rate on a midterm question was too high so he would make it harder next time. AVOID HIM!!!",0
"This guy is hilarious!  I really enjoyed taking such an off-the-wall course with such an off-the-wall guy.  His final exam made my hand fall off due to so much writing, but if you stay up on the reading and participate in group discussions, you'll do fine.",1
"He has good personality and is willing to help you. However, he did not prepare IFRS material and is VERY disorganized. Sometimes he teaches IFRS and yet sometimes it's GAAP..extremely confusing. Does not show effort in making complex material easier to understand. I did not learn much from his 321..might have to redo.. NOT RECOMMENDED for 321",0
"As a person, she is very kind. She's probably a great PT. However, as a professor, I didn't find her lectures helpful (basic overview of anatomy class) and her online materials were not up to date. She used to boast about professionalism and she had moments were she didn't display that quality. The textbook helped and the notes from her PowerPoint.",0
Really enjoyable class. He always makes jokes and keeps you engaged. The class itself was a bit dry but he does a really good job making the best of it . 10/10 recommend,1
"Prof. Rodgers is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic when it comes to biology. The subject matter is tough, but she's very detailed and always willing to answer questions during class. She's a lovely person who cares about her students, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from her.",1
She has a weird grading criteria in which she gives a cumulative final and if you dont pass that even if you have a good standing grade she will fail you. She is awful at explaining and she even puts things on midterms that werent on her study guides and arrogantly tells you she knows it wasnt on there but you can atleast try for partial credit.,0
"Sobie basically just takes the entire book, writes every word onto a powerpoint and says good luck. His powerpoints cover way too much unnecessary material so theyre useless, exam reviews are 200 qs, but the exams are only 85. The exams are all too close to eachother to learn that much!! He also grades vaguely!! Do not reccommend!",0
great professor! Her lectures are really straightforward and more interactive with students. She explains chemistry in way that you can actually understand whats going on. Her midterms and finals are based on the concepts learned in lectures/practice exams. Lecture is not mandatory but her discussions are. favorite chem professor!,1
"At first, Bellamy seems awful. Discrete is a pretty tough subject and he is unorganized as can be. He writes out long boring proofs that you can pretty much space out and ignore a lot of the time. However, even though his grading scales seem super weird, if you put in a decent amount of effort in it is actually fairly easy to get an A. ",0
"Stephen is a nice prof who always tries to lighten up your day with a few jokes. His slides are simple and contain all the information you will be tested on. He recites them in class with more detail. The exams are straightforward and consist of MC, and written short and long answer questions. Make sure to study precisely and good luck everyone!!",1
"Extremely rude, unwilling to help when extra information is needed. Likely to tell you ""look it up"" or ""you should've known"" when asking a question.",0
Professor Fitzpatrick was such an amazing professor. She is willingly to help on any essay she has assigned and is very concise with her comments on essays. She encourages her students to do well and is very passionate about the subject she teaches. I would love to take more of her classes.,1
"He is very rude and has no consideration for student success. If a student does not do something the exact way he vaguely tells them to do it, he will become very upset and refuse to help them. He does NOT teach anything. All he does is talk down to students thinks heâ??s all mighty and great. Awful â??teacherâ??â?¦if you would even call him that.",0
"This was a good class& teacher but she had that tough,scary act at times that made you want to do all your work. She was pretty helpful but it was also pulling teeth when it came to written assignments. She always said something needed to be change, nothing was ever perfect. & she said she never gave extra credit which i thought was kinda wrong.",1
"Dr. Hollist is a very nice man and is genuinely a funny guy. Yet, he is an extremely hard grader and does not make any assignments clear. There are three main papers and two big presentations. Do not take him.",0
"By far the best professor I've ever had. Keeps long lectures interesting and fun. Only 3 tests including the final which can seem scary but his notes stay in your head so it's pretty easy to study for them. Need 2 textbooks but they're worth the pain. Easy A if you pay attention, even if you're not interested in the subject. Will take him again!",1
"Good teacher. The notes you take in class are exactly what you need to know for all exams. Pretty straight forward, just study the material and you will be fine. She is also very helpful.",1
"As a freshman, I was scared for public speaking but she makes this class so interesting and fun!! The one thing I liked is that she makes you do only one essay which is very easy! The speeches go by fast, so don't let that stop you, and there is only a bit of them.",1
odd. and looks like clint eastwood.,0
"This course was very interesting and Dr. Flannery gave a ton of resources for it. There was a lot of work for a one credit hour, week long course, but some days were lighter than others and I was able to work ahead so that the final day wasn't so jam packed. There is a paper and a final for this class but it was not outrageously hard.",1
Racist towards asians. Ruining people's dream.,0
"she does not teach much on grammar, but she teach you a lot on your oral and let you practice on each class. go to her class if you would like to practice your oral, or avoid her if you want to learn more about grammar. moreover, her exam is more about listening in grammar test, but oral exam is easy",0
"There is without a doubt more expectations on the students in his 211 class than in other classes. He makes you think- a lot, but somehow everyone always makes it out with a good grade. The more involved the class is in discussion, the easier and more enjoyable the class is. It's NOT difficult as long as you put forth some effort. ",0
Always be prepared to speak in class- participation is huge! Tests are clear cut- if you paid attention in class and read the material you'll do well. Keep up on homework- there's not too much of it! ,1
"yells waaaay too much, and the class is wicked hard.  The worst psych class I have ever taken, and it's one of my majors.",0
Hes very good at explaining the work and give you a fair amount of time to get things done.,1
Exam is very hard. NO practice questions or notes to prepare for the test. ,1
"Prof. Allen is a cool guy, answers any questions, knows what he's talking about.  He does move a little fast at times, it helps if you have a background in Excel, Powerpoint, etc.  Overall, nice guy, helpful professor.  Take this class.",1
She's not that bad but she is not the best professor. She was sick for a week and made us write a paper for attendance credit. She also had to remove 9 questions for our last exam taking away 18 points from us and just put one extra credit question to make up for it. She does not give any extra credit and wont budge on it.,0
"Rodgers really cares about his students but his lectures are extremely confusing. He does reverse lecturing where the lectures are online and you do examples in class. Lab is fun but it is nearly impossible to get As on any lab reports, especially the formal ones. The tests are also kinda hard as well. Also, expect in class quizzes regularly.",0
"Way to much work, its a Gen Ed class and he treats it like a senior level philosophy class. He told us all we needed to do was the reading and i still did bad on the exams even though i read all the material. he gave me no helpful advice on how I could improve. I had to drop because I was putting off my other 4 classes just to get Ds on his exams.",0
"teacher is not clear with material, very broad but quiz questions are very specific and built to trick you. They suggest to log into the VOH sessions but they are useless and do not provide any important information. The reading material is extremely heavy for a 200 level  elective course. I strongly do not recommend this class.",0
"Yes, she's a great human being, but she's arguable the worst professor. She does not stick to the syllabus at all and is the most subjective grader there is. She doesn't allow for any creativity because it goes against her beliefs which I think is counterintuitive to an ethnic studies course. Almost impossible to get an A in unless you are her BFF.",0
"While she is a nice lady and she does seem like she has the best interests in her students her class is way too hard. Speaking from a non-science major who was forced to be in the class for other reasons, she makes her quizzes impossibly hard, tests are not easy as she claims them to be. Overall don't take her. GPA will suffer.",0
"Get ready to teach yourself. She gets off topic ALOT and does NOT teach what will be on exams. The only hope you will have to pass is to go to SI sessions. The SI leader will teach more than Walling. She treats the class like kids, ex: congratulates us over knowing what H2O is and such. She is very nice, just not great at teaching.",0
His exams are super hard and gives extra credit but its not enough. Rewatch lectures multiple times to pass,0
Shes cool and caring i give her an A,1
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
"Tidwell really knows her stuff but she has some trouble teaching it. She stands at the front and reads from the PPs for class. You have to have a quick hand for she doesnt put anything on Canvas because she wants to make sure everyone shows up. She grades attendance every single day, too. This info is really interesting but she made it boring.",1
Professor Ladon was not a terrible professor but she was a little disorganized. She was not great at answering questions when asked and she was a little passive-aggressive. I suggest you study every chance you get and complete all the practices!,1
"Very hard course. There is only a few grades, so if you do poorly on one, it really can hurt your grade. Wish we would have spent more than a few weeks going over theories, since the exam material is 50% of your grade. Class time is mostly discussion. Be sure to read rubric for group project!",0
"DMD is such a gem. She comes off as vaguely terrifying in the first couple weeks of class but she is so supportive of all of her students and is very passionate about what she is teaching you. This class is so rewarding and I would highly recommend it, but make sure you're ready to put in the work (writing, revising and visiting her office hours).",1
"Before taking her class I looked on here and she had a good rating but now It's lowered I can see why since I'm in the class and it's terrible, she's such a hard grader and doesn't explain work well I'm always confused, and I didn't find out my grade till the end of the semester, now I know who not to take for enc1102.",0
I enjoyed the class and felt there was valuable content I can use in the future. She gave multiple examples and told personal stories which made it very relatable. I wish we had more guest speakers though.,1
"Very nice teacher, good class, you can't skip that many classes,it affects grade",1
"It's a hard class in general. Of all the professors that teach it she is one of the better ones. She seems really strict at first, but only because she cares about students knowing the information and entering the world as prepared as possible and she loosens up as you get to know her. If you are actually looking to learn in college I recommend her",1
"He only sticks to what the book says, so if you have a question, he cannot answer it. It is like he is deficient in his own teaching matter. He messes up a lot and rarely notices until someone calls him out for it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",0
"Very hard class. Always got good grades until I took this class. Jumps right into high intellect teaching. Near to impossible to pass. Study guide had over 130 questions, which were hard to study for being that we get it a week before the test. Very very tough grader and tough class. Would not recommend.",0
"Chrissy is one of the absolute best professors at SDSU. Her class, Human Sexuality and Disease was also the most interesting class I have taken and I am in my 3rd year here at State. Cannot recommend her enough, seriously take this class if it counts or even just as a GPA booster! You won't regret it.",1
"I took this class as an elective, but it has probably been my favorite class that I have taken at ECU. The things that Dr. Knox teaches are important life lessons so you actually want to pay attention. He gives out study questions before each exam, complete those and you'll ace the exams!",1
I've learned alot from him with his real world experience. Never a dull moment in his class. Only wish I could of had a chance to work with him.,1
"Everything week to week was the same so you can always know what to expect. Lots of reading but the work is easy if you actually do it.  The instructor however was not understanding at all. I had a few sudden unexpected things happen in my life (newborn in NICU, step-father died ) and he had no leniency and wouldn't even offer me a few extra days.",1
"he is really a great professor, he explains things in such a way that you just understand it so well.  I really wish he could teach all of my math courses and i certainly encourage anyone to take his class.",1
"Professor Kathleen is an awesome artist and instructor. She cares about her students, very understanding, and takes every chance to give better instruction or clarification. She not only teaches how to draw, but also the thought process as you draw. Highly recommended.",1
"This class is a lot of reading material. If you don't read the entire chapter before attending lecture you will be very confused. I also think she relies too much on her pass sessions to explain information, and goes quickly in the actual class. There is a lot of outside work in this class. Her tests are almost impossible.",0
"Coffey is a nice guy but he was not made to be a teacher. He rambles on and on, confuses himself, and rarely has a point. With two weeks in the semester, I have yet to learn a single thing. He has no idea how to explain what he's teaching and he'll explain the same topic four completely different ways. Do not take this professor.",0
He shows up about 5 minutes late everyday.,0
Aren is really helpful and always makes lectures interesting. The topic changes each week which keeps the class moving and prevents you from being bored,1
She takes 20 points off for citation errors. So the max you can get is a B- and no revision opportunities. Awful,0
Great professor with an interesting outlook even if you don't agree with everything he says,1
"Prof. Sun is not a great teacher but he leans towards the better side of profs  when compared to others in the department.  He gives many pop quizzes in the class that can come at any time, but even if you do bad on the quizzes you can still ace the class by doing well on the final.  Do the hw cause that's the best way to learn the material.",1
"I checked his ratings here before taking the class, I still took the class. It  this was one of the best classes I have taken at Cal State LA. Cervantes is a very knowledgeable professor he expects students to do their work. Take it, he'll teach stuff you can make easy money off, if you work and pay attention of course.",1
"The class I took with her was essentially self-taught. She was only present to post and grade assignments and gave no input of her own regarding the lessons. Gives an unreasonable amount of work, deducts points for petty things, and is generally just absent as a professor. I learned nothing from her; all knowledge came from the assigned textbooks.",0
"Interesting and engaging professor, as long as you do what is asked of you, you will pass. Some classmates and I actually dual enrolled specifically to take another class with him before we graduated. 10/10 would learn from again.",1
Professor Betanzos is amazing! Take her!! She is very caring and is very straight forward. I would take her again if I could. There are three essays but she is a good grader and is not too hard. The tests do not count that much and it is really easy to get an A.,1
"I think a lot of people misread her because they don't put forth the effort to really pay attention and talk to her. She can be confusing and unclear (more so in the Research class) but seriously she has been one of the kindest, most inspirational and helpful teachers I've had here. And trust me, she's a good teacher to have on your side!!",1
"Take Harris!  He is so nice and tests are generally pretty easy--he always tells you exactly what is on them so if you don't study that is your fault.  Not an extremely easy A, you need to put some effort in but a little will go a long way.",1
"Professor Cooper is boring, his lectures are straight from the textbook and expects you to read it multiple times and to put his class before any of your other ones. I went to get help and he made everything worse. Avoid him if possible.",0
"Class was boring. He makes you participate for a grade, even though he does most of the talking during discussions. He talks down to students, which is annoying. Fiction writing is meant to be fun, but he sucked the life out of it.",0
"I recommend taking a different prof. Dunn expects you to read his mind when it comes to his short answer questions, and his multiple choice are very poorly written and confusing. His lectures do not follow a structure and induce slumber. He's passionate about it and cares about us, but he's arrogant, like he needs to prove something to himself.",0
He tends to get lost in his teachings. You have to basically teach yourself calculus without the professors help in order to pass this class.,0
"Love this professor! Dr Ferreira is smart, funny and gives great feedback. She wants students to succeed, and explains all literature and assignments in great detail to make sure it's understandable.",1
boring! she has a formula and never deviates from it.,1
Terrible professor. Has an awful way of teaching that makes it impossible to do his homework. The homework he gives absolutely does not relate to his lectures. would not recommend taking any of his classes.,0
"I am not good at English, and I got an A.  He is lenient with grading, no tests, just responses from stories in the textbook and essays.  The final is take-home.  Great class,  I'm a better writer because of this class.",1
"Perkins is an awesome professor. I thought theology was going to SUCK, but I loved most of the readings. We watched movies and played video games as part of the class. Discussion-based class - there were only a couple of times we had lectures with notes. Very tough grader, but the class and his chill personality made it worth it.",1
I really enjoyed her class and we always had very interesting class discussions.,1
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
I am so glad I had this professor. There were not really any proofs and he taught what would be on the test and explains well. Most of the grade was based on 2 midterms and a final but both allowed notes and were the easier of the questions. If you understand the quest hw then you'll be fine. Office hrs are super helpful. The textbook is optional,1
"He is completely crazy. Avoid him if you can. You can get a good grade, but he totally sucks. He is loony, stupid, and an absolutely pathetic teacher. :-(",0
Josh Loar does not accept late work without a Doctors note submitted through the deans office. He was of no help when I added the class late and asked for a syllabus or explanation. He told me to check canvas and go away. He talks a big game about how he used to work in the industry but is of no help when it comes to explaining class related topics,0
Mi-Sook is a fantastic professor who gives great feedback and cares a great deal about her students. I have developed so many new skills in this class! Do not be late or turn in assignments late and you will succeed. I would definitely take a class with her again.,1
"I'm a Bio major that has to take a lot of science classes, but I chose to opt out of a lot of them for her classes, which shows she's worth it. She does give a good amount of papers, but if you go to her office hours, she proof reads them an unlimited amount of times. Her exams and quizzes are easy, so long as you take minimal notes. Show you care.",1
"Come on time, work hard, learn.",1
she's so nice and the class is relatively easy,1
"Super easy class if you take her. She is very understanding, quizzes are online and super easy, she makes study guides and reviews for each exam which helps a ton. Basically, an easy A but you gotta show up for in-class assignments",1
"If you want to get the easiest A in your life, you may as well leave immediately and  find a different professor.  If you want to be challenged and learn things about investments and businesses that will be applicable later in life this is your man.  If you put in real effort you can pass.  My advice, read the chapter before class so it makes sence",1
"Professor Light was a great teacher, and made his grading criteria pretty clear for the most part. A lot of the class just consisted of him talking, which got boring at times, but it was also interesting at other times. I do recommend taking his class though! I'm taking his class again for HS 250 as well",1
"ok, word of advice, study the powerpoint presentation, pretty much all of the exam comes from that.  this guy is awsome and has a lot of passion for jour. plus field trips! who can complain?!?!",1
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
thanks for being a great teacher.,1
Terrible instructor Even terrible instructions. She never announced any PowerPoint project until the day before the submission. Assigns half/incomplete readings and expects you to answer in class Ughhh nightmare ,0
"Dr. Doonan is a great professor and his lectures are amazing, he grades on participation so if you are a wallflower it might be time to blossom. He cares about his students and will try to help if you are struggling. Be ready to take notes, not miss class and read the online textbook.",1
DR. Swank is a very sweet lady. She likes to talk a lot and sometimes her feedback can be wishy washy. Lots of projects and extra time you will have put in the studio for your models and portfolios.,1
This class is the reason why I am a better writer than I was in high school. Tom cares so much about his students and truly wants them to succeed. This is by far one of the hardest classes I have ever taken but I wouldn't have wanted to take it with anyone else.,1
"Its a Math class, so theres lots of homework. thats just part of the deal. But she teaches in a very clear, easy to understand way, and gets things graded fairly quickly. I really enjoyed the class and i would love to take more of her courses.",1
"She is an fantastic professor! She makes you laugh, she wants you to pass (only if you do the work). There is no midterm or final exam, no quizzes, but you have to do a research paper about a controversial topic of your choice and you have to do weekly assignments about it. The class is really easy if you choose a topic you are interested in. ",1
"omph! what a difficult class. I'm so glad it's over! But also glad I took from HIM. comprehensive. willing to start from where other teachers left off to make sure you truly understand what you need to know before you graduate. would highly recommend, but pull up your bootstraps and expect to earn the grade you receive.",1
"A rude professor who does have interesting material to cover, but does a poor job doing so. He is extremely harsh if no one in the class understands a certain photograph or piece of art that he displays on the screen. His grading is extremely hard especially the papers and midterms. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
"This is an English class, having to write many papers should not come as a surprise. Lisa is absolutely wonderful. She's so helpful, lenient, and understanding. Papers were very reasonable and of course she wants you to work hard on them but she isn't a super tough grader. There used to be a 12 pg final but instead she added one more 4-7pg essay.",1
"Stay away from McConnell. His classes are dry, his voice monotone, and his readings tedious. There is not too much work and he is an easy grader, however it's still not worth it. He's v vague in his assignment descriptions and seems to grade many papers without reading them. Even films did not make this class any more enjoyable.",0
"He is perfect in every way, shape, and form. I love you.",1
"Her instructions for assignments are very unclear and then she blames the students for not doing assignments exactly to the letter. Posts the directions to an assignment in several places, all slightly different making it difficult to understand what is expected. She does not make the subject matter interesting at all.",0
Graded 1 thing the entire semester. Had no idea what was happening half the time. The student helper consistently taught labs better than Kotman,0
"Can be very temperamental in class. Not clear in his instructions or essay prompts, which causes confusion. I would not take another one of his classes. ",0
"So, I thought it was me, but after speaking with other students in the class, there was a consensus that he isn't very friendly and cold.  His lectures didn't help me at all so I studied on my own which was better use of my time.  Take him if it's the last resort.  But he clearly doesn't like students.  In office hours, he'd come off as a jerk...",0
"WOW. i literally met with her everyday after class, went to the writing center- and spent atleast 5 hours weekly studying for her class, Still got a C. She is ridiculous- and expects you to answer exactly the way she wants- or no points. Deflates grades- highest grade in the class was a b-. this is NOT ok",0
"You can tell that she has good intentions, but she simply does not teach the subject well. If you don't go into this class with a very thorough background in Chemistry, you're not going to have a fun time.",0
"Easiest CGS2100, I'm not sure he even looks over the assignments and gives everyone an A. Took it online but still very accessible.",1
"Way too text book oriented, not up to date with current trends his knowledge begins and ends with two examples: coca-cola, and Toys-r-us. participation based on arbitrary facts like if you check your email in class, how professional you are, etc. has pop quizzes like elementary school.PHD in consumer behavior so he scrutinizes little details .enjoy",0
"An absolute DULLARD, 0 lecturing ability: why are you a Professor? You ruin an interesting topic. Unbelievable",0
"Dr. Thomson is the best! He is very nice and is very lenient in his grading. His essays are more about what you think rather than what he thinks. His lectures are also interesting and he loves when the class is involved in discussions. The exams aren't hard at all as long as you know what's going on. Very, very, very highly recommended!",1
"Attempted to fail me for wearing a hoodie during the final exam. If she thinks you are cheating even slightly she will do everything in her power to fail you, despite you not cheating.",0
"Prof. Barron is an amazing teacher, she makes lectures fun. Make sure you do the reading and always be prepared, especially on the note cases. She jumps around a lot but ultimately prepares you for the final with what she wants. Short, sweet, to the point answers. Make sure to take notes about everything she says, buzzwords are key.",1
"Dr.Grammy is the best Professor at SCUB, easy to understand and very helpful. I took  econ 420, 451 and 410 with him and got A's",1
"Very helpful, made math easier to understand. As long as time is logged on the Aleks program attendance to class everyday is not nessecary",1
"He is so enthusiastic about Shakespeare, and utterly brilliant!  As an actor, he adds extra excitement to the readings whenever he quotes the readings, making class time fly by. He's a genius.  The best at Marymount, (and NYU is lucky to have him too!)",1
Full of himself.,0
"Not going to lie, this class had a lot of busy work. There are usually about 4 things due every single week, but I really enjoyed her class! Dr. Mark really loves HRD and it shows. I learned so much in her class, and she gives you really good feedback on each assignment.",1
Not bad. Very enthusiastic about her work. Does not take criticism well. Tests are not hard. Takes marks off of assignments for no particular reason. A new lecturer that still has room for improvement.,1
"Class is 90% exam grades. Exams of which are incredibly difficult and almost impossible to do well on. This class wasn't even for my major, and I think I speak for most when I say anything remotely interesting that I could've learned in this course was ruined by her terrible teaching style. This class is such a disappointment because of this prof",0
One of the best teachers I have ever had.  He makes the material understandable and does not talk down to his students.  He could have easily been a prick and made the tests hard but seemed to be more concerned with the students actually learning the information.,1
Shes DOES NOT put grades online at all. She said she isnt going to.. maybe once we switch to canvas. Do the quizzes before the tests to get an A,1
"Dr. Alali is a great professor. He makes sure that everyone is able to understand his lectures, and with the help of his PowerPoint slides for notes it was hard to fail. There are a couple of papers, and just a couple of tests. Attend class, take notes, and you will be fine. ",1
Professor Khan is a great teacher. She gives writing assignments that are not difficult to do and many of them are interesting. Tons of group work and opportunities for extra credit. She is caring and understanding and brings goodies (snacks) to class. Do well and keep up with assignments and you'll get an easy A. I would definitely take her again.,1
"Great professor.  Her lectures presented things in a logical and meaningful way.  Also, she's concerned with the progress of each student.  After each paper she had individual conferences.  Very helpful.  Excellent class.",1
easy topics... but her MC tests are evil? why is everyone doing crappy in the class?,1
"The only things Alali gives out in class are quizzes and exams. He lectures every class and it gets boring throughout the semester. It's always slides with pure notes and talking, nothing else. On his quizzes, he tells us the right answer but won't let us take it home to study. So when those questions are on the exam, we don't know what's right.",0
"Very Very Very, I mean EXTREMELY picky. Nitpicks through anything and everything. The feedback given is good but very petty. She does not know how to use Word to format anything properly but gets mad when you reformat her poorly formatted outline templates.",0
"Glenn Smith is, simply put, an angle of a man. Truly passionate about constitutional law, he genuinely cares about the education of each of his students. Participate in his class and he'll appreciate it. I am taking him in a course simulating the Supreme Court, smaller than his usual lectures, and he is very accommodating. Funny too!",1
"Exceptional and brilliant lecturer but incredibly information heavy. You'll feel like you're taking a history class half the time, and the readings are as interesting as medieval literature can get. Go to lecture, take good notes, go to office hours for help on the two papers, and you will probably get at least a B+.",1
this is the wrost teacher i have ever had in my life she is a really hard grader and does not explain anything at all....,0
"His classes are interesting, however, the exams are impossible. He is very helpful when it comes to writing the essay though. I went to his office and he literally told me everything I needed to know to write my paper. Good guy, ridiculously hard teacher",1
"Prof. DeYoung is a very smart man, but he tries to show off how smart he is. He offers help to you, but when you go in he makes you feel stupid. He intentionally makes exams harder than needed, knows he does this, then continues to tell you it should have been easy. Overall this prof. Is not that great and I would recommend any other prof.",0
Great professor! He is very helpful and clear on the content. There are only 3 tests and 3 papers with no final so its a pretty easy course even though the tests and papers can be somewhat challenging.,1
"Prof. Song is a teacher who likes the material she teaches and loves teaching. She gives a lot of extra credit (over 10% of the total points). Five group projects are straightforward and can be completed in class. Also, one presentation. Three quizzes that are not hard. Overall, an easy course with a good teacher. Would recommend.",1
Dr. Borst is a wonderful professor.  She truely cares about her students and I loved this class.  She doesn't try to trick you on tests and all the assignments are manageable.  Probably one of the most caring profs at GVSU.,1
Sectional Anatomy: Hard course. Too much information. If you have not taken A&P 1 and 2 just before taking this course... like a semester prior then do not take her. (Make sure you read the reviews for YOUR specific course),0
"She's a hilarious lady. Unfortunately my grade dropped because attendance is mandatory, after 2 absences your absences/tardies count against you... No good for someone who has class in MAK and only 10 minutes to get to PAC... I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a totally fun singing experience!",1
"I would never recommend Royer. He is disrespectful, and unprofessional and is the type of teacher that will make you feel  thoughtless for asking questions. His directions are dreadfully unclear. He tries to be funny but just outright insults students. Unsympathetic to any missed classed. He grades based on what he likes, not what is assigned.",0
"Awesome professor! Nice, caring guy who loves teaching math. Easy to understand and ready to answer any questions. Worksheets to work on during each class after 15 min lecture. Very little homework outside of class. Weekly lab done with partner. Tests were difficult but if you studied you were fine. Weekly quizzes were pretty easy.",1
Gave assignments with no direction and everything was subjective grading. You will probably be fine if he likes you but his style is ridiculous and i would never take him again. Was not an understanding guy and it was always his way or the highway.,0
"Pros: Helpful, soft spoken, friendly, easy to talk to, available when you need her  Cons: hard tests, hard topics covered, hard to get an A.",1
"I don't think there is much to add about this professor: he sucks. Look in SH381. See the paint peeling from the walls? That's how boring he is. He wants you to memorize everything. Solving problems, not really. It seems the EE dept does not want engineers that can actually solve problems; only those that can spit out definitions like a robot.",0
"Horrible experience for Summer Online. Switch to Canvas made everything haywire, but she's really disorganized and seldom emails back. I basically taught myself English 5 with help from LRC English tutors. People in discussions would knock people's writing and it got really ugly and miserable due to total lack of oversight by the teacher.",0
"Midterm and exam were 10X harder than they needed to be with hypothetical type questions and things that have no real answer, just his opinion. Vague instructions yet expects a very specific response. Weekly D2L posts were graded hard and impossible to get a good mark. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Great teacher! Works with everyone so no one is left behind, great notes. as long as you show up and do the homework. You'll pass her class!",1
"Call was extremely interesting, the way Ariel lectured kept me listening. The class isn't easy, you really have to study and READ THE BOOK along with your notes for the exams. Exams and quizzes are all online and she gives a generous block of time to take them. No class on exam days which is also nice. Attend office hours if your grade is slipping!",1
"A decent prof, though he marks on the the less generous side. Lectures are well done despite talking very fast. He does write his notes on the board but the writing is nearly illegible (he doesn't hide this though). He is a smart guy with lots of interesting things to say and a good sense of humour. Not an easy ""A"" but an earned one.",1
"I am not going to lie this class it tough if you are looking for an easy A. However, effort and work does pay out in the end. She is a tough grader on the grammar portion of the class but it very understanding with the oral parts.  Overall was a fun relaxed, and laid back class.",1
"He was my reason to get up for my 8:30 classes. My only regret is not going to enough of his office hours :( Great prof, attended every lab and helped everyone, even if they didn't need help. Hopefully I have him again soon!!",1
She likes to talk about her family and baseball more than accounting. I only took her again because I know what to expect from her. I've been in 2401 for a week and we haven't had any actual teaching yet. Can't wait for December.,0
"Do not take his class. The only thing in the gradebook are 4 exams. Doesn't grade on percentage scale, based on number of points in the gradebook. Straight lecture class, if you do not attend you WILL NOT pass. Very hard grader too. Gives short essay questions a week in advance for you to prepare for exam but cannot take them to class with you.",0
Very good Prof. It's amazing how he teachs.,1
"Incredible person and professor.  Enjoy his amazing lectures but don't take notes! Use provided study notes for essays - answer all questions from readings and films - these are not comprehensive, exact words. Memorize, Memorize, Memorize!",0
"Don't buy the text book. You will not use it. His grading is ridiculous. He was absurd with grading, he would do one on one sessions for your essays, make corrections, then mark you down on your final draft once completed. Even though he made those changes. Hes absolutely hysterical. Just make sure you're a unicorn in your writing to get just a C",0
"So here's the deal. This class is HARD and TIME consuming. Start the projects the first day or you will suffer! I was terrified at first but when I put in the work and went to see him if I was confused, it paid off in the end. You learn so much new material so quickly its crazy! Amazing class and will really shape you well for the real world.",1
This is my second time taking this class. He's a far grader. If you do the work you'll pass. Simple. You have to keep up with postings and due dates. He's far!,1
Dr. Connors should not be allowed to be a college professor. She is the most unprepared woman Ive ever met. She regularly misses scheduled meeting with students and never responds to emails. You have no way to get in contact with her and youll have no way of knowing your grade until the last possible day because she doesnt really grade anything.,0
Even if you are not a geology major you should take one of his classes.  He is a great professor and a very nice and funny man.  He goes out of his way to help and here's the best part--he KNOWS what he is talking about.,1
Dr. Taylor-Perry is a wonderful chemistry professor and I would highly recommend her for Chemistry 111. She gives a lot of pop quizzes but they aren't usually too difficult and you can work with a partner. She makes chemistry lectures enjoyable and she knows how to capture the attention of her students. Ask for help and she is willing to help you.,1
"Basically a self-teach class. She reads straight off the slides and is very unorganized. There is a quiz after every chapter, she speeds through every chapter so the quizzes are every other day. She says she's always available but has never once responded to my emails. Didn't learn much either. Just study and you're likely to pass.",0
"Prof. Bannow is not a mean guy, let me get that out of the way. However, he talks down to students because he doesn't understand that a student doesn't master a concept by seeing it once. Do not ask questions, do not miss class, basically teach yourself. He ends up giving so much extra credit the class seems pointless. Not recommended at all.",0
Dr. Vutha is one of the best professors at OSU. He holds many review sessions outside of class and makes sure you are ready for every single weekly quiz and exam (every 3 weeks). Class is weighted 70% on the exams so be sure to do well. Final exam was tough but all other exams were quite easy.,1
HORRIFIC TEACHER! Very intelligent and knows his topic however prof. Denemark is unable to come down to students levels and makes the class completely about himself.  His personal notes consist of bad jokes and hugely off topic examples.  Waste of time and your grade! DO NOT BOTHER,0
"Easy A, don't buy the book because EVERYTHING is online. The downside is that he never grades anything so prepare for that. I think he plays the whole ""disorganized"" thing up. WileyPlus take a bit of getting used to but for not having to buy a book and just pay for this online and skate through his class for an easy A, I'll deal with it.",1
"Phil is an awesome TA. He doesn't grade the essay very hard and quizzes are easy. The class is nothing but powerpoints but he talks about his personal experiences with some of the topics and also goes into more detail with some things. Very goofy and makes class fun. Don't take his attitude as snobby or rude, he's probably trying to crack a joke.",1
"Expect to have to teach yourself absolutely everything on your own time, which is extra difficult because everything you research will be in a different (and more standardized and sensible format) than what she teaches. I have yet to meet a single person who thinks she is good at teaching material. Tests and quizzes are also obscenely difficult.",0
"If I had an accurate portrayal of what his class was really like, I never would've taken it in a million years. Don't expect to actually learn that much about epidemiology. This class had the potential to be awesome but fell totally flat because of the prof. Got an A but would never put myself through that again. His personality gave me gray hairs.",0
"I don't understand why people complain so much. He is literally the only professor who tells you exactly what you need to know for the exam. He is good at explaining concepts, and makes class interesting. It is easy to pay attention to him. Watch lecture captures again to process the material.",1
"Mrs. Judy is an effective instructor. Her class is a bit challenging, but if you work hard, you will be fine. Her goal is to get students to enhance their Math skills so that we be effective teachers. I don't see in her the passion of wanting to fail you; but I see it as her goal is to help each student in becoming the best; so work diligently.",1
"hes so cute!!! great professor- easy, explains everything, very responsive to students",1
"I've had Dr. O'G twice now, and I like him a lot. He is a nice and very smart guy. He knows a lot about the stuff he teaches and he is passionate about it as well. With him being a liberal and me being a republican, he was always respectful and never looked down on me for that. The only thing is that his tests suck, but he does give partial credit!",1
"One of my favorite professors here at ETSU. Very few grades, only 3 tests plus final and homework, but they are very fair. He gives out sample tests before every test, which are very similar to the actual tests. Just know how to do those, do the homework, and you will end up with an easy A. Highly recommend, especially for a subject most people find difficult!",1
"Looking on here I'm surprised by Prof Danko's rating. She's an ok prof, she was gone multiple times this semester which made us do even more outside of class work. She acts very frustrated when someone asks a question in class, and can be condescending. Pay attention to EVERY deadline because you can get extra credit at the end of the semester.",1
"He is a great teacher, but he isn't organized at all. It took one of the students going to the dean just to get our grades to be put online. He always talks about how our class is in the way of his other classes hes teaching. You do homework and do the lesson the week after. I have a B in the class but its hard teaching ourselves. A&P1",0
"This is the 3rd time I've taken Mulvihill for a course. This class is almost solely a discussion between him and students. You sit and talk about the CJS; that's pretty much it. Exams and short papers are difficult if you don't show up or pay attention. Final paper is 20+ pages so start early. If you need a capstone, take this one!",1
"Jason is a great guy, and he's always willing to make himself available to students. He's the sort of professor who is always in the student's corner, and that really encouraged me even though I had a really tough time towards the beginning of the class!",1
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
I'm currently talking his 100 level class and it is a wast of my money and effort. He give no slack and I'm trying my very hardest. They way he gives his test makes it very hard to pass. He teaches as if it is a 300 level class. I don't recommend him unless you are really into geology.,0
"By far best teacher at Cuesta. Helpful on exams, provides food at study groups. FUNNY and informative. Take this class if you want to learn something!",1
M.I.S. with Keyser is very easy but don't be surprised if your midterm grades don't make sense when you get them back.  I got out of it with an A- but had a lot of fear that he would put an absolutely random grade on my final.  No reasoning behind marks but you should make it out with a good grade.,1
"Great teacher, very helpful. This class not for lazy people! There is a lot of homework  but that is why I got an A, practice makes perfect! Even though he doesn't grade on attendance you really have to be there to do good. I hate math but am taking him for college algebra.",1
Only qualm is she doesn't give 100% on any paper out of principle. Amazing lady who is flexible with your needs. A+ teacher.,1
in grading papers he LOOKS for ways to take off points...the type of teacher who tries to make you do poorly...also never available for after class help..would strongly NOT recommend this class with him if you have any desire to get above a C,0
"Professor Cazenave spends the entire lecture talking about his own views and is rude. Class is extremely hard to sit through because when he does lecture about the material, he reads off of a piece of paper. Tests are insanely easy- a scantron of 50 multiple choice- and his projects are not worth it. Aweful experience overall.",0
"Well boys and girls if you want an easy ""A"" take this class.. Nice guy, funny, kinda talks a lot about random stuff. But all around good class.",1
"I enjoyed this class as well as the professor. I was dreading taking this class after reading all these negative reviews but honestly, it was great class. I learned a lot and it wasn't any harder than some of the other online classes I've taken. The class was very organized and straightforward.  Do the work and you'll get a decent grade.",1
this teacher is very knowledgeable and real. She has opened new endeavors that challenge me and how will I handle my career. She as taught me to be myself and grow with life.,1
"This guy is super funny. He is easy on the eyes too and he is a great professor. Beware, he doesn't look at you in the eye. Don't know why.",1
"I had Dr. Capozzi for Physics 1 and 2. If you have to take physics and Dr. Capozzi is an option, TAKE HIM. You will not regret it. The homework, quizzes, and tests are all online. His lectures are a little sporadic, so use the book or the internet to get you through the online assignments and you should get an easy A.",1
The worst prof I have had here. The class was pointless and you don't learn anything that you didn't already know. Too many useless projects outside of class and if your group members suck then you get a bad grade. I highly recommend NOT taking him.,0
The professor teaches outdated material and is rather rude at times. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you can avoid it.,0
"Mr. S is a great lecturer, even as just a grad student. I have never heard of anybody having a problem with him personally, and I found him to be respectful and unbiased during class. Whoever wrote the review below is a complete and utter moron. It is sad that a person like that is able to gain admission to SLU.",1
"Quizzes everyday on the reading, but all tests are comprised of those quiz questions plus some questions from the lectures. Really not a difficult class, Professor Stoner knows what he's talking about and  if you need some extra help, he is totally willing to help you. Not difficult to make a good grade if you put forth the effort.",1
"Hard grader, but encourages independent thought. Not a prof for those who are expecting an easy grade. I've never recieved full marks, even though comments on my paper said I was high above the class. I like that because it gives me something to always push harder for.",1
"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",0
"His class, tests, and quizzes are the definition of that one meme. Sally has four apples and gives one away.. calculate the mass of the sun.. like bruh Alot of college is self teaching/learning. But this class takes it to the next level. He lectures off slides with no additional context of HW problems. Very few examples and guidance given. avoid",0
"Pretty awesome teacher easy going,laid back,funny at times open book tests (only 2)1 short paper 1 group presentation , i recommand him",1
"Ferguson is a typical old fashioned and opinionated professor, and he is definitely a character. I found the class and content interesting, and his personality contributed to that.",1
"horrendous and absolutely terrible. her explanations leave you more confused than before the explanation, assignments don't make any sense at all and quizzes are very hard",0
"Wonderful, passionate teacher and really just a lovely person. She makes class engaging and I love listening to her french! The work isn't mandatory but is reflected in the tests, thus very helpful when you actually do it.",1
"English not too good, long pauses in lecture, easy subjects, OK teacher",0
Delightful presentation. Upbeat and encouraging. Helpful to students and presents useful information worth learning. Great experience.,1
don't be a guy and take the class. ****,0
I took this as a general art class. let me just say that if you are not an art/ history major do not bother taking this course. Her lectures are a bit dry. The exams are challenging(unless you love writing papers). Again unless your an art major do not bother taking this class. it will just add to your stress,0
"Mulvihill's class was amazing. It was very interesting, and I'm glad I took the class. He's a great professor. Easy A. If you can take his capstone, definitely do it. Far better than the other options.",1
"This course was a history class about The Modern Olympic Games and Dr. Goodwin definitely knows his stuff. He also had guest speakers for some classes including an Olympic Champion. The material itself is not too difficult, however the exams are entirely free response, so you really need to pay attention and study, but this was my favorite class.",1
"I hate bio, and he made it tolerable. he is a really great person, with some even better stories...Just go to class, he gives extra credit on those rainy days when no one attends class.",1
"Great prof, not super hard but not easy peasy either. If you have a genuine interest for bio, you will love her class and get an A!",1
Karen is very fair and has great tricks to help you remember things. The class is tough but you get what you put into it. I truly enjoyed the class and saw my grade increase as the semester went on which showed that she was effective at teaching the material. Would take another class with her.,1
"I loved david's class! His tests were hard but open book because he didn't want to trick his students, he was there to teach and we were there to learn! Best teacher i've had at UW Bothell so far! Didn't make life unnecessarily hard.",1
"I would highly recommend you not take this course if youre an undergrad student because its essentially a graduate course, and you will be graded as such. There are no exact instructions, and I was confused about most of the system. It isnt easy and I expected this to be a course that I would enjoy",0
"Senora Sanchez truly is a nice lady. She really wants all her students to do well in the course and to learn something new. She's extremely passionate but can sometimes go off on tangents because of it. If you don't like having homework, don't take the class, she gives a lot of it but it's more so tedious than hard work.",1
Very hard to understand. Changes direction with her speech so much you cant follow her. Also grades alot harder after drop date.,0
"If you're looking for a brush up on your math skills and you don't have any learning issues, this class is for you. There is no lecture and class participation. You have to rely on Alexs to instruct you in new topics if Alexs doesn't line up with your other assinments you've got to teach your self or fall behind.",0
"Pam is... interesting.  I respect her for what she is trying to do, which is spread diversity awareness, but she focuses on her own personal agenda WAY to much (chemical sensitivities).  Her quizzes are too hard and too subjective, and the grading is inconsistent.  You also can't miss any classes, and nothing is put on blackboard.  Goodluck.",0
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken. He is a great guy, but the exams are borderline impossible no matter how much work you put into studying. The work he has us do and the exams are made so much harder than they have to be. This class is about to destroy my gpa because I didn't listen to the other reviews on here...",0
"EXCELLENT professor- I took her for 195 and 373, assigns a good deal of reading, but all of it is relevant. Easily one of the best professors I've had-take her if you can! oh and you get to take some interesting field trips in this class too",1
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
"Professor McKean challenges his students, and those those that embrace the challenges  quickly become stronger writers.",1
"If you're not an Accouting major, I wouldn't take it with Neurath. He goes through the material quickly and if you skip a day you might as well just read the entire book on your own. Examples are out of the textbook and the homework is NOT graded. Hard class if you're not organized. I would suggest taking this class with Credit/No Credit.",0
"Goes on and on in lectures, he tests over terms that are mentioned in the reading so you actually have to read his book. About 40+ pages to read per test. A lot of the questions he ask are over the ideas he shared in class so it's like you're learning his ideals and what he believes in. Prob the only class I haven't figured out how to study...",0
Very loud and active professor. Class is interesting and never lasts the full three hours. VERY VERY HARD TESTS!!! I went to every class and took very detailed notes and got a B in the class. But I learned a lot and had a great time in that class.,1
"Very confusing, is not clear and teaches irrelevant stuff. If you ask for help, tell you to ""ask the google"", don't recommend but UAA doesn't care about how classes are being taught, lots of bad professors.",0
"He is lost more the 50% of the time, he knows the business but doesnt know how to teach it. If you dont match his ideas and his views you might as well quit film because he believes you wont make it and tells you. As well he goes on tangents that dont have anything to do with the class,.",0
"I really enjoyed her class. She printed out all the notes for you, but you had to fill some of it in. She had 6 test but you could miss one. She offered a lot of extra credit. I would definitely take this class again. It was really easy if you filled out the notes and looked over the study guys she handed out.",1
"Ferguson doesn't use lecture slides or courselink. He doesn't engage in any class discussion. He speaks crystal-clear and at a pace that allows you to get all the necessary notes down. Show up to every class, take good notes, and you'll get an A. I never opened the textbooks. ",1
"Avoid if possible. Although he's a nice guy and very funny, I found the lectures to be very unclear. I had to teach myself everything in this class and mechanics is not an easy thing to self teach. Studying hard and often is the key to doing well. He gives a quiz every class but helps in the end. Tests are hard but he curves the average to a 75.",0
"she set me up for failure, did not give grades back until the drop date, if you have a different opinion than her she will fail you, my whole class is basically failing now, have to meet outside of class and graded on it, have to come up with your own exam questions and even those are not good enough for her. exams have too much for the time period",0
"She grades everything extremely slow, I had to email her 16 times before she graded one of my assignments,(which took THREE MONTHS) she gave the majority of my class zeros on our final paper because they were ""plagiarized"" which none of them were. She knows what she's talking about and might be a good professor if she wasn't absolutely insane.",0
"This class is easy, just study each chapters multiple choice review questions for the online part of the book.  Most test questions are directly off the reviews. If you show up to class a week before the exam he gives you all the answers for the reviews.",0
"I thought that John was a very good teacher.  Even though you can really understand him, he know what he's doing. If your having trouble in the class just ask and he will help. Good Choice!",1
"Took Engineering Mathematical Analysis with Dr Gueye, and he was absolutely useless. Constantly did examples incorrectly in class, never answered student questions properly and provided incorrect solutions to the lab work. He also planned and marked exams so you would be rushed to complete, make small errors and get 0 for the whole question.",0
"It's all been said already. He is very knowledgible, but doesn't know how to teach it to students.",0
He pulls down your course off the D2L before you know your final grade without any notice. I was new to D2. I contacted his boss and the Dean. I scored a couple 80s on the quizzes but mostly 90s and 100s. I scored a 98 on the final exam and I still got a C. I was stunned! He doesn't return emails in a timely manner. I DO NOT reccomend this guy!,0
"Lisa is amazing!  To anyone taking the field seriously and capable of the workload, you will find the assignments extremely useful.  They are relevant and challenging, but absolutely worth it!  My favorite professor at BSU.  She still keeps in touch and is a true advocate for BSU students and students with disabilities.  Thank you Lisa!",1
"Very smart professor, he knows his stuff. HOWEVER, uses far too much jargon right out the door causing much confusion amongst students. Gets upset when you answer a questions incorrectly. Almost seems as though he expects his students to already know how to do everything before the semester starts. Overall: Far too difficult.",0
"Awful instructor.  The worst instructor in the program, he cares nothing for the students, you can tell that he treats his position as nothing more than a side gig. I suggest you get a thorough knowlege of information systems prior to enrolling in any of the courses, that's the way most of the teachers in the MIS program like it.",0
I really loved Mr. Dayoub C Sharp class. Wonderful job Mr. D!,1
"She's really nice and cool, knows a lot. The class was kind of boring in my opinion. All powerpoint lectures",1
I have had good grades throughout my life until Barreto. The material in the book does not match the material on the test. Even if you study you'll still likely fail a test or two. I emailed him about the material and he never responded.,0
Can an accreditor please sit through this course and give me my money back? At least look at the homework assignments he gave us. He never taught us Verilog but all of the homework assignments were poorly worded (if worded at all) copies of homework from more advanced courses at other universities. Most people failed but still got grades...,0
He is a tough grader but is clear of what is expected. He tends to go off topic a lot and talks really fast so it makes it hard to understand. If you are not able to reach him during his office hours then he will find time to meet and discuss assignments.,1
"Typical of SHU Nursing School faculty. Good reputation, nasty staff.",0
Tough grader,0
"He really doesnt know how to teach. He never really teaches a topic. 75% of what I learned in his class was from searching the internet, the other 25% I already knew. Don't even think about asking him a question, he will talk out of his ass for 10 minutes trying to sound like he knows what hes talking about so he can get around saying he doesnt kno",0
"My main issue with this professor was the delay in the grading process. I understand needing time, but returning assignments two months later does not help me understand what I am doing wrong. If assignments were graded in a more timely manner students would be able to use the feedback to perform better.",0
"Dude, some of these reviews are hilarious and they are all true!! She is really mean. There was probably nobody in class that liked her. She can be very judgmental and will stereotype you. The only people she seemed to be nice to were people of latin decent. I caught her rolling her eyes on a few student, particularly the white ones. Not recommende",0
"Awesome prof.  Goes over everything in class in  a lot of detail, makes midterms and exams easy. If you can write an essay, you're set.",1
"Her tests are all based on opinion, I memorized everything with none of it on the tests. Listen to her opinion thats all she cares about. Her lectures consist of random tangents. She has something against Christianity. If you are genuinely searching do not take it, if you need an easy A do not take it, if you can take anything else do not take it.",0
"She is a really nice person if you're nice to her... she loved me but still graded me hard so if you think being friends with her is going to help you you're wrong!!! You just have to actually do the work, kind of a pain sometimes",0
He is an old school prof - his lectures are all talk with minimal overhead slides. He talks at a reasonable pace and tends to say the same thing a few different ways so you have time to write down the important stuff. There isn't a topic in econ that this guy doesn't know about. One of the smartest people I've met at U of G.,1
"Professor Gibson is one of those professors that you wish for every semester. She is patient and easy-going. There is always work to be done but TRUST ME, she gives ample time. Extra credit and revisions available to everyone who participates in class. Love Dr. G. Awesomeness!",1
"At first I didn't think that this class would be hard, I was wrong. 81 percent failed his class. He has a quiz every Friday. All short answers, you must be specific or they get marked wrong and spelling HAS to be correct. The test are ALL short answers too. You if plan on taking him make sure you study, and know all the material weeks before.",0
"Paretta is tough. If you're looking for an easy A look elsewhere, but if you want to learn there is no one better. You will know accounting better than anyone who took it with a different professor. He is a good teacher but the way his class is set up he will only help you if you ask for it. Quizzes do not count but take them seriously.",1
"He explains problems while writing on board, then u don't have time to figure out how he gets answer. Not good with patients for others, you may somewhat understand, then he totally throws u off before u leave class. U leave with confusion and head spinning! And tutoring lab teaches differently. He knows math but not one to teach it!",0
Levenson is a figure here at UVA and for good reason. He is passionate and really cares that the students he teaches find something to love about the subject. He is great at making you feel like your commentary is worth while.,1
"He requires his students to use a textbook he wrote and it is not very well done. The problems are very hard to understand. He also requires you to teach the lesson to yourself before class and then take a quiz, which destroyed grades because the textbook was hard to understand. He took an easy class with easy concepts and made it complicated.",0
Probably the best professor in the school. Highly recommend taking him. I was lost a couple of times but going up to him and asking him questions is what helped me. Chet makes sure his students know what he's talking about. He'll even make up funny strategies and gestures to make the material stick in ones mind. Ill never forget this guy.,1
Favorite professor in the music department! He cares about his students and is pretty funny!,1
the class is just fine. really. but since this is 'rate my professor' i'd give him a big UGH AWFUL,0
"I took MGMT 374 & 478 with him. He's definitely a hard ass, but he means well. He marches to the beat of his own drum, is unorthodox in his teaching compared to the rest of the business school, & doesn't believe in textbooks. He pushes you out of your comfort zone so that you'll actually learn something, & I'm honestly grateful to him for it.",1
"I found Professor Mattox annoying, both as a person and as a professor. He didnt communicate well at all and when asking for help, he would provide vague answers that had almost nothing to due with the original question. Didnt seem like he cared if you did well or not. Had an attitude of I dont know, not my problem.",0
"Professor Henigman is very knowledgeable about what she's teaching, and equally passionate. Her handwriting could be hard to read at times, but I always appreciated the personal, thoughtful feedback she gave for assignments. She cares about what you have to say. During lectures, she's engaging and tells you what you need to succeed. Take her class!",1
"Wonderful class and professor. Only the midterm and final (essays) and one other essay. A good use of lecture material will get you a decent grade but if you want a high B or A you must do connect to the readings that are assigned. Other than that, and discussions of the reading (not formal or graded), doing the readings is up to you.",1
In class on week 7 he just started grading things. There was even a group email of all the students in his class talking about how he wasn't doing his job. He rarely gave feedback and doesn't have a rubric so as he grades so he starts marking down points and can go from a fully working code & half credit due to little things considered 'bad prog.',0
"Ms. Gronlund is an okay professor. Her quizzes are not hard if you do the objectives. You work in this class for the grade you want. If you don't like to read don't take this class because you will read almost the entire book to answer objectives. She assigns work for every chapter, a paper, one recipe project, midterm & final. Overall study & pass",1
This instructor is very vague in her assignments and will turn around and tell you you didnt read the assignment if you didnt do it to her standards. Everyone in the class gets confused and while she seems like a nice person she is not a great teacher.,0
One of the sweetest profs on campus. He loves the Lord and starts class with prayer requests and a sincere prayer. He is one of the few profs that cares deeply about the Gospel. He also cares about his students and that is seen in the ways he carries a conversation and prays for us.,1
I was told by Mike that I should consider changing my major and he was insanely harsh in his grading. He never encouraged me or worked with me and everything I did was wrong. Ive had 3000+ level classes that were easier.,0
"She was so helpful, and so understanding. There are only 3 papers and she helps you as much as she can. She is almost always available outside of class, and you can reach her through email as well. She is very funny too and has a very good personality. :)",1
Very nice and understanding lady. Basically just a lot of papers to write. Easy A!,1
"patty patty patty, what a woman! she's incredibly smart and i love her lectures. you can tell she really loves what she does. she's super hard, like, over the top hard, but she's just trying to give you the necessary tools to proceed with your degree.",1
"Matt is my favorite teacher at NAU! You could ask him the same question a million times and he will always be patient and kind with you. If you have you have the chance to take his class, please take him!",1
Made politics fun. He is a great teacher who cares about what he does.,1
this class was easy for me I made 90's on all of my papers the class are long and boring but shes not very strict to when it comes to drafts and final drafts she worries more about the final paper ,1
He does not explain things very well and he rambles during his presentations. He grades test very hard and if it is not what he is looking for it is not going to be counted correct. He is not very understanding of certain situations and why you may be late to class or why you have to leave class early. This is the worse professor Ive ever had.,0
"You learn more than you wanted!  She's tough, but the assignments are all good for future teachers.",1
"Professor Ross knew his material. He made sure that he had many hours worth of office hours per week. He claimed you needed the textbook, but I got an A without reading anything. Get ready for Mastering Physics assignments every week. The 4 ""exams"" are not comprehensive. The hardest part is that his voice is monotone and makes it hard to stay awake",1
"For the school he is at he was difficult. I have taken five classes from him at this point and have learned so much. He's unique in his approach, but definitely have respect for him, even if I don't always agree with him.",1
"She's a nice lady and all. But if you don't do the reading, she will call you out on it and the class grade is primarily based on the midterm and final. She's not very clear with what she expects and doesn't tell the criteria until AFTER the fact.",0
"I took the honors version of theology 1 and it wasn't terrible, but compared to my friends taking non-honors this class was hard work. You have to show up to class and take notes or else you will not do well on the midterm and final. There are some fun components where we went to the Haggerty Art Museum, but beware you have to write papers about it",1
"She requires you to read around 30+ pages from the book, and sometimes you also have to read online articles along the book reading, for a 5 question quiz that has very specific questions and answer. Lectures are pointless because we have no exams just one essay due at the end of the semester.",0
"By far one of the worst math professors ever, this is my second math course at SJSU and he was one of the worst professors ever. He is not clear when explaining the lessons, all he does is read off the power point. If you don't know how to do proofs or haven't learned them since the prerequisites for this class is precalc do not take him.",0
"If you have an 89 in the class, you will get a B instead of a B+.  I don't think that is very fair",1
"Great professor, he gives weekly assignments but they're only 150 words and they're easy. His lectures are all online so it's easy to follow along, and he tells  you exactly what's going to be on the test. He has experience in the field, and he knows what he's talking about. He's leaving to go to Worcester State next semester, I'm happy I had him",1
This class is not terrible but his teaching style is so dry I have to drink a large coffee to stay awake most days. I recommend taking the online course but overall it is an easy A as long as you do well on the exams,0
"Heffernan is very knowledgable and insightful, not to mention constuctively critical. He goes off on tangents, which only serves to make the class more interesting. He realizes that life is only a series of tangents. Heffernan is not only a great poet, but also a man from which much could be learned",1
"She is a very hard prof and doesn't seem very interested in her students. I fact one time I asked her a question and all she said was I do not understand why you don't get it, as someone else. I felt this was very rude and honestly it upset me.",0
"AVOID!! Boring lecturer. Tests were unusually difficult - worded weirdly or not covered in lecture. TAKE NOTES ON YOUR COMPUTER unless you are a fast writer on paper bc she SPEEDS through notes/lectures. Also, her ""study guides"" are topics we needed to know on the exam that weren't covered in class but were in the textbook.",0
I know she comes out with a low rating. She is constantly off topic and you really end up learning much of the material on your own. However she keeps the class interesting and fun. And she really enjoys and understands what she teaches. She just has a difficult time explaining it. I still recommend her overall.,0
"WORST DAMN TEACHER EVER!
 Not only can she not stay focused during class, she needs to ask for a copy of the syllabus just to see when her own assignments are due.
 
 Worst of all she is just a mean lady.",0
This professor is a great guy. We had one zoom class a week for 3 hours. All you do is read plays and talk about them in class. There is also assignments regarding the plays during the week but nothing too hard. There is a group project at the end but not bad either. He genuinely cares for his students and our success. I will miss him! Fun class!,1
Don't suggest taking this class if you don't have to. His tests are hard- most of the answers come between 2 that could be correct. Even if you study your butt off there's always a chance you'll do horribly. Sure he curves it but not by much. Don't take this class.,0
"SCOM123 was one of the hardest classes I've had this semester, and it's clear that most scom classes aren't hard at all. Dr. Barnes is a very tough grader and her teaching style is very confusing. If you're considering taking her online- DON'T. I'm not sure how she is in person, but being in her online class sucked. SCOM should not be this hard.",0
"Very easy class. We had a total of 4 papers (two easy subject papers, one research paper and a book review). Also, he grades very fair and he is lenient. He shows a lot of movies. He has you make a binder of all the classwork done, and checks it towards the end of the semester but barely looks at it. I am now going to take him for ENC1102.",1
"Sometimes late and missed some classes, but very helpful and knowledgeable.",1
"I could tell he wanted his students to do well in his class. He was willing to answer questions and give extra help. His notes were pretty scattered and confusing to follow at times. For the most part, I relied on other sources to teach me the course. He goes through the material pretty quickly, and this class required a LOT of outside effort",1
Bon prof!,1
"This lady was the biggest you-know-what to me, for reasons unknown. The only assignments are pieces of the ending research paper, which was nice, but if you don't get a C on the end paper, you fail the whole class (not her fault, it's policy). She made me change my topic at the last minute, after numerous meetings throughout the semester.",0
bioethics spring 2020: Holy moly this class was difficult. There was ONE philosophy major in my class and thank goodness he was in my group. She puts everyone in groups and that's your group for the semester. Frequent quizzes. 2 extremely difficult papers. Homework is to read A LOT of philosophy material. On the bright side she is funny and bubbly.,1
Worst professor I have had. His lectures are dense and they do make sense when watching them but quiz questions have NOTHING to do with the lecture or reading. Average quiz score is 6/10. He changed the weight of assignments on the last week of classes and my grade dropped 6 points. Don't show up to class late or he will humiliate you.,0
He just doesn't teach. He gives you his prewritten notes tells us we need ANY finance book no one is on the same topic. For HW its watching youtube videos of him going over his notes and in class he says the same exact thing in his video word for word. there was no clear structure of what to study.,0
"there are 3 ""tests"" which are long essays. hint: If you write over 20 pages for a test, you will probably get an A for the test. he always lets us out early, and only keeps you for an hour. our discussions are interesting and he is really funny. I would take him again!",1
I took both of his art history classes. I love his class. He has traveled the world doing archeological work and has seen many of the pieces of art that he covers. He has amazing stories and you will never be bored. ,1
"I had this course a while ago, He is a great guy but expect to work a a lot...I had a little bit of programming experience before and still had some difficulty.  Now, 2 years later, I am good at Java I can see how this class could be a blast.  I didn't really feel like I learned from him until the END of the semester though.",1
She switched from completely in-person to fully online two days before the course started. She is not very tech-savvy and barely responded to emails. I had to get a tutor because I was so confused. You honestly don't need the textbook because in order to get a passing grade you have to memorize her lectures. Avoid if possible,0
"The woman literally wrote the book. Dr. Taylor-Perry is an awesome professor. Although she may seem a little intimidating at first, she will always take any questions and will talk to you after class. I had a B in the course until the final exam and then it brought me down to a C.",1
I enjoyed this class because she gives us access to print out lecture notes. Shes very helpful with breaking down stuff. She gives extra credit and please do her SLA practice problems and multiple choice problems even though theyre not for points. Its helpful for tests. Come for group activities as well. I suggest tutor for this class as well,1
"I had Garyen half in person and half online for my semester. In person, he's really informative and teaches the material very well. His online class is a bit frustrating because his quizzes are really hard, but his exams were manageable. If you have the chance take him in person, otherwise take a different prof for online because he'll be difficult",1
"A lot of reading and useless papers, but if you come to class and pay attention, he tells you EXACTLY what you need. He's super helpful if you go to office hours. A little intimidating, but he's a great guy and knows A LOT about communication.",1
"Worst professor ever. Doesnt give good direction and even when the whole class doesnt understand instruction, she does nothing to help. If she is unsatisfied with your work, you are only able to receive half credit because it wasnt revised by the due date. So its not even worth it. Would not recommend.",0
So far the best professor I have taken! Cares so much about her students and human service field! Clear grading criteria and she is very easy to work with and understanding. Have so much fun in her class and get to know some amazing people.,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR'S CLASS. I felt like a was in a high school business class. She talks down to the students and doesn't teach at all. The only thing you do in class is team assignments and the skills and info you need to use for these assignments are expected to be learned outside of the classroom since it is hybrid.,0
"Worst prof ever. basically learned from past experience in calc and the pre-class modules. she doesn't even teach the concepts at all, any student could go up there and teach the lecture more efficiently. she was my only option too so if you have no choice, make sure you study and find resources to teach yourself independently or you won't pass",0
"He knows something about the topic, but his angle is extremely narrow and outdated. To his credit and my amazement, though, he emphasized fundamentalism's larger history rather than merely clan Anderson's role in it.",0
Tests are all short answer (only 2 + final) and the only grades for the course. After TA's grade & he reviews all exams to take off more points. Lectures are hard to follow and so boring. He was so rude all semester & during the final announced that he specifically picked the terms that would be hardest for the class. No canvas page either. Awful.,0
"She's kind person , but the test and quiz are very hard i might get C on cal1 ;(.",1
It's true that 3140 is hard. But Dr. Swift made it even harder. He doesn't fit into the online course AT ALL. You were expected to do heavy quizzes and exams within an extremely short time. And he actually think the time was way too much for the students. It's very upset that a professor can be such detached to his students.,0
"Her class literally made me not major in finance. She is very nice, always in a good mood but its impossible to learn anything. She speaks as if we already know the material, flies through it, and then gives you an extremely difficult test with material we never went over. I had to go home and teach myself everything online. She will help in office",0
"Great teacher! I took the combined Math 115/116 class. This class is a LOT of work and a lot of homework is assigned. Attendance is a must and you will use your book. I learned more about math in this class than any other math class. If you are serious about learning algebra, I suggest this class. Teacher is always available to help.",1
He was late almost all semester by 10-15 min. His teaching technique is pretty avrg. Only gives a few tests a semester he takes points off for the smallest things such as whether or not you placed arrows on your graph. He didn't update the canvas grade book the entire semester. He has no problem with trying toembarrassing you in front of the class.,0
"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes. This is not high school, and learning should be independent at unviersity. Students should have right to decide which learning style best suits them",0
"hard to understand, he seemed to leave things out of his lectures, or he had trouble completing his explainations clearly, i still dont know what greenstone belts are.  squirelly guy.",0
"One of the hardest classes/prof in the EE cirriculum.  You constantly need to study to prepare for a potential pop quiz (he once gave a quiz on the 2nd day of class).  You must have old material in order to stand a chance.  Teaches mainly via powerpoint slides, and therefore goes too fast. HW is worth only 10%, he takes off points based on ""effort""",1
final exam worth 50% of your grade. Was rude to students who asked questions.,0
I work hard and have always done well in all my classes- especially English.  she does not give good clear feedback & grades very unfairly. would NOT reccommend.,0
Professor Pantaleon is a very chaotic and messy teacher that cannot explain the easiest aspects of the subject. His lectures don’t cover test materials and his grading system is unclear. Don’t count on his help after evening class because he rarely has time for his students since he has to make it to the train station on time. .,0
"no syllabus to follow, everything that is assigned is just thrown at you at the last second and she expects all of your work to be perfect. if you do not agree with her opinions then you do not do well. she has her favorites in the class and only those people do well and she is rude to those students who are not her favorite.",0
"Dr. Cheers definitely picks favorites and picks on students in the class. If you do not stand out in the class during discussion, you will be unacknowledged by him. If you do not participate, you may as well not be in the class at all because of how he treats his students. Definitely participate if you plan on taking this class.",0
"She is a very nice teacher and I think she does care about the students in her class. But she doesn't go over the material well enough in class. She always lets us out early, which to some of u might be a good thing but when u are trying to learn about managerial accounting and she keeps letting you go early all the time, well thats not too good. H",1
I am taking her for 098 and love her. She is so nice and so helpful. She will work with you till you understand it even if she has to stay after class to show you. I would love to take her again.,1
"Him and Frank Shaw are the best math professors at HU.     His HW's assignments are short. Go to class cuz his notes are very useful. This professor loves math and he really cares about his students understanding and learning it clearly. He is very helpful to students. Exams are not hard like HW, Go to his office and also to labs for help.",1
"Prof was amazing; you will not regret taking him!! We had 0 tests or quizzes, and the entire grade was based on your completion of DB posts and reflections. There were very few long essays (I only wrote 1), and you have a lot of freedom for the midterm and final project. If you do your work, you will pass. Also didn't have to purchase anything.",1
"He doesn't have his own lectures for online classes. He just give you a textbook to use, the assignments and you have to figure out everything else. He doesn't provide lectures that explain well the material and the assignments. The textbook is not enough and it doesn't have too many examples.",0
"He knows his information but he is NOT a good teacher.  He fails to explain things in a clear manner, is rude to those whom ask for help, or do not understand something and little is learned from the class. I'm scoring well because I'm a quick study & look elsewhere for help. I learn little from hi teachings.  I do NOT recommend this professor.",0
"Very easy class. A few easy assignments and a group project. You can only miss 2 classes of the semester. Scott is really funny and brings in good guest speakers. He made it easy to understand what nursing is really like and was accessible to ask any questions. Great guy, easy class!",1
She goes through the class extremely fast. She went through at least 4 lessons in less than an hour.,0
"I took the online Statistics course this Fall 2019 semester. There is no interaction between yourself and other students, but he responds in a timely manner. A decent amount of homework, media assignments are helpful. The tech was easy to understand, and provides a lot of opportunity and resources for success!",1
"He is very easy going and cool ,explains very clear ,does not t waste any time at all ,very good sense of humor ,perfect grader , he would make the road clear and easy for you to go trough and all the time gives you motivation and ideas for success ,one of the best professors I ever had in whole college semesters, I definitely recommend it .",1
Very caring and enthusiastic teacher that gives some easy points in assignments. Labs are manageable to get A's if you put in a little effort. There are two tests throughout the entire semester that make up a good portion of your grade and they are pretty hard if you don't study (and even if you do). Study is needed as there is a lot of material.,1
I hated everything about this class.,0
"Professor Aitken is great! Took this class online. Consists for 8 exams, 2 papers and 3 projects. If you don't want to put in work and are looking for a no-brainer online class, don't take this one. You have to apply yourself for the papers to earn a good grade. Tests are easy but come directly form his online lectures. Take good notes to pass!",1
"Really liked Dr. Kroll. A little hard, but as long as you ALWAYS show up for class, and do all of the work as best as you can, you will do fine. Really likeable guy, and I highly recommend his course!",1
Iclicker heavy. Online textbook with modules and homework. It's all really straight forward. Each chapter has 6 questions at the end. 30 of those questions make up your final exam so just memorize the answers. She's super sweet but it throws her off if you ask a question because she only can explain it one way.,1
"Honestly, I am fairly confident that she wrote all of the positive reviews herself. I am an 'A' student, but I don't know anyone who would speak well of her. She is unclear in her expectations, terrible to communicate with, and doesn't understand student questions at all. I got a decent grade in the class, but I would seriously NEVER take it again.",0
"He is extremely outdated in his ideas and teaching method. He does not post slides, and talks way too fast so good luck taking notes. It is simple enough to get a good grade, but if you want a good learning experience DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. You will learn nothing other then what he believes to be true and he belittles everything else.",0
McDonald's lab is probably one of the better classes I've taken here. You learn a lot of technical procedures (get ready to do 5 hours of gel electro. every week) but it is useful and you get enough time and leeway to do everything required. McDonald is also a notoriously easy grader and just a really nice guy. PS. don't take if you hate bugs!,1
"BONNE CHANCE POUR VOTRE EXAMEN INTRA ET FINAL, J""AI JAMAIS EU UN COURS SI DIFFICILE. L'EXAMEN ET LA PRÉPARATION À L'EXAMEN SONT 2 COURS DIFFÉRENTS ON DIRAIT, EXAMEN SUPER TROP DIFFICILE QUI N'A AUCUN RAPPORT AVEC LA MATIÈRE ÉTUDIER UTILISE DES CONCEPTS QUE VOUS N'ALLEZ PAS VOIR EN CLASSE. BONNE CHANCE",0
"Very clear and organization. Take Tabea's class if you actually want to learn something. Do not use your phone/laptop in class, and participate as much as possible. Super knowledgeable, accessible, and cares about your success. This class was the most ""worth my money"" course I've ever taken.",1
"Forget about Brady, this man is literally the goat. Bellantoni makes what at times can be dry material into amazing lectures. He has so much wisdom and imparts it on his students that I wish he were my life coach. Also tests are mad easy and getting an A is cake.",1
"Intelligent and cares about the subject matter, but dull and not very class-aware--doesn't give the students enough time to take notes on his slides. He also made a comment about Africa creating more waste than the USA because it's 'underdeveloped', a fact that is both false and ignorant.",0
"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS. In fact, he loves to leave early and leave it up to his TA's to answer 57 questions from a class of 150. Pray that you have Brady as a TA.",0
"Linear algebra: Gupta does nothing to inspire students: reading straight off slides, he teaches computations and definitions s.t. when students like myself try to employ intuition he fails to understand our thought process. Neglects any curiosities you have in topics not directly addressed in the textbook. 3Blue1Brown will be your best friend.",0
"This has been one of my favorite professors I have had.  He is very open and blunt.  Very funny keeps things interesting, but also relates to things that are going on in class.  The only thing is he forgets where he is from class to class, so sometimes repetitive.",1
Professor Doyle gives roughly 4-5 discussion posts throughout the semester but only requires you to reply to 4. Weekly powerpoints and additional sources of information are provided alongside clear instructions for 3 2-4 page papers that are given at the start of the semester and due last day of class. Additional extra credit offered & study mater,1
I couldn't have asked for a better professor to introduce me to coding. He made java simple and he sparked my passion for coding. For Halloween he dressed up and did magic tricks. Tests were tough since they were handwritten code and the labs were just online exercises. Take if you want to learn.,1
Best teacher ever. Easy class and he makes it fun. If i could i would have him for everyclass,1
"Absolutely horrible professor. Completely unorganized, has no understanding of the concept of explaining assignments. Terrible at giving instruction and when asked for help, she's totally vague and doesn't help at all. Would NOT recommend this prof. Take another class.",0
"Professor Bair was very clear on what he wanted. Every assignment was clearly drawn out, which made it really easy to accomplish what he desired, and he sent an email every week with reminders. Very organized man. The in-class sessions were really boring, but if you can tough those out, I highly recommend taking him.",1
"Professor Moes was pretty chill tbh. Most of his lectures were interesting, but I never really read the book he wanted us to. The only grades we had were from 3 tests which were pretty easy as long as you filled out the study page. Attendance for me wasn't mandatory due to COVID, but you'd probably pass regardless. One thing though, he's p awkward.",1
"He is a terrible prof.  He may know the subject well but portraying it to students with very little mathematical background in the manor he did was horrible.  He has no control over the class, his accent is very thick, his exams are very hard which are multiple choice with no feedback.  The hw is online which makes it difficult to learn.",0
"If you are thoughtful with your responses, you will do good in this class. There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. He replies to emails quickly.",1
Marek is a terrible teacher. He is very hard to understand. His lessons do not make sense as well. I think he just wakes up and teaches on the fly. Ridiculous how Humber College still has him hired.,0
"I took her summer online class and she gave an extreme amount of homework. Her reading questions were basically all essay questions that were very difficult. She gives way to much reading and work to do for an introduction class. Also when you tried to ask a question she replies with a snarky comment which, made me never ask her anything again.",0
Dr. Formicola is the classic American university professor. Her class is difficult enough that you need to work for your A. She uses the Socratic method to help you draw your own conclusions out of the reading you've done. You MUST be prepared for class; if you haven't done the readings she will know and she will embarrass you. The best at SHU!,1
"He frequently uses profanity when talking to the class. If he feels the class is not ""alive enough"" he will give a pop quiz on a random topic that might not even deal with the class. He often does not stick to his course syllabus either, he makes up assignments and rules as he goes. I will make my best effort to not take one of his classes again.",0
NOPE. Don't do it.,0
"Dr. Cornish is honestly one of the best professors at UNI. She is SO caring and understanding. She really takes the time to get to know her students. Her classes are not challenging, come to class and you are fine. Even if you don't come to class read some material you'll be fine. I could talk about how wonderful she is all day. You will LOVE her",1
"Taking Physics 132 with professor Tewari was one of the worst choices in my UMass career. Every other professor in this course allows a cheat sheet during tests, she does not. She requires discussion attendance at strange times like 5:30 or 7:30pm when it could just be on opposite weeks of the lab she requires. Her accent makes it hard to focus.",0
"Prof. Lewis is the best professor Ive had in economics. He wants all of his students to succeed. His tests are quite long but he prepares you well for them. Take him if you can, excellent professor.",1
"Get on his good side and you are golden, otherwise good luck.",0
"At first, yes, her class discussions can be slow. But by the end, it will be your favorite class. It's never necessarily the most exciting conversation, but shes so anxious to help, and so down to earth that you'll be so glad to have learned the materials covered from her. She's really awesome, and kind of the Mom of the English Department.",1
His tests are super hard and you will never know your grades until the final. and other comments may written from him so be aware,0
Professor Pepper is very nice and easy going. She gives clear directions on what she wants and gives good feedback. Just do the homework and essays and you will be good. She allows rewrites on essays as well. She's also very funny. Take her!,1
"Ms. Mahon is nothing but amazing. She is the instructor we all need to get through this difficult course. Shes knowledgeable, caring, strict, and still able to demonstrates empathy. Ms Mahon genuinely wants to see her students pass and she gives you everything you need to do so. She my top recommendation",1
The quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and discouraging. The lecture slides were only a summary and to do well on the exam you were expected to kind of memorize every paragraph of the textbook just in case.,0
Her online course is one of the hardest to navigate which is ironic because of the class she teaches. If you ask about something on her course page that you couldn't find she'll make you go on a scavanger hunt through the clusterbomb of useless information on her page rather than taking 5 seconds to tell you. Also more homework than any class.,0
"The class itself is very hard and there were quizzes every week, but if you study hard, ask questions, and do the homework you will be fine. I will say, more than half the class dropped by the end of the semester. But if you hold on and stick through it you will find that his personality will truly come out and he cares heavily about your grade.",1
"Professor Mitchell is a pretty funny guy and definitely knows a lot about chemistry. However, he isn't too great at teaching the subject. His powerpoints and lectures seemed very jumbled and I couldn't follow along well. If you complete all of the homework and labs, it isn't too hard to pass, but the exams are very difficult. MUST study!!!!",1
"Awesome feedback.  Took the course online in the MHIT program, couldn't have asked for a better experience.",1
"Her lab quizzes are always fair and she goes over the procedure and major concepts before each lab. Shell answer any questions you have and makes a morning lab class fun, if possible she will let you out of class early.",1
"One of my favorite professors at Miami thus far. Tests are pretty much straight from lecture/powerpoints. Tests can be challenging, so go to class and take notes. Great fun and great guy.",1
"Stay far far away from this teacher. She does not care about her students at all, it's almost like she wants us to fail. Her tests don't match the curriculum and she feels no remorse for the class's failing averages on these ridiculous exams and quizzes she conjures up. In her mind, she is perfect and we are all, and I quote, ""brain dead"".",0
"Class has proctored pre and post-class quizzes. The exams are next to impossible. These exams are a majority of your grade, the final is worth 30%. A little bit of the information is in the book or in his powerpoints. Studied for a week and still barely passed an exam. Knowledgeable guy but awful professor. Take a different science to fill a prereq",0
"Terrible, Does not want to help you.  He talks down to you if you don't understand what he is teaching.  He goes around in circles and forgets what hes talking about.  Save yourself from this class.  I should have.",0
very frazzled and stressed woman. hates helping students not because she hates us but because she fears not having enough time to do her work. she will not forget simple requests (switching lectures) you make. sees you as a burden. needs to look into therapy and discover whether she can actually cope with university teaching.,0
"She is a great teacher, she is very helpful after class and especially if you miss something...optional study sessions are available for 30 bonus points...what's gunna be on the test is clearly told the day before the test",1
"  I would not take this class again. Professor is very blunt and seems clear, but when it comes to lab tests the material is not familiar. Lecture tests were okay, but I felt like Lab tests were an impossibility. I didn't know anyone who recieved an A on a lab exam, for that matter I didn't know one classmate who didn't agree with me. ",0
"Dr.Reiser-Danner is great she has her own workbooks which makes it easy to learn the concepts but you still need the textbook so you can look up Z-scores and stuff. She is very helpful and will explain a concept to you 10 times if thats what it takes. Nothing against Verrekia, or Gans but take STAT with Dr. R-D you wont regret it",1
"She has very high expectations. Her exams are hard. She will test you sometimes outside the book only from lecture. You will be lost after lecture. She does have curve quizes after every test so that is nice of her. She rushes through lecture and is intimidating to ask questions during her office hours. Overall, I dont recommend she made calc2 hard",0
"Very confusing lectures, he is all over the place. He gives homework that is not mandatory but only uses class time to go over that homework. Exams are hard and total surprises. Spends a lot of time talking about himself. Students are not his first priority.  Overall his class is just uncomfortable, take a different professor. ",0
"She's a very sweet woman to talk to as a friend but not as a teacher. In the beginning of class we would just talk, then go through the presentation, and then somehow land up talking about her life again. If you want to pass, you have to take a lot of notes, but honestly, its hard when her talking makes you want to curl up and go to sleep.",0
Literally the worst teacher I've ever had.  The only kinds of students that like him are those that are gullible enough to buy into his wannabe hippy mentality.  He just only teaches to live vicariously through his students and his not even slightly helpful unless you suck up to him on a daily basis.,0
"I wouldn't not recommend this class, though I wouldn't per se recommend it either. It has been the hardest class I've taken at UVa thus far. That said, I've learned a lot. He is a good lecturer and knows his stuff, and has a dry sense of humor. HIS TESTS ARE EXTREME!! I'm talking study all night and get a 65, extreme. Be wary.. All I'm saying...",1
"Definitely not a professor that I would recommend. She is not very nice, and is extremely unorganized. Everything is online, even the book. She does not respond to emails often, and when she does she is very passive aggressive. She should not be a professor. I have not learned a thing from her class.",0
"Syllabus says he wants you to be a great thinkers really, only if you think like him. This class was mundane. I didnt do my best work, and wanted this class to be over. Great thinkers get there points across with less words then he does. The syllabus was 20 pages for only half the semester. I did not learn anything from him. Waste of money. ",0
"I've taken two of her classes and really loved them both, but because she runs her class with a lot of small group discussion, its really important to be with other people who have done the required reading otherwise you'll be very bored. she offers extra credit on both the midterm and final so if you read and go to class, you'll do well",1
"He has his agenda like so many others here. And though he appears to be erudite, he cannot help but be married to his radical politics. Well this is UMass at Amherst. I cannot wait to get into classes about reality.",0
Second time taking him and I am now a sophomore class of 2017 and plan on taking him for the rest of my years here at Kean! He gives lots of opportunities to make sure you pass his class.,1
CARDIO CONDITIONING-SPIN CLASS. GREAT SPIN CLASS VERY CHALLENGING AND EDUCATIONAL. GREAT OVER ALL CONDITIONING ROUTINE AND HIGHLY MOTIVATING ATMOSPHERE. PROFESSOR MILBURN IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR/TRAINER AND ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE ATHLETES I HAVE SEEN IN ACTION. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER CLASSES.,1
"She was horrible, she treated and 1101 class like a grad class..she doesnt care about anyone and will willfully fail the entire class.",0
"Nice lady, but i didn't think she taught very well when it came to Math. I'm taking her again just because her time slot fits my schedule but i would much rather have someone else that fit my learning style. On the nicer side, math is math so if you dont learn from the teacher, maybe youll learn from a tutor. Best of luck! She's very nice though.",0
"Makes you buy a $90 access code just to access the homework which is 100 questions PER CHAPTER and you have 2-3 chapters due at a time. Crazy tedious work, each chapter takes about 2 hours to complete. STAY AWAY. Find someone easier.",0
"Great professor. Very friendly and open minded, which is very important  attributes for any sort science professor. In other words, he has no bias point of view. Plus, he's very logical, and at times he shares his personal information as examples to educated the class. One of the best CCP professor's I ever had.",1
"Hands down the worst professor I've ever had. He talks a big game and tries to sound smart by using a lot of random vocabulary but it just makes him sound like a jerk. He is so abstract and the criteria of the class is so unclear so you never know what you're doing. He is not willing to help his students, and just belittles you when you ask! 0/10",0
"Focuses on what the student(s) want; gives great, helpful feedback; efficient teaching style. Just be yourself and everything will be fine, and probably kind of funny.",1
Doesnt seem to care much about his work,0
Had her last winter. Always was unorganized and often seemed confused. After awhile stopped asking questions because she would never really answer them. Probably did not know the answers herself. Just went through the book myself. Should have just taken online.,0
"He took way too long to grade things & never followed the syllabus. His class didn't seem to have any structure or purpose. He often arrived late. He has a tendency to come off as arrogant, rude, &condescending. I asked him roughly how many sources should we use for our paper. He said, ""I shouldn't have to tell a college student that."" Um what??",0
"Worst online professor at CSUB!! Wont respond to emails or return your phone calls, only when he wants to. He makes you feel inferior as if your problems or circumstances are beneath him. Therefore, he does not give any help on retakes or hw assignments. Very unorganized and vague grader and person. Do NOT TAKE THIS GUY for an online class!    ",0
"The topic was interesting, the information was interesting. But it was very hard to pay attention in class because he would talk in circles frequently and has a very flat voice. He occasionally made funny jokes, but injected little of that life into his lectures. The tests were pretty easy, go to class you don't need to do most of the readings.",0
"Professor Bratcher was a great teacher to have. His course was structured and set up for success with clear direction. This pandemic has created a different learning environment but most importantly I really feel I retained the information with how discussions were woven into the class. Awesome, caring professor!",1
"Her scores are low but look at what class there for 11100. That's a hard section of math, in general, to pass b/c they're trying to cram a lot of info and homework in. Math 15300 is so much better. She is amazing. When she sees your trying but have a low-grade she'll work 1 on 1. She'll give encouragement and tips. Powerpoints are on point.",1
One of the most open-minded people i have ever met! Great teacher,1
"He's great! Talks about real-world scenarios, makes law interesting and teaches it the way you would understand it, not the way the book teaches it. Tests are a little hard, but he curves! 2 exams and 1 take-home quiz. I would recommend him!",1
"Some people were permitted late work and some weren't despite same reasons. Grading of drawings is inconsistent: a student loses 5 points for having a dimension line that is too long and another student loses 1 point for the same same line, same length. Why? I don't know. You teach yourselves, get others to help you. He does a short demo each day.",0
dont take her class. Shes terrible at grading. she takes forever to grade something she doesnt know how to explain anything.,0
"Professor Jackson was one to remember. He did a great job maintaining the students' attention, and assigning a consistent homework scedule. His grading is unique and based on points rather than percentage. A 93% can be a B which is a little odd. His homework can be challenging at times, his lectures long, but overall he is a great teacher.",1
"Morano reminds me of Anne Lamott...extremely endearing and neurotic.  A great professor, and also a great person to be around.  She has great critiques on your writing.  Take her.",1
"Professor Jackson or ""MJ"" is a perfect teacher for history. During the online summer course you will need to do reading, reading questions, lectures, discussion questions, & 4 exams. The readings & lectures will be on the exam. Exams are very specific so follow instructions & take advantage of the study guides. He is very accessible through email.",1
"she is really smart and really cute and so fashionable. but i don't really feel like i learned that much in her classes. the reading is great, but the assignments kind of suck. group presentations are pointless and the final research paper is hard to make relevant.",1
"One of my favorite teachers! She is so kind and helpful and really does want you to do well. 232 isnt an easy class in general, but she always answered any questions I have. She was a genuinely great professor, her lectures were engaging and she keeps it interesting. She cares about her students and is great at her job. Take her class!",1
He doesn't teach. Make sure you get your book and read it. Friends with programming experience always help too. Don't rely on Hoagland for any help at all. In fact if your really need a professor to talk to go see Randy Riness.,0
"He has tons of stories to tell which make up most of the lectures and keep things entertaining. Class is mainly graded off 4 exams that aren't too bad, most stuff is common sense. Lab is super easy and you only had to go 5 times.",1
If u r taking this class read everything in the sylabis! You will need it! if she gives u notes b prepared to take a pop quiz next class. Her notes are all over the place bring a recorder. Her tests are hard. STUDY THE TIME LINES! and yes she has favorites.,0
This guy can't teach. Period. I'm a comp sci major and had all A's in my comp sci classes until this one. He mumbles off slides and you can't hear what he's saying. His tests and projects don't reflect the material. Don't waste your time attending class. It's so boring. Just stay home and read the book.,0
"I took physics 4B in summer, and everyone said it is really a tough class. But, I would say he is the best Physics professor in SJCC. Just study regularly and he asked most of the questions from his lecture slides and quizzes. Although you have to buy webassign for homework, I would say it is really worth it.",1
"Prof. Scaltriti was honestly THE best Professor I have ever had. He is a native speaker with a sexy accent, so that made class more enjoyable. On the plus side, he is very handsome and that was a good motivation to study Italian. I hope I will have him next year! He is THE man!",1
"I loved Crawley both times I had him, for physiological psych and for psychological apps of stats. Tests are tough and there was a quiz every class for physio, but that was only to help us stay on track and ensure we were reading our books. You can tell he knows what he's doing and he loves it. He's always gone out of his way to help when needed!",1
"Great Professor, Wants to see you succeed and improve. The class was easy and helpful. It is an easy A as long as you try to learn how to play piano a bit. If he sees you know more than the average student he will challenge you with harder material if you would like. Adapts the class to you.",1
"Professor Kireyev has a lot of potential being a great professor if that is what he chooses to do, what I would recommend to him (if he reads this) is to slow down during lectures because he FLIES through topics which leaves little time to ask questions even though you may be confused. Overall he knows what he's talking about and is accessible.",1
he rocks!! friendly and most helpful.. he always has a solution to any problem you have.. knowledgeable- and always smiling!!,1
"Professor Hurley is the quite possibly the best teacher and best person at Massbay. A solid portion of class is spent on him telling hilarious jokes and life stories, and he still manages to cover all the material with time to spare. 2 take home quizzes, and 2 exams, all of which are open book and are a breeze if you've kept up with the homework.",1
"Tries to maintain a balance between liberal and conservative political interpretations, but is definitely left-leaning. She is open-minded about politics, but the care ethic is very strong in her. There is A LOT of reading for this class and so if you aren't inherently interested in the subject, take a different class. Grading depends on your TA.",1
"I had to take this class for major credit and I'm stuck having to retake it. He doesn't teach other than boring recorded lectures that are confusing and don't give a good grasp of concepts. He doesn't give a study guide and tells you to use Mindtap to study for exams, no help from him. Mindtap heavy, 40% of your grade and you have to google a ton.",0
"She assigns one hour documentaries for homework and 3 hour democratic debate. You get quizzed on student presentations on very tiny specific details. Instead of teaching, she shows video clips during class and prepare for it to show up on the quiz. The quizzes are easy except for when specifics questions are asked about video clips or presentations",0
Good class.  Great teacher.  ,1
"He is one of the smartest, most genuine professorsteachers I've had, though his lectures and assignments can be baffling they do push you to learn about yourself and your environment in new ways. ",1
"I am confident in my belief that those who wrote negative reviews for Mrs. Liu did not apply themselves or pay attention in her class and then blamed her for their bad grades. Calculus is tough sometimes, but Mrs. Liu only tests you on the concepts that you should be an expert on, as long as you go to class.",1
Only had Scordilis for the last few weeks of EEN112.  Subject matter was fairly difficult and he didn't explain MATLAB too well; assumed that we already knew the basics.  Always go to class; he calls on students who look lost to answer difficult questions.,1
"This man is the most precious thing you will ever see.  He doesn't let anyone get below a B in his class, and it's not like anyone ever could.  He is someone you want to adopt as a grandfather.",1
"Dr. Rodrigues is caring and accessible outside of class. He also draws heavily on his immigrant experience making lectures interesting.  Group projects are a large part of the class including the final, and there are no individual grades on these projects. He tries to address tough social issues (racism) but clearly leans politically liberal.",0
"She is a very nice lady, but I would NEVER take her again! Totally disorganized and barely teaches! I was excited to take this class & learn some new skills, but instead I wasted a whole bunch of money & time on nothing. She would come in, take attendance, tell you to look at the posted assignments & then leave her student assistant to do it all.",0
Super hard to understand (accent). Not very helpful. A good guy though...,0
"The homework, exams, and lab could trip you up if you're expecting a blow-off class, but otherwise its great.  Looney is very enthusiastic and the course is full of interesting content",1
"There are weekly homework assignments, two take home exams and a 10 page paper. The take home assignments take A LOT of time to finish. He is helpful if you ask a question, but not always very clear. ",1
"LA is the best professor at Carleton. She sets up the course so that students have a chance to succeed if they work hard. She has an amazing background & is helpful in every way. I would LOVE to have the chance to take another course with her, and I am signing my fiance up in her class for the fall!",1
"Forget It. I have my SEC Licenses (Series 7, 55, 63, 66) and he even confused me; Did I mention I'm a Finance Major and Financial Professional? Does not comprehend the phrase, ""Prior engagements"". His exams are verbatim his handouts. STUDY THEM/COPY THEM. The tests are still impossible but if you do not remember the handouts, good luck passing.",0
Lets his classes decide when things are due and also lets the class decide when an amendment to a due date needs to be made. Unfortunately lecture is a part of the class you can't skip but he was entertaining enough to hold my attention through 3 weekends of classes. Fair grader with lots of feedback. Would definitely take him again!,1
"I've taken several classes with Katey and liked every one. She connects material to life and clearly wants us to understand and do well. I think her lectures are interesting most of the time and she's pretty funny. Her tests can be tough sometimes, but if you go to class, pay attention, and study a bit, you'll be ok.",1
"i have been at uccs for 5 years... was working on my last two classes and this was the WORST class i have taken. it was not the actual class, but more the professor. she has no clarity in what she wants from students in their writing. nothing ever seemed good enough for her.she is defensive and can be quite rude.",0
"He makes simple topics very difficult to understand; you're better off teaching yourself. He is kind of rude when approached with a question, and isn't clear.",0
"Josh will give great advice when you ask him directly, but he will not spoon feed it to you, you have to be actively involved in his classes to get ahead. Overall he does an amazing job of both explaining and teaching the material and he is a great resource both in and out of class.",1
He really knows his field.  He is tough but fair.,1
"Only a few moodle assignments at the beginning and then a midterm and final. He's very vague and wouldn't give you exact definitions of terms, but these terms would show up on the exams. Wouldn't take him again because I don't feel like I learned anything and this was supposed to be an easy LBST.",0
Good teacher does a lot of hands on work!!  Lets you take test at home before you actually take it in class.,1
"the worst class i have taken at oberlin.  wow, so painful.  i got As on all my papers and a B+ in the class... she just overlooked it.  said nothing that i couldn't think up or read.  not a fan",0
"This is hands down the best Prof I have ever had! He actually cares if his students are learning, and takes the pressure away from the letter grade. It is so refreshing to be in a class where my Prof has my back. All he wants is for you to succeed. If you want to learn from a professional in a comfortable environment, then Mr. Hurley is for you.",1
Just memorize random facts from his book and you will do fine on the exams - if you have sharp memorization skills. There's actually little to no actual learning about NUTRITION in this class. It's basically Biochemistry 2.0. I am disappointed because the instructor failed at articulating the material in lectures. Just memorize his book.,0
Really nice. I had problems with the TA marking unfairly and she read my essay and put it a grade up. She is very approachable and fair.,1
"Yarwood gives no guidance and no assignment is clear and outlined. She also has awkward encounters, is easily confused, and constantly makes a pained face when shes talking to students. I know that sounds picky but when you are asking for help and she looks like shes in pain its frustrating. Also her lectures are terrible",0
"Definitely found him intimidating. He's not happy if the class, in general, doesn't do well on a test or if nobody knows the answer to something. He lectures A LOT within a 50 minute period and writes everything on the board. He goes over the material relatively quickly. Do the WebAssigns as they will help. Just wasn't a great prof for me.",0
This was an easy class before I got to this guy...He made everything difficult and made tons of mistakes which made me have to follow up all the time just to make sure that I got the grade I deserved....I was doing my job as a student and his by constantly having to correct everything...Forget it...,0
"Uncle Bijan is a JMU institution. This class was difficult but in the best way; his material is very informative and actually relevant to your life. Exams are hard but there is always a generous curve, and your ""savings account"" points will boost your grade. I respect him so much and it was a gift to experience his lectures. Please take him!",1
This was an easy class thanks to the clear instructions given by the professor. I understood the material well because of the examples that were given out which helped with the exams and homework.,1
"ethics of education is sooo boring. she is very monotone and unclear. the tests are ridiculous (and i went to class and studied). the readings are ambigious and very boring. the only fun part of the class is going to teach at the school. and that's mostly bc dr. wike isn't talking. she's very smart, just boring.avoid if possible",0
"I wouldn't recommend him for IFT372. His exams are mostly confused because most of them are different than from homework, previous quiz, and study guide. He doesn't teach well for IFT372... class average for every quizzes & exam were failing. Also, this class doesn't have pre-requisite.",0
"Shah is a great professor. He gives great feedback throughout the semester as you work on the group project and has a really big personality. Definitely made lecture enjoyable, which isn't an easy thing to do. Definitely my favorite professor in the J School so far.",1
"Professor O'Hara is a good professor. There are 12 quizzes, a blog (which you must keep throughout the semester covering government issues in a local city), two in class stories, and a final exam of 50 questions. It's not a hard class if you read the chapters each week and complete the blog.",1
"I really liked professor Fox. I feel like ""advanced grammar"" isn't going to be fun no matter who is teaching it but she made it very easy with all the handouts and helpful methods to actually understand the grammar. Very dedicated to her students and is always willing to help when you don't understand something",1
"Took her for spanish fourth semester and the class itself is pretty repetitve and boring, but shes a good teacher and tries to make the class interesting. Pretty Easy to get a good grade if you follow instructions and participate. Homework isn't that bad. The only complaint would be that she doesn't really help you prepare for tests.",1
"Sadly the lack of reviews on this guy led me to take his class due to this class being set in the morning. First off, he relies heavily on the book to teach which isnt great because his tests barely reflect what you were taught and was supposed to learn by doing the homework. Also very inconsistent. Overall, take someone else.",0
"Thank God he only does labs. Despite having a Ph.D, he works below Cebelak who only has an M.S. There is a reason for this. I've never seen someone turn a 45 minute lecture into an eternity in hell like Ming wang. He barely speaks english which is probably why Cebelak types an entire lecture on the lab papers each week. Just read his instructions.",0
"If you know any C++ you will do very well in the class.  He was the most lazy ""professor"" Ive ever taken.  DONT TAKE HIM!",0
"I don't think it matters how hard you study- in taking her tests I used information from her slides, the textbook, and information from other class textbooks and still received below a B on all exams. She doesn't tell you what you did wrong, just takes marks off. She can't use technology and trails off in the middle of her sentences.",0
"Professor Webster takes a boring subject and makes it even worse. He rambles on and on and on, not teaching you a single thing. He grades essays hard. His exams are complete BS (quote identification- aka the hardest thing ever). The only good thing about his class was that you barely had to do the reading because he would forget to talk about them.",0
"She is such a wonderful Professor!  So kind and enthusiastic about the material, it is amazing.  She really wants each student to do well and I am so glad to have taken her class.  Truly a great Professor.",1
So attendance is not necessary all the powerpoints are online but she does take into consideration your attendance and participation. If you were smart you would come to class she has a very clear way of explaining what the powerpoints are about. Each of her exams and quizzes have opportunity to gain extra points. She makes psych interesting!!!!!!,1
"Easy class with interesting material. Class is made up mostly of getting into groups and discussing readings, not much real work.",1
"This class is incredibly difficult.  Dr. Grange was available during his office hours to assist with homework problems and explain things, so take advantage of that.  Lecture is typically straight off the powerpoint, but don't think that it's a good reason to skip class.  He curves at the end of the semester.",1
"Deb is awesome.  One of the best professors at Skidmore.  I had no interest in learned Graphic Design and ended up loving it in the end.  I learned so much from her and now feel like I can do anything on the computer in Photoshop, quark and freehand.  I recommend everyone at skidmore takes her class",1
"An Honours Thesis with Dr. Rich provided a challenging opportunity which was enriched through regular meetings with her lab composed of graduate students and post-docs. Dr. Rich is a very fair marker who clearly presents the grading rubric and expectations. If you are diligent and work hard, an A+ is easily obtainable.",1
This has been THE single hardest class I have ever taken at Creighton. The classroom environment is intimidating and very demanding. This is a capstone course so you have to get a 'C' to graduate. He treats the class like a Stanford MBA course. I would avoid his class at any cost! Look for Laura Mizaur who also teaches it. Midterm average= 36%,0
"I had this teacher for both Bio 140 and Bio 324. She's not very good at teaching anything as she just reads off of power points every class. She seldom gives any kind of practice before exams. Especially this last semester in quarantine she didn't do anything to help accommodate students, she gave even less instruction and basically went silent.",0
"For a level 100 gen-ed class , she treats the class as if it's a level 400 class. I had more work in this class then in my upper-level major courses. There is little to no clarity on what is expected from you and the materials that are needed. If you need help, don't ask as you will only be ridiculed for asking. Godspeed to all who take her course.",0
Take Voice and Movement !!! It's sweeter than HONEYYYY ����,1
"she's so hilarious when she required too many papers and heavy test. her guideline wasn't clear, I didn't know which ones was reliable textbook. the test's instruction was confused, she gave the MCQ sheet at the beginning of the test, later on when you finished the MCQs and thought you've done with the test, then she gave you the essay paper",0
"She knows her stuff but gets so distracted, class never actually got going until 20 mins late, she constantly told us about a topic and then said that it would come later in the course .... so why did she bring it up! Took finals in dec I had papers from sept that were not graded. If possible I suggest taking her class online.",1
he is the easiest teacher ever.  forest gump would make an A if he slept thru class,1
He is not a good teacher. He doesn't know how to express what he wants to teach. Whenever someone gives a wrong answer he just kinda scoffs at the student and he brings the down them down for giving a wrong answer. All of his homework is for accuracy so if you don't understand it in class your basically screwed. One of the worst teachers at GV.,0
"I have never cried in public before taking his class. He printed copies of my paper out and passed them around the class as an example of what not to do. Did not even show the mercy of whiting out my name. English is not my major, but I believe I'm a decent writer. He told me I had to start an entirely new paper and write it like ""an adult."" I'm 28",0
"great guy, very helpful, very understanding, comes to the bar crawl with the students at the end of the semester",1
"Very fun classes, she is a 5 foot nothing indian origin human, very often she has fun experiments she will ask for volunteers, my friend and I would always raise our hands and she knew or names by the end of the semester, she does prs so u dont have to be there but atleast have a friend do it for you, your answers dont have to be correct.She gave u",1
"to the prev. rater: i suggest you pay attention in lecture as well as read the text. 1/3 questions from each...the other 1/3 are random, educated guesses needed..not too hard to pull at least a B. curve is insane",0
"I have to say, Richard Lewis the comedian isn't quite as funny, Richard Duller!!",0
"Francis is very knowledgeable in his subject area. Though, he is not a native English speaker his ability to impart knowledge to his students is very rewarding. You will find his class very lively if you have some High School math foundation. He provides many worked examples, which are very helpful for the midterm and final exams. ",1
1. He does not understand a thing about what he's teaching;    2. He does not understand your codes either;    3. Constantly asks for help from the student next to him and 'his old friend'--google;    4. Takes points off for no reason he could explain;    5. Read directly from class notes he posts;    6. Can't prepare you ready for anything.,0
"4th year in orchestra. Great repertoire, terrible ensemble- mainly because there is gap in talent. The winds are solid; strings are all over-1st violin are great. McClure takes SLOW tempi, is boring, biased, and strict. Great musical exposure but little to learn from this stubborn man.",0
"Her online class is the easiest class i've taken.  You will learn how to use word, powerpoint, excel, access, on myitlab, and have a test on all 4 parts. Besides that you have to participate in discussions, take 3 easy exams, and other easy assignments. Nothing you can't handle. She's also replies on a timely manner to your messages. RECOMMENDED!",1
"I took this class online. It was very easy and interesting. If you do the work, you'll do fine. She is a very fair grader.",1
"Marty is a great professor he is very exuberant, yet humble.  You will learn a lot in his class; he always manages to keep your attention with historical examples or personal anecdotes. Be sure to read the text he assigns, and show up for class on a regular basis and you will be fine.",1
"She means well, but she had a very hard time with my class. Good deal of online work. There is a lot of self study needed for this class. Its almost like teaching yourself. ",0
Great professor to have.  Explains everything really well and will even explain it different ways if everyone in the class does not understand fully.  Follows the syllabus directly - well organized and thorough. Definitely plan to take him again. Nice that he is a working paralegal to share experiences.,1
"You will do very well in this class if you have just come out of high school Algebra and are a A student. I found this instructor to be difficult because She didn't give out homework assignment right away. One time she didn't post the homework for eight hours. The second exam hours were written on the white board as 9AM-12, at 11:15 test stopped",1
"Rambles a lot in class which he describes as concrete examples to the theories but really he's just trying to showcase the fact that he knows a lot of things. He doesn't ""teach"". The worst part is class presence is mandatory but at least he lets you use your laptop so you can do other school work. Also, tough grader and without feedback.",0
"Internship...what a joke.  This was the easiest class every.  Turn in your journals, do your final paper, evaluate yourself, that is it.  What a waste of money.  Jokes on the company that I worked for.  They pay for my classes, so they payed for my internship and paid me.  HA.",1
Shaikh Karim is lovely. he explains Arabic well. I like him. I hope to marry him and become Muzlim. Love you teacher KOKO!,1
She definitely understands her subject but she very hard to understand. I think she is from Bangladesh originally. Due to the boring nature of the subject and her accent you will probably find yourself drifting off in her class. Her tests are hard but the quizzes are easy because they aren't proctored.,0
"Kind of a useless professor, it is possible to learn everything she has said in statistics on your own.  I had her for Child/Adolescent Psychology as well... you would do well to avoid these classes if you can!",0
Super smart guy. But doesnt really communicate his knowledge to students well. Not everyone is capable of teaching and this guy is one of them. Just reads the slides to the class then passes out a worksheet. Be prepared to do loads of reading and work on your own. The only reason I passed was having seen most of this material in high school.,0
Rambles on about nothing. His view is the only one that matters. If you don't agree with him you are wrong. He wants everyone to be ashamed of themselves if they are not living out of a dumpster. If you can take anyone else do it!,0
Sweet guy. AWESOME CLASS!! EASIEST A EVER!!!!!! Quiet.  A lot of time to do your essays (could be 1 page as long as they were decent). Simple binder check at end. Lots of movies. Gets out early. Need the book. Can get away with missing 1 or 2 days. Not good if you want discussion or feedback on your work. WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE! Be respectful.,1
I loved this teacher! She was very nice and understanding towards students. You could tell that she wanted every student to get a good grade and helped everyone to the best of her abilities.,1
"Lectures are boring, VERY boring. He's funny. You don't have HW other than online quizzes, which don't matter that much because the tests run the grades basically. This was the only class I could not get an A in no matter how much I studied or tried. There's no curriculum, no method or comprehension. If you can memorize a lot of stuff you're good.",0
"This class was a joke. The lab was just another lecture, we didn't do any hands-on activities. He posts homework late on Friday (due Monday) and posted his PowerPoints with all of the important info blacked out. He ignores in-class questions and doesn't explain things well. From what I hear over half the class is failing, this is a 100 level class.",0
"Quite possibly the worst professor I've ever met. Her entire class is sooo unorganized. She gave us a syllabus with upcoming assignments, but she always changes the prompts of the essays. She never gives us the exact prompt for the essays and expects us to write something she'll like. Also, essays and due dates are just thrown at you...",0
I had this teacher for several classes. She was pretty unpleasant. Didn't like to help people with questions. The readings were good though.,0
"Professor Spainhour can be a stringent grader, but she means well and is always fair. The content she teaches is very relevant and useful for a communications major. Just attend class and do the readings and you will do fine in her course.",1
"She has a bad attitude. She makes a lot of unnecessary comments, snarky remarks and jabs at students for literally no reason, it makes the class environment uncomfortable and makes you not want to participate. She explains things well. If you listen youll understand. But shes very harsh when even though its only a freshman/beginner course.",0
"By far the worst professor I ever had. HE is not organized, rude when a question is asked, hard tests.. you won't learn in his class, there are many other great professor teaching this course,",0
I wish Id have rated Professor Epstein back when I completed this course in 2017. His class was extremely enjoyable and though he over-elaborated at times it always related to class topics. He was always ready to answer a linguistics question and was very kind. I wish that I could have taken another of his classes.,1
"Takes attendance every class. Lectures tend to run upclose to the end. He's old school - no powerpoints, no use of iLearn whatsoever so you are unable to access any of the pictures or info that he shares. He speaks monotone. Seems grumpy all the time. Handwriting illegible.  I boughtused the Red CR.  Midterms: A-, B+ Overall Grade: B+",0
"Very hard teacher, acts as if you should already know everything he is teaching you. Does not give study guides, and tests are nothing like the hw on connect. Very rude and if you ask him a question he answers with a mean response and makes you feel stupid. Every test had a mean of 50 or less. Would not take a class from him ever again.",0
"I feel that Professor Curtiss is a very underrated professor, she is very helpful, offers a ton of extra credit and really wants you to do well in the class. The class was really not that hard, I would recommend her again.",1
"Unfortunately, GVSU offers one CIS260 section a semester, and it's taught by Lowell. During his hybrid class during COVID19, he did not upload weekly lecture videos as he had indicated in his syllabus. He said we could use the videos in place of in-person class if we needed to quarantine. Later, he blamed our struggles on us missing classes.",0
"Honestly one of the easiest classes you'll ever take, but also very informing. I looked forward to going and learning about a different culture. Your grade consists of facebook posts through the class group, and commenting at least 10 times on other peoples post. You also write a 3-4 page paper as a final but other than that no exams or anything.",1
Study guides are useless as tests are very different from the guides themselves. The fact that you fail if you get below a 60% in the class even though you have a good enough grade is just odd.,0
"I took Intro to Management Information Systems over a mini-term. I learned a little bit in the class. (I already knew a lot about computer systems, I clepped out of Intro to Computer Science.) I enjoyed the class. Dr. Sims is a very humble man and a good professor.",1
"This class is such an important course and it's unfortunate this man is allowed to ""instruct"" it. No participation from prof or respose to emails. Course is self guided. Read intense text. Watch his uploaded youtube prompts which may or may not connect to material, answer essay questions. Repeat. GRCC has really let it's standards slide.",0
"I retook this class after getting an F. If you don't attend class I don't think you'll pass with a high grade. For almost every homework and exam he gives ""hints"" which if you can do, you'll do fine in his exams since those are more or less the questions on the exam. Also you can take a cheat sheet for the exams.",1
"Knowledgeable on the subject, gives good feedback, although you might have to ask for it. Discussion posts are the main place to apply learning. quizzes are 3-attempt and you see the answers you missed. Lectures are recorded and can be played up to 2x speed (I recommend it, he's a slow talker). Great guy, good class, easy and learned a lot.",1
"c:lots of hw,shes rude (says whatever comes 2 her mind+often insults people),boring b/c her teaching style is unstructured+all she does is talk and make fun of people,refuses to go over the readings in textbook+write on the board because she says that we should have learned it  already. p:allows u 2 give hw 1 day late. overall advice:dont take her!",0
"I didn't know what to expect going into a class on Native American literature, but it turned into my favorite class of my program so far. She cares, is easy to talk to, and excited about what we read.",1
"She's such a great teacher so helpful in General Bio lectures, gives plenty of extra credit sometimes the work can get difficult, you really do need to pay attention in class but if you do then not much studying outside class is needed, just the homework. i don't know about lab though. .",1
"The worst class I have ever taken. Exams every single week at the testing center, you get 3 tries though. Need to complete two seminars (invitation only) to even be eligible for an A, one for a B. Clicker quizzes every class. Textbook MANDATORY even to bring to class or you cannot complete assignments. Save yourself and just dont take it.",0
"Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!",0
Best Class ever! I enjoyed the way Professor Jasek-Rysdahl taught the class. He made economics easy to understand. If you pay attention and do the study guide then you won't have trouble passing the exams.,1
"never take this class, we learned things in class, and BAM they were not on the exam. very one sided and did not care to hear her opinions.",0
"Prof. Potvin is a nice guy but I feel like Physics with modeling is more suited for people who have taken some kind of physics before and have a core understanding of it. Like others have said there is very little that gets taught, instead you are supposed to work in groups and figure out the information with only a few LA/TA to help you as needed.",1
"If you still know SOME math from HS, take her, shes really nice and helpful.Her tests are decently hard, especially later on. A lot of HW is on MathXL which is nice because you can ALWAYS get 100% if you redo the problems.If you havnt taken math in 10+ years,you probably dont want to take her, and should take a starter math course.Dont buy the book",1
"Sue is a great professor, she makes this class easy. Her tests can be difficult as she puts too many questions on it for the time she gives us. The worst part about her is the fact that she hasnt graded anything since January and we now have one week till finals so no one knows what their grades are. Very bad at staying on top of grades",1
"Neil is very smart, very organized, and very particular.  However, he's a wonderfully nice guy and seems to enjoy what he's doing.  He's always happy to help and while some of the activities we did in class were a kind of tedious, this was probably the most fun lab I've ever had.  Neil's great!!",1
He should be a literature lecturer in stead of a science or engineering lecturer. He keeps using fancy words and tends to make simple concept complicated. His teaching is very disorganized. 50% of the questions given in homeworks are not learnt or practise before.,0
Gabriella Pozzi is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had. She has good intentions and wants all of her students to succeed. She is a very tough grader when it comes to essays. Your rough drafts are weighted more than your final drafts so it can be detrimental to your grade if you have an erroneous first draft. I would take her class again.,1
"He was impossible to understand. He didn't clarify his assignments, but he would critique them very harshly. Group presentations ended up being arguments with him after he interrupted the 10th time. If I asked him for help, he would explain it rudely and it was completely unhelpful. Lectures were awful and long. He's so harsh, he has to use Plan B.",0
"I loved this professor. She was always super nice, tests were really easy to me. Read the material, do the homework and go to lectures.",1
"Professor Zhang was awful. His accent is IMPOSSIBLE to understand. He is way too smart to teach the material well. I got an 88 on the first test, and it all went downhill when the material got harder. I failed this class miserably and re-took it with professor Stephen Wuor and passed with a B! He was the best professor I have ever had!!!",0
WORST PROFESSOR EVER! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER! She grades insanely hard and gives you no chance to save your grade. She is unclear on what she wants you to write in your essays. Even if you turn it in early and fix all of your mistakes she gives you a bad grade! The lowest grade I have ever received! AND SHE IS RUDE IF YOU ASK FOR HELP!,0
"Class lectures aren't that interesting. Lots and lots of reading for every single class period. Only one large paper to write, but smaller writing assignments throughout the semester and in class writing.",1
"Friendly professor, very interesting material if you care about Africa.  Experienced, knowledgeable and forms individual relationships with most students.  Highly recommend! I love this class.",1
"Professor Carbone treats his students like they work for the weather Chanel. Not clear in his explanations or lectures. Attendance is a must if you just want to pull out a C to get credit. For an intro Climate class, it is beyond difficult. Test involve concepts that were barley touched in lecture. Textbook is $250+. Weekly journal entries. Avoid!!",0
"Marc's an excellent professor.  He's very good at facilitating class discussion, particularly at drawing important points out of sometimes incoherent student responses.  His classes usually run a little behind his schedule, but definitely worth it.",1
Great professor. Probably one of the best I've ever had. Tough grader but very helpful and always willing to meet you outside of class. There isn't formal participation grades but she will raise or lower your grade at her discretion depending on your participation. Highly recommend her if you want to learn a lot.,1
"She will tell you exactly what will be on the exams. Lectures are a bit boring though. She has a tough to e explaining several topics. I went to other's help sessions to get better explanations. Overall she's ok, and you can get a good grade, even if you don't understand the material.",1
"Makes her lessons clear, but doesn't take a lot of extra time to explain things, so make sure to pay attention and ask questions when you can! uses ALEKS for homework which ends up being alot of work but helps you to grasp the material well. Overall a nice teacher but doesn't go easy on late assignments",1
"Never does example problems. Is not clear on HW, quiz, or test expectations. Tests are brutal. Reads (in the quietest voice ever) a Powerpoint presentation for the whole lecture, then you go home and teach yourself with the book. May add points to the tests (since everyone fails) but does not curve. ",0
Very informative class. Instructor encouraged the discussion and expression of differing viewpoints in light of common ground.,1
"This professor was honestly one of the best I've had. His lectures actually inspired me to go into a major in psych. Attendance isn't mandatory but his tests are lecture-based, mostly. I actually never wanted to miss class because of how good the lectures were. I think this was his last semester, though. Thankful to have taken his course!(:",1
"By far the worst instructor I've had in my entire scholastic career. Read out of the book during ""lectures."" Attempted to cover the entire text by racing through it, never focusing on any rule of evidence. Failed to teach how to apply evidence to the real world. Last class threw NY exceptions at us in 45 min. Ridiculous exam. Avoid at all costs!",0
"Students in the class get bored easily. She just talks and talks with no attempt to connect with the students. There is no real connection because Moore, herself, is not passionate about teaching, at least that is how it appears.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIM! I am warning you!!! He is the worst... seriously... save yourself, your GPA, your money, and your time!!!!!!!",0
Great professor. Easy on the eyes too!,1
"Terrible professor, mumbles constantly, reads directly from slides and does not stop to ask if there are any questions.  He just assumes that everyone knows exactly what he's talking about.  I cannot believe that the univeristy is still allowing him to teach.  Don't go to class it'll just be a waste of your time.",0
Worst professor EVER!  Don't waste your time with this awful option. If you have no other option but to take this professor change your major.,0
"This professor was amazing! I took him last fall and although he was intimidating at first, he made it extremely comfortable to speak to him and in class. I enjoyed his lectures and have actually registered for the other two classes he offers despite them not being required for my degree. I highly recommend him to anyone who's willing to do it.",1
"This is one of the best professors I had in my MBA program. He was able to convert the whole class into a team whose members would help each other and think ""out of the box."" Students can get a lot out of the time invested in the class. Professor James supports his students in any possible way and gives multiple opportunities to get a good grade.",1
"Ne prenez jamais Lawrence Olivier. Incompréhensible, CONFUS, il est perdu comme ca ce peux pas. Les textes qui nous donne sont incomplet, parfois en vieux français, il ne donne pas d'explication, fait juste lire les textes en classe... Bonne chance pour vos travaux, vous ne savez pas comment faire? Lui non plus.",0
Don't expect to get a good grade .,0
"I took during the COVID pandemic & hadn't taken math in 8 years. Breaks down the basic concepts and makes it very comprehensive and interesting. Participating does matter. Gotta put in the effort, which counted in the end. Very responsive & explains the path to the correct answers, which is very helpful. He was recommended by friends. Na regerts",1
"Professor Neff is an absolute gem! He not only stays after class to hear every student's voice, but his few essays are all about your free, unique ideas. His classes are debate-formatted where the entire class is usually a 30 minute anecdote about his own philosophical ideas paired with an open debate about what was read the previous night.",1
"Just horrible. Completely incomprehensible, two enormous projects in the last week of classes without any explanations, makes you feel useless in her feedbacks, really  really low average grades for the whole class.. Don't take her by any means, run as fast as you can!",0
Its an intro to accounting so material is the same between professors. Very helpful professor willing to meet with students. Tells you exactly what will be on exams so if you don't study blame yourself. Got 100s on every exam but many classmates did not do as good. Just study the material an you'll be fine.,1
Richard Allen is not a super easy A at all but his tests are very straight forward. I went to class 0 times but watched the lectures and never struggled on an exam,1
"Dude is cool enough, but his tests are insanely difficult and not at all like his study guide. Took during Summer A, so granted could be easier if taken during a full semester. Lab is boring and pointless but easy.",0
"The quizzes are very difficult to pass. They are online and open book, but I would suggest doing them in groups to pass them. The homework is pretty easy. Dr. O's lectures aren't that great, but he knows his stuff.",1
Not the best. So- so,0
Shes an organic freak,0
"Dr. Strange is a very knowledgeable and entertaining professor. Class is interesting and often hilarious. I didn't find his tests particularly hard, especially since he offers bookoos of extra credit for showing up to lecture. If you have even the slightest interest in the outdoors, then I highly recommend FWF 250.",1
Marching band with Mr. Youngblood was not at all as difficult as I expected. The band is fairly laid-back and you never are punished with running or push-ups. He does a great job of making band a positive community!,1
"Her lectures can be very boring and she only outlines so be prepared to take very good notes. The tests can be tricky and there are only 3 so it is very important that your study HARD for them. Overall not bad, but I wouldn't want to take another class with her.",1
"I have taken her three times now. Great lady, always brings treats to class. The classes she teaches are usually meant to be the ""easy"" classes but she expects you to work for your grade. I've spent more time and effort on some of her classes than I had in classes that I cared about. Many other professors were supposedly much easier.",0
He is a fun teacher that does a fair job of explaining questions that people have. If you are doing bad at first don't worry there is a lot of opportunity for extra credit at the end. Homework is optional and is not graded. He rarely gives partial credit for problems so make sure to recheck your work. He was a lot of fun and I would recommend him.,1
"She was amazing. Favourite professor by far! Very easy to talk to, very kind hearted, but make sure you go to class as she incorporates many in-class examples in the test. ",1
He uses his own material that is easily accessible. Exams are open-book but it really won't help because the problems can be really confusing at times.  Key to success- keep your head  and follow your instinct,1
"Great teacher, the school needs more like her",1
"I had Deb apart of an asynchronous class. I cannot speak of her in person but as for online I definitely would switch out ASAP. She isnt very good with technology, its rather difficult to reach her, expect you to memorize your entire biology book so good luck, her online lectures are awful and dont provide half of the material covered on exams.",0
"Dr. Liu was able to take a difficult subject and explain its concepts in a clear way by using physical objects and applying them to real world applications.  He made a basically boring subject interesting, and really cared about his students understanding the subject matter.",1
There is no reason you shouldn't get an A in this class. Main project is very confusing though. Class has no exams or anything. Discussion based and you don't even have to participate. Only required to blog a little each week. Soo easy. Recommend as a breadth requirement definitely. Students can change rules and choose topics. Nice guy.,0
"She was very helpful. You need to do a lot of work in her class on your own, but thats math. I suggest going through each section before class the day of or night before. Do homework to get ready for quizzes and if you are doing well on quizzes exams go well and are really easy. Exams are major for points but have 10% worth of extra credit on them",1
"Don't take him for math! He's a computer teacher, not algebra, and he can't explain anything. Despite this he was very nice, made lots of beer jokes, and tried to help as much as possible. He was just not meant to teach math. Only take this if you need math courses beyond it or remember a LOT from high school algebra, otherwise take MATH127. l",0
"Had to take a poetry class for my minor and even though I went in disinterested, she really changed my mind. She's a published poet herself which is cool and the readings she posts are diverse. Easy grader, she'd say it herself that you have to try to do badly to get a bad grade.",1
"Very helpful with compositions- very fun prof, easy to understand",1
Very solid teacher. Partovi is very knowledgable and he really tries to focus the class on the person who know the least which is a nice review. There were only three tests and a final paper though so you do need to do well on the assignments.,1
Super scatter brained professor. Understand all the concepts but has some difficulty driving home the ideas for students to understand. I honestly when to class just to hear is crazy analogies. Take him for FIN 422! ,1
"Her lectures provide almost no information on what is tested and the tests are almost entirely the textbook content so you will need the book. The tests are open book (can use your computer) and there is no final exam. Colleen is a really lively prof and lets you know what you will have to know. Always have your computer during tests, itll save u",1
He is brilliant.,1
AVOID THIS TEACHER! horrible teacher and doesn't help at all! Went to him for help and he told me to find someone in the class who has an A (there were 80 people in the class) Studied for weeks and never missed class yet I still got a C. Treats this class like a graduate class. Tests are extremely hard and confusing,0
Easy class I guess... but he gives a ton of homework and kind of a picky grader..,0
Hahn is honestly a really nice guy but the class is graded solely on 3 exams so you really have to work for it. Talk to him after class so he knows youre putting in the effort and do the extra credit and you should be okay. Its hard but doable!,1
"Clarence Ball is one of the most caring professors I have ever had. He saw that we cared about our project so he gave us all his time to coach us and make us a great presenting team. Additionally, he saw that I was struggling and had a private coaching session with me, which helped me drastically improve. He is a great guy and a great teacher.",1
Matt was an awesome teacher. he was very helpful and made psych very interesting.,1
"I usually get As and Bs, hardest professor. Does not care. Leaves the room for you to teach yourself. Do not take !!!",0
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
"The grade itself was easy, just class was boring. Take this class if you know how to speak Spanish and write. He isn't a tough grader ",1
"Ms. McDonald Smith is fantastic! As a Business Marketing major, taking her course was extremely delightful. Her continuous years of social entrepreneurship and sales experience make her class informative. With a raw and uncanny personality, Ms. McDaniel-Smith will incite wit and cleverness into your school days. Great teaching style!",1
You wont need a textbook for this class and all the lectures are posted online Incase you missed something during class. She gives study guides that are exactly the same as the test. If you show up to class and listen you will easily pass with an A,1
"Dr. Ranft is by far the least caring professor I have ever taken. He didn't show up for half of the semester and when he did, he gave incorrect, confusing examples and went on irrelevant rants. He purposely added confusing wording to questions and was not fair in hearing students' concerns. You'll never get him to respond to an email either.",0
Lisa Cassidy was by far one of the biggest influences in my life this spring semester 2016. Granted I love philosophy but her critical thinking course is amazing if your looking to expand your mind. Theres work to do for her in class all through out the semester not many test but a few papers. I would take her again.,1
Mr. Trower is extremely helpful in trying to help you understand the material but the class its self is hard. I am not good in math at all but I passed with an A. I was able to do this because of all the extra credit he gives. I nearly failed every exam he gave us but thanks to all the extra credit I received an A!!!,1
sad.,0
"Absolutely aweful. the comments I've read so far are SPOT ON. I was kicked out of his class this semester because I'd finally had enough of him being so disrespectful to not only me, but my classmates. Always bringing up the subject of abortions and how ""if you don't want the baby, you can give it up for adoption.""teaching strategies were confusing",0
"She is an ANGEL. Easily the most entertaining and engaging class I've taken. She's very passionate about comm & rhetoric and teaches in a way you'll remember the info! This is a class you'll actually want to go to and look forward too! She's one of the sweetest & most caring prof I've ever had, TAKE THIS CLASS!",1
One midterm that covers the entire text. 2 fully researched group papers that he grades like he is an English professor. A BPR diagram that you aren't taught how to do that he grades harshly. 1 Quiz that covers the entire first half of the text book. Overall this is not the same professor you think is fair from MIS 315. Avoid if possible.,0
"I have loved this class. I took it completely online due to COVID-19 restrictions and I watched most of his lectures after the fact, but I learned so much! He made concepts I had never found interesting seem relevant and really interesting. I learned so much from this class!",1
Dr. Connolly is an outstanding professor! She truly cares about her students and the learning experience. I highly recommend her to anyone who needs English credit. She is amazing and I could not say enough good things. Class is pretty entertaining and the papers can be difficult but she allows time for revision. Take her classes!!,1
"Professor Intraub is one of the best professors I've had at UD.  She's extremely nice and truly wants everyone to succeed.  It's completely possible to get an A but you have to at least skim the readings she assigns and find the studies the book talks about.  They'll be on the tests. She isn't kidding when she says to do the essay clinic, it helps.",1
"If you want to waste your time, go ahead, take his classes...",0
"Decent teacher. My biggest complaint is that he's a little slow to grade papers, and as the quarter progressed he got even slower. I know everyone is busy end of quarter, and maybe there were other circumstances causing the delay, but it got frustrating and at times made me wonder how committed he is to his online class(es).",1
"i'm taking this course now. yes, lots of reading--and writing, but the stuff is very interesting. i'm learning about things in our country/society no one has ever taught me before. the best class i have taken at wsu.",1
Easy class just show up do the homework and essays and youll be fine . I never did any homework and did good on my essays and got a B in the class. Also attendance matters so show up and be on time. DeLong was truly one of southerns nicest and most caring professors,1
"Absolutely one of my favorite profs. The class was extremely lecture heavy, but he does a good job making it interesting. All of his examples are bird related because he is obsessed with birds, and when he gets excited about a topic his vocal infection goes up. He is by far the coolest science prof I've had.",1
"Extremely difficult to understand, but very willing to help!  I got a 99% on the first test and failed every other one and still managed to get a C.  He gives a lot of extra credit.  Just study hard and you will do alright!",0
"Super nice and understanding. Take good notes and study the night before the test and you'll be good. 10/10 would recommend her, easiest class ever.",1
class seem to be o.k. just do the reading & attend lecture & you will be fine.,0
Unrealistic expectations for his students.  INSANELY HARD!,0
"She's pretty nice. If you're taking an online class, expect to do a lot of readings and class discussions (weekly). She doesn't grade them harshly, but she sure make you work for it. It was creative writing, so you get to try different things every week, it feels like a high school class, which is awesome.",1
Bowman can be a tough professor but she cares about her students and wants them to do well. Our class was Literature of the Occult - the books we read were wonderful and the exams were all questions from class discussions. She's a little corny but even brought in 2 tarot card readers as background knowledge for one of the books. Great professor!,1
The worst teacher I have ever met. His class was not clear at all,0
"This man is not ****.  He is the most hopeless romantic that I know. He is genuine. His humor can be brash, but I think that he sees it as constructive criticism.  He cares, and he is fair-He's hard on everybody.",1
"Very fair course. Yes, I won't lie, his lectures are quite unclear, but if you follow along in the book and do all the homework you will do fine in this class. The tests were difficult and there's a quiz almost every class but just put in the work. very nice and he will help you if you seek it. Take him over sepinsky.",0
Corsi is amazing. Very good choice for writing intensive. Most of his papers are two pages in length except for one that was 3-4 pages. He loves quotes so make sure to include a lot. Final is 100 mc but he goes over half of them in class. Pretty sure he curves the final and the class overall. Make sure you go to class /sign in.,1
"very unorganized course. the only hope you have is the final that tests your true understanding. The quizzes, even if you know all the material you cant do well. This is because the professor thinks because it is open book it needs to be more difficult. That too, with an extremely limited time limit per quiz. One of the worst classes I have taken.",0
Horrible.. no passion to actually teach. Seems like she likes to assert her authority or dominance onto students. Constantly makes kids feel uncomfortable in the middle of a lecture. Very unprofessional presence in the classroom. Doesnt know what partial credit means. All She is good for is putting your test threw the scantron.,0
"Record the lectures and complete the study guides and you will get an A. Material is relatively easy. Professor Self is very intelligent however, boring as well. He does have a passion for Microbial Metabolism and by the end of the course you will have gained a lot of knowledge about E.coli. Overall, good class!",1
Poor response to questions. Not very helpful and a very self taught class.,0
"10/10. Smart, motherly and casual. Always felt calm and relaxed during her lectures and was didn't regret once for taking her class. Course divided into: 3 tests, 10 weekly quizzes, and one essay with clear criteria on marking. If you want a chill, laid back professor who makes you luv Biology, it's Dr. Gonzalez.",1
"Overall, you have to be an electrical engineer to be able to take him. He goes ultra fast on lectures and his test are really hard. If you can take another teacher take Kubat, Sung-Jim-KIm or Hamman. You are not going to learn with scordilis. He will literally ruin your GPA as a BME. 3 Test and a final. no quizzes",0
"ACCT 2 - Show up, Do homework, read book and you will do fine.",1
"He's completely terrible. However, his lecturing is very good. Marking is beyond horrible. Holy cow. I worked 7 days on his first assignment and read 160 pages for it. I got a C+. I was so disappointed. You don't know how they mark. But, one think is clear they focus way too much on grammar and started telling me how to rewrite the sentences.",0
"This is one of the best, hands down, porfessor i have had at wentworth.  the material is neither difficult nor easy it is like learning algebra in grade school.  If you pay attention in class, which he makes it hard not to, you will do well on his tests. not only does he test fairly but he also grades genorously.  Awesome professor very helpful.",1
"Fish is extremely tough, but he's also completely fair. He will push you like no one ever has, but my gosh will you have some stunning work at the end of the semester. Listen to everything he says and do it. He will help you turn your 'eh' work into pieces you can't wait to show off. I HIGHLY recommend him.",1
Did not enjoy this professor. Grading is off because it is almost impossible to get an A. I got a C and I am an engineer major that is normally very good at math. Would never recommend him.,0
"I disagree with the post below. Prof Weiner is a little tougher than you can perceive initially. As the semester goes, the readings become harder. However, he's a great lecturer and professor. I am definitely taking him again. He also has a very funny sense of humor.",1
"Great professor, very funny at times. The practice exams were often very similar to the actual exams, but he would change a few problems. He is very specific in how he does problems and also how he wants them done on the test, so take good notes.",1
Great Guy. Very knowledgeable and passionate about economics. Exams were relatively easy with minimal studying.,1
"Literally do not take this professor. I took this as a mandatory credit and will be receiving my first C ever in college. He grades as if everyone in his class will be professional writers. Not clear in feedback, nor does he ever talk about how he wants papers to be written. I do admit that the class discussions are interesting but not worth it.",0
Love this guy!,1
"The professor is nice, response to emails fast, and the essays and discussion posts aren't too bad. What is worst is the exams in this class. The formatting is horrific with answer choices being extremely unclear. At the moment about 3/4 of the class has not gotten higher than 30% on the exams, and the only thing she said was to ""Study more"".",0
Awesome Comp Sci professor.  Maintains good humor despite the inherent boredom of any computer courses. Highly recommended!!!,1
"Easy grader but really unorganized. Will let you rewrite a paper if she doesnt think it is written well. She is nice, but her class is boring to me. Easy A for a gen ed class",1
horrible and very rude ! don't take any class with him,0
"Slides are taken from textbook and he lectures from them during v. long and dry 3 hours. All exams are MC and while 1st one was easy, the second one was incredibly tricky and obscure. Even with proper studying  I barely passed due to random/tricky questions pulled from textbook. Definitely lost any interest in linguistics and would NOT recommend. ",0
Gets a bit off task sometimes but the class was still enjoyable. Class conversations were always interesting.,0
"Absolutely AWFUL professor. He is very hard to understand and he is just not a kind person. He acts like it is the students fault when the stupid ""MyStatLab"" doesn't work. He calls on students during class and if you don't know the answer he makes you feel like the dumbest person that ever lived. WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND TAKING!!!",0
"She is definitely a hard grader and expects a lot from the students. However, she has a lot of useful comments to give and her anecdotes are really interesting. Whenever I have approached her she's always been very compassionate and understanding.",1
"Lectures/discussions are mandatory, attendance will be taken. Exams are easy as she gives a complete study guide with all of the material on it, just memorize. Papers are graded rather harshly (especially the first one). They look for a very specific format for the papers and it is up to you to figure out what that is.",1
"A good deal of the class is ""Group Work"" meaning you'll be teaching each other from printed worksheets. It's frustrating to pay tuition and be taught by an 18 year old group member. I could have stayed home and watched Khan Academy videos and learned more. When you're paying tuition,  you want to learn from someone with a PhD and experience.",0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS. He is very condescending when you ask questions and claims to be accessible outside of class but never responds to emails. He is not understanding and does not seem to care about his students at all. The average for all 3 exams was a D and he claims that we did very well. If I could give him 0 stars I would.,0
"If you like macintosh then you will do fine in this class.  if you think it is an inferior, overpriced product you will not succeed in this class.",0
"She is an extremely tough grader, very impatient with students who do not understand the material, and absolutely plays favorites. She is inconsiderate of personal matters and I would never recommend her to anyone.",0
24 CHAPTERS IN 3 MONTHS!!! ENDLESS READING AND GRADING MAKES 0 SENSE! CRAPPIEST TEACHER! She has an attitude for no reason. She does absolutely nothing for the class and you WILL have to teach yourself everything.,0
"Dr. Moyers is an incredible professor; she's very smart and her lectures are incredibly interesting. She cares for all her students, and open to questions. There are overall 4 exams and they are not the easiest but just by attending her lectures and paying attention, you could pass her tests. She is awesome I definitely recommend her.",1
"Phenomenal instructor. He's a business owner so he's very familiar with the real world and often incorporates it into lectures. He picks 5 random days to do attendance throughout semester and if you miss the majority of them, you flunk. Exams are moderately difficult (you need to study hard). Great guy. Really wants to help you with career pursuit.",1
"Good lecturer, knows his stuff. The class is just really kind of boring and nothing is really worth writing down in the lectures. It can be interesting at times but most of the time it's dry. Most of the student taking the class are Business majors who just want a Humanities credit so they don't really care about the concepts they're learning",1
Very difficult professor. If you do not always do your hw or attend class then do NOT take him. You have to be very serious about passing the class from the beginning to do well. Do EVERY hw assignment and try to ALWAYS attend class bc they count for so much more than they shld. Nice guy but very very tough.,0
"I have never written a review in my life, but this time I would not let it go, Bruce Cohen has no idea what he is teaching, no material in the class, the class goes by bad jokes and arguments, and he is the most racist Professor in the USA.",0
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0
"He is the WORST professor I have ever had. Couldn't understand him, textbook has nothing to do with the class, and he doesn't let you pick your group so expect the worst group project group you can imagine and that's probably ten times better than what you will actually get. Oh yea and that's a good chunk of your grade and he doesn't do peer evals ",0
"Professor Brown is one of my favorite teachers I have had at U of O. He was helpful, engaged in class discussion, encouraged creative thinking, exposed us to a variety of ideas and opinions, and somehow made our class feel like a giant family at the end of ten weeks. He was amazing, I would recommend him to anyone who wants to grow as a person.",1
"Brennan was a pretty cool teacher. He was very enthusiastic and I feel that I learned a lot in this class. Hard homeworks, easy exams.",1
"Overall, she was okay. But she never gave anyone a 100% and would expect a room full of freshmen to challenge their philosophical views in a language they don't know. She really just wanted you to agree with whatever she thought and would find significant symbolism in anything. But cool reading material and great class atmosphere.",1
"all of the questions on the exams are trick questions and are extremely hard even if you study and think you know the material, you'll get to the exam and be confused probably.  don't ask questions unless you're prepared to get roasted by him.",0
Really sweet man.  Stories were pretty funny.  As a teacher was not the greatest.  All over the place and never gave back grades.  Didn't really learn anything from this class.,0
"Dr. Matt is an awesome dude and very intelligent. If you love science you will love his classes however be prepared for a heavy work load and lots of reading. If you pay attention in his lectures and take good notes you will do great in the class, he also gives lot of points in the class making it hard to fail.",1
"She was an absolutely horrible teacher. she returned NO WORK during the entire semester. we had no idea what any of our grades where before we took the final. i was really interested in this class but she made me completely uninterested. basically, she doesnt teach, you read the book, and watch movies. i cant believe i payed money to take this clas",0
"Took this class last summer and it was not a pleasant experience. He hardly lectures and expects students to commit their time hours-on-end on difficult hw, online quizzes and in-class worksheets which barely reflected his simple lectures. He can get frustrated easily with struggling students too. The only upside about him is that he curves exams.",0
"Not terrible but not good either. The one good thing is that he curves your final grade at the end of the semester. His exams are brutal, but they're mostly based on the homework, not the slides. Very nice person, but too laid back... except for his exams. Lectures are pointless. He just reads from the slides.",0
"Hye-Shin Kim's teaching is very scatter-brained. She will ask you the same question at least once a day. She kind of rambles. She has a textbook; I would not recommend buying it. You don't need it. You have three group projects in the class, as well as two essay exams. It wasn't that hard of a class, but it kind of felt like a waste of time.",0
"Lash is not as bad as people make him out to be. He can seem like a know it all at times, but he definitely has his students' best interest in mind and does everything he can to help you pass. The homework can be very specific to the textbook and the grading can be nitpicky but I didn't hate the class by any means.",1
"US HISTORY 2                  Basically, listen to what he says.  His stories are good, but HE WILL MENTION SUBLIMINALLY the topic the class is suppose to be on regarding history.  Write down those terms, highlight them in the book and you will be fine.",1
"I was skeptical about Sledge, but I totally ended up loving her. She's different, and she's REALLY into her material, but if you read your assigned stuff and show up ready to talk about it she won't go too hard on you. The people posting rude things are probably can't handle actually learning something in class. She's weird, but I enjoyed her a lot",1
"Coop is interesting, funny, and understanding, yet he is extremely hard to understand and follow even the most basic algorithmic foundations. He s a good person, not a good professor.",0
"tests were HARD but obviously doable, people were getting 100% on her tests. Very funny in class but I found her to be harsh during office hours which caused me to stop going, she made me feel less than and a bit dumb to be honest. Her class is hard, just do the work, go over lectures and you should be fine",0
He is a pretty nice guy and he is very easy to understand in lecture. He provides good in-class activities and homework to make sure you understand the material before taking the test.,1
Prof. Sledge is one of the best Professor I've ever had. Take her if you truly want to learn.,1
"Assaf is a cool guy but he makes class miserable, which is unfortunate because he happens to teach cool classes. He picks and chooses which students he likes and which ones he doesn't, and grades assignments from there. He has a general bad attitude and expects certain grades when he doesn't put equal effort into teaching.",0
What is my grade? Who knows! we have not gotten our case studies back nor will he reply to an email about getting a grade update. I am reporting him to his superiors due to his lack of response when we try to contact him.  He is just so distracted/all over the place during lecture/ makes him difficult to follow  will never take his classes again!,0
He is the coolest science professor around. He will take you out on trips to show you first hand the work of God's perfection.,1
"I feel the only reason I had pass this class with a high grade was due to reading the textbook. When the professor tells you to read, put aside that time to read or even just pay really good attention to the Jeopardy review he does if you want to barely skim if that's your thing.",1
Very lecture heavy and unorganized. The material is scattered and the amount of information crammed into one class period is incredibly confusing to say the least.,0
"He's a very challenging teacher but you learn alot. He's always willing to help you, time not a limit. He knows his stuff and comes acrosss as a very intelligent man. Most of all he's fair and he'll work with you. Prepare to read....Alot!!!!",1
"Took this class in the online synchronous format, but going to lectures was useless. Read straight off the PowerPoints he gave us. I read every textbook chapter and did all his practice questions, but then didn't do great on his tests. Don't recommend taking this course with this professor.",0
"She's great.  At first, she comes off as intimidating, but she is actually very easy-going and approachable.  She tells you exactly what you need to do to receive a good grade in the lab.  Some of the experiments are tedious - obviously not her fault",1
"Personable professor but the way she teaches is awful. Did not have a course outline, made up assignments along the way and did not stay on course topic enough. Always late and was a tough grader in a course that was meant to be a grade booster. She asked us what we wanted to have for assignments during the class. Multiple things due at same time.",0
she is terribly boring and spends the whole class doing useless proofs. her exams are hard - i purposely avoid her classes at all costs.,0
She's okay. She tries her best but doesn't really do a good job overall in her teaching.,1
"As a person- always helpful, gives a lot of feedback, always flexible and willing to help. As a proff.- she is often scattered and busy and rarely gives papers back, willing to accomadate though. Overall, not a bad teacher if you need the credit- I do suggest her.",1
Lectures are pointless but you have to go because of pop quizzes. If you arent already experienced with computers or programming prepare to teach yourself. The class itself isnt that difficult but he assumes you have prior knowledge. Very bad lectures.,0
"This is one class I actually don't mind going to. Most of the books you have to read are decent and the class is actually interesting. The papers are a pain but doable. You pretty much have to go to class bc there are 6 in class pop quizzes, but they're really easy if you do the reading.",1
"Idk where this lady gets off with all the time consuming assignments. Would never take again, ridiculous workload and unfair quizzes",0
"So. I've been in Ryerson for 2 years and she is the only prof that I despise as a Lecturer. She starts off with the phrase the establishes her bias and privilege as a 'white-privileged, cis-gendered, left-leaning' PhD person and keeps going. Lectures are the worst stereotype of University lectures; I spend too long not knowing what she teaches us.",0
"The amount he expects you to read is unrealistic, impossible, and actually humorous. He is obsessed with reading competency, very odd . He sends a 3 page letter explaining why he is such a hard grader. I am bummed hes the only on I could take for this course. Awful..",0
The way he grades you seems very unfair to me. All it is is about 3 tests and then two papers that only count for 10% of your grade. The subject is interesting but your ability to pass may be questionable.,0
"Professor Gerencser was a very engaging professor who encouraged class discussion. He was definitely a tough grader, but fair. He was always happy to answer emails or meet to discuss your papers. Even if you are not interested in political science, this is a great course to take since it engages you in a lot of critical thinking.",1
"this guy saved my life more than just once! he looks wierd, acts wierd but, when it comes to physics he is the go to guy! thanks doctor J!",1
I really enjoyed this class. I didn't think I would. I found her to be a great teacher. She knows her stuff. Though some of the material was boring she tried to make it interesting. 4 exams. You need to study they can be tricky. Never used the book. 4 papers but pretty straightforward & she grades easy. Gave extra credit. Do it...it's easy points.,1
"Extremely disorganized, insecure, and overly-demanding. She never makes her expectations clear. Capable of being cruel and caustic. Beware.",0
Her teaching style did not work for me,0
"Dr. Weiner makes Reading 501 way more difficult than it needs to be. He does not teach, like at all. He assigns groups and has the groups teach for a class period which takes up the whole semester. I ended with a B and there is no evidence of how I got it",0
Your best bet is to use Khan Academy or some other online resources and just use those over relying on the book or lecture too heavily. He says the book isnt student friendly then proceeds to read directly from the text. He took an hour to do 4 examples and a quarter of the class left after the following 5 minute break.,0
"Starts every class with an ""Alllllllriiiight.""  Funny and engaging guy.  Very considerate and helpful.  I passed a paper in a day late and there were no points taken off because I told him it was going to be late.  Show up to class though, he take attendance every class, besides, he might just play his guitar and sing slave spirituals for you!",1
"Dr. Creahan is a different kind of teacher. he is fairly unclear in his lectures and very boring, as long as you actually attend he is ok with it. the class over all was kinda lame, but it is econ. it doesnt matter who you take, econ is boring, so i would advise dr. creahan over the others.",0
"Took it online and it was a breeze. Put in minimal time and still did well. The assignments were long but you do not have to do every one of them. The exams are just like the practice exams, plus you can bring a cheat sheet to the exams. Recommend this online class.",1
no a good idea!,0
"Read 2 assignments per week and ask AND answer 3 of your own questions per reading. Midterm and final paper are 3 or 4 questions which require 3 or 4 paragraphs a piece. Do the readingS, watch the films (2 or 3), pass the class. No lectures, no test, no gimmicks and you will learn in the process. Highly recommended",1
amazing. take every class you can with him. switch to an english major just to get him all the time. it's worth it.,1
Extremely tough grader. Cannot stress that enough. Tests basically determine your grade. Only 2 and a final. I'd like to see two tests before the withdrawal period.  Gives homework quizzes but they will not help your grade much at all if you don't test well. Tests are 75% of the grade and he grades ruthlessly. Not a bad guy just very nitpicky.,0
"If you want a teacher who is willing to help you to pass their class, DON'T even think about this one. I passed only due to the heavy work I did for my homework, participation, and quizzes. Exams are HEAVILY weighted for this class. Not to mention communication isn't the best from him. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!",0
"Genetics lab is  one of the toughest labs I have ever taken. However, I do not think that this is the TAs fault. She does her best to help out but you have to restrain from falling behind and outside sources along with office hours are necessary as the lab manual is very vague and the lab itself is on a very short and tight schedule.",1
He is really interesting to talk to he tells a lot of stories that actually tie in with his lectures. however if you get him started on a subject you will have spent the whole class going over it. he really doesn't expect a lot however he does expect you to pay attention. Test are a BEAST!! just know your stuff and have a passion in learning.,1
"Read the book, don't even bother going to her class unless you're spanish or someone who is very capable of understanding english w/ a heavy spanish accent. She is a really nice lady but her accent doesn't make up for it because if you don't understand her, you're screwed. Good luck to her future students.",0
"He doesn't actually connect the readings he gives us to the lecture. Overall, I felt the course was very unclear and disorganized and really discouraged me. I was left feeling the course had no clear point. He also wasn't always clear in his instructions, and trying to get an answer from him often resulted in what felt was talking in circles. ",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR HANSON. 100% the worst professor I've ever had. Your grade is solely tests and quizzes and you have no extra assignments to bring up your grade. Her lectures and readings make absolutely no sense and the tests are insanely hard, she doesn't use A-D she does A-G as multiple-choice options. Impossible to succeed",0
"Seems nice, & is very funny, but assigns at least a 100 pages for class, and then will either spend 30 seconds on each case, or discuss something else entirely. She seems very unorganized with the material, and does not do a particularly good job of explaining what is right and what is wrong. She also runs out as soon as class ends. Hard to follow.",0
"She was rude, you had to teach a lot of the content yourself, not very helpful in general.",0
"Never will understand his lectures. He is the worst prof tbh, never take his courses",0
"I do not reccommend Mgmt 309 w/ Tarjan. It seems as if you don't agree w/ what he says, your wrong. You can follow guidelines when writing a paper, but again, if he doesn't agree, you are incorrect. Its frustrating. He attempts to cram way to much info in each class session. I won't talk about his personality, this is a review on him as a teacher.",0
One of the best professors I've ever had. He actually cares about what you actually take from his class and learn and adapts the lectures to what everyone is struggling with (as opposed using 10 year old slideshows). As long as you complete the given assignments (he drops a certain amount) you'll succeed in this class.,1
"Great teacher! Always had interesting facts and stories about the countries he had visited. There was no textbook, so there was no reading.  Would take this class again! Very smart, funny, and awesome professor. :)",1
"Dr. Hart is by far one of my favorite professors at MSU. Take advantage of talking with her outside of class, because she really does care about her students, but you have to show that you're interested in doing well. If you want to contact her you're much better off going to office hours rather than email. She makes lecture very interesting!!",1
Professor Walker is a great teacher. She is very understanding and likes to truly get to know her students. All of her lessons and assignments are applicable to real world situations and you truly learn something. She even throws in random useful gems for students like what credit is etc.,1
Worst acc prof ever! She expects everyone to know everything before class so what's the point of going to her class? She will go through easy questions in class (super basic) and homework questions are completely off and takes hours to complete. exams are hard!,0
Talks about random stuff that is not related to the subject. Changes the date for papers. Not clear on the assignments.,0
She really doesn't care about anything or anyone except for her PUENTE program.,0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The program she uses is horrible. The quizes she gives are through Cengage and one wrong click on the page and you get the question wrong. You could do all of the correct steps and it will still count your answer as wrong. She is also very unhelpful, and if you email her for help, dont expect to get it.",0
"Very strong, smart woman with a big heart. My favorite.",1
I took this course online. The instructor was always helpful and offered two extra credit assignments. A previous poster lamented having to study--of course you will have to study. This instructor is passionate about music and I find that refreshing. This instrutor is engaging and cares about the success of his students.,1
Class was pretty straight forward.  You really need to attend lectures to do well on his exams.  He's very reasonable and I would take a class with him again.,1
"be sure not to sit in the first two rows becuz this is the spit zone...he spits a lot when talking, good prof. and funny",1
Awesome and Friendly Guy.  Brings a lot of current situations and news to the table to make things interesting besides just reading the boring old textbook.  If you're looking to take a HR or Communications Class. I recommend Woodcock A++,1
"Amazing professor and lectures. Prof. Atwood presents the material in a clear and interesting way, very inspiring. Great selection of books to read for the course. Students are encouraged to express their views and develop critical thinking. Professor Atwood has a great positive energy, was always available to answer questions. Fantastic course!",1
Non responsive to emails or outside help. Does not follow her own syllabus. Extremely test heavy with 100+ questions each.,0
He's the bomb. He tries to make you figure out the answer without just telling you. However is always willing to help. Makes sure everyone is on the same pace but make sure to ask questions.,1
"If you take this teacher be prepared to work and study hard.  The project is the hardest part of the class make sure you start early.  The tests are also hard even if you study, so be prepared.",0
"She's extremely unorganized in lecture, so forget taking notes--it's an absolute mess. Labs are difficult and when you email her with questions she gives the shortest answer possible and sometimes the answers aren't even helpful. I dropped the class and am going to take it with a BETTER professor.",1
Be prepared to use the text book. All the information needed for the quizzes is in it. Be prepared to write.,1
"I really like Dr. Cochrane, she is extremely nice and personable. Anthropology is not my major but I still  enjoyed her class. She is an easy grader and doesn't over complicate things. She truly just wants everyone to succeed in her class. Complete your assignments and you will do fine. I definitely recommend!",1
"Professor Hooper Mark has been my strength, though I know quite right that I am going to learn a lot from him when I first met him but never think that it will be as much as I did. In fact, Hooper your mode of teaching is really superb and clarity of words as the best teaching method which I believe will continue linger in all our heart.",1
Professor Ringer is absolutely AMAZING!!!,1
"I would not recommend Professor Jewell to anyone. She does not teach much or give  helpful information, or relevant information. She loses papers and gives you a zero grade. Doesn't help with research paper assignment - you're on your own. Doesn't answer emails and is not accessible to students.",0
"John is very disorganized when leading a class. In my experience, he has trouble communicating his thoughts to a large group, and when too many people try to figure out what he wants, he gets frustrated. I had really amazing classmates that made this course worth it, but take this class at your own risk",1
Dr. Schmitz is incredibly helpful and knows what she is teaching. I highly recommend taking a class with her! I would definitely hope to get her as a professor again,1
Dr. Cochran is an interesting professor. He says that if you have a pulse you will pass his class. His quizzes are a little hard but he curves the quizzes. Come to class and you will do fine.,1
"very nice, very helpful. even had a pizza party.",1
"Emily Bauman is an amazing professor. She genuinely cares for the knowledge of her students. She does her very best to keep people engaged. Her discussion can be interesting. As long as you don't fall behind in the readings, it's really not a terribly hard class. She is also very understanding with absences and personal issues.",1
"Always comes in late, always has an excuse",0
"Professor Juana Gonzalez-Santos is a very good and caring professor. She taught Bio270 at the University of Toronto (Animal Physiology) and made very fair tests. Textbook readings are optional and lectures are extremely helpful. Although the professor has a bit of an accent and the lectures aren't too organized sometimes, it was a great experience.",1
He is funny and the best professor ever.,1
Best professor I ever had. Politics is not my thing but at the end of the semester I feel like I have something to say and that I am better prepared for my upper level college classes. I reccomend Dr. B!,1
"she was good, and from what i understand the easiest person to take automata from. sure she got confused on the problems, but thats because its a lot to digest. take it with her. she explained whole concepts to me in email.  she is clear as they come for this class.",1
"I think she is a really good professor. The class itself is a bit difficult but everything she talks about in class is important to take notes on for the test. The book is helpful in the beginning for definitions but other than that mostly focus on her lectures. Go see her in office hours to review your tests, she is very helpful in explantion",1
This class was definitely not what I thought it would be. Heavily reading based. If you read the articles you'll be fine and he gives you opportunities to miss some of the reaction papers he assigns. The book essay is a big part of your grade: START IT EARLY! Overall he's an okay teacher but kind of boring and the class is not based on medications.,1
"He is a pretty nice guy and very animated when teaching. However, he is not very organized or clear when it comes to assignments and the webcourse is hardly ever updated. Also, he likes to crack jokes and poke fun at students, which can be fine, but one of his jokes really rubbed me the wrong way and being in class became extremely uncomfortable.",0
"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",0
"She teaches really fast and when you don't understand something, she'll be like ""WHAT?  what DON'T you understand?""  A little confusing at times, but she'll help you.  A little short tempered.  Her tests are alright, no trick questions.  She emphasizes on the stuff that's going to be on the tests.  She makes you practice the problems a lot.",1
"I had Tokunaga-sensei for both 110 and 120. The class isn't that hard, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to keep up. She's nice. Never in a bad mood. It was a pleasure to be in her class this year. arigatou gozaimasu!",1
"Boaring, Very Boaring, and doesn't teach, just reads out of the book he wrote.  All memorization, never really knew what I was doing, just cruching numbers.  Many had to retake because of not learning the material good enough.",0
"Amazing professor who made accounting so easy. Lectures aren't mandatory, but you will need to go to pass the tests.  3 quizzes, 1 midterm and 1 final.  If you pay attention in class and do the homework then the tests are all really easy.  Overall a great teacher who made me really like accounting.",1
"I've never had a more BORING instructor, let alone subject.  For an online student there's next to no interaction and reply and grading times are horrible.",0
"All I can say is that I will never take another class with him again. Doesn't even grade the assignments, just assigns a random grade. If you want to do well, you better be reading the textbook religiously. Long and difficult to read. The material is interesting, but the professor blows. The lecture has very little to do w/ the test. Avoid him.",0
"This class is one of the easiest classes I have ever taken, but also, I didn't learn a thing. The class was very disorganized and hard to follow and most of the time, his lectures didn't make sense. Overall, he's not a bad guy. He's really nice and caring, but do not take this class if you actually want to learn visual basic.",0
He gives lots of reading but i never usually did any of it. He is super off track and its so hard to study because i don't know if what he is saying is an anecdote or actual things i need to learn.,0
Shes the best prof at the u of a,1
Hes a VERY nice man. However hes unclear about his expectations and was very unorganized during class. Being a Spanish major who will be studying in Spain for a semester I am looking for a class that will challenge my Spanish skills and this class did not do so at all. I feel as if I learned very little from this class. I will NOT take him again.,0
"Well respected person at Dixie State, but not a great professor. Reads off power-points or watches 15 year old videos during class. Grades hard on papers for English class like things when this class is ethics. Tests are true/false and confusing questions that could be either. Nice guy, but not a very good teacher",0
I'm not a philosophy major and I took this class on a whim but he's awesome. His lectures are a breeze and oftentimes funny. The class seems a lot more tedious than it is. If I was a philosophy major I'd definitely take more of his courses. Also he randomly takes attendance so show up.,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! Although she is sweet, nothing is graded. We wrote multiple essays and we only received one essay back before finals week. Assignment instructions are always unclear, no matter how many times she explains it. Stay clear if you care about a decent GPA.",0
"Really great, very thorough lectures. Be sure to read the lecture notes ahead of time and come with questions--he is always enthusiastic about answering them and always has excellent and informative responses/examples. He likes to cover an insane amount of material (this is an honors class, after all), but tests are generally not too hard.",1
"Test on the syllabus, 1 post and 2 discussion board replies gets a ""C"" grade, wasn't clear with due date when assigning the first paper. She made it sound as though it were due the 2nd week but it wasn't actually due till the 4th week. ",0
I missed the Dean's list because of this class by .01! I have straight A's in all other classes (I took 7 classes this semester)!! Such a hard class and I regret taking it. I begged him to let me makeup or redo a quiz or a lab but he wouldn't let me. Do not take this class unless required for your major!,0
I am not a science person but I'm so glad I took my science courses with Christy. She was so patient with helping me understand each lesson. Her lectures were so thorough and clear! I would deff recommend her!!!,1
"Dr. Daley is a nice lady, always looking to help. BUT how math 115 is set up, it's an extremely difficult class. ALL learning is done on your own time by watching videos and doing online math topics. A lot of effort is required to do well in this class so beware. Tests are partially on a computer which is unforgiving and doesn't give partial credit",1
Feedback is not helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking him.,0
"My favorite professor at St. Joe's :) You really need to pay attention and take notes, but he doesn't butcher us with homework. We only have a presentation and term paper at the end of the class, both of which he is happy to help with. He's super approachable and funny. Definitely take him!",1
He's not a very good teacher. Does not do a good job teaching the material that he assigns the homework over. I definitely regret taking his course.,0
"Link has one of the most unique teaching techniques I have ever seen. If you pay attention in class, go all of his reviewing sessions and read the materials he required in the syllabus, you will pass his class easily. Of course, this will take you a lot of outside class times. He has a lot of extra credit work that will turn your Fail to Pass.",1
"Such a sweetheart and says lots of funny stuff. Her class is test heavy but she is not trying to trick you, go back over your HW problems and you will do great. She is always willing to help, and will spend an entire class answering questions is she has to. Highly recommend, I actually found her class to be more fun than I thought it would be.",1
"I started at URI in 2002 and registered for this class every semester and dropped it until Fall 2004.  First assignment I hand wrote and when I turned it in she said ""No, type, type, type."" Instead of being scared off I stuck with it. She always  wasavailable. Dr. Ferguson gave me the firmness I needed. Currently finishing my Doctorate! Thank you.",1
"Spaeth's passion lies with Rome, not her students. She's far more concerned with rushing through powerpoints than engaging and educating. Yes, there's a lot of material to cover, but the class just feels like watching someone rapidly talk to themselves. Don't buy the textbooks; just review the power points online. Take only if you love the subject!",0
Dr. Luther pushes you towards excellence. He can bring out qualities in yourself that you never knew existed. I was his TA for a semester and learned so much from him. The principles he taught me stick with me to this day.,1
"Hes a good professor, very patient and explains concepts well. His biggest con is the way he grades. He takes points off for the smallest things: he didnt like the way you wrote a symbol or you skipped an obvious step. You can have every answer right and still get a B or C",1
"Humber is one of the nicest profs I've met, but I hated taking MATH 213 with him. He wasn't prepared to teach for two hours straight. I found his lectures very difficult to engage with, which was unfortunate because the textbook was not helpful either. His homework was really difficult, but tests and quizzes were easy.",0
"Julien for eon 102 was a waste of time. First and only live class was a disaster of random questions and him having no lecture plan. after the first week it was very unclear on what mindtap readings and assignments were to be done. Besides that first lecture he did not teach, only assignments and short videos which weren't super helpful.",0
"He is a prof at George Brown College, he's amazing and very helpful and understanding with deadlines and assignments.",1
"Michael is a professor who not only cares about the material, but about his students. He comes off as super strict at first, but he's also very flexible, and as long as you don't make stuff up or say what he wants to hear and you're original and thoughtful, he'll be more than happy to work with you. I work my schedule around his classes. Love him.",1
"I took psych 101 as an elective and have regretted not dropping the class when I could. She gives you 20 mins to complete a 30 question quiz each chapter, it wouldn't be bad if the questions weren't scenarios that you had to read the questions carefully, its next near impossible to complete. her direction in every aspect of the class is vague.",0
"Lazy & unfocused on his end while very harsh in grading... Like... OMG! Material is all over the place between vids, lectures, and chapter material and they don't always line up - very hard to tell the interpretation he wants! This wouldn't be so bad if 50% of the grade wasn't based on a dozen questions split between 2 exams.",0
I agree with the few previous responses. There is absolutely no learning of Nutrition in this class. It's actually Advanced Biochemistry. A is possible with memorization word for word of his little book.,0
She is a horrible teacher! She is never happy or smiles. Always serious and treats her students like they are in high school. Her test are much harder than what is on her slides or talks in class. Don't like her attitude as a teacher.,0
"Very sweet teacher, goes out of his way to make class fun. He will go the extra mile to help if you ask, and usually even if you don't - oh yes, and definitely gorgeous =)",1
I suggest switching out of his class ASAP if you're not a quick learner. Mr. Bannow will expect you to know things he vaguely goes over (like the math portions of chapters). Be ready to teach yourself or hire a semester long tutor or you WILL be lost. He will get angry/frustrated if you have any questions. Most impatient teacher I've ever met.,0
"At first, I dreaded taking this class due to many of the negative ratemyprofessor posts. As it turned out, she was a very understanding and helpful professor -- one of the best I have had at WPU. Yes, you have to read and think critically about the text, but this is college -- that's what is expected of you!",1
MG Whitney is the best math teacher I have ever had! DONT BE AFRAID ask her questions! she is SO willing to help every single way she can!,1
"I don't understand why this teacher yells during his lecture as if the class cannot hear him. He is ineffective as a professor because during a group quiz, none of the students knew what was going on. I would advise to take another professor over this one.",0
"Dr. Rich's class has a very heavy workload, but it is an upper level English class. Contribute often and remember the online discussions, so you hit 25 pages. Be prepared to work but enjoy the readings.",1
I'd rather impale my eyes with an ice pick than bother with her again.,0
"Professor Heyrman is a great professor. She is truly passionate about history & made the material very interesting. Mostly lectures w/occasional discussions on assigned readings (short books, no typical textbook). Easy multiple choice pop quizzes every week or so. Midterm, final, paper, & quizzes make up your grade. Take this if you can!",1
He is really funny! Dr. Cogan demonstrated very good points about culture and made class reasonable.,1
"Great professor! Quizzes are hard, but she answers any questions you have. Understands we have a life outside of school, great at working with you to make sure you succeed in both. Awesome feedback and encouragement on papers.",1
"He's a very nice guy, but not the best professor. He works with students really well if they have outside problems going on, but in class it's hard to follow because he lectures the entire period and gets distracted very easily. He does give very good and clear study guides before exams though.",1
"This professor was the worst professor ever! He doesn't grade anything until two or three days before the withdraw date. He creates study guides with answer sheets AND DOESN'T ANSWER THEM CORRECTLY and if you use that answer on the test , he marks it wrong. So unorganized, rude, gives tests that have the hardest problems! DONT TAKE HIM!!!",0
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
"Very confusing about the projects, looks for specific she never mentionned.",0
"He's nice, helpful, and funny. He gives worksheets that help with learning the material. Study for the tests because it's a hard class. I'd definitely take him again!",1
"Worst math teacher I've ever had. He gets dragged off topic and doesn't teach the curriculum well. 90% of your grade will be if you can do math bookwork because he won't teach it, you have to learn it there.",0
"Not sure if she's checked out since COVID but no material from past semesters was updated. Errors everywhere in syllabus. Material is painfully boring & she can ramble on about nothing for hours in her lectures. Others mentioned excessive coursework, I definitely agree that her exams are really over the top. Would never take a class with her again.",0
Probably the funniest professor i've had at UMKC. Test questions came straight from the lecture notes. Make sure to READ the books he assigns if you want full credit on the essays. Very knowledgable about his material. Possibly an ex-hippie!,1
"This guy is not ""sweet""! He likes to make indirect slams on particular students, which is unprofessional and intolerable. I won't continue with my major if it requires me to take a class with him- I walked out on one today and so far, he's the only prof at csub I really dislike and disrespect.",1
"He's a very tough grader, but he does give extra credit. Also, as long as you put in some effort, you should pass the class with at least a C. Getting an A is really difficult, but it is possible. You get around 4 essays, and one grammar final. Be prepared to study that grammar.",1
"Prof Masterson is not great at explaining things clearly. However, the online HW site has video lessons so I don't pay attention in class and teach myself the course as I do HW. Quizzes/Tests are all 4 questions and easy if you study even a little. Consistently keeps class extra 15 mins. Very easy class w/ any prior calc/stat knowledge. Hw is easy.",0
"Prof. Kolluru is a good professor. However, I believe she is bored with teaching. Her in-class lectures are great, she engages with students. The tough part is the exams. They are nothing like homework or practice material. She will ask you to remember formulas never covered in her class and has questions and has sections designed to trick you.",0
you have to do learn smart!! its just a lot when your taking 4-5 classes. tests are not easy at all each questions talks about 2-3 different topics so its confusing at times ... GOOOODLUCK WITH THIS PROFESSOR U'll need it for anatomy 425,0
"Hansen is a pretty good professor. She always answers questions in class. She doesn't prefer to correspond with students via email. She is very casual in class, which doesn't bother me. I have taken 2 classes with her so far. She can come off as mean at first, but once you get to know her she is easy to get along with. Her exams are tough.",1
"I loved her class! She is very funny and nice. Overall, the class itself was not terribly hard, but the tests were hard. Luckily, projects helped pad the grade.",1
"Not allowed to stand up at all. NO bathroom, NO eating, NO electronics, including if you wish to take notes digitally. His lectures jump around so it makes it difficult to find your appropriate notes when studying for the midterm or final. Studied religiously the study guide for the midterm, did not help at all. 5 books and 5 papers. AVOID!",0
Took him for clas. Pol. Thought. Easy prof. Grades easily. Lectures and content can be a bit boring. He grades papers and reading summaries easily. Just pay attention in class and take some notes. A nice and helpful guy.,1
"Was a nice teacher at first and had a different way of teaching that I respected because not many professors are willing to try something new to help students succeed. However this style of teaching just did not work for me, and after expressing these concerns I guess I triggered him into writing a 5 page paper about how I was a terrible person.",0
"I came into Financial Accounting expecting the worst, and it really was not bad. I credit Dr. Chiu for this. The workload was very manageable and she clearly laid out her expectations for students. Very intelligent. Good professor overall.",1
"His lectures are mind-numbingly boring. Sit in front of the class because he mumbles. The mumbling plus his thick accent makes it really difficult to understand. He only goes over things one time and he does it quickly, like if he's reading from a list and he needs to check off everything. Don't take it if you don't have to.",0
"If you want to pass you must attend! His favorite sentence is ""I'm here to help you learn!!"" Class is pretty dang hard and hard to understand the lectures but he's pretty approachable. You can sit there and listen to his lectures but it's easier to write down the information in your own terms. Ask him a lot of questions!",0
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
i completed a few of her courses back in 2010-11. chingling was my match in the English dept. she brought out the best in me in class and on paper. i found her essay prompts challenging as they gave me the opportunity to be creative and intellectual. chingling is intelligent. she helped me see little details that actually were bigger.,1
"Profe Rincon at first seemed nice but was very unaccommodating when I missed class for documented medical conditions and refused to give me my attendance points back when i showed her a doctor's note, and when i returned from being sick i was told ""to stop missing class"" and that ""i must not be doing well in my other classes"" because i was sick.",0
Loved this course. Would definately take it again by Professor Smith. Highly suggested. Cancels class often. Tests aren't bad if you study. Easy speech grader.,1
I have taken this professor twice. Her class is easy. She is very nice and helpful. She explains what she wants to see in your papers/assignments very well and clearly. You can tell she wants her students to succeed and be interested in what she teaches. Don't miss your opportunity to take her class!She is great!,1
"Erica's a great teacher! She's funny and pretty chill, but grades fairly and cares about students' success. I had a lot of fun in this class. It requires a lot of partner discussions and class participation, but that's pretty typical for UNL French classes.",1
"Creed is very smart, but don't take this class if you want to be an unbiased, thoughtful political scientist. As was mentioned, the readings are very heavy, but they are all aligned with his political beliefs, and he will berate anyone who does not agree... And he quite literally made up midterm grades (I have written 10 papers, 3 have been read).",0
"Serge Jasmin is a good guy its that other guy names organic chemistry that sucks. I'm not gonna lie he has trouble finishing his sentences and has accent so its sometime hard to follow, oh yeah and he gets mad when you ask questions and tells you too look at the stuff he posted on canvas as his answer. Grading isn't too bad since he curves.",0
"This textbook was written by him, so he always makes reference to it in class. Quizzes every week based entirely on the textbook chapter with 5 written questions you're given beforehand (which you answer 3 of in the quiz) and 14-15 multiple choice. Super easy if you do the work. 1 midterm, 1 reflection assignment. Superb prof.",1
"LOTS of homework. Very lax with due dates. You can wait until the week before the exam to turn in all homework if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Set aside some time every week to do the homework, do an occasional extra credit assignment, re write your paper at least once, and you'll get an A.   Put in the effort and you'll do great.",1
"I think she's only good for introductory courses like 108148. Not as great for higher level classes since they get more nit picky, and she doesn't explain much at all. Difficult to learn more difficult languages.",0
Heard lots of bad things about this professor -- and they were all right. Stopped class several times to tell everyone how they lost their compassion and humanity somehow before college. Gave tests back by grade so everyone knew who failed. Was rude and unhelpful when asked questions. Worst class and professor I've had in three years of school.,0
"Incredibly knowledgeable about the stuff he teaches. Phenomenal lecturer and in discussion (seminars). I've taken both a 15 person seminar on The Rise of Liberalism and the much larger History of American War from WWI on with him and both were amazing. It's a good amount of writing, but you don't need to memorize any tedious stuff for tests.",1
Very easy class with very straightforward professor. Tests very simillar to practice tests. Open notes. HW and projects easy.,1
I used to love math but this class made me hate it. The professor is awful at explaining/helping when you need it. The notes are hard to follow and she goes through them quick with little explanation. The only thing that saved me in this class was the free tutoring at the math center! Take advantage of it!!,0
"Professor Galgano is literally one of the nicest professors ever!!!! His class can get pretty boring but he grades really easy, and all the assignments are straight forward. Theres a take home midterm and final also!!! Def take it",1
"The textbook she uses is abysmally unhelpful, and all homework is assigned from it. Your only chance to actually learn anything is through the lectures, but she RACES through new material -- you basically only have time to copy down her work and hope to make sense of it later. The class itself is not hard, she's just a terrible teacher.",0
She is so mean and never teach. And didn't be responsible for her students.,0
I took my soci class online and I was easy. But I used the study guide on the test and made 80s and 90s on every test. The TA is really nice and theres not much work in this class,1
"Not impressed. The class was basically taught by the adjunct. CJ never even showed us any of her artwork, and had minimal tips for students, which wasn't an issue for me, because I'm a pretty experienced artist, but I felt badly for beginners. I wouldn't recommend her.",0
Very good prof - understands he is here to teach and help students learn.  First class I have ever felt comfortable expressing my ideas.  Quite a few papers but they do contribute to the material!,1
"unclear lecture notes, not well explained, too much data less information and knowledge",0
Excellent Professor!!!,1
"Dr. Chen is the cutest human and can be funny, but her accent can be difficult to understand. At the beginning of the semester she gives quizzes so do well because they add up. Her exams are very difficult and worded weirdly, she gives one group project and doesn't explain it clearly making it very confusing to work with.",0
The homework and tests don't match the notes which makes this class extremely hard. Her lectures are kinda pointless because she'll bring stuff up that won't ever be used. The homework and tests have things on them that were never discussed and she expects you to know how to do them even when you weren't taught,0
"This guy is great.  At least for dynamics he is.  His lecture are pretty clear and he he absolutely loves the topic.  He hates giving out bad grades and gives you every opportunity possible to get extra points.  Only bad thing is he isn't in his office much, but will definitely help you when he is.",1
"he rambles on and expects us to do lab assignments and homework AND turn something in at the lecture AND gives us WAY too much pointless homework. hes never at the labs, he has is TAs do it because he is way too lazy. he doesn't grade that hard, but he still doesnt know how to teach.  he expects us to know everything already.",0
I hate math and she was the only teacher who could make me understand it.  She is so sweet and nice and I learned a lot from her.  One of the best teachers at WCU.,1
"Least favorite prof Ive had at USC. Eccentric, scattered, calls out students. Screens old white Hollywood movies. Ignores international cinema at the time that was actually relevant - French New Wave anyone? Never discussed. Casper is all about HOLLYWOOD and HIMSELF. Unless you like outdated ideology and Mildred Pierce, PLEASE dont take Casper!",0
"McDonald is the best professor I've had so far in college. His lectures are interesting and funny. Only real grades are the mid-term, final, large 12pg paper and small 8pg paper. His exams are tricky and he grades more on concepts rather than facts. Study the examples he uses in class and try to see how you could recreate those experiments.",1
"This class is the worst spanish course that I have ever taken. We have so much homework for every class and the quizzes are terrible. She is nice, but this class is not worth it. I have gotten an A in every spanish class up to this point. The quizzes have things we never even talked about and the sakai page is so unorganized.",0
One of the best professors ever! Brent is probably the most hilarious professor ever. He makes mineralogy do-able and fun. Strongly recommended.,1
"I had him for American People II, he is a little boring but he knows his stuff and I did learn a lot. It's not a hard class and should be an easy A if you do the work.",1
"She's a great teacher, she is extremely passionate with her field of study. She knows a lot and expects a lot from you. Yes her test are hard but thats if you don't pay attention to the lectures, i didn't use the book for her class but it is needed for extra references. I say come to this class with an open mind.",1
"I basically taught myself this entire course. He wrote the book himself so it didn't make any difference to go to his class. The material is already so dry, his monotonous voice made even worse. Nice prof but my GPA suffered from this class.",0
"Quite honestly the worst professor Ive had in a while. She was almost completely absent from the course the entire semester. Never answered emails in a timely manner, doesnt respond to student questions online, never made assignments available in time for when we were to do them. Complete lack of attention from professor. Do not recommend.",0
Sandi genuinely cares about her students and respects hard work put into papers/class participation. We read many short stories and poems and we finished with a Shakespeare play and a novel. I enjoyed the class and would take it again,1
"Asks questions in quizzes/tests that were not covered in lecture or discussion and were barely covered in the textbook; you will not pass the class if you don't read it. The whole class is struggling with his quizzes, but he has no sympathy for us. He goes on off-topic rants about serious current events and doesn't allow any other viewpoints.",0
She is the worst teacher i have ever had i got 60's on every single assessment.  she was rude. When i asked for help before classed started she told me to get out she was not on the clock. I have no respect for her at all.  The only good thing about her is that she lets you redo assignments.  other then that find a new teacher.  ,0
Does the bare minimum.. doesn't care to help students out. Smug,0
"He was the best professor I have had.. He is very clear on what he wants, so he doesn't leave you wondering. This is not a hard class to pass, like any class you just have to pay attention. He has amazing lectures, the only real class work (no homework) is in the lab after lecture. Attendance matters, he takes roll.",1
"He's a tough grader, his tests consist of 3 essays and 5 glossary terms but essays have to be in depth about the content. He teaches pretty well as long as you study a bit, you could pass this class. I liked him, personality wise, his humour mostly consisted of being sarcastic, but i could see how other students wouldn't like him. Overall decent.",1
"She's extremely entitled. She says she is 'strict' under the guise of just being relatively self-important. I say this because she doesn't listen enough to her own students & demeans them. In a speech class, where students have to speak even when they have social anxieties, why is a professional in the subject demoralizing and degrading them?",0
"I struggled with understanding Dr. Stewart's teaching and he wasn't able to understand questions very well when asked. He also struggled with professionalism with students. Lecture was not very helpful, and the few times I tried to get help outside of class were not benificial. He did end up curving a lot on exams to make the grades more normal.",0
It's very clear on what she wants you to do. Papers are back to back. Also she will not grade any of the papers on time.,0
She knows her stuff. I want to go into disasters now!,1
The worst professor I've had. He does keep the class interested but his lectures are very hard to understand. The exams are very tricky. I regret taking this class after everyone had warned me not to!,0
"One of the best professors I have had, ever! She is so nice and helpful, and is also great at lecturing. Her tests were hard, but really encouraged me to study and I ended up learning more in this class than any other science class I have taken at SU. I REALLY recommend her.",1
"Dr. Stevens has a bad way of skipping over crucial details.  For example, he didn't explain to our class the important process of declaring variables, but spent 45 minutes explaining the implications of the uber-simple ""x++"" command.  I'm glad I went in with some programming experience, otherwise I would have been completely lost, as many were.",0
It can be hard to find a teacher to cling to especially since youre only with them for 4 months. Not with her. After 1.5 years at Tri-C she has made an astounding impact on me. You can watch her teach and know she cares about every single student. Ive never had a professor be as detail oriented and include every type of learning there is.,1
"Heard good reviews about her in previous years. However, felt subpar to me this year. Very good attitude but a good attitude has no correlation with being able to present course material. She tries very hard to make things interesting and it just ends up making things confusing. I can't ever tell if she's cracking a joke or being serious",0
Extremely helpful and engaging. Ensured students had every opportunity to pass the class and provides feedback and resources to help plan for your future in the program and after you graduate. Makes you feel like he truly wants you to succeed.,1
"When I first took this course the set up of his website was confusing. There will be times where you'll need to email him. He will reply, but he'll have an attitude in the email, so if you like rude professors take him. I felt like I learned nothing after this course. I'm usually an A student too.",0
She is the best math teacher I've ever had. Math is not my subject at all and never has been. But taking her was the best move. She is always willing to help you with anything. Her test is excactly what she goes over in class. She gives quizes to help your grade. They are easy and she will ask the class if you are ready or not. Advice: Take her.,1
"I enjoyed this class. Dr. Song made this difficult class easy to manage. The learning goal and expectation were clear. Three exams, a team project, plus a presentation. There are many hands-ons and assignments throughout the semester, so you get lots of practice for SQL. I would definitely take her again!",1
"Professor Doane is a lovely, lively, and fun teacher to have. Although, I do feel that a warning is in order, she can be judgemental when she grades tests and papers. She wants everything to flow with what she believes the text means, and she is not afraid to let those that are completely wrong that they are so. She is a very eager instructor.",1
"I really wanted to like this class because the material was so interesting. However, the professor was very unorganized, not posting assignments until the middle of the week that they were due and very unresponsive to emails. I wanted to be understanding due to the pandemic but people told me she's always been this unorganized.",0
Amazing.,1
great Prof,1
"This man, and understand I'm taking this class online during the pandemic so this might not be applicable if this lockdown gets resolved, but he is the singular worst teacher I've had in college. He simply is lazy and does not care one bit, he's recorded lectures are unacceptably horrid. Poor resolution and poorer audio quality. NEVER RESPONDS.",0
"Professor Lai was not a bad professor, but she expected too much out of this course. If she did not like your writing style you would automatically get a C on each paper with no explanation. Even with trying my hardest I got a B... Lots of readings to do!",1
"Please avoid this professor. You will not learn anything if you take him, especially those who are starting out to code. He is picks on students to do the work for him, specifically girls. There are 5 homework assignments and 2 exams. His homework and exams are very confusing, and some of them are copied from other textbooks. Would not recommend.",0
"He taught me how to complete a sentence. Yeah, he's religious, yeah, it's the canon. But, who teaches the canon better than Lentz, and don't you think you should read it well before you discount it. He is also the most compassionate, generous professor I've ever had. He grades hard, but on terms you set forth in writing",1
Has a great way of keeping the classroom fun while covering course content!,1
He is an AMAZING teacher. An inspiration.,1
"Dr. Childs is great! I thought logic was going to be very difficult but Dr. Childs does an excellent job explaining the material and making sure everyone understands! She's very understanding and hilarious. If you want an awesome teacher and an A, take Dr. Childs!",1
"Dr. Vohs gives great notes, like a high school teacher.  However, he is hard to reach and offers little help outside of class.",0
"She was really nice, she just wasnt truly helpful or harmful in any way.",1
"Pretty harsh when asking questions and really knows how to make you feel dumb even if you are right; he loves to use words like ""obviously"" and ""I do not understand what you do not see."" Spent 25-35 hours on labs and got an average of an 80 on all of them. (2) Tests are less than an hour and count 80% of your grade. I have nothing good to say :(",0
"Tabea is the best teacher I have ever had at NAIT. She is knowledgeable, puts effort into her lessons and really cares about her students. Leadership isn't always the most exciting course but she made it great!",1
"I had Lutfi for 110 as well and didn't like his teaching then and I didn't like it again this time around. He is extremely confusing, he jumps around in his lectures, he is awful at communicating through email, and he made me feel dumb every time I went to office hours. It would be a million times better of a class if he was not the one teaching it",0
"Very hard teacher, very fair and you walk away with alot of knowledge that sticks.  Best teacher I have had.",1
She was number one Adobe Professor in the world.,1
"Do not miss class. The class has 3 exams, movies with discussion guides, activities, 2 writing assignments, and quizzes. He gives lots of extra credit. Show up to class, study the lecture slides, and do the assignments, and you should get an A.",1
"She is a nice person, but as a professor she is very unorganized. Her class time is wasted while she goes on tangents all class and flips around power points where she forgot where she left off. If you ask her questions about the answers to her study guides she has no idea. I wouldn't recommend taking her class if you want to actually learn.",0
Worst Professor I've ever had. Makes you feel bad when you ask a question. Is very hard to follow. Homework assignments take hours and test are very difficult. Do not take him if you don't have to!,0
GREAT PROFESSOR! LECTURES COULD GET A LITTLE BORING BUT I LIKED HOW HE NEVER FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE USA IS GREAT. GRADE DEPENDS ON CHAPTER BOOK QUIZZES (3) AND 3 EXAMS.,1
"This is the hardest course I have taken thus far.  He does not lecture well because he thinks everyone should know everything already.  Do not approach him outside of class, it will not go well.",0
She  rambles about things that are not even remotely relevant to the class. she also gives A LOT of pop quizzes about material we have not discussed yet. her power points are vague and doesnt put them up online and what she talks about is not what the power point says. i get As in all criminal justice classes that ive taken but her class i got a C,0
The last project for her is manditory attendence but evrthing else is optional she also does not put a lot of things online so make sure you are there to get them,1
Make sure you attend every lecture and discussion! I had 90+ in both midterm and final. But only got B+ overall because I missed a few lectures. His one page essay is really restricted in terms of his requirement. His lecture is always useless and you better off read books on your own. Participation grade is so subjective and unfair. Avoid him.,0
Just go to the lecture and you'll be fine. Don't need to take notes. Every assignment is online and you have to go to two concerts within the semester. He's super chill and understanding about absences if you email him a good reason he won't count it towards you. Attendance is mandatory of your grade will slip.,1
"Prof. Rita is a prime example of why tenure needs to be eliminated at universities. She is an absolutely awful professor. She never responds to emails, and shell forget about emails that you explicitly sent her. R IS FOR RETIRE, Rita...",0
"I have nightmares of rolling backpacks because of her.  Grading is very unclear.  You do not need many materials in this class. Share a book with someone during class and use the reference book in the english lab.  Only 4 papers, but you're expected to work on them. Use the english lab.",0
"Great at explaining difficult topics. It can be a hard course if you're not good with Chemistry, but he explains well, and is available to help. Had him for ChemII after a bad professor for ChemI. What a difference. He was able to explain the stuff I didn't get the first time very well.",1
She was very nice and you can tell she cared about her students but the class was just too hard. I would compare my tests with students with other professors and the tests weren't nearly as hard.,0
Prog Reimersma was a great guy. He knows and LOVES what he is talking about. I really have to interest in geology but he made it fun. Test van be a challenge. I am a straight A student andgot B's on the tests but got an A in the class. He offers lots of extra credit. Attendance not madatory but he has pop assignments which help raise grades so go!,1
"Prof. Montague-Smith is hands down the best Organic Chemistry professor at UMD. He is tough and will challenge you and your will but after a while you begin to pick up patterns and things begin to repeat and it gets easier. Go to class each day, copy his notes, and study many practice problems and you will succeed in this class. Hard work pays.",1
"A very nice person, but a poor professor. He is very nervous when he lectures and often mumbles, which (combined with his accent) makes it difficult to understand him sometimes. The class was difficult but the grades are curved and quizzes/a test are dropped. You'll definitely need to attend tutoring/office hours if you want to do well.",0
"Definitely a worthwhile class to take and Professor Love is very knowledgable.  If you're looking for a simple gen-ed, take this.  It is not hard by any means and there are only 2 exams and a final, all essays.  After the first exam, i didn't read at all - just went to class and took clear notes. Love is very smart though.",1
I took his class thinking it was going to be easy. He is VERY confusing. Need to go to class to understand what is going on. He is very unclear and not very helpful!,1
this guy made me hate communications!!!! he thinks he knows everything and if you try and prove him wrong he will punk you and make you feel stupid.  the tests are a joke.  he asks the most random questions and its nothing that you studied. DONT TAKE!!!!!,0
"He posts his previous tests online, and he takes his new tests right from there. All his notes are online as well. He goes really fast through the material in class, so it's almost pointless to go. However, the day before exams, he gives you really good hints as to what else is going to be on the exams.",0
"She is a dismal teacher- a combination of incompetence and apathy.  Never returned emails, changed requirements constantly with no warning, let the class know the criteria for grading projects AFTER submission.  I could go on and on.  BTW, she doesn't know her subject - I finally quit trying to dialogue as she just spouted her opinion as fact.",0
Proffessor Williams is a good person but a BAD examiner. The class is hard The exams are open book open notes but hey .. the notes should be hand written only and the book must be physical one NO EBOOKS. his exams are hard with a 50 minutes time window .. you've better hurry!!,0
Hands down my favorite teacher at CSUS and one of the most interesting classes I've taken. EASY AS HELL TOO=D,1
"Tomi is one of the best teachers I've ever encountered. Without her I would not have graduated, would not have the job I have now and would still be stuck in Martin working some slacker job. Between classes and The Pacer I learned more from her than 10 oth",1
"Dr. Hollist is a great guy, he cares about his students and tells you exactly how to get a good grade on his assignments. He also has a good sense of humor. Pay attention to that and you'll be fine. There are a lot of bad reviews on here but they're coming from other UTampa students so that doesn't say much.",1
"BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!  If ur interactive in class the class will be very interesting. It's what you make out of it because there are a lot of small group discussions. Didn't know a single thing about writingstructure before taking this class, and now I write like I know how to write. It isveryhelpful class for all essays you write in the future. ",1
"Took his CS 220 class, and Intro to Algorithms class.  Worst teacher I've ever had.  He threw me out of his office hours once, because he didn't like that I missed class that day.  Doesn't speak English well at all.  You won't learn a thing in his class.  Drop, immediately.",0
"If you're looking to actually learn about literature, don't take this class. Its structure consists of games that have nothing to do with the pieces you're learning about. Dr. Lawrence is the least helpful professor; he lets the students run amok 75% of the semester. And all you do is group work, so if you're an introvert, its that much worse.",0
"Regret taking her pilates, very picky person. though she's dedicated it's way over the top, especially for something students are just taking as an extra curricular exercise. She comes off as rude. when I emailed her for clarification on an assignment, she told me to look at the syllabus even though I had and was the reason I had even emailed her",0
"All lectures are online as PowerPoints & content is straight from the book. Preferred to just read the book rather than sit through lecture. Does give extra credit for attending events & writing one page summary. Soft speaker so, if you want to hear lectures clearly, sit in first two rows.",1
"Hey, lets put this guy in charge of the honors program so he can make the smart kids fulfill a ridiculous range of random requirements instead of concentrating on their major!",0
"William Coplin is everything someone with low self esteem during their college career hopes to become, a sad egotistical elderly man who has an army of brown-nosing TA's to boost his ego. His entire course was built around having his ego massaged by teenagers. Willing to bet this creep enjoys that more than he should. Terrible professor.",0
"Professor Green is okay. The class is graded off of 3 tests. The tests are all writing, with essays and key concepts to define. Reading the textbook is not necessary. You don't have to attend class because he gives you the study guide (which is the test 1 week before the test). Most of the answers can be found online. The class is boring anyways.",1
Monica is a terrible professer. She cancels class regularly or has a substitute and ends every class early. Monica is not very straight forward with her expectations for assignments and the midterm. She takes forever to give grades back. I highly recommend not taking a class with her.,0
"One of the rudest professors I've ever encountered. Felt like if I didn't understand a part of his lecture, I couldn't ask a question or else he'd be ill-mannered about it. Always seemed knowledgeable about the subject, but was never approachable about the content. I'd recommend taking his class as a last resort if you want to learn the content.",0
I don't understand VHDL but managed to finish all homework and project except the last part(project was divided into smaller projects). You can email or ask after class when you are stuck. I think he curved our final exam too.,1
"Although his class was fairly easy and straightforward, I didn't like his personality. He would question you for leaving during lecture to go to the restroom by saying you should have done so before. Dislikes anyone leaving during class in general and thinks he's humorous but I don't believe he is. Almost condescending in a way. Don't recommend.",0
Hes really nice and caring. He keeps the class interesting and he cares about his students and their learning. I would definitely recommend taking his class,1
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
Melanie is a teacher who cares about her students her lectures are a bit boring but the slides are very explanatory. Final was easy but REALLY long with 100 multiple choice  worth 50% and 7 LONG answers worth the other 50%.,1
"If you like literature or writing, you need to take this class. A great teacher as well. It's not an easy class, it takes dedication, but it has been one of my favorite classes I've taken here, and one of my favorite teachers.",1
"Work was minimal, but he had a tendency to ramble during lectures. Much of what he said made no sense in context with the book reading, or just briefly skimmed over it. I didn't learn anything.",0
Prof. Rico does a great job of making the material available outside of class which was beneficial if you didn't instantly grasp a topic. The course is pretty straight forward but he is easy to understand and an all-around good guy. 10/10 recommend.,1
She is an awesome teacher! Willing to help you when you dont understand! Always very well prepared for class and knows her stuff! She is great I would take her any day!,1
"Not helpful, only class I have ever failed, I got migraines because of this class! Awful! ",0
"Professor Kuchta made learning Russian seem so easy! She is a very deliberate grader, so make sure you actually do the homework. Also, if you get an A on the final you pass the class, so dont worry if you bomb the midterm. The class gets easier. Also, be ready for Oral quizzes in front of the class! Not good to take if you have stage fright.",1
"Some of the information on her powerpoints blatantly contradicted the book, which made tests confusing. There is no way to see what you missed on her tests, which is inconvenient as there is no way to tell if she made a mistake, and for me going back over old tests is one of the most efficient ways to learn.",0
"He was a great teacher. He took time to inform you of key details & the reasoning behind the film before you viewed it. He also shared personal stories that helped you relate to the films being viewed. He's very wise, open minded & eagerly involved the class in class discussions after viewing the films. I have a lot of respect for him",1
I havnt even finished the semester and I cannot stand this class.  He is the worst professor I have ever seen.  The class is pretty much him reading off of the powepoints and pointless tests that test for nothing that we have learned...NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS FROM THIS PROFESSOR HE IS HORRIBLE!,0
"High expectations, but she's an intellectual. The class discussions are great.  She directs free discussions towards the topic of the evening.  She inspires a more philosophical/theoretical inspection of the studied topics. Professor Dagenais is one of my all-time favourite professors.",1
Sudipto is one of the most easy going profs at McMaster. You learn everything from his courseware that he wrote and it's so straightforward.,1
Take him for genetics lab! A little disorganized (you won't get most of your labs back... Ever) but he's nice and helps you out if you're confused,1
"Prof. Smith loves the study of Native Americans. The book he requires you to purchase is about Native Americans, and you will watch a couple movies on this subject. However, don't misunderstand this to mean that he is flaky! He is not! Everything you do in his class is a building block for writing in preparation of the final exam. Great teacher!",1
"Professor Tanoukhi has a unique, discussion based teaching style.  If you want to learn to think in the abstract and like a challenge, I highly recommend her classes.  She knows her theory and also makes sure to incorporate her student's interests.  She will make you a better scholar.  Plus she genuinely helpful in answering questions.",1
Professor Mohamed explained every single concept super clearly and provided more than enough practice to help solidify the learning of the concepts. He was very fair with grading and made sure to accommodate students due to the pandemic. A very caring professor who I can't recommend enough.,1
"Bijan is a really nice man who cares about his students deeply. He makes you call him ""Uncle Bijan"" which was very interesting. The lectures are straight from the textbook so they are pretty boring. The class is graded on three tests (including the final).",1
a little difficult to understand sometimes but he teaches decently. typically i would use the book to understand better what he went over during class. labs are easy and tests are fair.,1
"Definitely one of my favorite professors here at NDSU, he has good lectures and takes the class relatively slow. I would say that he does use a lot of masculine models and examples, and he calls on people a lot. Otherwise make sure you take good notes and you will pass the class.",1
She is amazing! This is the only class I look forward to going to.,1
"Laura is an awful teacher.  She got the clavicle bone and phalanges confused on a skeletal model.  Thank god I only had her as a lab instructor.   Her assignments were incredibly easy, but I couldn't stand her lectures.  She has no idea what she's talking about ever.  And if you ask her a question, good luck getting a logical answer.  Horrible.",0
"One of my favorite professors at MMC. He's a really good guy & his lectures are always interesting. He expects you to participate & voice your opinions in class. If you want an A, you have to work for it. He can be a tough grader on papers, but he's always willing to help you improve as a writer & give you feedback on your drafts. I recommend!!",1
Hate this kind of proffs.  Doesn't teach anything specific. Answers on a test could be anything you want as long as you justify your answer.,0
"Looking at the comments, this professor must have changed over the years.   When I had him many years ago, he was absolutely horrible.   He did tell some funny stories in class, but as a professor of history, he was lacking in many ways.",0
"Great instructor! Her class is lighthearted and you can tell that she cares. This class is quite a bit of work, but it's mostly assignments that are required from any UNIV class.",1
"Would not recommend taking this class unless you're a genuine masochist and like the ""grind"" of a more ""challenging"" class. It takes her paragraphs to describe simple physics concepts and the classwork isn't the same as the homework (20% of grade). Exams are partial credit though so if you have an idea of what you're doing you can pull a B.",0
Dr. Vutha has been one of the best professors I have ever had. The class is tough but Dr. Vutha does everything in his power to help you through it. He is very funny and personable. He holds review sessions before every quiz and exam and he is willing to meet with you anytime about any questions you have and explain them to you. Awesome dude!,1
"Ok, I have NEVER done a professor review. But Guetter is that bad. He is the worst professor I've had in my entire schooling. Get ready for LOTS of mathematica & nothing that expresses your Calculus knowledge. Get ready to be laughed at, belittled, & mocked for trying. I did well in the class, but I can't believe hes still employed. -stars for him.",0
"I had a bad TA which really killed the class considering there were two discussions a week, but the one lecture we would have was excellent. She infuses humor and intellect brilliantly. A terrific professor.",1
"Really nice professor, but too much work for a mandatory intro level course. Be prepared to spend 1-2 hours reading 20-40 pages each week for a 10 question quiz. But if you listen and participate it makes class a lot easier. He is extremely smart and will work with you during office hours, just be prepared for work load.",1
"Kelly rambles most of the class and his lectures are typically very boring. Most of the time no one would do the discussion papers. Sometimes he isn't clear with what he wants and he doesn't grade discussion papers with a rubric. Your grade will merely be what he felt it was. As long as you show up and are a decent writer, you can pass the class.",0
"I always hated biology, but Professor Morgan actually made me enjoy it for once. His lectures were always engaging, and class typically ended fairly early. We also did some fun experiments in class (made yogurt, looked at pond water, etc). There was NO homework besides one 5 page paper on any topic along with 3 Exams, 3 Quizzes, and Final Exam.",1
"One of the better profs I've had at GVSU. She explains everything thourghouly, which is great for a class like FIN320, and won't ever hesitate to go over things again and again until students understand. Tests are fair and gives a good curve. If you put in effort and work for it, you'll do fine with Edwards.",1
He's a great teacher and if you need to get that body rightthis is a great person to teach you how to do this.,1
"Professor was very intelligent about her subject, however, her teaching style was not fit for such a small class. Also, textbook reading was not only a requirement, we would be required to read in depth and analyze information, almost always requiring a second or third read to answer quizzes correctly. Homework was also extremely difficult.",0
Another laid back instructor. He is Very well educated and he conveys his point clearly. He is fair and will help you out as much as he can. Hard concepts but he makes it as interesting as possible. Will recommend.,1
"Difficult class.  A majority of that was due to Dr. Wilson's inability to actually teach.  Assignments, etc were moving targets.  I altered study habits w/ each section to see which would bring the most success.  The amount of time that I spent studying for this class did not coincide with my final grade and overall effort.  2/3 of class dropped.",0
I took this class online. She didnt write the lectures or the quizzes/tests and that fact alone is absolutely ridiculous. I emailed her several times throughout the course to understand trick questions and she would say that the concept had been taken out or it WAS a weird question and still wouldnt give credit. Too tedious.,0
I've never been a fan of the sciences.  This class put me to sleep.,0
Profesor McCarthy is a very nice but I would not recommend taking her class! She is an extremely tough grader and will not give out an A. I am an A student and I got a C on my first paper. She allows you to correct your paper which is helpful. You are given 3 papers but she just expects way too much. Assignments are unclear.,0
"you have to put in the effort to do well in your class, but as long as she sees you are taking risks with your acting and trying, you can do well.  if you are the type who doesn't like uncertainty in grades you shouldn't take the class, because you won't find out your grades on the acting assnmts (only the written ones).  fun class.",1
"He is a nice person and genuinely wanted to know his students and he would create flashcards of us so he could learn all our names. However, he doesn't really teach the material. Especially when we went online, it was just a lot of read the book and do the online homework and he was just chillin' there.",0
"Professor Ni brings a lot of knowledge to his classes. Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism all find a place in his analysis of Western philosophy, and it's organic, not forced. Sometimes it's hard to get him to understand your difficulty with a problem, in class or outside. I suggest emailing him with questions. ",1
"He's a great professor, one of the best ones I have had at csuf. The material is not easy and requires a lot of review to master. He's pretty lenient with the homework and you would be smart to get to know him personally. He's a great instructor and he wants everyone to pass. He has a wealth of knowledge and if you try you'll be fine.",1
"He is a nice guy, but admits the first day that he is monotoned and prepares us for a boring course.  His quizzes are hard for the pure fact that there is so much material to cover for a 10 question quiz.  He isn't helpful outside of class and is very hard to get ahold of. DONT TAKE. Take learning!!!!",0
"I think Mr. Johnson is an amazing professor. You can tell that he knows his stuff & all of his lectures are actually amusing. I have learned so much in this class, even though I didn't do the best. He really makes you work for a good grade, but always has E.C. available. Exams are hard & I still don't know how to study for them to pass LOL",1
"I don't know what this guy gets out of ruining your GPA and making this class 100 times harder than it is, but he just loves it. Will not help you in any way shape or form. Worst class of my life.",0
"Judy truly cares about the personal well being of her students and their internal learning more than tests.  You may take it bc its easy, but she'll care so much about you that you end up caring alot about the class, and learning.  And she's brilliant.",1
"Extremely difficult exams even if you're regularly studying. Always starts lecture a minute early and goes at least two minutes past the time allotted. Once made a mistake on his exam and went back to regrade a week later and took points away from several students, penalizing students for his mistake. Would recommend a different prof.",0
By far the worst class i've taken in college. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFFESOR! Even if it's your last option!!!!,0
"This was so boring. I always dreaded it, and I would almost fall asleep. He lectures the whole time, but it's sooo boring. I learned most things from the textbook.",0
"This class is amazing attendance is and isnt mandatory he takes attendance but you can skip a couple of times. You write a total of like 4 -5 papers but they will be the easiest papers youve ever done. We had one quiz and it was analyzing a video. The class is fun, I would 100% take again.",1
"Awful, didn't explain things, hard. I'm a dean's list student and I got a C. He was the worst professor ever.",0
"Horrible professor with such a heavy accent. Had no idea what he was talking about, and to top it off his handwriting was pure garbage. Statistics shouldn't be hard but professor sidhom made it extremely difficult. Passed with a B but it was a real struggle, I know more than half got below C.",0
"This was my first math class I have taken for college and I LOVED IT! Professor Ball is hands down the best teacher I have ever had! Such a funny guy, but at the same time doesn't get off task, and is able to teach the material perfectly! I wish he taught every math class! TAKE HIM AND I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!",1
"I have loved History my entire life. Taking this class made me doubt that love on multiple occasions. There is way too much reading for a gen ed. I had to spend more time on this class than I did on the rest, lowering my overall grade. He also seems to think we're all below average students. And I'm pretty sure History is more than Social Mobility.",0
Nicest funniest professor I have had. I actually was happy to go to his class. He is very knowledgable. He even wrote our lab manual. Take him. ,1
Cares about students and funny stories,1
all online with a old class on Blackboard that is had a confusing layout. No instructor present. grade is based on 4 exams and discussions posts. Requires 6 replies and initial post response. Class is extremely boring and reading and responding to 6 posts that all say the same thing is mind numbing. Would not recommend. Would not repeat.,0
"Took this as an online class. Every week there's a homework and a quiz. They weren't super hard, but VERY time consuming. Finding answers in the text were often hard. Only tests are a Midterm and Final, lots of questions and difficult to retain all that information, especially when this is an elective class and you are not a science major.",1
If you have the option do not take this class online. Her directions are not very specific and she is terrible at replying to emails when students have questions. She will even copy and paste emails and send them to multiple students that asked for feedback on their paper. Not very helpful at all. ,0
"Professor Pool is one of kind. She is definitely a master of her profession. She really knows all there is about music and loves passing on her knowledge, love, and enthusiasm of music to her students. Not one day in her class is dull or boring - she always has an upbeat attitude that makes time fly. You will also learn TONS from Prof. Pool!!",1
"Prof. Wike is a very knowledgable prof! however, the material is not as easy to grasp if you aren't an education major. The majority of the class gets B's. If you're ok with this, take the class. Lots of reading, but overall GOOD class! 3 quizzes, 2 papers, a group project, and a final!",1
I don't know what these people are thinking that say he cares about students. He will just make fun of you and insult you and then talk about his 4.0 GPA. He's a total @$$ to everyone. I would say avoid at all costs but his class is required.,0
"Terrible experience. Very unorganized and lacks the necessary communication skills to teach remotely. Whole grade is based on 2 tests taken in a totally different format than 3rd party software she uses to ""teach"". Unreasonable expectations, passive aggressive emails, no passion. She doesn't care and it shows-don't waste your time/money.",0
"Really nice guy, funny, but frustrating if youre accustomed to more organized & punctual teachers. No HW but that does mean your grade is basically based on tests. Feels weird spending hrs on labs you dont even turn in for credit. Stalls on getting graded work back due to being busy w day job, but its a night class, most of us work FT too.",1
"Great guy, explains the information well and does lot of in class examples from the homework to help even more, definitely recommend Adam",1
Dan is awesome! One of the best professors out there. He is super willing to help his students and his love of French is infectious. Can't wait to take more of his classes.,1
I did not like the fact that I couldn't understand her with her accent so it was very frustrating. I am good at math and I couldn't do it so I had to drop her class and get a better professor.,0
I would not recommend him at any cost. Do WHATEVER you can to get out of his class. The exams were extremely detail oriented and the lectures were hard to follow. He's a nice guy but he is ineffectual when teaching. You have to take your own notes completely and the tests are all written. Crams material quickly and never revisits it.,0
Doesn't grade or give feedback on the many lengthy assignments till weeks later.,0
"Dr Golden is fantastic, he is trying to alter the way we see math and the way we believe it should be taught: comprehension, deep understanding vs remember this and that and apply. He wants us to help our future students engage with the math. His class set up is unusual, but fun. Open your mind.",1
"Pretty boring class that is not difficult if you attend, take notes, and do the readings. The class had a m/c midterm and final, which he allowed an 8x10 cheat sheet of double sided notes. Also have to post forums (only 6/12 assigned through semester) which are based off the readings. Overall, this class was mediocre-just go to class and take notes",1
"Estrada is not very happy about teaching the trig version of this course. He actively avoided us during office hours, allowed some students more time on exams if they skipped other classes, and is very hard to understand. The textbook is even more garbage as it doesn't actually reflect anything from his tests. Exams are brutal.",0
"Interesting topic, but he makes it boring and even more confusing. Gives no feedback. Assignments are crammed and confusing. Does not help. Assignments will take forever, but only worth a few points. Avoid at all costs.",0
"take someone else, avoid him!",0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! she literally does not answer her EMAILS! she is a communication professor yet her inability to get back to you with attitude is unacceptable. Her workload is insane she acts like her class is the only one, meanwhile there is other courses. too much for a 200 level class .",0
"Very personable, he is a bit of a picky grader, but an easy B. As long as you follow the essay format for the three essays that he teaches you in class you will be fine. He literally tells you how he wants each essay written. Interesting enough topics as well. Overall good.",1
"I only needed to go to my tutorials and the review classes before midterm and final and still got an A-. Most of his slides were unnecessary, just read the TB pages assigned. The term paper was ridiculously easy, and the midterms are fair but you better know your stuff because there's no time to think.",1
"DO NOT take this professor.  She sucks at teaching, she don't know how to communicate with her students.  She's constantly rude she surely do not help you at all.",0
"I found Lubert to be one of the most unapproachable professors I've had. I went to his office hours a few times, and if you don't seem like you know what's going on, he doesn't seem willing to help. He always told me to ""go deeper"" on written assignments but I would literally write until the end of class. Only timed write exams and quizzes. Avoid.",0
Professor Noimann grades very unfairly. I took her class online and she wasnt helpful at all. I turned in all her homework on time and participated and passed all her tests and assignments and overall gave me a poorly grade. I highly recommend you dont take her.,0
"This class is very easy if you go to class and pay attention. The material is not hard to understand. If you dont understand, he will help you understand. Very great class and professor!",1
"He was the coolest professor I have had by far! Super nice and truly does want his students to succeed. Lab work was easy, just make sure you have the book because a lot of the labs require diagrams that are already in the book. If you don't have it, he'll print out some copies. Really just and overall good guy.",1
He is a sweet heart the exams are just like the homework,1
"Professor Hinshaw is very nice and approachable, but I found his class boring and his teaching overrated.  He reads from his powerpoint slides, which makes it useless to go to class, since you can stay home and read them yourself.",1
"Ms. Pena is a great professor. She's a little on the young side but she connects well with her students. She gives you the option to buy either the online or physical book. You have one group presentation but it's fun because you get to choose your subject. Make sure to play close attention to everything, especially the pop quizzes. Final was easy.",1
"Head of the department and it is obvious why. JD is a great professor that has a main goal of making sure students understand the subject topic. Was always willing to help, clarify, and go the extra mile to make sure that everybody knew what he was teaching. A MUST HAVE professor at least once. Glad I was able to take this course with him.",1
"Sign language is a great language, but this Professor makes me question if I should continue with studying it. She has temper tantrums, extremely impatient, and will put down students when they have a genuine inquiry to further their learning. It is taxing having to come to each class and have to feel like you are not good enough for sign language.",0
"While she uses the book a lot for homework, she hardly ever uses it to teach. Her entire method was hinged on whether or not you took French in high school. If you did, you're golden, if not, look for another professor because you will not get the necessary foundation for french from her.",0
I had her for 099 and if you go to class and do your HW you will get a good grade! just do the freakin HW and ur okay!!!,1
"This professor just does not seem to have any knowledge on teaching. He is extreamly unorganized, and you just cannot follow what he is saying. Honestly I don't think he has any intrest in his students.",0
"She's very nice, and attendance is mandatory, but I didn't learn much in her class. She talks alot and her lectures don't seem very helpful if you plan on being a teacher. She is a tough grader, and even if she tells you that you did a really good job that means you might had a B or lower. Her quizes are specific and her insturctions are not clear.",0
"No personal skills -- hardest class I've taken in my entire life, because I had him -- get ANY other prof!",0
Dr. Head. You rock.  Thanks for 6 awesome years.  You are truly one of the finest musicians and people i have ever and will ever meet.,1
"Dr. McCullough is very nice, and her class was a breeze. There are small assignments due at pretty much every class, but they are easy. You are allowed a 3x5 double sided notecard on the exams; she offers a ton of extra credit.",1
"He does have an accent, but honestly, it's not hard to understand him. His practice test are very close to actual test, he's willing to help and answer questions if you ask. He can get ahead of himself sometimes during lecture and will skip steps, but he'll explain if you just raise your hand and ask. If you study, you should be fine.",1
"Once in a lifetime, you meet a teacher with the care and determination that Favara has and it is amazing! If you do the reading and take time to prepare for class (even if it's a skim through) you will be able to contribute to some amazing conversations! She always wants to hear what her students have to say and she has our best interest at heart!",1
"He is a very difficult professor, He makes you do quizzes Every 2 chapters. Import lane mid term and the final combine. Where you have to re learn the information you learned in the beginning to even passes class. My recommendation is to not take him. He does not give you enough time to study. He gives you the study guide day before the final.",0
Her lectures seemed frantic and not very well organized. It was hard to follow her because of this. She claimed the study guides/lectures outlines would help prepare students for the exam but they didn't. She should assign homework that would provide a better idea on the types of questions she asks on exams bc the wording was difficult.,0
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! I took the 8 week online class and asked for help with the Excel project and got no response. I emailed him 4 times and got a response that did not explain anything. Way more than just the usual computer stuff. I get all A's in my classes but will be lucky to get a C.,0
Not supportive at all.,0
This class was horrible. She grades on however she wants and doesn't give back any comments. Her scantron tests are not even covered in the book.,0
Excellent teacher! She has a focus in education and really understands how to teach. She offers lots of extra credit and is helpful. She will only lecture for 20 or so minutes and makes sure you understand the material. I think she could teach any subject well. Wish there were more professors like her!,1
"I wouldnt recommend to take him for summer. He speeds through lectures. Exam every week, he has a unique way of teaching, which can be confusing. He is funny and... thats it. Other than that, asking questions or help on homework wont help.",0
"THIS GUY IS AWESOME! I had him for Political Inquiry and The Congress and Public Opinion. TAKE HIS CLASSES! Literally one of the smartest and most engaging progessors at Bates College. Extremely knowledgeable, helpful and funny!!!!!",1
Lhota is very caring and cares about your success in this class. Attendance is mandatory but you can miss up to 4 classes. Just go in during office hours and she will tell you what you need to fix on your paper to receive a great grade.,1
"Very clear expectations from Day 1! Read the assigned chapters and post on the discussion boards, and you are all but guaranteed to pass.",1
"Definitely one of the best math professors Ive ever had. She answers emails and proactive throughout the semester. Everything is through mymathlab, but her setup makes it easier to understand each chapter. Take her if you can!",1
Wouldn't take him again he was a much harder grader than other lab professors I've had before. Take a diff lab instructor if you can.,0
"HORRIBLE CLASS!!! Do not take it. I am not kidding when I say that more than half the class is sleeping in their seats during his lectures. Nothing he says applies to his exams or quizes. Prof. Cole is a very nice man, but a horrible teacher. He can not communicate very well. I eventually gave up in the class. The exams are IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!",0
She was a decent teacher but without my prior knowledge and amazing TA I don't think I would've done as well. She gives random extra credit assignments and points which is a big plus.,1
"Professor Hower really knows how to explain stats. She is really bad at replying to emails, sometimes it has taken over 6 days for her to reply. You will do a lot of labs, 3 tests, 1 quiz, 1 project, and a final. She is extremely funny and cares a lot about her students.",1
Unprofessional. Do one thing he doesn't like and he will hold a grudge.,0
"Well, I'll start with the good: Firstly, she's peppy and sometimes makes funny jokes. Yeah, that's about it. She has a pretty thick accent, which isn't her fault, but she speaks so quickly and blasts through so many topics that I always found myself with a dull headache at the end of class. There are NO practice materials and feedback is minimal.",0
He's a good guy. Show up to class and pay attention and you'll do fine.,1
She is a great professor. She works with her students and offers extra credit...Do the extra credit because she doesn't round your grade up for that reason.A lot of her test questions come from the diagrams in the book so study those...,1
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone. I chose this class with such high intentions and ending up being extremely disappointed. I am barely passing and the amount of work assigned is not normal. Please trust me. ,0
"Coplin is incredible. Some of the comments below are completely untrue. Great class, great professor. Real life applications. Former PAF students as speakers. Would take again.",1
Professor McAdam is seriously one of the BEST TEACHERS I've ever had. Firstly she is hilarious.  She always listens to our feedback and really listens to us.  She's simply awesome. I would never wanna miss her class simply because i loved it! she has a couple of quizzes that are basically vocab and some essays.  Take her class is you have the chanc,1
"Log into the lecture on time, TRY to pay attention to his lectures, and do the homework and you'll pass. He's very confusing when it comes to what expects. Be prepared for one day he wants you to just randomly download respondus lockdown for an exam WITH a webcam with no explanation. For technical issues, he wasn't good at assisting.",1
Wonderful teacher. One would love to have her. She cares about her students and gives extra credit. I have her for two classes and she takes passion in her teachings. Attendance is important and so is being on time. She takes roll everyday. Very clear and the books and short stories she teaches are wonderful.,1
"He's one of the most intelligent professors Ive encountered on this campus. He's a little sarcastic, condescending, and crabby, but there is nobody id rather learn history from. Be prepared to read. All of his exams are multi essays. He gives a lot of reading assignments, so beware of pop quizzes. If you're here to better your education choose him.",1
"Although he was respectable and responsive, most of his assignments were vague. For example, one had to think outside of the box yet if you answer to your own accord, he doesn't explain what you did wrong. His lectures were useless and this class was pretty much asynchronous. The class is passable, but it can be difficult because of his directions.",0
ok prof. clear lectures but bad tests,0
Worst prof ever- brought her toddler to class 3times including final exam! She expects to be accommodated but accommodates no student even if you have a learning disability. Boring classes- always starts talking about her own life for min. 1 hour every class. I tried complaining to the dept-  no reply! She should be fired. Waste of my money & time!,0
"She is a very sweet lady, and really loves what she does. However, be prepared to really have to work for your grade in this class, especially if you're not very keen with math to begin with.",0
"He is not good at explaining things, but because of this he does a lot of examples to try and explain. He gives a lot of homework but is identical to the examples done in class, weekly quizzes and homeworks and drops 4-5 of them, he gives you a study guide that has the same questions as the exam and lets you retake the exams for a better grade.",1
"This professor's lessons are very clear. The class is very interesting and there will be a lot of debate. The exams are somewhat long, but if you read the chapters and study the study guide you will do great. I highly RECOMMEND this professor. The book is extremely interesting.",1
He is a great lecturer. He doesn't use slides and writes everything on the blackboard. So you need to be in class all. the. time. He doesn't give out quizzes. The grades are based on two midterms and one final.,1
She thoroughly went over everything that she knew you would encounter in your homework. Always gave numerous examples to clarify the subject. Anytime you had a question she was more then happy to answer it and even explain it in a way that you would understand it. She really is passionate about what she teaches! I highly recommend her class!,1
"Ho, is literally the one of my worst profs. I had him for Micro Economics, and all I have to say is get ready to work. Even though I never went to class because he does heavy lectures and goes to fast. I decided to self teach. One good thing about Ho, he uses the study guide and literally uses the study guide as the exam. So memorize it.",0
"Such a boring Professor. He is a nice guy, yet he is VERY monotoned. Also when he is going over the PowerPoints, he doesn't elaborate at all. I could not tell you a single that that we are talking about in this class. Tests and homework are easy though and the book is expensive.",0
"He's the man. Knows his stuff and is crystal clear. Hard to do poorly in class. But reason I recommend him is despite a class of 30 people, he knows everyone's name and face. I came to him 2 semesters after the class to see if he would write me a recommendation, and he remembered who I was perfectly and gladly wrote it. Take one of his classes.",1
"I had him as a discussion class for calc 1 and my god he seems so irritated to teach. As if it's not his job to??? Also, he graded my work with really rude comments. I attended his discussion once and I asked a question and he seemed super annoyed that I did. Never joined the class again.",0
"I've only been in this class for a week and I already hate it. She doesn't help you on anything at all and just assumes that you know everything. She even puts extremely difficult questions on homework that she never taught in class. If it wasn't past the drop date, I would most definitely switch out of her class.",0
LAME.,0
"He is a nice guy.. but professor wise, I would never recommend him. His class is passable. But, you will learn nothing. He just reads off the powerpoints and seems disinterested in any comments from others. However, his exams are easy if you study. His exam reviews are very helpful. I wish he was that helpful in daily lectures.",0
"I would not recommend this Prof to anyone. If possible, take someone else. His grading is near impossible, and he does not seem to understand how to talk to students. This is my major, and I have never had such a horrible history Prof in all seven years of my college experience.",0
Great teacher!  I very much enjoyed his teaching style.  Great class.  I learned a lot.,1
"One of the least helpful and least responsive professors I've ever had. She never responded to my emails by answering the questions I had she always just redirected me to the tutoring center, even for technical issues that the tutoring center couldn't really help with. I wouldn't recommend this teacher to anyone.",0
What a waste of time! too much English.  when she used Spanish you hardly could understand.  Easy A and nice lady.,0
"He's actually not that bad, I think.  It's hard to tell whether he is mean, hateful and condescending or whether he's trying to be funny.  Whatever it is though he really needs to work on his personality.  He's a graduate student that isn't ready to be teaching yet.  I've had graduate students before who were amazing, he is not one of them.",0
"He likes to be called "" Uncle J.R"" and his favorite color is orange. Jones is funny and really knows this subject. For 120 all the quizs were take home, homework was minimal. However his exams are hard so study for those!!  Also you might have to write a research paper APA style.",1
Dr. Fujita speaks in such an awkward tone that it it difficult to understand.  I learned everything in my workshop in which the leader did not have anything good to say about her either.  She makes multiple mistakes on her tests. I have had three and there have been at least 2 MAJOR mistakes on each,0
Never has exam grades added up and does them fast before hands them back.  Both my exams were added up wrong so far this year and had to track him down to get them corrected. Tests you on things like calculations that he has never taught you how to actually do in class.  Never returns class case study assignements so we dont know our grades,0
"Dr. J is quite frankly the best professor I have ever come in to contact with. She guides you, as you are typically a freshman in her class, through your experiences as a freshman english education major. You will be grateful for the high demands she has for you after you complete her class and have a grip on your life as a whole. TAKE HER CLASS! ",1
"Terrible teacher. Got good grades so far, but approaching him is useless for help. He's very rude to plenty of students. The class is all lecture, and for tests, he only gives you the questions. 100 questions on test, must find answers yourself. 6-8 page essay. 2 100 questions tests. Never expect to leave early. Would not take him again.",1
Mr. Prunty truly cares about his students and goes over and above to be helpful. I would definitely take his classes again.,1
"This class is super easy, but if you have a question don't ask the teacher. He won't be able to answer it. Ask one of the student assistants. This teacher makes the class almost impossible to fail, but he doesn't know what he is doing.",0
"Funny and really nice! Not the most commanding and interesting lecturer, but easy to talk to and knows what he's talking about. This class (GWSS 1006) is very easy, you don't have to do all of the reading. Participation in the discussion sections is basically an easy A",1
"do not take this professor if possible. expect having to teach yourself the material on your own time. feedback is unhelpful, marks down correct answers because you didn't do it ""his"" way.  class average on exams are well below 50%, but that's obviously our fault, right?",0
"Professor Pozzi is a very example of an educator. She is nervous speaking in front of a class. She is very biased and feels threatened if her ideas/beliefs are questioned. She does not reward those who take interest in the language/her class. As a current educator, I can affirm she represents everything a teacher should not be.  Not recommended.",0
Very disorganized!! Can be rude and it can be difficult to understand what she wants. I feel like I haven't learned anything about Social Work in this class...,0
Had to drop this class. Teacher is ridiculous.,0
"I had Dr. D in 1976. Learned alot. Made the courses I had interesting. As a Field Public Health Sanitarian, the courses were very helpful. Can't forget the knowledge that was passed on.",1
awesome teacher. She is great at explaining and making sure you understand the concept. Do not give her attitude she will not tolerate it. We had hw listed for us it's a lot she doesn't look at it you'll get a check mark if it's done. My class convinced her for all test to be taken home it worked. Do your work study the content&youll pass,1
Good teacher.He knows what he is talking about and he doesn't try and push his views on his students.,1
"Fun and interesting, but he is blunt. I have given many hours to this course and I still think I may fail.  I am trying everything to succeed and he tells me if you don't understand physics, I can't make you.  He is harsh, for a 100 level course he teaches it like it is a 400 level.  Hoping I can succeed in the end.",0
He gives incredibly long lectures that are not engaging. NR001 was a joke. Not enjoyable at all. I would recommend that if you want to be in Rubenstein that you start freshman year as undeclared and then transfer into Rubenstein sophomore year. That way you only have to take one class as a transfer student as opposed to NR001 and NR002.,0
"Schilling's lectures are boring, but if you just do every single reading, this class is an easy A. Tests are all multiple choice, including the midterm and final, with some easy short answer extra credit questions.",0
"There is a LOT of reading, and it's not always entirely clear which portions are important or what you're supposed to be getting out of it. There's no textbook, so the reading is all online. Because there's no feedback and the grades take a while to be posted, you could be completely off and have no idea until weeks later.",0
"I'm taking her class and I really enjoy it! She's super understanding of personal issues and is really willing to work with you if you talk with her. She gives great comments on your work which are very helpful. Not the best class, but she's a great teacher.",1
"I feel Dr. Deeba cares for her students & knows a lot about A&P2 but Stay clear of her, especially if the class is online. The majority/ if not the entire class failed the 1st two exams (60% of your grade). Very little support/ guidance to help you succeed. Test are very difficult and she makes it harder than needed. 1/2 the class withdrew.",0
"I had a really great time in his class, but you have to work for it. The class is very hard and you are only graded based on quizzes and the final exam. Since my class was online everything was open note, no time limit. Very fun and his lectures were helpful. While is teaching style works for me might not be the best for everyone.",1
"Cohen is new teacher from California. I still got a B, but I scraped by- my lowest grade that term. Every other teacher for this class will present tests that are extracted from in-class quizzes. Cohen on the other hand would rather torture you (even if you study) with difficult tests. Just take another teacher; they will make this core class easy.",0
"This professor is an absolute trip. If you have a question regarding anything and you e-mail her one week in advance, she will say I never saw the e-mail. The weekly homework were mostly essays that had to be cited in APA . She is easily the toughest grader in the dept. If you have the option, please save yourself and your GPA to not take the class",0
"After reading good reviews, I was excited to learn about crim in a sociological context. LA's lectures are painfully dull and boring, you're better off staying home and reading the text and slides. Shes super dismissive and seems to revel in her white privilege. Always uses same weird anecdote about her being able to drink vs an indigenous woman?",0
"Still uses moodle when we as students pay for D2L. Talks about himself like he is the the ""best."" The lectures are all over the place. He starts talking about one topic bounces around to another topic. Be prepared to be confused with his teaching methods very unorthodox.",0
rude,0
The worst consoler ever in my entire life.I don't know who and how this lady is chosen as a consoler .I MUST say she can be anything except a consoler. She discouraged me a lot in a ridiculous way .when I reached to her office was early morning but I seemed like she did not want me there by that time and I was so disrespected. I regret about going.,0
"Dr. Fitzpatrick is good at relaying the ""heady"" material into layman's terms, but the class is still not super easy. The reading journals are the worst! I do not like philosophy, but I would recommend the class if you need a PL class.",1
"Mrs. Thrasher is a very nice lady. Her class is very laid back and easy. My only complaint is that her class can get a tad dull, but other than that, she's great!",1
"He is hard and uses constructive criticism but it's only because he's trying to make you a better dancer. Come to class, write in your notebook, and KNOW THE DANCE TO A TEE, it's your exam! He takes nervousness into consideration though he should grade those who have danced longer on a harder scale vs. beginners.",1
"I studied every day for this course and got deducted points for saying too much. I got an 85% avg mark for the lab portion with the lab instructors marking-which is all based off short answer but could only get no higher than a 71 for his exams. Super unfair prof, hes a nice guy but I would not recommend him to anyone.",0
"She is a great teacher and the course was not hard at all. All you have to do is do all the work, it's not hard just kind of time consuming but this is an easy A class. You will love her I promise.",1
"This professor changed my life, because of him I have a degree. ",1
"I took NSD 225 to fulfill a non-lab science requirement and received the EASIEST A! If youre not STEM orientated then definitely take while online! This barely felt like a class, with the only work being weekly quizzes and discussion board posts. Everything was already on Quizlet.",1
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
Nice Prof. Simulation sucks!!!! Test were easy. Don't take notes they are online. Have to do a Presentation of Wall Street Journal Article.,0
"Tries very hard for his students, genuinely cares about student success. Not a great lecturer. I never really learned the real material for the class from his lectures, so the online tests were very hard for me. really nice guy, he just tends to ramble on and on about ""real world"" stuff that doesn't actually pertain to the material.",1
A bit scatter-brained.  Tons of homework.  Do it all and you'll be all right.,1
"Miller understands the material but doesn't teach very well. The class is mixture of rambling and rushing at the end to fit in examples that are ""crucial"" for the class. Miller goes over by 8 mins a day. Over all, I would not want to take a class with him again.",0
Absolutely loved him. I found his teaching style super easy to follow and his sense of humor was fantastic (once you get used to him that is). I had him for MTH 23.,1
Very knowledgeable professor. He knows his stuff. Only problem is that he goes too fast when showing his slides. His exams are half the quiz and half class notes. Very hard class. Must be willing to memorize a lot of information.,0
Lisa kicks ass!,1
"Wow, what a mean,unpersonable, and seemingly unhappy woman.  Tests are easy if you study your notes, but class time is SUCH a drag.  Why should you want to be there if your professor just regurgitates the book.  She is a bit scary and unapproachable.",0
Took course online for fall 2018. Course had little assignments but tons of reading and 2 papers to complete work. Not sure what to make of it but it required 2 books.,0
She blew off the students questions and told us not to bother going to the tutor,0
"Professor literally lost one of my quizzes and gave me a zero, when I never missed one class and took the quiz. Incredibly disrespectful to students. She tells us to ask her questions and email her then she does not respond to emails. Would never recommend this professor. Many people dropped the course halfway through the semester due to her.",0
Professor Draayer is a great Professor. He is an easy A and if you show up to class and take notes you should get an A. Everything that he puts on the board is going to be on the test.,1
"No clear directions on to what the actual assignment is. Wants a new essay draft printed each time you make even just a word change, and we all know we don't have the money as college students to be printing off 8 or more pages every class. Definitely would not recommend taking her class, honestly taking the online class would be easier for sure.",0
"She was like a guide introducing us to this brand new world that you can tell she was passionate about. Was the class hard? Yes! However, its better to learn from someone with her knowledge about the ocean than just out of a textbook. Do not miss the field trips. Theyre incredible!",1
"Worst professor I've had at UVM thus far. Vague and completely incomprehensible...I don't even think she knows what she's talking about half the time. Classes were boring and unnecessary...you would think you were doing fine in the class until test time when, although upon finishing the test you felt fine, you actually did terribly.",0
"Extremely dull class. Discussion has no direction, particularly irritating as discussion accounts for 24%. Subject matter is minimal, feels like Kuefler is stretching the limited material to fit timeframe. Advertised as history class but there are few historical sources used, just low quality films.",0
"Dreadful teacher. Never appears organized, and her discussion certainly reflects it. Her midterm was ridiculous and studying was so vague. She frequently goes on random tangents. Avoid this class like the plague.",0
Would never take again. Grammar Nazi. Avoid if can.,0
"KB was awesome. He was very relaxed about attendance, but held you accountable by your work. He was helpful and open to ideas, never made anyone feel that they were wrong for their opinions. He grades according to the college standard guidelines (where a c is a good thing), so I was worried, but I did really well in the class.",1
"He is nice, but I wouldnt take OChem at OC again. He doesnt know his stuff enough to answer questions at all.",0
"Very very smart Professor who can teach anyone thermodynamics. Her lectures and notes were very clear and Dr. Elliot is very approachable as she enjoys any questions about thermodynamics. If you do your part, she will lead you to an A :)",1
"He's a good TA. Has a bit of an accent, but still easy to understand. You can ask him for help with the discussion worksheet so you should do fine in the course.",1
"This professor has an amazing resume, but dont let that trick you. He is rude to students, doesnt answer questions most of the time, even thought he will ask if anyone has questions. He may struggle with hearing as he does wear a hearing aid, but that does not excuse his attitude. He picks and chooses who he calls out, and you will learn very lit",0
"Love, Love, Love him!  His class was my favorite.  He tells you what to study and that will be on the test. Very awesome guy, cares about all his students.  I wished he taught more than this class!",1
Super nice lady!! She gives an insane amount of extra credit it's literally impossible to do bad in this class. Everyone does bad on the first exam which makes you think you're doing bad in the class but then after the second exam she shows you how she curves everything and literally everyone gets an A/B. Just go to class and take notes and ur good,1
"Parkhurst is an amazing professor!!! Very caring. His lectures are easy to understand and are intriguing. He seems to genuinely love what he does. Make sure you read!!! If you dont, I promise you he knows. DO NOT SHOW UP LATE. He will lock the doors and not let you in if you do.",1
Great professor! Would definitely take again. Tests are take home and he will go out of his way to help you with his extremely understanding attitude and helping teaching style. He will go over it until he knows you have learned the material. He always has super funny jokes and is very outgoing.,1
"I had Mr. F-M for ENC 1101 and 1102, and I enjoyed having him as a teacher for both classes! He is very clear on the requirements of the assignment and gives good feedback on the rough drafts. He is very comical and is understanding when it comes to stress level, especially during finals and midterms. I would definitely take him again!",1
"Take this professor! You will learn a lot and there is not much work to do. Just show up to class, meet his expectations and you'll get an A.",1
"Very nice guy but too laid back, doesnt teach a thing just plays boring movies that arent tested. midterm composed nearly entirely of study questions at the end of each textbook chapter (easy if you study).  must teach yourself everything from the book as there's no lecutures or notes",0
I switched my major to marketing because Maria made the class that awesome. I wish I could have her teach all of my classes. You can tell she's really passionate about her students and she really wants everyone to learn. Take her!!,1
"Such a lovely woman. I have taken her several times and have to admit, I do have a bit of a crush on her as she is quite physically attractive but dont let that distract you from the fact that she is a mathematical genius. Very reachable outside of class and willing to help. Passionate about what she teaches and wants to see you succeed.",1
"How can you not love Kucich? He is the sweetest, nicest man ever. He types up ridiculously long and thoughtful comments on people's essays, always tries to make sure the class understands the concepts, and ratchets up the level of analytical discourse. May not always be entirely easy to follow, but if you're willing to think, it's worth it.",1
I dont know how this professor has high ratings or is in charge of the FMS department. She has poor organization skills. Never was clear on grading material. Only took attendance when she wanted. Constantly changed her syllabus schedule last minute. Dont take her unless you have too. Which sadly was my case. Her material is dated and boring.,0
"This is a beginners art class, and Jesse didn't treat it like one. Graded on if you could draw really well when he should be grading on effort and passion for the subject. Very rude and disrespectful. I did not appreciate or even ask for his criticism. His assignments were uninteresting and boring. Good luck if you're stuck with him.",0
"She would be great for high school.
 
 PS her name is spelled Miiller.",0
"This class is an oral requirement so everyone is required to give a presentation on a predetermined topic. Most professors make you do the full hour and 15 minutes, Cassidy only required a 30 minute presentation. You will do some impromptu and peer reviewed papers, no class on those days. Easy A if you do everything and show up for presentations.",1
:-/,1
"Online class.  The class is listed under Dr. McHann, the entire class is lectured, graded and instructed by Prof Frost (tough grader).  Gave all 3's because McHann was nonexistent.  Living Case Study of 30 pages, along with a cumulative final exam.  Weekly quiz's and weekly research plus group DQ's.  Spend at least 20+ hours a week.  Good Luck!!!!!",1
"He started off the year seeming like a nice guy.. He changed as the year went on, Hes pretty harsh I learned this the hard way. He tries to push his views on you (politics, vegetarianism, etc). I think he chooses favoritism as a way to grade rather than what work or effort you put in.",0
I took her and personally feel that her lectures and lab are not correlated at all and are not organized. I come out of lab feeling like I didn't grasp any information. Her lectures are easy and brief and exams are in-depth and difficult. Had an A in BIO 141 and now i have a C in her class. and she lectures during lab?!,0
Amazing professor.,1
"I had Professor Ravetch back in the late '90s and absolutely loved his class. His lectures are engaging, entertaining and interactive. I have never worked as a professional accountant, but I have found myself recalling skills and concepts I learned in his class on multiple occasions over the last decade. Glad to see he's still around.",1
"Dr. Venus is  of my favorite professors at Gordon. Super nice guy, very understanding and agreeable. He has a good sense of humor which kind of keeps you alert during his lectures, you never know what he will say next. His 1101 class was easy. As long as you put in the effort, you'll do well. Also, his final is only 5%, which I though was nice.",1
"If you want to pass, you will need to teach yourself. He is extremely smart, but too smart to be teaching lower level. He said our class was a disappointment. also, his study problems were easy and seemed to trick us on the test (Extremely hardunclear)",0
"Beard is a great intellect and a funny guy, but is shockingly disorganized. He comes 10 minutes late to every lecture. Expects you to learn everything from the textbook. He rambles in lectures and is very hard to follow. Does not make his expectations clear for essays. Avoid him if you can. There are much better film profs in the department.",0
easiest A I've ever taken... he is a very nice person in general but don't expect to learn that much because he just teaches you very basic and easy stuff. take him if you just want an easy A.  beware of boring lectures (reads off ppt slides and teaches really slow) but he takes attendance.,1
"He's a solid choice for orgo, and undoubtedly cares for those who are interested in learning. He is readily available to help, but he definitely knows who has been attending his classes (even if attendance isn't mandatory). The curve definitely helps out in the end. He was a great orgo teacher online, during the transition to Zoom.",1
You have to be dedicated and never tardy,1
This guy is great.  This is by far one of the most interesting classes I have had.  He loves plants and makes the class interesting. The exams are easy.  You need to goto class because there is no book.  It's an easy B.,1
"Dr. Reyna is retiring this year! Im so glad I was able to have him for two classes! Hes so talented and one of the kindest professors I had! Im graduating this Spring and because of him, CSUB was a great experience!",1
"Always asks for questions and offers help. Very patient! He is younger, so that may be why is more encouraging and excited about math. Very good! Only downfall to this class is that he only grades tests (5 incl final) and assigns homework but it's optional and don't get credit for doing it. Gave reviews  b4 tests but definitely need to study!",1
"Jorge is a great professor and really loves what he teaches about. Expects a lot from students, but if you do your work he grades fairly.",1
"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",0
Dr. Comfot is from the Chemical Engineering department. So his entire class is geared toward Chem E's. If you are another kind of Engineer you will not to well in his class at all. I highly recommend a different teacher if you are not a Chem E.,0
"Very hard to understand, and he does not explain his thought process well. Test are tough and there are only 3 excluding the final. Which are your only grades. So go to class and do the homework and study guides!",0
"Being a philosophy major, Professor Wilburn is one of the best philosophy professors I have had. His workload is completely manageable and he goes in length to explain and clarify the content. Only 2 papers and 2 exams and 1 pg weekly responses. Hes also very knowledgeable on the content matter. Would definitely recommend this class.",1
"It was an interesting class that covered interesting topics. Gildenhuys is a little hard to follow at times, but has interesting ideas as well. Definitely must stay up on the readings, and although most people didn't attend the second class of the week, you definitely should.",0
"DROP THE CLASS AND RUN. choose another professor if you must. even the highest achieving students will not pass, due to her strict grading on tests. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND STUDY!!",0
Take any other stats professor.,0
Just read off the PowerPoint doesnt make his own PowerPoint uses the book so get ready to not need over half of it but he wont make his own so you really have no idea what youre studying at home. Just lectures youre not interacting with a 3 1/2 hours at all. For someone who has a learning disability get ready to be very challenged. NSCC,0
David puts in a lot of work/thought in this class. He seems nice but what frustrates me is that you can study for hours on end for his exams/quizzes just to end up failing. I was told that this class would be fun and informative; Lots of people loved FSCN! It's food and science? Seems like fun but trust me. Spare yourself the headache and avoid.,0
not all that clear about what she wants on written assignments. the other stuff is mostly online quizzes and tests so they're  ok. You can take quizzes more than once. not the biggest textbook a teacher's made me read. If you're not organized just take this in person. might be easier too.,0
Get real practice in negotiating. Lots of stories on how to avoid getting taken in the real world.  Pretty easy tests if you come to class.,1
"Even though he bashes lecture heavy classes his classes are lecture heavy. The lectures were really boring and no one ever really talked in class because Professor Dotts appears very judgemental of viewpoints outside his own. Class is graded on a few things, but they were easy. If looking for an easy, boring A then take this class.",0
Awesome teacher very laid back and was an easy class. I will admit I thought this class was not gonna be very fun but it was  and he made it very relaxed. Attendance is mandatory after so many absences it will start to affect your grade. Text book was used in class.  I highly recommend him.,1
"This is my last semester with Professor Bertens and I hope I can find someone as clear and helpful as him. Two homeworks a week and a quiz every other week. His instructional videos is very helpful, he will teach you helpful ways that would make sense.",1
"Heavy grader, not specific to the point of what should be done.",0
Dr. Alcoutlabi rushes lectures in order to give a quiz at the end of class. You will have a quiz every class even if there wasn't homework due. He will stop working on a problem just so that he can give a quiz. He cares more about giving a quiz than teaching. Not very good.,0
Prof. Jagpal is very brilliant. This class gives you very good understanding of Marketing. Use his book and you will get most out of the teaching. Not an easy class and you need to work with him. Don’t be intimidated to talk. He encourages healthy discussions. He is one of the best professors Rutgers has.,1
Professor Fox is a sweet lady but clearly does not know how to teach/captivate an audience. She's very soft spoken and unclear with her directions/assignments. I literally didn't understand anything she wanted me to do! Her thoughts are so unorganized and hard to follow. She doesn't use any online school websites like Sakai or Canvas.,0
"His English is very difficult to understand Lab and Lecture are totally not relevant Youtube video, link on lectures are useless Regret going to KPU because of his class",0
"This class was for academic probation. She teaches one class a semester, and is absolutely phenominal. I've developed a relationship with her outside of class as well as in, and she doesn't yell at you. She grades everything easy. Out of 500 points, I have 499 for the semester. Take her over anyone.",1
"Dr. I is one of the best math teachers I've ever had. She's very sweet and you can tell she definitely cares about her students. I had her during COVID19 and she made what is normally a very difficult class very manageable. The first exam of the semester was very hard, but the rest were super easy so long as you take the time to study and do the HW",1
"I had Mrs. McCormick for pharm and she was very unclear. She's a sweet person with a sense of humor, but this is not her subject. You definitely have to study the powerpoints and use the book for reference - she does take questions from the book that she didn't stress in class. Even if pharm isn't your subject, if you study well you can get a B.",0
I took Eng 1b online and I had a good experience. You definitely need to put in the work to earn your grade but if youre willing to do so and attend office hours for extra help I would recommend the class. Lots of essays and readings but final project was fun.,1
Quite possibly the worst professor I've taken at Rutgers. Took him last year for  Research Methods and thought that it was just the class that I didn't like. He ended up teaching this class last minute and has never posted a syllabus or graded assignments from two months ago. Makes jokes at the expense of any student with a different opinion.,0
"Dr. Whitt is a great instructor! I really didn't need him much during this semester because I am so good at math, but when I did needed help, he was there! He makes things seem easier and better to understand. I took him for Probability & Statistics Enhanced! I finished the course a month early. Take him! Passed with a B.",1
The course was very organized. I really enjoyed this class and reading the chapters! The only thing that would give me anxiety was the quizzes because you have a small limited time to complete them. But overall great class!,1
"Any man who uses clips from ""This is Spinal Tap"" to illustrate a point has my utmost respect.  Class was fairly fun, tests were pretty easy.  He is fairly helpful, and is generally accessible during office hours.  He gives you everything you need to get an A.",1
Will read ninety percent of poets and one or two outside novels for any given period and tested on all of it.,0
"Professor Danko seems to be a good person, but is not a good professor. She doesn't encourage questions at all. She teaches very fast, this may be due to the class only being 50 mins long. IF you're not good at accounting naturally this will be a very difficult course.",0
Jeff Allen is the grand master of PPS! Take him.,1
"Ms. Wright is um mediocre. Her class isnt hard, if you show up youll pass (and if u dont show up youll probably still pass). Not too much hw. Her tests/finals are straightforward. She relies on the class to do a lot of the talking, so idk what she knows. Class kinda drags on , I took notes to stay awake.",0
"I'm going to be very honest, he is not a very good teacher. He bases your essay from best to worst in the class. The whole class he spends talking about god knows what and worst he does not keep up with the schedule or assignments. I ended the class with a B but still wasn't satisfied with his teaching or how he graded the assignments.",0
Expected this to be an easy 100 course considering I have a basic background in meteorology from high school but man was I wrong. Worked really really hard spending countless of hours just to get an 80% overall.,0
"Took his online class. The material was barely covered and discussed, and the comments he'd leave on worksheets were rude and patronizing. I learned more from searching on Google than I did from his class. Sometimes the way of solving or formatting a problem that he'd explain would get me docked points as being wrong. Avoid this teacher.",0
"I did not like Professor Smith. Her lectures were extremely long with obnoxious background music and lost my attention. She brought her personal political views into HISTORY lectures multiple times, but she does communicate with students well. She knows when students are most likely sharing answers. Stay on top of the work, and you will do great.",0
hate this class! test are hard. studying is a MUST with lots of outside help. doesnt give out OLD powerpoints. Rambles.,0
this had to be one of my worst teachers. she doesnt help and expects you to know everything. she makes a simple subject very difficult. i would never recommend her,0
"Although she is somewhat scatterbrained, she makes the class super easy. She will extend test and assignment dates. She is very laid back, but lectures can get boring sometimes.",1
I thought her class was a little much. You have to do alot of busy work. She is very conservative. She will make that clear.,1
If you like being stressed out and failing classes because of a single pass or fail exam then she's the right prof for you.,0
Adams a great guy. Super straight forwards and gets to the point. Best math professor I've ever had. Just make sure to put effort into the class and you will do fine. Highly recommend him!,1
"Did not enjoy class, talks about theory and derives equations rather than doing an example.  Tests are on applied problems, not theoretical.",0
One of the best professors at CSUN! Very clear and concise! Work hard.,1
"I really enjoyed having Dr. Matt as my professor. He made my 7 week summer course fly by. He is extremely funny, and he really has a passion for what he teaches. He makes A&P very interesting. I did not really get a lot out of his lectures, however, if you put in the time outside of class and actually read the textbook, you will do just fine.",1
Dr. Forbes is amazing!! His lectures are incredible and throughou ans something you can remember for use later. Didnt really use the book mostly lecture notes and APR. You can tell he really cares for his students and wants them to pass. I wish Dr. Forbes taught other subjects so I could take him again.,1
"Terrible prof! I felt like I learned virtually nothing about sociology. He would go on long off topic tangents that had nothing to do with the material. He only liked to talk about what he was interested in. However, class was blowoff and an easy pass as long as you studied in detail topics discussed in class.",0
Turnipseed doesnt care about the students. His class is completely self taught with no guidance or assistance from the professor.,0
"I went an entire semester in Ivo's World Mythology course, and never learned a single thing about mythology. He stands in front of the class and talks about whatever pops into his head. Nice and charismatic guy, but it became hard to make myself show up, as I knew it would be just another day of random tangents.",0
Worst instructor I have ever had. Is not clear with dates of tests.,0
Professor Yemut teaches straight from the text book. He lectures 2 hours straight. Lets u leave 30 min early. His tests are hard. He does offer 10 points extea credit and drops the lowest test grade. I was .2 ponts away from a B �� wich sux.,0
She writes all her lectures and stuff in the board and she gives you hints on what to copy down for the exam. We only have 3 exams I believe,1
Professor Paul Kirz gives it how it is. Awesome class and his work is the best work ever. Gives some homework and will take you far in the music industry. In his class you will learn not the material but also how the industry works and will give you gigs as well!!! make sure to bring him food too! when you do he will give you your fist pro-gig!,1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich reminds me of a teacher running down the clock til he retires. Communication took FOREVER, and when he did resopond, he just reworded the syllabus without clarifying. Test questions were overly detail driven. Only take if you can teach yourself and memorize well.",0
"Nash is super sweet and very passionate. She'll make you work hard for an A, but it is attainable. It is VITAL that you read the textbook. She bases lectures, papers, and tests off its content. Attendance is important to her, so skipping class is not a good choice. Keep pace with the readings she assigns and follow her study guides.",1
She basically expects you to memorize the whole textbook. On her test there are over 60 questions usually. She is nice but don't let it trick you that she won't give you a D for not remembering everything by heart,0
Best professor around! His philosophy 101 class was my favorite class. Cannot not recommend anyone else but him.,1
"She's insanely hard! I had to work extremely hard in her class to pull a C. When she lectures, she talks too fast and in a way that no one understands. I like her as a person she's very nice. Would I ever take a class with her again? Absolutely not.",0
"Blose goes off on unimportant tangents in class, confuses his numbers and formulas in calculations, and does not do a great job communicating something clearly. Many questions had to be asked for clarification on things. His exams are completely based off the study guides and homework isn't difficult which were the redeeming qualities of his class.",0
Excellent teacher.  Only wears sandals and is kooky but hilarious teacher!,1
Dr. Willett is an AMAZING professor! I would recommend her to anyone taking a history course that she is teaching. Shes always happy when she lectures and youll learn something every class. Test are easy if you study her key terms and pre write your essays before he tests. Reading quizzes are easy if you read the books. Definitely would take again,1
Graded on a 1000 pt. scale with 2 major assignments; one worth 300 and the other worth 500. You have two chances at each to improve your grade if you did poorly on the first. He did not get my 500 pt. assn. graded until the qtr was completed. Did not get a chance to reattempt 500 pt assn.,0
Bio311 is the worst class I have ever taken. Rosa runs a live class every week on top of various pre-recorded lectures. There are about 6 assignments due every Sunday on sapling on top of problem sets that might be due on Moodle. I am very disappointed in the way she has handled an online class . Complete overkill of work.,0
"Kristi is very friendly but she sucks at replying to emails, she grades everything months later. Is confusing when explaining the papers she assigns. Exams are ridiculously difficult would not take again.",0
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"Lectures are kind of dry, but she is very understanding and willing to help if you have any issues!",1
"She is energetic about her subject and very helpful & accommodating. Besides this, I did have a few things that bothered me a bit. Going into this class I think it is nice to know before-hand (I didn't), she is not a native Spanish speaker and has a STRONG English accent. I prefer to learn from a native. Also a negative- class is very reading heavy",1
"Soooo, the class wasn't awful, but don't go if you're sleepy... he talks for huge blocks and it can be very difficult to understand what he's saying because his accent is so thick.  We watched really terrible movies and for the final project we had to make our own movies... way too much expected for a liberal arts class.",0
"If you show up to class everyday, you will pass. We had a bunch of readings to do, and we had pop quizzes (kind of hard), but other than that , he grades fairly. If you work hard, then you will do well. The only thing I don't like about him is that he is kind of rude and snarky.",1
"Takes attendence way too seriously for a class that isn't reliant on it, which is why I dropped the course. An interesting man with lots of stories (and magic tricks!) to share, but a tough grader and unclear about what he wants on assignments. Not recommended.",0
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
DONT TAKE LINK. HES HORRIBLE. Very heavy grader and doesn't care about you at all. He should just retire soon. Problem sets are very hard and the tests are harder.,0
"While Professor Giraud is a great and funny person, his course schedules and timetables leave something to be desired of. Through circumstance and perhaps just a lot of bad luck, the set schedule for his class is continually derailed and modified, leaving many students, including myself, confused as to what is coming next.",0
"Great prof. Notes are printed out and you just fill in the blanks. Gives good feedback on each quiz and test. Lectures were a little dry, but still 100% recommend. Notes are presented in an organized manner and you know what is going to be on tests. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS (they directly resemble quiz questions) !!",1
"She is the most unhelpful teacher I have ever had. I went into her office hours and she actually told me to google my question! Lecture is pointless to go to but you have to. All she is does is babble on about herself and her stories and how she did this and that. DON""T TAKE THIS CLAASS!",0
"Dr. Bey is by far the most empathetic and caring professor I have ever met. He is absolutely amazing and he cares so much for his students. If you are ever struggling, he is one of the few professors who will actually understand and work with you. He is a wonderful person and I am grateful that I had the opportunity to take classes with him.",1
"""I try not to lecture, but since this is not in the book I guess I have to"" Wendy Reffeor. More or less a direct quote. I dropped this class because of her, the material wasnt hard but she didnt make it easy. She has videos of some material, but are the worst videos ive ever seen, no exaggeration. She tries to do a flipped class and fails. AVOID!!",0
"Great Profesor, very easy to get along with, has a fun loving sense of humor. Excelent teacher very easy to learn from.",1
"This was probably the hardest class I've ever taken at CMU. The class is rather classic in fashion, you get two quizzes, a mid term, a final, and a term paper. If that suits you, then this class is perfect. If you're more laid back in fashion and are just wanting to learn the material without proving your knowledge, perhaps think twice.",1
"This guy is awesome. took him for intro to counseling. Funny engaging, learned a lot and he is informative. a lot of what i learned will be helpful in my career and daily life. Demonstrations on active listening during the class made me more aware of how much it is important it in with  communications with people.",1
Lentz is completely old school.  He won't allow you to make up a quiz for being two minutes late and then he'll hold you four minutes after class.  His rigidness is often unfair and tyrannical,0
"Graham is a really nice guy and you can tell he actually wants to be there. The class mainly consisted of quizzes, 4 big exams, and the Final. The quizzes, however, were more like in class assignments, because you can work together and even ask him for help. If you miss a quiz day, you receive a 0, but he dropped the 2 lowest quiz scores.",1
"Pretty good class.  Nelson is an amazing professor with a sense of humor.  Too bad I can't pull out a decent grade, but it's worth it.  Not all of the class time is spent on the lit which isn't a bad thing.  Wish there was more discussion, though.",1
Just do all the homework.,1
This lady was pregnant the whole semester and still managed to make the class fun and easy.  No kidding....this chick was still teaching like two days before going into labor!!  What a warrior!!  And was back in class like 3 days later like nothing happened!!  Amazing!!,1
I took her photography class because I loved photography. I get treated like I'm 5. She is not very helpful. She would tell everyone else what I have and haven't done in the class. Verbally attacks me. I will NOT be taking this prof ever again,0
Amazing professor and woman! She was one of the professors at the Rome Campus when I went and cares a lot about her relationships with students and making sure they do the best they can in her class and outside class. Loves to talk :),1
"Everyone told me she was strict.  She was not.  Favorite quote, ""Your windows of opportunities are wide open.  Mine are closed.  I'm going to die soon.""  Likes to talk about life during class.  Be prepared for a lot of reading and translating from stories/ handouts.  Tests were easy.",1
"Winter Sess. Three mini papers and a major paper due at the end of each week and is due the following week. He's heavy on participation, so be ACTIVE during text discussion. Spaulding gives amazing feedback on your papers and will actually steer you in the right direction. He's super kind and caring. Come to class active and prepared!",1
"I have never rated any professor before but because this class was SO bad and because he was the most boring teacher I have ever had, I want to warn anyone who thinks about taking this class or this teacher in general...DON'T DO IT.",0
"She is super helpful! She loves her students and want to see them succeed. Communication runs deep, if you ever need anything reach out to her and she will be willing to help you.",1
"Very boring lectures. No tests but pretty difficult quizzes. She uses tophat for lectures and to ask questions, which she uses to determine attendance.",0
Don't take this class with him. You learn on your own plus his tests are nothing like what he talks about in class. He makes you do useless assignments. Lecture time is totally useless. You never know your grade. Don't get surprised when you see a lot of people dropping. Stay away from him,0
"Do not take this class if you don't like politics. He is very dry when giving the lecture as it is easy to fall asleep or not pay attention. His grading criteria is mostly based on tests which he makes extremely difficult. The exams are short answer, multiple choice and essay. He also hardly gives extra credit and doesn't care about his students",0
"His class was boring, the work was pointless, he didn't grade anything until the last week. He didn't assist when asked for help. Getting an A was easy but not rewarding. Would not recommend for anyone who wants to further their skills.",0
Knows a lot about the class material and is really helpful. Sit in the front and you will hear him fine. Easy A and great professor.,1
easy class but if you do not know the quadratic formula good luck,0
"Dr. Sobhi is a pretty good Chem professor. He seems intimidating at first, but he's not so bad. He is fair with his grading and gives partial credit for trying. Some lectures were dry, but I was able to stay pretty engaged in class. He poses questions and uses examples to get you thinking. I had to retake CHEM 131 and I'm glad I took it with him.",1
"I took him last semester and although Micro was fairly tough for me, he makes it impossible to fail if you actually do the work. The slides are directly from the book and so boring, the tests are tough but he lets us take home and make up each exam for the extra points! He has a very dry sense of humor but I would totally take the class again!",1
"It is impossible to understand her, and her spelling is horrible. She often has to ask the class what a word is and how to spell it. She never stops talking, talks over her students, and always goes off on random tangents. She is a very easy grader, however it is not worth taking one of her classes again because it is impossible to learn anything.",0
"HORRIBLE professor... he will not ""take you to the promise land"" as he says. Extremely nit-picky, and rude, cant understand you and you cant understand hiM! DO NOT TAKE!",0
"This man has seen everything that psychology has to offer. He is the sweetest, and if you're invested in his class, he is very good to his students. He goes on a lot of tangents, but he is amazing to listen to. If you get bored, just count how many times he says ""what"". Would 100% recommend him and only him for psych.",1
"I've taken 2 classes with Brian McKenna-Rice, and I'll be taking another one with him next semester. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and makes himself available to assist them, as needed. Brian is very knowledgeable in his field and has a lot to offer his students. His method of instruction is very laid back and interactive. 2 thumbs up!",1
Professor Massnick is a Professor who will work with you at all times. She is very understanding and no matter what she will attempt to try her best in order to help you receive a good grade. She is not the type of Professor class who you will not want to show up. She keeps things entertaining and includes opinions and feelings on subjects.,1
He is just too hard. He gets off topic a lot and doesnt stay focused. When you go for help he is not really helpful at all.,0
"Does not know anything about the subject. Has to consult his notebook to answer what should be a simple question on java. The structure of the curriculum is not conducive to learning a programming language, on top of the fact that he can't teach leaves you lost in the world of java. I have not learned a single thing from this class.",0
Very nice and easy,1
"Debrot is a great guy. His lectures may seem like they drag on for ages but he is knowledgeable about the field of philosophy and also a very adept philosopher himself. He likes it when you engage with him, and he enjoys most working with the students who are willing to try to think philosophically. Note: some of the concepts can be hard to grasp.",1
She was all over the place!,0
"Hardest class I've ever had. Had to teach myself everything. I usually went to class, but it was usually pointless because I wouldn't understand a thing. Only did clickers 3 times the whole semester. I had to work really hard and study days in advance to do okay on the tests. He curves the final grade which helped a lot. That was the only good part",0
"You can't avoid taking him, but be ready to self-teach. Lectures are confusing and meandering. Go to office hours with questions to do well. No curve so hard to get a good grade. Very old-fashioned type teacher.",0
"Professor is great. The whole class is structured around 4 tests that make up your overall grade. I think this is a very poor way to structure a class, but if you are just looking for a class to fulfill the stupid gen ed requirements then this is probably a good choice.",0
Need I say more read down the page. She is the only one that teaches it at LSC-Montgomery. She cancelled a week of classes before the final emailed us the study guide was online. Get to the final we have a substitute and the review is nothing like the test. This is representative of the disaster the entire class was.,0
"AVOID her unless you absolutely can't. Super strict about attendance and being on time. Does not use canvas at ALL, not even to post grades. No powerpoints for notes, just her talking. Exams were very difficult, they are written/mc. No extra credit or ways to bring your grade up. Only 3 exams and paper. Can't miss more than 1 class. Way too hard.",0
"Back again after finishing the class to its entirety to say.. that was a waste of my time and money. Professor Martin said she would make a ""special exception"" for those who turned an essay on time to grade said essay by the day of the final. Come to find out, she has not even started. This essay was important as it was needed for the reflection",0
"Professor Marshall truly is a sweetheart. She cares about her students and is very accommodating to everyone's schedules. She understands that life happens and situations arise, but as long as you complete the assignments, you will be fine. She usually sends emails with 1 page readings and asks for a response that can be discussed in class/written.",1
"Meh. Her lectures were very ambiguous. She made already difficult concepts very hard to understand. I do think she knows a lot about plants and fungus, but just does a horrible job explaining it to the class.",0
Don't take her trust me you will regret it,0
"Maria is a very outgoing teacher and will definitely make the class worth while. Her assignments are pretty unclear, and require a good amount of time to complete. As long as you show up, take notes, and make study guides for the test, you should be fine. ",1
"The exams in this class are beyond impossible. Even if you read and take notes, the length, detail and layered opened ended exam questions are impossible. She never updates grades and class averages on exams are failing even after the curve. The most pointless and relentless class ever. She speaks down to you and assigns tons of busy work.",0
"I took Professor Chris for the Winter semester. He was fun, enthusiastic, and his lectures were awesome. He gave cool study guides before the exams which were multiple choice and true/false. Prepare yourself to do outlines for your speeches which are timed, which was the toughest part of the class for me. Overall it was an excellent class!!!",1
HIST 424 changed my life!  The genuine passion of Dr. Tone quickly connected our class creating a unique open space and honest space to approach carefully selected fascinating subjects. Dr. Tone is incredibly knowledgeable and conveys extraordinary compassion towards her students.  It was such a privilege to take this class!,1
"He is a terrible professor, he could care less about his students and doesn't explain the material well at all. His lectures tend to be word for word out of the text. Really isnt helpful at all.",0
"The midterm and final are extremely hard, also I took the hybrid course which is almost impossible. I recommend taking the actual lectures. ",0
"If you have the opportunity to take discrete math with another instructor or to a community college, do so. His teaching style is heavy on his slides which relates NOTHING to the homework. His homework DOES NOT reflect what he teaches in class. I ended up learning discrete math from a YouTuber. This was a waste of time and money.",0
One of the best prof's I have had in Asper! Her exams are fair if you have read the material but are very difficult if you don't keep up! Explains everything and very approachable! Answers any question you may have and very accessible during office hours and other times,1
"Professor Bernstein teaches by asking Socratic questions: probing and often complexly phrased. As an introvert who certainly did not have an auditory learning style, it was difficult and stressful. Two 5-pagers, one 10-pager. No notes, no projector. Colloquium theme was ""political philosophy,"" lots of theoretical discussion. Makes you think hard.",1
"Getting a straight answer from the man is impossible. He talks in circles. Grades are erratic, bordering on random.",0
"The class has no structure at all, there is no syllabus he follows. Nearing the end of the semester and we only have two grades so far.",0
Shes the best hands on learner! One of the few professors at UNCC where I actually learned something useful!,1
"His projects were challenging for me, but he always helped me with any questions & was open-minded with his feedback.  Aside from teaching the class he was always very available for questions about the GVSU art program even though he wasn't my advisor.  I noticed the people that had a hard time in his classes were people that hardly ever showed up.",1
"Professor Benton as a person is great, as a teacher that's a different story. She takes a while to respond and her responses are vague. She'll post items with due dates on the calendar, but if you were to check canvas to do them the night before they're due, they'll still be unpublished. If you put the work in and read the book you will be fine.",0
... ... Boring ... ... A+ ... ... That is it ... ...,0
"Course is easy! Professor is absolutely terrible, and for the final makes you hand write out the problems and copy scan to her.",0
Best professor at mercy. Knows the material like the back of his hand. Willing to go above and beyond to help students pass not only his class but other classes as well.,1
"As a professor, she was the hardest grader I have ever had.  I would highly recommend staying away from this course if possible, based on the difficulty of her grading alone.",0
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
"Don is the best prof I have had so far, and the reason I went into finance. Finance 3227 is a tough, tough class, people seem to blame Don for this. Most of the class is going through practice problems which is the best way to learn finance.",1
Oh Steve.. Steve is that dude. He is one of the boys and was a great professor. Tests is based on 4 tests and he gives very good reviews. Also we has quizzes but were told about them in advance. Much love Steve.,1
She is incredibly understanding and truly wants to help you succeed. I can't thank her enough.,1
The course was awesome. Loved the material and the course set up. What was missing was the teacher. No feedback and when we tried to ask questions he would never get back to us. I honestly could not tell you a single thing about the teacher. the course was great but I would choose a more involved teacher to get more out the class. ,1
"Wonderful professor. I learned so much. He uses many historical examples to drive the material home. He loves to post articles on TWEN which clarify and are very helpful (at least scan them prior to class). I can't say enough good things about Professor Haney. If you get a chance, take his classes!",1
Professor Flannery is one of the best professors I've had so far. He gives great examples in class that make it so easy to understand. He's a great guy.,1
"Charles Putnam is an exceptionally well spoken dedicated professor. He has a knack for engaging all of his students despite the large lecture size of JUST401. But distract other students at your peril, it's the quickest way to get him angry. What you put into this class you will receive. But it wasn't too hard either. A+ Professor, would take again",1
"I sat in his class and felt lost the whole time. He is all over the place, he does not follow the quiz/test dates, his review sessions are useless. Tough grader, be prepared to read and self study !!!",0
"Professor Owens is just a great guy. If you are a freshmen and do not not what coll 150 class to take do this one (even if you are not interested in geology at all). It's not too much work and will not stress you out. Sometimes the readings were a little dry, but professor Owens make the classes fun.",1
"If I was told I was allowed to slap one person without consequences, it would be this damn woman. Her class is boring, she doesn't teach, and she doesn't care about her students at all.",0
"Very helpful, math is not my area and he really helped me learn and take something from the class.",1
"Dr. H is a great professor and super easy going! This class is very lecture-heavy and a lot of reading but she makes it pretty interesting. Be aware that if you take Anth 360 you'll have to do 15 hours of applied projects, but these weren't bad.",1
"Thick accent and just moves to hard tricky problems to give for your test. Has a complicated grading system of extra credit and quizzes and tests.  Really beware of pop quizzes, it used to be open book, then it wasn't. Multiple choice tests-very hard and no partial credit for problems (150 pts)",0
worst prof in my life. hardest test which was 54 avg even it was open book test. maybe he's good career man but worst at teaching.,0
Overall she is pretty awesome. The class is easy and not boring because you learn out of the book not a boring PowerPoint and she makes everything interactive with the class so you learn how to speak aloud usually with a partner.,1
"DJB is kind, welcoming to questions, and gives great examples. Beware of cold-calling. She told funny stories about her husband relating to accounting. She really knew her stuff. She recognized me outside of class despite me only going online and said hi. Tests are hard but doable. Do not underestimate them - they are much harder than homeworks.",1
"Horrible professor.  Lectures are pointless, the due dates for assignments always change, and nothing is graded in a timely manner.  Overall, class is simple as long as you just do the tedious stuff.  Stay on his good said and it's an easy A.",0
"Teacher is knowledgeable on the topic of microeconomics, but her ""english second language"" accent can be distracting. Class was hard for me, but then again my interest in the subject is zero. All quizes are online, but final is in class. Two group projects to present to class throughout semester. Overall, meh.",0
"Very dedicated professor. Professor Shen gives very positive and constructive feedback to my research. The communication was a joy, too. I believe every student who has done research with professor Shen would appreciate his expertise on the topic and such positive feedback. Highly recommend!",1
Learned a ton from this professor! Did a lot of writing for him but I got a lot out of his class in exchange. He's very helpful during the writing process and alway's available for students. I started graduate school lacking some confidence but after taking his class I feel set up for success in the rest of my classes. Thank you!,1
this class is very frustrating. She gets corrected almost everyday in class. Her teaching method is to just read from the projector and not explain anything. She clearly lacks confidence in this subject. Her tests and even quizes are riduculously hard compared to how she teaches.,0
"Terrible prof. Can't understand her English. Had to do difficult calculations, but no one in the class had a clue how to do them. No textbook use, just her lectures. Like a lot of other people,I dropped. Don't take her, and especially not for this class.",0
she's not a great professor but the class is fun and you learn more than you realize you're learning at the time,1
professor Gulli is very understanding and makes very helpful videos for our classes. And gives comments that are helpful.,1
"This class is not easy A class anymore, because recently she changed her lecture. Such as finish minimum 2800 words 12 pages report paper in a week and 20 pages reporting paper for final. unless you love to write reporting paper, I am not recommended this class.",0
"Almost 100% sure you will regret taking her. She is the worst teacher I haver had in all of my schooling. She doesn't respond to any of her emails or texts. She also grades with her eyes closed, she is very inconsistent and does not provide explanations. She will give you 100% on the first half of the test, and 0 points for the rest. Horrible.",0
"Attendance isn't mandatory, but if you attend class everyday, he will be kinder to you when grading exams. Great professor and plan to take him for higher level courses! He doesn't give practice exams or old exams to study with, so I would try to get old exams from someone who previously took calculus 3 from him.",1
"Lectures are not mandatory, only discussions are. She gives power points during lecture, but they are very bare outlines and you have to actually listen to take better notes. The textbook readings were sometimes more helpful than going to the lectures. Put forth a decent effort on papers because there are only a couple graded assignments.",0
"She is great, very relaxed easy to talk to you. Class is easy overall, she goes over the readings in class. In class quiz is easy as is the take home final. I would take her again.",1
"I dont have him for computer science but i do have him for Operating Systems 1, and that is the easiest class i've ever taken in my life, so yea good teacher though and quite helpful.",1
"Very hard course with him, a lot of the class is failing. Tests are hard (avg grade = 35!. C = 50). OK at teaching (2 out of 5).",0
"If you are new to networking, or old to networking, take this guy, he makes learning a fun. Best instructor ever!",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! I personally disliked her teaching style and learned nothing from her. We had two research papers for her class and we still had 4 exams and a 15 hour community service for our project. Also, she does not use power points or blackboard so be ready to take as many notes and read.",0
I dont know why everyone makes a big deal about Professor Drake being too hard. Its probably because he is one of the few professors who is actually legit here at the university of Montana.I get A's on all his tests. The key is going to class and making distinctions behind main actors in the readings. Not a class for deadbeats who only want easyA's,1
"I took EN 102 with her and it started off pretty good. When getting into assignments, we were assigned multiple short assignments that personally were pointless and didnt help me. She made us do the maximum course requirements with essay lengths and made us print every source no matter how many you had. She needed to focus on assignment at a time",0
Great Teacher who really knows his stuff. He has very impressive work and is enthusiastic to share his knowledge with students in the class. This is not a blow-off class the work is hard and time consuming. Great class if you want to really learn about Graphic Design!,1
"I hope you like listening to hours of boring lectures because that is what you will get when you take this class online. I thought I liked abstract concepts before I took this class, now I am just traumatized. Good information, but without youtube, I would not have passed this class. Test are hard too. He knows his stuff, however.",1
"this class is so boring it is making me come on here and write a review. seriously, I am writing this as he lectures. the tests suck. I worked so hard to do the study guide for over a week and only managed to pull out an 80 on the test. he talks a mile a minute so it is impossible to write down what he says and his slides have absolutely no info.",0
"He was visiting Canterbury Uni for a semester. He taught us nothing, relied on the textbook and Youtube tutorials, and simply provided TopHat quizzes in class to check if we had read the book. The questions were specific to the book, rather than the topic area. He calls this 'peer instruction' but doesn't augment it with actual lectures.",0
"He clearly couldn't care less whether you are successful in his class or not. How this man has ever gotten a decent review, i do not know. His review outlines for tests are ridiculously broad, he basically just asks you to memorize ""anything of importance"" in the textbook. If you have a question he will either respond rudely or in an unhelpful way.",0
"Professor Castelao-Lawless was a very nice lady and certainly tried to make class bearable, but wasn't a very good teacher. She's hard to follow in her lectures. Her handwriting is also atrocious and thats how all notes are taken. Only two tests and the final go into the grade book, so if you're not a good test taker then don't take her course.",0
Thanks for the climate change fear mongering propaganda. If I didn't need this for my degree I would have walked out.,0
"If you want an instructor that will communicate with you, don't take her classes. I e-mailed her a few times and never heard back from her. In the online class there are group discussions once a week. Even when you meet her criteria for acceptable participation, she still deducts points. Tried to ask what I did wrong. No response.",0
"Professor TeBeest is the best math professor at Kettering. Go to class and you will learn from his lectures. The lectures may seem repetitive at times, but it forces you to learn the material and the examples he goes through are great. Test are straightforward as long as you know the material, there won't be any tricks or super difficult problems.",1
"Great professor.  Always well prepared for lectures, and tried his best to make them relevant and interesting.  If you were already familiar with the concepts in the course, the lectures tended to drag.",1
"Although Lamont King seems passionate in what he teaches, he speaks very slowly to the point that the class is quite boring. he is not clear on instructions so its best to ask him any questions... there is also no rubric for any papers you do or quizzes, etc.",0
Impossible grader. Only grades on tests which are essays. No other opportunity to improve your grade besides essays. Don't take her.,0
He is an amazing teacher who makes it obvious he wants to see his students succeed.,1
"If you don't attend class, you will not pass. This professor gives 6 point notecards each and they are not easy questions- you definitely have to pay attention in class or you will not receive a good grade on the notecard and that's the most important part aside from 2 group projects that are also horrible and is 13+ people in each group.. Bad idea",1
Worked our tails off!,1
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
"I think that Prof. Tripp is one of the best professors. He is so knowledgable about all of the content we go over, and if you ever need help he's always there for you. He gives great lectures and talks about all the readings in class. It is a little bit difficult because it deeps so in depth about some historical times but he makes the class so fun",1
"Not the worst option, but definitely not a good option. Tests are hard and he uses the ACS final instead of writing his own. If youre stuck with him, know the reactions well and use the old exams to study.",0
Trust me you do not want to take this teacher. He is very hard in his grading i even asked for help and belive me he is not that helpful ****him.,0
"David is a ""gotcha"" kind of teacher. He often times places items on his tests that he has not gone over in class. He is demeaning and rude when students ask questions during class. Unfortunately, he is the only option for many students who have no choice but to take evening classes. Made easy material difficult. Worst math teacher I have had.",0
"Only class Ive gotten a C in so far, and Im a junior. She misplaces students things constantly and majority of class time was spent just passing time staring at us.",0
I didnt feel like I learned from attending his lectures. If youre taking his class I would recommend you study for yourself. Memorize the theory and know how to apply it to the extra texts they give you. Ps: He also took attendance but only for some classes.,0
"TAKE HIM! One of Howard's best. He is hilarious and extremely knowledgable about the topics we cover. It is an easy A, but still take the time to get to know him because he's awesome and a joy to talk to. I will definitely be taking him again.",1
"He's tough and not all warm and fuzzy, but I don't think that makes him a bad prof.  It's just his personality, and he wants us to do well...he's just not willing to nurse us through every bad grade.  If you try to get to know him, though, he's nice.",1
Mrs. Padgett is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is EXTREMELY scatterbrained therefore can never stay on topic. She claims to go by the syllabus but never does. She also picks favorites which get graded differently than the rest. Her grading varies by student or what mood she is in.  She is very unprofessional and inappropriate.,0
"great instructor, really helps everyone out and is lineant with the work he assigns.",1
"Super easy class, no homework because everything is in-class. All test questions are taken from the in-class problem sets, and you can get everything right if you check your answers with the TA before submitting it. Grissom uses lots of cat videos as a visual aid and everything is very easy to follow along to.",1
"Very easy class, he can be boring but you really don't listen to him talk ur mostly watching movies this class was boring but a good grade for me!",1
"Dr. J was an awesome teacher in my first semester. Funny, engaging, and knowledgeable. He always made sure to be clear and always asked if he needed to clarify. Always helpful when you needed extra help and never felt like I was bothering him. Will likely take him again.",1
He's a great teacher and tells you exactly whats going to be on the test. Lectures are tied in with the book and his real life experiences and encourages the class to discuss about the lecture. You must attend his classes to pass his test because he will pretty much tell you exactly whats going to be on the exam.,1
"If you take this class make sure and do well on the first test because that will be your grade for the semester. Prof. Blake is a nice man, boring, and doesn't grade well, but nontheless nice.",0
Dr. Sá over communicates and is very clear about his expectations so as long as you follow along itll be easy. Its definitely homework and lecture intensive but he makes it very interesting and understandable to learn. I definitely recommend taking a class with him if you can!,1
"Example A of final exam.. he gave us 1 hour and 15 minutes for 116 questions, all other exams were an hour with 70 questions, breaks down to about 15 minutes to answer the last 46 questions. If that doesnt sound ridiculous to anyone, then youre flat lying. Had no time to comprehend and even read a question basically felt like he wanted us to fail",0
No bb so I never knew my grade. Only a few opportunities for points but he had no grading criteria so the assignments were unclear. A nice guy but is not good at teaching as he is super unorganized and cannot explain ideas clearly for the life of him. He would ask a question and no one would understand what he had asked until he said it 3 times.,0
Go to class and pay attention. Other than that the course does not include much studying. The assignments can be tedious but she is very helpful and will give away some of the answers in class. You can work it groups if you would like.  If you go to class and pay attention the assignments and exams will not be too difficult. You can get an A . ,1
"Take this class for your Cultural Heritage 1. Steve keeps discussion interesting and relevant. He is open to alternative viewpoints and everyone is made to feel like they have something to contribute. We don't just talk about the Greek and Romans, we talk about how it relates to today. Class is lots of fun> he's a fair grader and really nice guy.",1
"I took a class with him and Dr. Kauffman, and the two of them together are awesome. Dr. Shichtman seems to really care about his students and he's super funny. His lectures aren't always straightforward in structure, but they're really interesting and always funny.",1
"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",0
I disagree with some other comments about Frau Thibault. I learned a lot more from her than my german teacher. She explains grammar concepts very well and gives many examples so you really understand. She is kind and funny. She even makes food for the students who do well on presentations. She seems to really care about her students.,1
"She seems like a nice person during lecture, but I emailed her for help on something and she was so rude to me... I would think that someone who has dedicated her life to teaching would be a little nicer about doing her job.",0
Easy and amazing Professor. He reviews stuffs at the beginning of the class so you won't get lost. Very nice when you go to his office hour (though I just did once). He will explain some difficult stuffs that he didn't mention in class if you are willing to learn. Homework questions are not mandatory but they will help you understand materials.,1
"This is the second class Ive taken with Prof. K and I wish I could take a third. Shes one of the best teachers Ive ever had. She wants you to learn, and tries to facilitate that in SO many ways! As long as you participate and communicate, her classes are awesome.",1
"He's a nice guy and does his best to explain everything, but for someone who isnt good at math like me, it's a hard class.  He gives alot of homework.  His tests aren't extremely hard, but alot of the class couldn't finish them on time.  But if you are good at math you should do well.",1
"If you like misogyny, you'll love Lentz. He soured me on the English department as a whole and on English as a subject. He should have retired years ago and been a Civil War historian instead.",0
"People ragged on her so much, I was nervous to take her class. She cares about not only your learning the material, but you as a person as well. You will learn a lot in this class, and unlike other classes I've had, you apply this material to your daily life so you don't forget anything. Keep an organized notebook and tests are no problem.",1
"Professor Jones is the best you learn she does not sugar coat and she does move fast. Do your homework, be an active note taker and read over the lecture notes prior to the lecture.",1
"Like the others said, he's loud and opinionated.  He doesn't give students a chance to speak their opinions and if he does, he counterattacks.  His class overall is simple with 2 essay questions and 50 multiple choice.  If you don't mind rude teachers that are offensive then take him.",0
"he's a very nice teacher and will help u if u need it. the hw is very easy, just write a paper w/ the ques. he ask u 2 answer and u will get a good grade. the tests r a lil harder i thought i would have done better. the films r all very good. but studying is the key! u'll never get out early. breaks are only about 5-10 mins long",1
Genuinely caring professor- the best :),1
Sometimes nice but I HATE he uses psychological terms and clearly doesn't know the meaning and ends up not making sense. He also seems bath challenged.,0
"This professor is knowledgable and very smart but lacks teaching skills. Provided study guides for exam 1 and 2 and average class grades was in the 80s. For the final, he skipped chapters, did not offer a study guide, and the class average was 60%. Content from the chapters we skipped was in the final! 3 out of 13 lectures were useful.",0
"Professor Trower is a very kind professor who really cares about his student's success. He can be a little difficult to understand sometimes, but he tries to make things clear. He is not tech savy, don't expect tech help from him, its not his job anyway!",1
He talks about working in tech the way it was 20 years ago. This guy has been away from the industry (has he ever been in the industry?) for far too long to be teaching this class.,0
I did not learn anything in this class. If theology is your major run. This class was hard for only being a core credit. He is a tough grader with no rewrites. He gives a paper and a final so prepare.,0
"She is a really nice person but as a professor she is not that great. If you have to take her make sure you study ahead. She is very disorganized and her test are really hard especially the multiple choice part, the essay part is pretty easy but multiple choices are worth more so make sure you study and read the questions and choices slowly.",0
"Class is very interesting. Do not be intimidated because it is a writing intensive course. She is a very sweet lady that is always willing to help you with papers. She gives 4 papers: one 2-3 pg, one 3-5 pg, one 5-8 pg, and one 8+. She gave 3 EASYYYY exams, almost impossible to fail. Book is not required for this course do not waste your money.",1
Ervin's a good guy but he is challenging. You will have to work and re-work his problems before the test and he likes to throw curveballs in there. Homework is worth 28% of the final grade though and is pretty easy. Managed to get a C in the class without killing myself,1
"The class itself sometimes was very boring but i enjoyed Dr. Reyna's stories and knowledge of Mexican American history. As for the homework, short essays and punctuation most of the time.",1
This woman is not nice and actually quite rude. Lacks respect for every student and has no patience or empathy it seems. Told us that wifi not working wasn't an excuse even though we are completely online due to a national pandemic which in its own is absolutely absurd. The only reason I would recommend this class is because there are no exams.,0
"A semester's worth of reading and assignments condensed into 4 weeks is no joke. You are expected to read every single day, complete discussion posts, quizzes, and her essay-format exams. She wasn't necessarily difficult but not easy either. The effort you put into your work is the grade you receive. Textbook is required!",1
Scanlon is rude. No way around it. I was afraid to ever ask questions and he made me uber nervous in lab. Avoid taking him at all costs. ,0
"I am NOT a history person, but this class was engaging and easy to understand. It is difficult because hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years are covered in 50 minutes but it's not impossible to keep up. The readings are VERY important, but the exams are fairly easy and predictable. Overall good teacher and valuable class.",1
"If you're someone who wants a thorough education at Santa Fe, I would NOT recommend Bruna. Although lighthearted and funny, Bruna doesn't get into the nitty gritty of Macroeconomics. The powerpoints came directly from the text book publisher, so during his class it's somewhat pointless to take notes. Vague explanations and easy tests. Easy A.",0
"Strict, diplomatic, follows the rules and very ethical!!!",1
We had 12 Quizzes and 7 Mid-Terms in the class. His lectures are him doing 1/2 of a problem and then your homework is to finish the problem and then another 10-11 problems. No way to study for quizzes. If you like teaching yourself on a subject that can't be found on youtube? This class is for you!,0
"As a former student of Gerritsen, makes me happy to know anytime I go on this site he is the top-rated professor at Cortland because he is. If you have the chance, get him for class. He makes every class interesting and shows the care every teacher should show for a student to succeed.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
Amazing!!! Take her if you can! My favorite professor and favorite class  this semester.,1
"What other students are saying is correct, he is very vague in what he wants from you and he acts like a student in the fact that he was late in giving us our exam to take",0
"Always willing to meet before or after class hours. Extremely helpful, kind and caring!",1
"Previous reviews aren't fair! She is passionate about the material, treat her with respect (as you should with your professors), she'll respect you back. Be a mature adult and pay attention in class and you'll be fine. Midterm coming up and she's organizing a class study guide where she will make sure we include everything. Also funny and caring!",1
"one of the worst classes I've taken. For an online class, it is all busy work. They're a multiple videos to watch that take up 1-2 hours a week. The quizzes are so specific to the videos and the questions on the quizzes/exams are all very challenging.",0
She doesn't answer emails. She gave me a 0 on an assignment that I completed. Only gives two tests a midterm and final which are take home. Never get any quizzes.,0
The material is pretty boring but if you read the textbook and do the practice exams you should have no problem getting A's on the exams.,1
"Great lectures and labs are enjoyable. The individual programming assignments are huge in comparison to the labs, but you have two weeks to do them. Not a very helpful professor when you ask him a question, and he's not very understanding or lenient. ",0
"The class itself was very easy, I ran into some issues with the SAM site and when I asked for feedback it never came.  Overall the class was good but I had absolutely no interaction with the professor on her end. ",0
Class is lecture heavy and boring but notes are only presented in class (not put online) so attendance is mandatory and counts towards your grade because he calls on groups to answer activity sheets done in class. Exams are the same as the review and are 60-80 MC questions. In-class notes and activities are irrelevant to the exams.,1
"The actual worst to be honest. The class is unnecessarily hard. Her tests are ambiguous and no matter how much extra credit you do, you will more than likely do poorly because the is the worst grader. They don't match the material at all. POSC200 is a gen ed and counts toward certain majors/minors. If you don't have to take her, don't.",0
"Goes over material too fast, doesn't ever give out handouts to learn from. All he does is just talk and do quick problems on the board..",0
"I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT THIS IS THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN! Took this online as I am balancing a 19 hour course load, two jobs etc and it was SO inflexible. HW due on T/TH, quizzes due Sat., etc. Lectures are awful to listen to & so unhelpful. Super expensive access code required. I would drop if I could, avoid at all costs!!!!",0
Really helps you with one-on-one critiques to get your art to a point that will get it looking great and get you a good grade on it as well. He is a super friendly and approachable guy,1
"This professor is HORRIBLE. If you get him, drop the class! You will thank yourself. This class is ridiculous, and the tests are so hard and have material that has never been covered before. And he blames the students when most of the class fails rather than himself. He confuses himself and students when doing problems. Avoid him like the plague.",0
"Fantastic professor. His lectures are very interesting, and he explains economic concepts in a easy to understand manner. Homework and exams can be challenging, but he is very accessible outside class, and is always willing to help students. My only gripe is the terrible third party website he uses for HW/txtbook. Apart from that great class!",1
"Absolutely awful. She grades Aplia by average so you get lower grades than what you deserve. She also won't even bother clarifying questions through emails (because it's ""too difficult to explain"" through email) and keeps pushing phone meetings when I clearly stated I don't have the time. Would not recommend!!",0
"Very nice, caring and funny. Shes easy going, chill, and very open minded to any questions you have. Youll definitely understand the homework easily if you just pay attention in class. Its College after all. She does give out a lot of homework but the good thing is, she gives you enough time to work on it before its due. Would take her again!",1
rude to students calls us stupid and lazy by saying all we do is play on our phones. tests are unbearably tough and half the things on the test he never talks about in class. Whenever u ask questions he rolls his eyes won answer them because apparently he told you about it before. I could go on and on about him! If you see him as your teacher RUN!!,0
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
Best professor ever! I wish she had a part two to some of her classes. I looked forward to this class every day and never wanted to leave it.,1
"Dr Larson is an amazing professor. She makes the entire course interesting, you wont want to miss a piece. I took her for two classes back to back and enjoyed every minute of it and learned so much. She is very nice and you can easily talk to her. I would definitely recommend her to everyone.",1
Show up and take notes and you are good. You have to take notes by hand but it's not bad. He keeps things interesting and fun. I'm not a history person but he made this class very enjoyable.,1
"For those who enjoy learning, he has a lot to offer. If you don't like to think and question yourself you will not appreciate him or his lectures. He has much insight and it has made me grow as a person. A+",1
"The Professor is helpful, but prepare have the worst grading system used on all your problem sets and test. Recommend if you take her class, make sure all your work is 100% correct or she will take points off for every little thing you do wrong",1
Worthless class.  It should not be mandatory.  Don't take him.,0
he is the nicest sweetest man ever in RCOE. The class is super fun and informative. I can't picture anyone else to teach this class. if you are conservative you might not like the class but people should get out of their comfort zones. would take his class a billion times.,1
This class had potential. however the professor teaching it isn't a teacher. She isn't a director or even a decent human being. If you take a class with her you'll regret it..,0
"The class itself is hard mainly because of the material, it is all memorizing but  doable and more than possible to make an A in the class. You will learn. Sieber is very caring and understanding when it comes to helping her students. Just focus and ask questions. Oh and she gives extra credit on her exams which is a plus.",1
"His classes were pretty dull, and he doesn't always touch everything that's on the test. If you don't have a book for this class, you would defiantly fail. Also, he likes to blame a lot of the bad grades he gets on his students. It's like he can't ever find fault in himself.",0
"terrible... If you're looking to take Bi122 class, don't take his - wait another semester for another professor! So unhelpful and does not want to help you at all. Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!!!!!",0
Dr. Skerpan-Wheeler made it extremely difficult to succeed in her class. Her directions for essays are SUPER unclear and she isn't eager to help or answer questions. She puts nothing on Canvas and even waits until the day of to post an essay assignment. All of the assignments are given during class so if you miss you have no idea whats happening.,0
"Be prepared to work very diligently and with all the effort you can physically and mentally exert on the assignments. Research Methods is a difficult course. Dr. Hedlund is a very courteous, intelligent and respectful professor.",1
"really easy class. professor is clear and helpful, really tries to let everyone learn the material. very nice guy too. tas are helpful as well. def take it if never taken a cs class before",1
Very frustrating class to take.  Be prepared to learn everything on your own.  Gives practice questions in class and then never goes over answers!  Avoid this prof at all costs!,0
the most unorganized professor. she gets ahead of herself too often and you have to do a peer review which means to grade other peoples homework.. pointless. she also made us have a third exam and a final in the same week (which was a 124 questions.) some of the answers on the exams didn't even have the right answers sometimes. avoid her class.,0
As easy as it gets. S=how mild interest and he'll be thrilled. Never ontime. You won't learn much.,1
Lots of stories from his past experience. Let's the class out early a lot.,1
"An example of why teachers should go to teacher-school before trying to teach. The department should place more oversight over how she organizes/writes lectures and how she grades. We compare homework and scores so we know grading is not consistent. Some people always score better, for no reason. She ruined what was supposed to be the best class",0
"The best part of this class is when it's over. This class is almost too fun. He uses puppets, imaginary competitive juggling, log throwing, and mustache growing to show how invisible neutrinos are the real cause of his headaches. He also once arm wrestled a bear to raise funds for cancer. He is truly too good to be a chem 101 teacher.",0
"I dreaded this class every day! The class was so unorganized and not very interesting at all. The tests were common sense and never opened the book. As long as you go to class you will do fine on the tests. Marty is very credible and has a lot of accolades, but the other professor I had, You Li, was nice but not a good teacher.",0
I took his class in 2006 (Not a typo). I can't believe he is still teaching. Awful professor. Needs to stop teaching and focus on his research aka website instead like he has been which seems like forever now. Thermodynamics is already hard as it is for many students.,0
"This is by far the worst prof I've ever had. She wasn't helpful, didn't understand why anyone had questions, and refused to answer them, sometimes by cutting you off and saying ""We move on now!"" She uses different equations/symbols then the book, so pick one and use them. Show up for class. She will change quiz dates.",0
"It's an online class, why are tests only available for one day which is a sunday? He wouldn't let me make up a online test. Horrible!",0
This is the most difficult class I have ever taken. I spent well over twelve hours a week studying for this class to only get fifty per cent on homework. His instructions were incredibly confusing and I felt like I had to teach myself most of thee material. Didnt seem to care that I had difficulty accessing software due to Covid.,1
"mollie gave us a very clear description as to what to expect when we decide to become ag teachers. I feel like she does a very good job at giving us the reality of being an ag teacher. class met once a week for about three hours, we never actually used up the three hours until near the end of the semester. makes it very clear that shes a mom first",1
"Dickens is a true intellectual. His classes are interesting, lectures clear and simple, stories funny and entertaining.  He is always available and eager to talk to students.  He is a real asset to UNLV and to sociology",1
"I never missed a class because I loved them so much. If you do miss a class, you miss a lot of info though. He is wonderful at carefully going over the readings. He grades unpredictably at times, but he allows rewrites. He's very smart and totally nuts. If you don't mind a little disorganization, you will have some laughs and learn a lot.",1
"Textbook is mandatory, lots of homework, and tests aren't difficult. He will give u a worksheet in the beginning of class and u could work on it alone or with a partner and then he'll go over SOME questions. If u have  a hard time understanding the way he teaches, he'll tell you to ask for a tutor instead of helping you get a better understanding.",0
"Never responds to posts or questions. Had assignments in the syllabus that I spent 4+ hours a week on and she never even opened them, later found out that she has it in there but does not grade them, of course found this out after week 5 or 6 of 8. Lazy as all get out, takes her sweet time getting grades back to you. Easy grading though.",0
Hard Class like reallllly hard. Mrs. Sharon is a respectable teacher. yes you have to work for it but she will help you along the way. ,1
"Dr. Harris provides notes and lectures that are unclear and seem to only lean to his understanding. He uses pre-written notes which are very hard to understand and he does not thoroughly explain topics and suggests that most of this class is ""basic algebra"". He is also very rude and has yelled at students, 1st math class I've ever failed.",0
Excellent experience.,1
Terrific prof. Highly recommended!,1
"Professor Fetter is one of the worst professors I have had at Butler. He is a great person and a very enthusiastic teacher but does not efficiently provide students with the material and teaching skills necessary to do well in class. He records notes and puts them online, which are just as confusing. Do not take him or Marketing Analytics (MK 384).",0
"Professor Olsson is very sweet and cares about students however, shes very bad at responding to emails. She doesnt give much homework but her assignments are difficult, she doesnt respond to questions about the assignment and grades very hard. Her lectures are more or less reading from slides and when she goes off its very complex w/ no explanation",0
"His lectures are straight forward, have good structure, and are easy to understand. He gives good examples and uses online resources a lot. His study guides are practically the exams - so if you are doing bad, you just didn't study. Don't need the book. Also, he is tall and hot. But he's REALLY flirty with attractive females... a little bit creepy!",1
He have the answer of every question,1
"He is fast-paced. Gives you very little time to work on a subject in the text. You have to ask him questions or he won't explain it in detail. He is too focused on doing math the fast way instead of explaining why the answer is what it is and how he got there. He knows his math just doesn't teach it well, many dropped.",0
"This class was way too easy for a college level bio class, so it's an easy A with Reed. Reed is very quirky and caring, and loves science, but it can be hard to stay awake through a 75 minute lecture. He posts all the pp's online, so attendance isn't necessary. Nice guy overall, and easy A.",1
"Get ready to have your Cognitive Load bursting with irrelevant information! The only thing i got out of this class was sleep deprivation, a nightmare (not even kidding), and how to properly praise a student.",0
"Great Professor, she transformed an online class by including lectures. Interesting assignments, you have to work for it but you can get a great mark if you are engaged and do the work. I hope Professor Keefer drops the quiz which had confusing instructions. Otherwise this was a perfect course.",1
This class was more like a honors level course. The class was completely unbearable and it didn't help that the professor was extremely not helpful. She had no idea what she was talking about. She assigns way to much hw. Way too many papers are handed out. And journals for a math class!?,0
"Don't take his online class, ESPECIALLY during this pandemic. Totally unclear with his directions and doesn't provide clear feedback. Tests are difficult and study guides are confusing. Doesn't even teach, he just gives A LOT of readings and papers. To top it off, he's a VERY tough grader. I'm just taking this class because I have to. Horrible.",0
"Professor Maynard is a pretty dry as a professor. She is not very flexible with assignments, projects etc. She knows what shes talking about but cannot easily relate to students. Lots of reading. No textbook since its online.",0
"His voice is literally the most monotone voice I have ever heard in my life, especially with a lecture at 9am it is impossible to not want to fall asleep. The content is interesting at times but overall he isn't too exciting to listen to. Good thing he posts everything online.",0
Worst professor ever. No one should ever take him. Couldn't teach to save his life. He doesn't even know how to use the technology at hand ie basic computer or projector. Only teaches for him to understand and no one else. Avoid like the plague. If you have no choice get outside help asap.,0
"Great Professor!! Compared to the calculus classes at a UCF this class is cake. I love the way he explains problems! He doesn't speed through them, but he obviously can't go too slow because there is a lot of material to cover. Quizzes and test are required, but homework is optional. Obviously with the more practice you have the better you get.",1
"Do a lot of hw just for practice (most important for derivative unit) but most the test material comes from quizes and notes. He helps on quizes and tests if you come up and ask to check final your final answer. Learn how to not makes mistakes. He's awesome but be ready to work hard you can get an A no doubt, also make the math lab your new home.",1
She takes quite a while to grade assignments but is very helpful and quick to respond to emails. There are assignments available for extra credit. She certainly cares about her students passing.,1
Worst class I have taken. Super long and boring lectures that have nothing to do with the book reading. A  pretty hard class for a Gen Ed. I would not recommend this class to anyone.,0
"He'll be super enthusiastic one day, and the next he'll lecture while sitting at the desk barely talking loud enough to hear. He makes you buy his book, then basically reads parts of it as the entire lecture. Couple options for grading: two 33 M/C exams where the questions are asked weirdly, and if get an 85%+, you can do a project. Don't recommend",0
Maybe he is a better teacher in person but I have learned very little from this online course. Some problems are explained through videos but many of the videos are extremely confusing and unhelpful. Plus $80 for mandatory WebAssign membership even though the point of City College is to be free/cheap and accessible to all. Worst online course imo,0
"Dr. Steadman is a little on the hard arse side but as long as you speak up when talking to him and show respect, he'll like you. He seems cold but loves to joke with students!! DO NOT BE LATE. I'm sure he's harder in other courses but he's a great EG101 instructor & a good person to get in good with because he's the dean of the college of eng.",1
"He's a nice guy but not a very good teacher, went to lectures during the beginning of the semester but stopped because they're confusing and often irrelevant to tests. You'll do far better in the class if you use the textbook and the assignments and lab manual questions he posts.",0
He is a nice guy but not a very good teacher. Lectures are boring and doesn't really explain how to do anything. ,0
She was a very inconsiderate teacher that did not have much care for the students. She basically takes 10% off of your total grade if you miss 1 class period. I have upper level courses that are 10 times easier than this 100 level gen ed! AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!!,0
is the hardest teacher u will ever take in your life......hes boring and his lectures are boring its hard to pay attention.... he a smart guy but a smartalic... the tests ha u might as well get the drop sheet ready.....,0
The other recent review is 100% correct. He doesn't acknowledge technical issues and is not clear about what material is on which quiz. The material is VERY disorganized and instructor isn't helpful at all. Either ignores emails/discussions or just responds that he thinks everything is self-explanatory. Many students post questions that are ignored,0
"She is an amazing teacher and her class is not hard. She takes attendance, but only to learn your name. It is not for a grade. She does a lot of fun activities in class. She was seriously one of my favorite classes to go to. She assigns kind of a lot of group projects, but they are not hard. I would highly recommend her!!!!",1
"This class was a NIGHTMARE. She posted ""slides"" online with blanks for all the relevant information which was ultimately pointless. She pays someone to grade her exams and papers, and that person is BRUTAL. Also, the grader and Durrant CLEARLY have different expectations for the students which is a really bad surprise to realize as a student. AVOID",0
I took Bergert for Marketing online & she was good! The assignments are pretty easy & you will also do a marketing plan throughout the semester which is pretty easy as well! I ended with an 89.6 but she was nice enough to round it up! :),1
"This class was one of my favorites that I have ever taken. Although it is lecture heavy, video clips are included and discussions are interesting and engaging. There are lots of papers but he gives you the freedom to write about what you want. Highly recommend taking this class with this professor!",1
"Prof Leidig wants everyone to answer questions to earn a decent grade, but you better know what you're answering or else. There apparently is not a right/wrong answer. Great class that made me want to learn more about what I need to know in my job.",1
Tries to cover way too much within the 75min class. having the homework & quizzes online makes it very difficult to keep up with assignments because she gives no reminders of due dates. she is a very nice lady but a horrible teacher... would definitely NOT recommend!,0
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
"Same person as last review, I'm not done:  Vician rambles on the entire class in a way reminiscent of senility.  He brags about where he went to college so much that I actually checked if he got accredited because I couldn't believe it from his teaching. We didn't learn any actual philosophy; this class is just an indoctrination into his beliefs",0
"This class was so hard. I really struggled with it, even after studying a LOT! I did pass, barely! The tests never seemed to be what I expected or we were encouraged to study. This didn't help my HATE for history. I did much better in the 2nd part of this class with a better teacher.",0
Prof Mattson's lectures a lot of fun. He is into new technologies and we got to create our on blog in this class. Very entertaining,1
"extremely difficult to work with.  was not knowledgable in helping me do a project and then graded me down for making a mistake i asked her for help with. can be rude and snotty if not having a ""good day"". would not recommend taking her if you dont have to.",0
Awesome.,1
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
"In the beginning you think what a great teacher...then he grades analytical essays that he makes you do all semester. He has very opinionated views and grading system. This shouldn't be a history class, more like a essay competition class to make him jump out of his seat but that won't happen b/c he thinks everyone sucks at writing except himself.",0
Her lectures are long and she just talks at you for most of it. Tests are alright but she grades them very meticulously. The homework are an easy 100% but they don't count for much towards your grade. I would not take this class again.,0
"Professor Green has a very monotonous voice that will put you to sleep. Thankfully, his homework is one of the easiest things on the planet, as are his exams. He'll help you if you ask. Not a bad class, just boring.",1
"Dr. Arndt is probably the best college professor I have taken.  Although the course is very difficult, he explains assignments extremely well and often, gives excellent feedback, and does an excellent job of reducing the inevitable stress.  The assignments are constant, but if you keep up, you will do just fine.",1
"Dave Boden is great! He is a great teacher and his power points are very lucid. If you just go to class, take notes, pay attention, you will pass this class. Dave explains  the material so well, and he is always there for help. This was definitely one of my easiest class, but he loves when you are very very very very descriptive in all the labs.",1
His wording style in his tests and homework is horrible. You will get confused at some point. His lecture notes aren't really that great either.,0
This professor did the bare minimum with teaching this class. No lecture videos and barely any powerpoints/notes to supplement the reading guides she gives. Exams are way harder than what they need to be. Ignored many students emails when asking for help with the course when a majority of students are struggling in the class.,0
"Noble knows this class can be taught in 4-6 wks so that is why he gives busy work...to fill in the rest of the time. You'll learn the history of UNO, who everyone in HPER is & you have to type your entire college course plan - yes the very same thing your advisor does for you. Also, there are 6 wks of guest speakers...all of which you are tested on",0
"I am far from a philosophy major, but Corcoran made it enjoyable! I am a biochem major and was worried about philosophy ruining my GPA, but Corcoran is very clear about what he requires to receive an A. He is hilarious and every lecture was interesting. If you can get him for philosophy DO IT. Princeton Review ranked him in the top 300 professors.",1
"Great class, great teacher. Planning to take her for nutrition next cuz I like the way she organizes the class, you always know what is expected.",1
also read my rating for her on www.virtualratings.com its more extensive,0
"MATH122 is hard enough of a class as it is, especially to teach, but if Argerami is teaching it AVOID LIKE THE PLAUGE. The content of our class never lined up with SI, and Argerami was hard to understand with the way he went about doing his examples.",0
"I came in knowing nothing and came out a genius.... not because of the slob of a teacher but because of other students that were helpful and internet tutorials. He never slowed down when asked, rolls his eyes when you ask a question and goes for an entire class period about how much better he than you are.... he's pathetic... ignorant and arrogant.",0
Scott's an overall great professor! He is really funny and likes to make you laugh. All the assignments are on Top Hat or Code org. Don't worry about this being hard. He lets you be very creative and wants you to succeed. There is one paper and it is super easy. I think there are two group projects and many partner assignments but overall it's fun.,1
"I got an A from this class from determination alone. He gives you extra credit on some tests (if you correct them) but other than that, nada. After the second day absent, you lose points. And he has this ridiculous grading system where he replaces the lowest test score (say an 80) with your final (say a 50), regardless of score. Hated it.",0
This was an incredible waste of time and money. Norm is a business professor trying to teach IT and CPS courses and failing. Most of the work is busy work and completely useless. You would be better off reading a book because that is all you'll do anyway. He lacks and ability to teach and instead assigns papers on modern tech to avoid doing work.,0
"Everyone should take one of her classes. She is a great teacher, good person. Cares about students, wants them to be knowledgable about the world. No text, just online reading and handouts. A few community involvement opportunities. She is interested in what her students are interested in. A UNCC treasure.",1
Don't take this prof. unless you want to have your mind blown. He uses subatomic particles to change the laws of physics in class. He also hypnotized me and made me believe that I was a real student and not who actually tried and did the homework and that helped me get the grade I earned not given. I had to do the work for once in my life.,0
Frau Bush is the most amazing professor at UD. She is so helpful and wants you to succeed. She allows re-writes for everything and won't let you fail her class. I would 10/10 100% recommend.,1
"Very good professor, very inspirational for me. This was my first class I have taken at Oakton, because of Mr. Ragy I kept going.",1
"He seems reasonable and very knowledgeable at first, which he is very knowledgable. However,  with the ""daily prep"", Labs, problem of the week, webwork, studying and normal homework, the work for this course is entirely unreasonable. He is ready to help, but his expectations are much too high.",0
"Dr. Bottomley was my favorite professor last semester! She has an incredible sense of humor and she truly cares about her students. The class was also very fun, with multiple design competitions. Highly HIGHLY recommended.",1
"This teacher is unlike any other you'll ever meet at CSCC.  We all know that Columbus State is famous for their crap teachers and in the toilet retention rates but Melissa is one of a kind.  Knowledgeable, fun, dedicated, kind, caring, helpful, interesting, hilarious, sensible, and understanding.  You will miss her sorely when you move on.",1
"Denise is highly respected in the field, one of the top professor's in the UB school of social work. You have to work your ass off to get a good grade her expectations of students are very high. Do not skip her class because you will have missed out on a great lecture. A lot of role play to get you prepared. Feel very lucky to have her as a prof.",1
"So this class is pretty lecture heavy, if you are a solid note taker you will pass this class easily. We had a pop quiz on the third day of class, so write down pretty much everything he says. We also had HW on the second day of class, we had to read and answer 10 questions on Apology by Socrates (that was great). His shorthand sucks so make a key.",0
"I am about to finish this course in fall 2020, so I took it all online and asynchronous due to COVID. Out of all the classes I'm taking this semester, this is by far my least favorite and most difficult. The entire grade is based off of 4 exams, THATS IT. Unless you really enjoy philosophy or learning about specific philosophers, don't take this.",0
Great guy and a great class! Definitely take this course. It is amazing the stuff i learned.,1
"Rhodes doesn't believe in using powerpoints or D2L. All of your assignments are emailed to you and you have to keep track of your own grade. There are only 4 tests and the final is worth 40% of your grade. For hw, you read and analyze court cases and then he cold-calls to recite cases in class. Tests are all essays. It sucked.",0
"You are graded on four things; Two papers (both of which are difficult) and two exams, where if you do not know the material inside and out you will fail. If I wanted to take a philosophy class I would have, but for a criminal justice course, this guy is all over the place and lectures are lengthy and confusing.",0
Just really boring. Her voice is really shrill and she says the same stuff over and over. There wasn't really any structure to the class and all you need to do is read the book. ,0
"i was an econ major, now i'm not. the man makes up formulae and has nonsensical graphs. he's boring, and the class is even worse. what you do in class (which is redundant at best) has little to do with the exams. he will make you despise macro without even really teaching it to you.",0
Way too  angry about gender and ambiguous.,0
Not such a great experience. Dont recommend,0
A ridiculous amount of work each week. No communication with instructor whatsoever. Missed One deadline because it is a class where teacher doesnt email you for months and failed. I got an F whereas I had gotten an A on 2301 with a different professor.,0
"Seriously the worst teacher I've ever had. Exams are 90% about reading, which there is A LOT of. Exams are more concerned about wether you did the reading/came to class than if you learned anything. He's obviously full of himself and can be really condescending. He CANNOT lecture - literally reads off the slides & every other word is ""uh"" or ""ok"".",0
"Mr. McEntire is an exceptional teacher of drama. He gives TONS of extra credit by watching videos in class, seeing playsmusicals at TCC or outside of class. He lets you know when a quiz is coming. Several short quizzes, 2 tests, 1 analysis essay over a play of your choice. He makes things very interesting!  Very funny guy, Highly recommended.",1
Definetly not reccommended. Very vague in what he wants and rarely offers any valuable input for improvement. How you do well in his class is beyond me. Not all approachable and very rarely interesting. Would avoid at all costs,0
I'd 10/10 be friends with him outside of class but do not take his class. Way too difficult for the level of the class and his tests do not reflect your understanding of the content 0/10.,0
Professor is a really good teacher he knows the material really well but this is a very hard class. He tries to balance grades out with homework online but there are not a lot of grades for his class to really make a big difference. He tries to make lecture interesting overall I thought he was a good teacher just a hard course in general.,1
"In this class, we only talked about the 2020 election even though it was not on any test/quiz/exam we took. He also never answered when I emailed him. I did not learn much if anything in this class.",0
"Formatting should never be taken as seriously as it is in this class. I answered the questions for the first assignment with ""too basic a response"" to the most basic possible questions. I'm a straight A student but I'll be dropping this class as soon as possible. Save yourself the headache, don't take this teacher.",0
Has questions on exams that were not in the lectures or reviews. Exams reward strict memorization rather than understanding of material.,0
"Very tough grader and hard class. Would not recommend. He did answer emails fast and was helpful, but papers were very hard to even receive a decent grade",0
Fun personality to be around in class. Very unclear grading criteria and hard to follow in lecture.,0
"My friends and I are going to write him a five-page letter sharing our opinions about how this course was taught. We'll write it on engineering grid-paper (double sided of course), using our worst handwriting, list our names in random order, paper clip (not staple) the pages together and slide the whole thing under his office door.",0
Give's great feedback to each paper. Customizes your homework based upon your individual learning needs.,1
He is an amazing teacher.  I wasn't interested in Liberal education before I took his class and I learned sooo much!  As long as you do your work and try hard you'll do fine in his class.  His really knows what he's talking about.,1
SHE'S OK WITH THE ASSIGNMENTS,1
"Never thought I would end loving this class. We call Prof. Wolfe's class a ""life class"" truly inspirational and motivates his students all the time.  Most of his students ends up crying with the speeches of other students.  Easy A! Just don't be late and participate in ALL his speech assignments.",1
"Dr. Falvo (Doc) is simply the greatest instructor I’ve had. You can treat him more as a friend than a professor, and you can expect the same from him. Very talented performer.  Mistakes not a part of his vocabulary. He will help you about personal stuff and assumes the mentor role for his students.",1
"Not difficult to get an EASY A. Didn't show up for half the classes, because it was a 9 a.m., but still managed to get an A. GOOGLE DOCS are your best friends. Lets you use notes for all the tests. Don't forget to do the 5 question quizzes on BB for easy points. 10/10 recommend.",1
"He is a very nice guy, but his class is nothing like I expected. He gives quizzes over the reading, which is usually 30 pages to read, every week. He lectures the entire class time but his notes are not beneficial to his quizzes. He gives a take home midterm and final, as well as two book reviews, but his grading is very inconsistent.",0
"Hard class, dry lectures, did not curve exams",0
"A truly devoted professor and wonderful mentor. He lives and breathes literature, and he really inspires his students to work hard and react personally to the text. Kind, perceptive, and invested in his students. If you want a challenging but fulfilling English experience, take a class with him. It's so sad that he's only here for one more year!",1
Thomas Flowers is a nic person his only downside is he gives to much homework lecture heavy his work is hard and homework is to it takes six hours to complete his homework assignment the work load is to much for a Beginnings class lots of reading I hop this was helpful,0
He is a cool dude. Go to class and do the work and you will be fine.,1
"As a student very interested in art and entering the course with extensive prior experience/skill, Salzillo is terrible. He does not give any constructive criticism and he doesn't know what he's talking about most of the time. I did not learn anything from his class. He is very easy if it looks like you put any semblance of time into a piece.",0
"Class was unruly and prof was not good at managing it. Class was regularly disruptive and off task. I don't think we finished one lecture in its entirety before I decided to drop this class. The subject matter is dope and prof seems to know it well, but it did not translate well into her teaching methodologies.",0
"He will not, ""he will not..."" round your 69.15% to a 70.00% even if you are were close in passing the class. Find other Professor that is more considerate. He will not answer your email or ""will just say grades will be out soon!"" You been warned to not take any of his classes. Dont say you never read this... good luck finding a better professor.",0
"Dr Meglich was a terrible grader. She laughs with you in class and acts all friendly seeing you outside class but when it comes to grading she is just too terrible. Nobody got an A in her class and she didn't even give opportunity for B+ grades or A- grades she just stuck to the traditional A,B,C. I narrowly escaped a C. NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!",0
Take her class. She's real helpful if you need it.,1
"Very very into himself. Never wrong, even when it comes to opinions. Immature and calls students out in front of the class. He does not explain material well. He doesn't give study guides or guidelines for exams. This class should have been way easier than it ended up being.",0
"Rodgers was rarely teaching us something we actually needed to know for our homework and test.  I haven't learned anything from him, I've pretty much had to teach myself.  He takes about 3 weeks to reply to an email, if you ask in person you will stand there listening for 10min and at the end you'd be more confused than before.",0
"He seems to be a very nice man outside of the classroom, but once in class he is incredibly condescending. He does not listen to his students needs. His comments on papers often left students feeling embarrassed and upset. I went to office hours with him but left feeling worse about my paper. Honestly one of my worst experiences with a professor.",0
"This class was honestly the best class I had ever taken at the U. Not only was the material interesting and engaging but Professor Nesvig delivered it in a great manner! So grateful to have taken this course, take him if you have a chance!",1
"If grammar or spelling are a challenge for you, beware she will go after you 1-on-1 & in class. You HAVE to read!! You will not survive the blackboard post or class discussions without it. My class read 4 novel sized memoirs. You are graded super subjectively on ""if you are getting it"" & you are graded on two essays and BB posts. No tests/quizzes.",0
"Get ready to write down lots and lots and lots of lecture notes, he doesn't make them available online, honestly never seen a teacher do this before, and then he tells us if you don't study the lecture notes you're not gonna pass, also made us buy the book for $80 in the beginning of the year, never used it once",0
"If you can, definitely take Stat 105/305 with him. His practice exams are almost identical to the real tests and he is very nice. Would highly recommend him over any other stats professor.",1
Online class. Didn't answer emails promptly or consistently. Slow to grade. Class was extremely easy but didn't really learn a lot.,0
"She had an attitude when students asked  questions and criticized them for not knowing the answers.  I emailed her for help and she refused! When I went to class she was rude again, but got quiet when she realized I was prepared. I've heard similar experiences from other students. Luckily I only had her for lab and passed the course overall.",0
"If your were good at calc 1,2 then you should be good for his calc 3 class. I barely even tried and i got a B. His lectures were boring and his exams were long. Webassign will teach you more than him.",1
"He does not use blackboard so you never know what your grade is. We also had only 4 assignments the entire semester- two ten page papers, a four page paper, and our final exam. Very tough grader and a lot of reading. The entire class was way over my head. ",0
"Horrible professor, so rude and reads straight from power points, doesn't actually teach. Tests are confusing. Read the anatomy textbook because it's your only chance of passing.",0
"The class was a total JOKE, respectfully. Seems hard at first because you get HW, 1 Midterm, 2 Quizzes, 1 Final & Extra Credit project. Midterm problems are identical to HW (which is online) & the final was online (answers on Chegg). Copies from solution manuals during lectures, cancels class & arrives late all the time & posts grades 2 weeks late.",0
Easy A! Show up ready to learn and you will do well!,1
"Dr. B is a pretty good teacher, he can go fast sometimes but he will always stop or slow down for questions. Practice tests are very similar to the tests he gives. Don't bother buying the textbook, I never used it once. He also does not take attendance and posts notes on Canvas. He can be very boring but at least he doesn't have an accent.",1
This professor is an extremely tough grader. Although you do the homework it does not correlate to the test because the questions are too hard to do on the test because you are not allowed to use a scientific calculator. So although you may study and do the homework it does not help when taking test and quizs.,0
"nice lady, but if you care about your GPA id avoid taking this class with her at all costs! shes very unorganized & there is almost 2 weeks of class left & shes only posted one grade plus attendance. she is also picky at grading so its unfair for us to know what to work on to get a better grade when she doesnt give us anything to compare to.",0
"The class itself isn't all that exciting, but he is aware of this and tries to liven it up sometimes. He does get annoyed if you are late to class. He grades homework which pertains to the mid term and final. He grades fairly and will answer questions outside of class. Uses the text book somewhat. Overall, good prof.",1
Homework due almost every Friday. Will not open it back up even if you have a valid excuse. Unclear during her lectures. Tough quiz grader ( 1 question- 10 pts). Overall I didon't like her teaching style. Very unclear about test reviews!!!!! You basically have to teach yourself,0
During Covid she took weeks to respond to my emails.,0
"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass. The exams are way more involved (and graded harder) than you'd think, given how easy the day-to-day work is, so study hard for the midterm and final. Overall, don't love, but it's still a pretty easy class.",0
He's a little quirky but really fun to have! Take good notes on his lectures and you will do fine. Average amount of work for a 100 level class.,1
"Neil Nevitte ran the most difficult course I took in four years of university.  Years later, however it is the only class in which I still retain much of the material covered. He committed the offense of expecting students to think.",1
"Exams are extremely hard, does not give a study guide. Expected to know all of the HW, In class work, and the conceptual book information we don't discuss in class. First exam was curved over 40%, still blamed us students. Take someone else if possible unless you enjoy studying without direction! Are allowed 3x5 card, which is half the size needed.",0
"Very Very opinionated. Does not teach in detail, reads off her slides, says her opinion and moves on. It gets confusing with what is actual facts and her opinion. I have emailed her several times asking questions, its been two months and I haven't gotten one response yet.  She puts in no effort to help students.",0
"I loved his class. It's not often you see a real scientist teaching his subject. Very knowledgeable and excited about the material. I would take more of his classes, but it's not under my degree.",1
"He is a good teacher and interesting lecturer. It helped that I had a keen interest in this course (Philosophy of the Mind), but the material wouldn't have been the same without Professor Adams as a guide. There are required readings each week, but they are short. Definitely a great breadth elective to take!",1
"Brooklyn style grit and wit. 1/3 - 1/2 of lecture is information dense, the rest is meant to help you find what interests you by showing many many many pictures of animals.",1
Honestly Im not sure if its due to the class having to be online due to covid19 but this professor is the worst Ive had. She doesnt care for her students and refuses to listen when they reach out about the course. She also refuses to help if it is past her bedtime or if it interrupts her time with her kids. We have families too ya know.,0
plan to take someone different for ASL 121. Hopefully it will be a better experience.,0
"I like Dr. Wells as a person but never have I studied so hard for a class and FLUNK 2 out of the 3 exams. The tests are EXTREMELY difficult. He ""tells"" you what to study but much of what he says isn't on the test per se. SHOW ALL YOUR WORK on practical problems. Even if you don't know how to solve it, the more you show, the more credit you'll get.",0
"I did not enjoy her class at all. This class really stressed me out, and was pretty difficult. You really have to work for it, which can be hard when you're also managing lots of other classes. Her exams are very challenging so put in a lot of time if you want to do well. I do not recommend taking her class!",0
"Benny cares about you and will adjust the grading scale according to how the class performs. He is lenient in grading exams and looks to see if you understood the concept rather than focusing on whether your answer is correct. Grading: 2 midterms (50%), final (30%), hw (20%). Hw is tough and long but I learnt the most in this class.",1
"Mr. Zant is a  nice teacher I'll say that much, but the way he teaches the material is boring. Most of the questions come from the textbooks and the way he words the questions make it difficult to understand. Exams were too long to finish in the amount of time given and tons of material to remember. Would recommend another professor.",0
"Dr. Casimir is very sweet but soft-spoken. His lectures are not mandatory but in recitation, he gives quizzes and answers HW questions. HW is due weekly 10/12 questions. Labs are long with a lot of calculations but attendance is mandatory for full lab report credit. Test are online also",1
"Professor Rysdahl is a great professor. Takes a subject most dont care about and brings it to the maximum of relevance. Got 3 on easiness cause of material, not him. Take him, you'll learn so much in his class.",1
"Dr. Gea is a very nice man; however, he is not a great physics teacher. The lectures are absolutely pointless and really only help you with attendance points. I taught myself everything in this course and relied heavily on past physics courses and the textbook.",0
She really for students and knows how to teach,1
"Mark makes you buy a textbook which he wrote so he also gets money when you buy it. He doesn't use canvas! when he grades he can't understand his own handwriting. Very messy, he doesn't lecture and makes you do speeches about his book. He estimates your grade. Makes you do 1 hour long speeches and makes you buy a binder you don't use.",0
love SAM such a solid guy who genuinely cares about what hes teaching,1
"At first I thought bob was kinda funny. After counting me absent for 2 days that I attended, I contacted him multiple times to try and fix my grade and even offered to let him see my notes (I sat in the 1st row?) He told me I was lying and laughed at me. Only show up for the points, the slides are irrelevant brain farts & projects have no direction",0
"Wane is unorganized, unclear in both her lectures and grading criteria, and overall the worst professor I have had. Her lectures had no structure, and everything she said was overtly opinionated. While opinions are fine, objectivity is needed when describing literary schools. I got an A, so I'm not just complaining because I flunked. She's horrible",0
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jennifer!! She has been one of the most caring, relatable, invested professors I've ever had. This was already an emotional class alone, but speaking with her about the issues of everyday wouldn't have been the same with any other teacher at NCC! She really is a gem, a must take teacher at NCC!",1
"Smart and nice lady. But, takes very long to grade anything. Did not know what my true grade in the class was even up until the final exam. Takes long to respond to emails. Cant use computer in class. Tests are very hard. If it wasnt for other class assignments, I probably would have failed her class solely because of her.",0
Sweet person. She grades hard on papers so do them well in advance and/or look over them thoroughly. Some of the material is boring and some is really interesting. She is really invested in students doing well. Overall interesting class but a decent challenge.,1
His grading system is extremely frustrating.  He grades harshly with no feedback to give you room for improvement next time.  His grading system is ambiguous  and inconsistent.  The works studied are borderline X-Rated.  He specifically tells you not to use any outside research.  You must accept only his interpretation of the material.,0
"hes terrible, miserable, and rude. he always gets mad when no one answers his questions in class and when people do answer them but are wrong, he calls you out and makes you feel dumb!!! no wonder no one answers your questions! tests are like they're in a different language, not on anything you actually learn. would not recommend to even an enemy",0
"I guess it's either a love or hate relationship.  I personally couldn't stand him. I found his lecturers to be unbelievably boring and uninspiring. He's arrogant and loves it when students stroke his ego. I went in there wanting to like the guy, but I just couldn't. But, give him a chance and see for yourself.",0
Worst experience in NJIT! Avoiidddddddddd! A lot to read! Boring lectures! Do not take her at all!,0
"Very disappointed in this class. With everything going on in the world you would think this class would be fine to take. Not the case here. Victor, how does it feel that your whole curriculum is disappointing? 3+ hours of lectures for 10 min 10 question quiz. No time to think. 40 question final 40 MIN. Are you out of your mind or just dont care?",0
"Norma is an amazing professor. She cares about all of her students and her main goal is to teach you what it means to be a teacher. The homework is easy and she is very understanding if you forget an assignment or something. If you can, take her class! I cant say enough good about her.",1
Professor Nikkel doesnt really know how to teach. Goes on tangents all the time and is just hard to follow in general. Do not take him if you can help it. His teaching style is just not effective and his exams are the hardest Ive taken in college.,0
"As long as you participate on Discussion board and workbook assignments, Its an A!",1
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED do not let her be your 1st choice. She is a kind teacher &loves math but she is higly confusing&wants you to spell out each word&number if your problem is 2+24 she wants you to explain why and how do you know for a fact that  4. Makes everything more confusing than what it needs 2b. Group projects? what are we in highschool?,0
His lecture are soooooooooooooooo dense and so are the readings. Power points also do not have much to offer which makes it hard to follow. Also repeats himself a lot? which makes following him even harder,0
Dr. Sikora does not know how to teach Calculus. I have already taken Calculus in high school and the credit would not transfer to UB. He will not accept on tests the way the book explains or another equally right way. His lectures are repetitions of the reading and he is completely unorganized and hard to follow.,0
"Scripps isn't a easy teacher. He can be funny and is a genius when it comes to coding, but he doesn't really do a good job teaching it to you. he isn't much help in labs at all either. It's hard at first because I had no programming or coding experience. I learned everything just fine, but mostley by myself with my text book. he's a funny guy tho.",0
"Her class taught me so much about reading and understanding scientific literature and data analysis. She goes through research papers, asking students to interpret statistics and taking apart data in tables. It could be tediuos at times, but soooooo worth the effort if you want to learn how to read research papers. One of the best classes I've had.",1
"I saw how crappy her reviews were after starting her class, but after taking her for almost 4 weeks now, she's not as bad as everyone says. She's boring, and grades toughly, but she's definitely not the worst. She won't be your most fun class, but she's not the worst option",0
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0
Be ready to learn and remain teachable!! This woman know her stuff and can spot a wanna be know it all a mile away. Do yourself a favor and try to remain humble in her class. She loves to help the struggles and will bend over backwards until you understand the material. Leave your phone off or in the car. Copy down ALL that she writes on the board!,1
"Initially I liked Dillery b/c he was so enthusiastic and really interested in helping me at office hours.  My test and paper grades don't reflect this though.  I never really found what he was exactly looking for in papers.  The tests were beasts and the IDs could be random and unpredictable.  A LOT of reading, skip The Histories.",1
"Get ready for alot of reading, journals and 4 essays. He is not very accessible outside of school. It took him A MONTH to get back to me about an email!",0
Worst professor ever. I did not learn a single thing in that class and he was rude! Do not take his class if you want to learn.,0
This was probably the worst professor I have ever encountered!!! It was actually ridiculous how he treated his students. I dropped out the 2nd week of school due to an incident that happened. I asked him a question about the things he never announces that are due and he straight up got in my face and yelled at me I had to step back. Do not take!!!!,0
"While I believe Professor Phil is respected and knows his craft, I found his teaching style to be challenging at best and hostile to new students at worse. He teaches a beginning level scriptwriting class like he's teaching Scriptwriting II. His feedback is vague, and he doesn't aid his students outside of class. He isn't constructive at all.",0
This is a hard class (which is why many people give him bad reviews) but DeBruine is your best option. He always makes himself available to help (especially before exams) and he tells you what to expect on exams. He is a kind professor and cares a lot about his students. Show him you are working hard and he will get you through it! Take him!,1
"Throughout the year she never input any grades and when reaching out, she would not respond to emails. Eventually towards the end of the year, she announced that her computer was the issue and that it somehow inhibited her ability to release grades. There's a quiz every class but the catch is she only collects 6 so if you miss class u may be SOL",0
"She is nice, but she is EXTREMELY ""loopy.""  She forgets things all the time and even changed her teaching topic mid-sentence into something totally unrelated! It's pretty scary. It can be very frustrating. If you have other options for piano, I would strongly consider them.",0
I can not stand this lady. Michelle is very rude she wanted an assignment completed but does not explain exactly what she wants. It was painful being in her class. I felt like all I did was cram everything I read and did not learn anything. She gives so much work and the readings were unnecessary. It took her days to respond to my emails. Skip her!,0
"Now that I have become a teacher myself, I find that Prof. Warner is the instructor I most frequently find myself emulating.  His conversational and humerous demeanor make him an ideal professor of communications and his upbeat approach to every class, every day is commendable in the profession.",1
Professor Kuo's class was super easy. Do every assignment and study the PowerPoints he uses to lecture. I never paid attention during the lectures because they weren't very engaging but I studied the PowerPoints and was able to get good scores each time. Those that didn't do well either didn't do assignments or didn't study at all.,1
"Huge GPA booster if you stay remotely up-to-date. Got 100% on all quizzes. No textbook needed, use her notes. Crammed for the final in 1 day, got 85% and 77% in the course. Would NOT recommend though if you have absolutely no interest in the course; I lost marks because I didn't care enough to even attempt the assignments. Yes, I'm garbage.",0
Wonderful perforessor! Always there to help give feedback and help with your learning! Great professor! Would love to take again!,1
"If you can understand what he is saying, you'll wish you didn't.",0
"I loved having freshman seminar with Dr. Coles! Very helpful, chill, and friendly guy. Take a class with him, definitely! You'll enjoy him as a professor and as a person.",1
This professor has super long and super boring lectures. The only grades are 6 quizzes and two exams. The exams are worth 80% of your grade. The content is very science heavy and the lectures are so monotone and boring its impossible to pay attention.,0
Mr. Randolph was extremely knowledgeable and helped us understand the content. He's reasonable but doesn't like you to not pay attention or be on your phones-typical professor. You'll enjoy his class.,1
"You can barely pay attention in class and pass the 3 exams with Cs, but still pull out an A if you do the homework, a few of the extra credit assignments, and show up to recitation. The trip to the observatory was pretty fun and cool too.",1
"The material is not clearly laid out for any of the assignments, she doesn't grade anything or give feedback until the week of finals. Her quizzes are hard, weekly assignments that are long. She also is just an ununderstanding professor, don't come to her with any issues she doesn't care",0
I missed class due to medical issues and had the papers she did not want to help me catch up and asked me to withdraw so i wouldn't fail,0
"STAY AWAY!!! from this lady do not take her online for math because she barely explains anything, she just gives you the text book to read and expects you to know. She also is very rude when you ask her about extra credits.",0
"Bret was a really good professor. You do quite a bit of essays and projects in this class, along with the mandatory student-learning portion. However, the student-learning wasn't as bad as I originally thought and he puts a lot of time and effort into making sure you understand his feedback on your essays.",1
"She has a very high energy level.  If you're not sure about poetry, take this class.",1
"Tom is the reason my writing has improved and it has shown through all of my classes. He cares a lot about his students and wants them all to succeed. He is a tough grader, but always comments on what you need to improve on. SOC 206 has been the hardest class I have taken throughout my college career, but I would have not have had it any other way!",1
"Prof à éviter. Les explication ne sont pas claires, il lit les diapositives tout simplement. Les examens ne représentent la matière, (Plus difficile que les exercices fait à la maison). Passe sont temps à se venter de ses expériences professionnelles, rien avoir avec le cours. Un chose bonne: Répond rapidement aux courriels!",0
he is horrible...exams have nothing to do with powerpoints or lecture notes...avoid taking him as much as you can....going to class is not gonna help either...this is my first B...I have an 89 and I went to all his stupid lectures....still didn't get a curve ...AVOID AVOID AVOIDDDD!,0
"Sucked at teaching physics. Lectures only covered conceptual material, tests contained at max 1-2 conceptual problems. Final was really hard for 6B, like unreasonably hard. Had him for the entire physics series-- would not do again if I could",0
Too much work. Did not enjoy. Avoid.,0
Such a great director. Definitely recommend joining her team. Live changing and bonds that cannot be broken.,0
She is a nice professor that will provide help if requested. The whole class she will lecture but she will like to discuss a topic as long as you bring it up. The assignments are not hard as long as you show you participate. There are two essays in which are research papers but she will provide help and exams are the midterm and final.,1
He is the best professor! Very good explanation.. :) He is very very helpful... i would love to have him for every subject,1
Motherly is the best way to describe her. Transcultural nursing is one of the easiest classes you will take for the major but it could be more difficult with another professor. She is very straightforward about what will be on the tests and if you listen to her lectures you will get an A! Has very simple group projects that boost your grade.,1
Professor Cole is not the easiest professor but definitely one of my favorites I've had at GV so far. He is sooo educated on geography as a whole there's literally nothing he isn't informed on. Yes his class is lecture heavy and it can get boring at times. Take Prof. Cole if you truly want to learn a lot and challenge yourself!,1
"Awesome teacher! Take her if you can.  Very helpful, clear, nice, friendly, etc.  If you want to get a good grade you can, you will just have to work your butt off! But she is very nice about it!",1
She knows her stuff and can be nice most of the time. She gets visibly aggravated when she THINKS no one's done the reading regardless of whether they've done it or not. She ruined my 4.0 GPA in History courses. Grading was mostly arbitrary. The main assignments were diary entries and it seemed she wanted everything she said rewritten in two pages.,1
"I loved Renee and her course! I wish she was teaching every HCOM course because I'd take them all. There's a ready quiz every day, but as long as you actually read you'll be ok. Her lectures are inspiration filled and passionate. She's funny and just overall lovely. You have to go to class every day, though.",1
"Agree with the other posters - has no interest in hearing any opinion that doesn't mimic his own.  Is downright abrasive to students at times.  Also doesn't seem to believe in the concept of giving ""partial credit"" on exams, even though he will say that he does.  Do not recommend him at all!",0
"I really loved the way he lectured. Very captivating and he really knew his stuff. Interesting class. A lot of reading, but interesting stuff. I thought I was going to get a worse grade but I ended up getting an A. Definitely recommended :)",1
"not the worst lecturer, but this man never returned anything.  I had the worlds most solid A going, but hadn't seen a paper a web site, or a presentation grade going into the final.  ended up with an A-, and when i emailed him he said and I quote ""oh yeah, i hope to get those grades posted soon.""  never did, and never returned an email.",0
She is Romanian so it takes a few days to get used to her accent. It's a fairly easy class just show up and participate when given the chance. Final exam is 50 questions worth 4 points a piece. All the questions came from the study hall session packets. As long as you attend the study sessions you should easily finish with an A or B.,1
He is a fairly good teacher. He gives you many oppertunities and bonuses to improve your grade. OVerall it was a good class but don't expect it to be easy.,1
This guy is very dedicated to his teaching and I felt like I was important to him. He doesn?t teach many classes at Keene but if he did I would definitely take him again. He is not very easy but he will help you do well. Be sure to come to class and look like you are paying attention. He is scary looking but pretty nice.,1
"Dr. Kelley has an absolutely fantastic nutrition class at PCC! She has been so caring towards her students during the covid-19 pandemic and has really ensured to give us every opportunity available to get an A. There are so many, many extra credit opportunities. You will succeed if you try. Thank you Dr. Kelley for a great online class.",1
Does NOT provide study guides. Very unhelpful.,1
Survey I is just a piece of cake for me. I got no exam grade below 90 and all homeworks were rated check plus in his class. Read the textbook and review the presentation if you don't understand dude!,1
"Huber often demands too much from students, even from entry-level courses. Huber is very pompous and is rarely understanding of student.    Hard work is his class barely yields a ""C"" in most cases.",0
"Professor Doane is a kind person and a great professor. I've developed nothing short of the deepest respect and greatest affection for her. Pay attention! Not only will you learn a lot about literature, you may learn something about life.",1
"Great instructor! Great stories from a public defender that are a learning experience. Make sure to attend class since all test material will be from lectures, no need to purchase textbook unless you want to. Best instructor and would recommend his class to all those that want to learn Criminal Law.A GREAT TEACHER, wish more were like you...",1
"Promises to be ""your statistician for life"" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can",0
"The whole class is Dr. Carrion reading off of slides that are word for word from the textbook. The TA was super unhelpful and could not correctly answer questions with problems in lab. The lab portion was a waste of time, only one or two concepts from lab was applicable for the final paper.",0
Poor execution for the second basic programming course. Professor teaches through slides and poorly written instructions for lab assignments and homework leaving students confused about what needs to be done. Teacher does not seem to care if a majority of the class did  not complete previous lab assignments and will move on to the next topic.,0
"She is my favorite professor here at Allegheny. I respect her a lot, and I think she grades fairly. Her class is my favorite of the semester, and one of the few that I've ever had that I actually really look forward to attending.",1
"Murrie is a HORRIBLE teacher.  Has no clue how to deal with people in a major that REQUIRES people skills.  He's not challenging, just not good at actually TEACHING kids. Nuff said.",0
"Probably the best professor I've ever had. Whether you take this class as a GenEd or an elective, you will receive valuable information to be used in life, as well as boosting your GPA. Even if you don't study much, it's really hard to do poorly in this class. She also gives MANY opportunities for extra credit and boosting your grade.",1
She is very sweet and a good portion of the textbook she goes over in power points in class. All the stuff she goes over in class are always on the test and if your not doing so well she allows a lot of extra credit,1
"I love Professor Lusk! While her classes tend to be pretty lecture heavy, I generally don't get bored listening to her. Her lectures are honestly quite thought provoking and interesting. She tells stories that make her lessons pretty applicable. Don't skip her class, I relied a lot on what I learned in class for tests. Also she grades pretty easy.",1
"This course was useless. The only useful thing I learned was how to write grant applications. Dean was a boring professor who only talked about his area of expertise.... FORESTRY! He has a lot of experience working abroad in natural resource development, but is not interesting at all.",0
"She was very disorganized, and would come up with assignments at the last minute, but she explained things well, and by the end of the semester, I could understand her easily when she conducted the class in Spanish.  She would talk a lot about her life in Spain, but it added a really interesting cultural component.",1
Amazing teacher,1
"This class was easy until we got to resumes. She told me to take off all my non-history related job experiences on mine. When it came to the mock interview, she said I didnt have enough on my resume. Her criticism was not helpful in any way. I could get into detail but there arent enough characters. Not accommodating at all given COVID going on.",0
Dustin is the BEST professor anyone will ever have at WSU. He understands the material and knows how to teach it. If you are having a difficult time he is more than willing to work with you. Gives helpful tips for exams and goes through many example problems to help you prepare. Having trouble in other engineering courses? Hes the one to talk to!,1
"He believes he is the best professor in the world, really a very bully person.",1
Peggy is a pretty solid teacher. She makes her expectations clear and expects you to stick to them. She does mumble sometimes during lectures but it doesn't really matter because if you show up and do the middle school like assignments you pass.,1
Her assignments and expectations were vague. She could not explain why she gave you certain grades. The class was stressful and she seemed distracted for most of it. She did not give constructive feedback. In some cases her feedback was contradictory. Would not take class from her again.,0
She is the best math professor hands down. Enjoyed her class 100% and she is passionate. Put in your part of the work and she puts in her part of the workeasy A. Do the homework.,1
A lot of snoozy discussions and nap time.,0
Really interested in material and shows it; expects you to do the reading but if you do the class is really interesting; willing to help once you make the first effort,1
Very enthusiastic.. makes the class fun.,1
"Jennifer Jackson is the best professor I've ever had and she cares so much about her students. She's easy going, but she makes you work for your grade. I love her and she is my best friend.",1
"Best professor in Concordia, by far. Papers are well selected (you can actually learn something useful from them). The test uses real code, and he actually reads it and gives feedback, something will make you a better coder. Not the usual ""memorize those usually slides word by word so you can forget it tomorrow"" most lazy professors do.",1
DO NOT TAKE unless required,0
"People either hate him or love him. I was not a fan. He has MAJOR ego issues and likes to put down people. I tried receiving help from him and he just yelled at me for doing so poor in his course. I did what was expected of me - showed up, did homework, and attempted to pass the daily quizzes. Anyways, I wouldn't suggest him to anyone.",0
"Definitely the best professor I've had so far at GV. Attendance is not required,  but go to lecture. I wish I had attended lecture more often because Jim makes it so easy for you to succeed if you do. Important material is made clear in lecture. Exams are basically half  old quiz questions. He offers more than enough extra credit. And he's funny!",1
"This is a difficult subject.  His teaching methods are unclear and the class is left confused.But he is relatively lenient on tests and quizes If you wish to gain experience predominately teaching yourself this subject through homework and the book, take his class. He does try very hard to answer any questions you have.",0
Worst professor I have ever had. That is all I have to say. You are better off taking this class at community college than suffering through ACCT200 with Dr. Debessay.,0
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take this instructor. He gives you 3 quizzes a week and the questions do not make any sense at all. Just about everyone in my class is failing because of his ridiculous quizzes. He's seriously the absolute WORST instructor I have EVER had at Ferris and the community college I went to before. Also very unorganized!!,0
Professor seem like an overall person but when it comes to teaching she needs to be better prepared. While doing examples of new material she often makes mistakes and corrects them midway with unclear explanations of the changes. Good amount of homework on pearson while will require a code $$$ a few quzzies and tests plus final. Find other options.,0
"Répondu à aucun un de mes courriels ou ceux de mes collègues. J'ai eu A+ et me suis très peu présenté en classe. Fiches de lecture et questions d'exam données en avance. Cours relativement facile si l'on met l'effort. Prof tient à ne pas donner plus de précisions qu'il juge nécessaire quant aux évaluations. A part note finale, mauvaise expérience.",0
"Find another professor. Shes vary vague when answering emails whe she answers them. All test are closed book. Instructions are sometimes hard to understand. If you can, take another professor. She complains about the number of emails sent to her and seems to get irritated.",0
Took him for Math 45. You will not pass if you skip class. Each meeting is lecture heavy and he will go through it fast. Make sure to ask questions if you don't get it. Tests are worth a majority of your grade so make sure to study and do study guides.,1
"Unprepared, unclear, unavailable.",0
"This teacher is super nice, she cares about you and youre education as well... I took her late start online class, you will have to read a textbook, and take exams every week, they are easy and obviously open notes/textbook. Easy pass if you get your work done.",1
This was the easiest class I've ever took. A lot of reading but not much else.,1
"Dr. Hedlund is awesome and her class is extremely straight forward. She lays out everything you need in detail, you just need to do the work. Overall easy and interesting.",1
"Hard to hear, her slides don't make sense half the time because she doesn't proof read them. If you ask her something she'll tell you that's too advanced for the class and won't answer.",0
"I took Spanish 101 with this professor. I would highly recommend this class to anyone. She was very understanding, kind, and full of positive energy. If someone didn't turn in their homework she always gave them an extension. Overall she is very passionate about teaching. The homework load wasn't unmanageable. If one tries they will get an A.",1
"I had the honor of having Professor McFaul in the fall. He was extremely insightful and made English enjoyable. He makes writing easier due to the clarity of his instructions. Additionally, I can tell that he truly cared for his students and he created respectful relationships with a lot of us. I would definitely recommend taking his class!",1
"i heard gibson is better than the other professor. a couple papers which she is really just looking for your opinion, 4 exams which arent as bad if you ATTEND THE REVIEW SESSIONS!!!! They will tell you a lot of the material on it. The hardest part for me were the quizzes, you wanna take a couple days to really read and highlight the book.",1
One of the best prof I have come across!!,1
"Super boring, but she really means well. She is passionate about the subject and answers any questions you might have but it's just lectures and lectures. It's only midterm, final, and essay that are really graded. there is assignments and discussion posts, super easy so do them to get that bread!! but easy a (:",0
I really liked that she was willing to help students.,1
"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Professor Hill isn't the best teacher, her class is pretty boring, but her tests are almost all of the clicker questions from class and the online quizzes. If you study and come to class, you will do fine in the course.",0
"Most of your grade is determined by labs that you will spend 20 + hours a week on. Tests were open book, however, they tended to be hard and long. Fontentot calls his students out on everything and gets distracted very easily- making lectures all over the place. I never learned anything from a lecture ever. Take another intro teacher if you can",1
"He is awesome. He copies and pastes homework questions to the test (only 4 assign. & tests total). He seems to be the only one that understands we have jobs, relationships, and other things other than class so he gives you time. He super nice & makes class interesting. Take his class!",1
"Professor Trower is very nice and extremely helpful. I would definitley take a class with him again. I took a developmental course and its pretty much self paced but he helps with every question. He does talk a little fast, lol, but that was not a big issue.",1
"Is way too personal in lectures, treats us as if shes at the psychologist. Gives extra credit but you have to pay $15 for the app. 3 exams are 75% of grade and homework (that she says helps pay her bills) is 25%. Would not take again but it is an easy class if you prefer a teacher who gives out way too much personal information.",0
difficult class and to be successful you have to do a lot of homework and additional tasks. The professor does his best to explain difficult topics so that it becomes clear. The more you practice the better the exam results.,1
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
This class is extremely difficult so if you want to do well you have to put in the time and effort. I would highly recommend going to the tutors if you are struggling. And try not the leave the homework to the last minute because it can take awhile.,0
"I defintely didn't like his class at the beginning of the semester, but it grew on me. Classes are very process-oriented (rather than ""here's a problem. Find the solution""). He will help you if you need it. If you're looking for an easy A, look elsewhere. If you want a better understanding of math, he is way better than his rating on here.",1
"The Atlantis Debate was one of my favorite classes at Colgate- Godwin is a great lecturer and fair grader, and the course topic itself was very interesting",1
"Absolutely terrible. Gives little help on the massive amount of daily homework. Little explanation over topics expected to know without prior discussion. When he does answer a question is extremely condescending. On more than one occasion said ""If you don't understand this then drop the class."" Has knowledge of Spanish but doesn't wish to share it.",0
"absolutely horrible teacher if you need a good grade.  Is not helpful or understanding.  Endless amounts of homework & the tests are near to impossible.  There is a lot of extra credit built in but rare to achieve a high enough grade for it, even if you have a tutor it's still hard.  The toughest grader i have EVER had.",0
"I have taken two classes with Ambassador Hare during my studies at BU. He is by far my favorite professor at BU. Although he assigns a substantial amount of reading, they are relevant and interesting. Highly recommend any class with him.",1
"Others here have said that Dr. Marni is a professor who cares and wants you to do well, which is absolutely true. Unfortunately she is not a skilled lecturer/teacher and she lacks the ability to convey topics to students in an understandable way. Do not take unless you're confident in your ability to self-teach the course through outside reading.",0
"Very fun class. The materials she made us read were interesting. Teaches the material towards the papers, so all you have to do is reguritate that information into a 3-4 page paper. I actually don't mind English now. Easy to look at, too. ;)",1
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
J'ai eu le professeur... Il a essayé le mode: Je ne donne pas de cours.... On a eu 0 cours de sa part... Il commençait le cours à parler d'écologie... Il répétait la même actualité d'un cours à l'autre. Professeur à ne pas prendre.,0
"Dr. derrick knows what he is teaching, but his lectures are very boring. He is not always very clear either. He is nice and approachable.",1
I am generally a very competent student; I have done well with my classes up till now. Ams just does a terrible job explaining things in class. He makes frequent mistakes in lectures. He is very unsympathetic to students who struggle and made me feel like an idiot at office hours. My classmates tell me that he is very unavailable for them.,0
Not the best professor to take. There are a lot of questions on the exams for a short period of time. She gives a lot of readings. The study guides are no help. She's a tough grader.,0
"I have heard good things about this professor before I took this class. He is an awesome person, but this class needs another professor to teach it! Avoid him at all costs for MIS 300. His lectures (which are fun and interesting and very much off topic) on powerpoint DO NOT MATCH what he tests on. Study the text, have a friend sign you in. Easy A!",0
"She tries to help, but she is unclear about directions. When you do exactly what she says you still get an F. Don't take this class unless you want to suffer.",0
"I didn't really learn much in this class but it was still super enjoyable. She's very sweet and caring and will be understanding if you're struggling, she's also super accessible through email and tries to make her class fun whenever she can. She does give a lot of papers though and ""makeup assignments.""",1
"Most boring class, he makes you go to class for attendance & participation which is 15% of your mark. The class is so useless and his accent is so heavy that you can't understand a single word he says. Read the textbook because your mark depends on it. Brock needs a better entrepreneurship prof.",0
end of the semester and STILL no exam grade?! you have got to be kidding me.  One excuse after another. Guy is a complete joke,0
"This course was very intense but is easy to pass if you dedicate a lot of time to the weekly assignments. The weekly assignments tended to be very time consuming, though.",0
Monica is an average prof. She makes good notes but doesn't post her slides online so class is a must. Her tests are pretty straightforward and I did enjoy going to class. She made it interesting. My only complaint is that she takes a long time to grade things so don't expect to get marks back very quick,1
"You will never finish your project: building a compiler called ""MeggyJava"". Its not because is it hard. Its because there is no class diagrams, no easy-to-start code, no IDE for debug and no explicit hint for this compiler. All you can rely on is google resource. If you want to balance all your courses, STAY AWAY FROM CISC672.",0
"This is a HORRIBLE professor! Her tests are way too hard for a principles class, she doesn't allow a formula sheet, will not help you if you go to her office for help. The first test most people scored in the 60's and lower. She completely refuses extra credit or curving grades. This is the second time Ive taken this class...and there will be a 3rd",0
"Great prof. Explains things well. Hardly any homework and tests are easy if you pay attention in class. Also has a great sense of humor. If you can, take him or Samuel for ECON classes.",1
"Really helpful professor, knows what she's talking about and how to explain things for those who are struggling. Make sure you complete the homework and take notes in class. The exams aren't too bad, just don't study at the last minute and you'll pass.",1
"I don't understand his teaching style, no slides just lecture, and he talks fast.",0
She's a real gem. Loves to joke around. Allows you to have a note card as a cheat sheet on tests.,1
I loved this class and this professor. You must to show up to class because he gives attendance points and participation points. He is very good about giving out extra credit and posting stuff that he does in class in case you miss something you can just get it off blackboard. He was very good about extending homework if needed. Highly recommend.,1
His lectures are pretty good and he explains concepts well. Homeworks and exam questions can be tough and thought-provoking at times. He doesn't provide solutions but you can go to his office to discuss. Although not an entirely approachable guy... Exams are open-book and usually similar to questions on old exams. ,1
"She's great honestly, I think she is an amazing Professor. I'm so glad I got the pleasure of meeting her, if you see her name anywhere for classes take it I swear you won't regret it. She's kind, and cares about her students, loves her job and pays close attention to everyone. Take her course !",1
Loved Dr. Wallace. Very helpful.. miss her already :(,1
"She's terrible. Get another professor if you can. She's really nice, but my four year old nephew is a more competent teacher than this woman is. That isn't to say she isn't incredibly knowledgable in her field, but she just can't teach to save her life. She spends way too much time deriving the equations and never does examples with actual numbers.",0
"Caring, and loves to help. Be prepared to do essays but she will help you through the whole thing. Moderately tough but I managed to get B+. Awesome teacher and would take again if I could!",1
"Professor Nia C. Mahallati, J.D.-PROC 5840-Legal Acquisitions Graduate Law course at Webster. Recommend attending all class sessions as tests based on class materials. Very informative class, exceptional professor. Provides extensive coverage of Uniform Commercial Code (Sale of Goods). Highly recommend this graduate law course and professor.",1
"No time management skills. Class went late everyday. Homework wasn't helpful. He is very disorganized. When he taught, it was very rushed and hard to understand. He has little concern about his students. Even if you are in the hospital with kidney stones, he will not let you make up ANY assignments or tests. Worst Professor I've had so far.",0
"Very conservative, and almost only points out viewpoints he agrees with.  Dismissive if differing views are presented in class.  Reading material included text on global warming not being real, and ""all poor people choose to be poor or are disabled.""",1
Hate programming,1
Good luck. Copies notes incorrectly to board that have already been copied incorrectly...,0
"When I first arrived here I took her class and did not pass. She expects a lot of reading and a lot of participating. Although I got a NP, her class was very interesting to me because it had to do a lot with the Latin culture! Honestly don't take her class if you have the chance.   ",0
"Very difficult class.  He expected us to have background in the subject and made us feel like idiots when he would ask questions, because no one in the class was an AD major, so none of us had any idea what was going on.",0
This class was easy. Grade consists of a paper based on volunteer work and a paper based on a movie. I barely went to class and got an A. She's so sweet and willing to help all the time.,1
"Well let's just say he's not user friendly.  I daresay his education leaves a lot to be desired.  Knowledge of content is fine.  Not ready to help though.  Of all the PhD's I've dealt with over the years, he comes across as one of the more arrogant.",0
Barely did any examples in class. All quizzes were exactly from the assigned book problems. Pretty much left you to learn diffeq yourself without much help. Did not write much on the board and ended class way too early to learn anything most days. I learned almost everything in that class solely from going to SI.,0
"Overall, shes not a bad person. Shes a good professor and knows what shes talking about but she expects you to be on her level.... she grades SO HARD. And does not care at all. Ive had way better HDFS professors who actually care and understand that we dont know as much as they do which is why we are taking the class to learn.....",0
"He goes by Will. I personally thought he was a great prof, but his writing assignments are brutal. You aren't going to get an 11/10, I promise you. The highest I got was a 9 or 10. Lots of homework, and makes you participate, but overall solid guy. Really kind and caring; he helps you a lot if you go see him during his office hours.",1
"He can go off topic a lot. Sometimes he doesn't talk about other cultures unless an exam is near. I noticed he talks a lot about Christianity than any other religion, mostly not in a good way. He's passionate in what he loves but barely knows how to teach it. You pretty much have to read the textbook to understand the class.",0
"I literally had no idea what I was doing in this class, and he didn't really teach much about it. You just follow along with his 12 step process and hope you don't get lost along the way or you're going to end up with a terrible grade. He's accessible outside of class but doesn't take time to read the reports students worked all semester on.",1
"I've never had a professor more unwilling to help students than Tisha. In lab when we call her in for help, she refuses to help us find the correct answer and makes us feel dumb for not knowing the answer right away. When you struggle with a problem, it's better to search the internet than ask for her help. I wish she would listen to her students.",0
He is clint Eastwood!,0
"I was in the class until the 2nd week of school, he is a TERRIBLE lecturer, ULTRA confusing, rambles and rants about random things in no order, yells at students in a very rude fashion, does not say when things are due and randomly expects people to have things that he never asked for ready. Absolutely the worst profsr I've had at sdsu, take at CC!",0
"Susan is a charm. She does have strong opinions often that you might disagree with, especially in regard to her attitude toward male students sometimes, but you can get tons from her. Like all people in this industry, she has strong philosophies on various topics that other people in the industry disagree with e.g. story titles (hers are bad).",1
"Amazing professor!  Very well versed in his field.  Lectures are fun, energetic, sometimes a little too ridiculous.  Although, his tests are not easy and you do have to read a few chapters from the book.  Highly recommended.",1
"Had Mr. Knesek for my final class before graduation (MGT 489), and he's an outstanding guy. Always available to talk after class. Tests are tough, but he does give out extra credit to improve your grade. You will be assigned a group presentation and that counts as a big chunk of your grade. Be sure to show up to get points.",1
Ok if you don't come to class your double done he is super harsh and can come off as an a hole but once you get what he wants his class is attainable he grades very harsh and is BIG on correct MLA and citation,0
"Her lectures are very boring, and her low unenthusiastic voice makes it hard to pay attention. Tests are tricky; never really tells you what to study just tells you to expect everything that has been covered so far. Sometimes would be tested on things we didn't learn. You'll have quizzes and assignments done in class also count towards attendance.",0
Terrible choice. All she does is read off the slides and is not willing to help the students when they have questions. She even gets annoyed when you ask questions. She thinks she is funny,0
She is extremely rude and condescending. Almost everything she says is passive aggressive. She gives unnecessary work and is very unclear of what she wants which will lead to lower grades. She is THE WORST communicator! If you ask a question that she doesnt like then she will make you feel dumb and wrong for ever asking. Would not take again!,0
"Professor Lewis is great. His exams are long, but he pulls all his questions from previous exams, which you go over, and other worksheets from class. He explains everything thoroughly, which can get a bit boring if you have good knowledge of calculus. If you do the work an A is definitely possible. Take him if you can.",1
"Amazingly subjective grading, recognize that picking your battles in the beginning may very well save your grade in the end. I.E. don't argue about your first grade, argue about midterm and final. Start on projects immediately, they are very difficult for the time constrains provided.",0
"Make sure that you read the books for his class. He will ask you in-depth questions from the reading materials. If you haven't read, he will definitely humiliate you in front of the whole class!!!",0
"Professor Turkel is just so wonderful. You can tell that she really does care about the well being of her students, and she relates to the class very valuable information. You definitely should attend classes and use the text book in order to prepare for tests. They're not really that hard if you have a prior knowledge of feminist ideals.",1
"Katselis tends to just copy straight from the ECE313 course notes when he lectures. Occasionally, he'll bring his own examples into the mix to try to help, but this class was still difficult for me. He is willing to do review days before exams if time permits. Probability and stats just aren't my thing and his teaching methods helped very little.",0
"Professor Camp seems like a nice guy, but his lectures can be dry, and his quizzes are hard. There's a total of 10 quizzes, and a paper due in the middle of the semester. Little leg room if you miss a question on a quiz. I would not take again.",0
"This professor is honestly so mean. He grades super harsh. i dont know how he has so many good reviews on here. essays are 65% of your grade. he doesnt care how hard you worked on the essay if it isnt where he wants it to be, he will give u bad grade. wants everything written his way. not opened to different writing. considers everything as bad.",0
"THE best proffessor I've ever had. Most of his classes are story telling, but they are all interesting and he has a great sense of humor. Tests are easy; he pretty much tells you exactly what you'll be tested over(short answer, T/F, mult. choice). You need to be in class to know what you'll be tested over but I always looked forward to showing up!",1
"Worst class I've honestly ever taken. Majority of the students failed due to the professor being very boring, off topic constantly, and confused.  Despite the fact that he is nice older gentleman, the stress level within the class IS NOT WORTH IT. Do not take this class unless your willing to cry after seeing your test scores.",0
"Very nice, fairly laid back, but gives an interesting variety of assignments. A bit of a dork, but in a good way",1
Sat through this class the whole semester. Never skipped. Didn't understand one thing and he was not helpful. Very judgmental.,0
"Don't bother emailing him, he doesn't answer any of them. He never comes to class, so last minute, he assigns random things to do online. He doesn't use D2L, so you can't see your grade the whole semester. He uses webcourse, instead, but it never works. Makes fun of every student in the class and doesn't care how mean it is.",0
"The course is not hard at all, as long as you show up to class.",1
I don't recommend this teacher to anyone she is not focused on the success of the students but on showing off her skills that most of students does not understand and she doesn't consider the student's situation even when they have proof and excuse,0
"Professor Nelson is one of the most thoughtful and caring professors out there. For our class, he decided to not give any tests and place the deadline for all assignments in December. He also cut 42 points from our final grade. This may not happen to future students, but it was a rare opportunity, and it helped my GPA a ton. Professor Nelson is a G",1
I like Dr. Dickens a lot. He make classical theory so much easier to understand. He's an easy professor if you take notes. He gives a midterm & a final and gives a study guide a week or two before the exam. Anyone can pass this class with an A or B if they try.,1
"I took his online intro to geography class, easiest class Ive taken. The textbook is pretty useful and not that expensive online, so Id get it. Very straightforward course, make sure you turn in the weekly assignment by sunday night each week and youre set. Super easy diversity credit, hes got a well-organized canvas page.",1
"If you're looking for an easy A, this is it. Just don't miss too many classes or he drops you/ you won't know when assignments are due. No tests at all with only a few assignments, just do them and turn them in and you'll get an A. Lets you leave early almost every class and you watch movies frequently.",1
"Frey is very awkward. She reads from her notes in a cold tone. It is not clear she understands everything she is saying. She does not answer questions well. Then she insists we work together on simple clicker questions. I strongly recommend you take someone else for Gen Chem. Overall the course is good, but she is not.",0
"Oh my god !!!! dont even get me started. He is taking up a graduate class and has no respect for the students. Does not answer questions... does not listen to anything students say... easily offended for no reason... gets defensive,,, does not respect others point... its his way or the highway... if you get him, RUN!! and don't look back.",0
class makes me want to change me major.,0
Very opinionated and rude. Does not care what he says. Makes you feel horrible after leaving his class,0
"Not much things from lectures got correct on exam. I literally recorded his lecture. If you fall behind people in areas where others did well, you will regret it. Don't waste time to do better than others. Don't confuse him on projects by sorting things differently from others. He wouldn't ask questions and makes bad judgement. No one copies exams",0
"-Has a strong accent which can be hard to understand at times - tries to explain as best he can, nice guy and willing to answer questions - honestly would not take any of his classes again - notes are super import if you dont take any you will fal",0
"Nice guy who is clearly passionate about the subject. Midterm, final, reading journal, participation, paper (2000 words), and group presentation. Go to his office for feedback on papers/tests for help. Participate and read because some of the material was confusing. Do not wait to do reading journals because it's awful trying to finish them later",1
Ms. Walkrt is the best teacher I have had at Moorpark College. She is hilarious and so sweet! Her class is actually fun and talking to her is so easy. She is very flexible on turn in dates but don't make it a habit. I hope I get her for my other business class as well!,1
"Readings everyday.  Paper every 3-4 weeks. He never gave me an A on any paper only A-'s.  He is pretty funny but if you did not read the book at all you are screwed for the final because it is in detail.  100 question final wmult choice with only A,B,C,  fill in the blank, and tf.  Sign in sheet for attendance grade.  He's a nice guy overall tho.",1
GREAT LADY!!!!! So helpful you won't believe it. More than a teacher she felt like my friend throughout every counseling session. She really has an awesome and helpful personality.,1
"Luigi's teaching skills are perfect. Glad to have him for my MATH. In class, he solved all of my questions even if I couldn't express it properly or the problems were not really related to the lecture (that's the best of him, very approachable). Outside of class, you will see who is the BUSIEST MAN on earth.",1
Professor Knott gives good feedback but when she gets frustrated she lets it out on her students. She is a tough grader. I like her personality a lot and you can tell that she cares but I just wish she didn't grade like everyone was becoming an English major. She doesn't realize that people take this class because it's a requirement for an AA.,0
Wouldnt have passed w/o my smart boyfriend. Lectures are just him making something complicated when it is simple & he only lectured once or twice a week. I hardly attended class. Only days of quizzes/exams. Gives many assignments that are tedious & not helpful. You are better off getting tutored at the learning center than going to his class.,0
This guy was terrible. He never explained anything during the lectures. The midterms were ridiculous.,0
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"I took 5 classes with Heth, and would 10/10 recommend. Take Greek!",1
"Took BLAW 200 online. There is weekly assignments (like 5) and a weekly quiz. Almost everything on the quiz is from the lecture notes she posts or from the assignments, so if you do them, it's quite simple. I've emailed her questions and she usually takes 1-2 days to respond. ",1
"Homework will help, but make sure to do reviews. He is difficult to understand and not clear on explaining some topics. I read and did examples in the book and still was confused. The final is extremely difficult. Make sure to study and do reviews and extra practice.",0
"The class is online but its more like a live class than an online one because you have to watch it at a specific time and you interact with other students. If you do the readings, pay attention to the lectures, and take notes you can do well on the quizzes and get an A. The lectures are really interesting so its not hard to pay attention.",1
"Dr. Napolitano was a great professor to have. Although his tests were hard, he really teaches the material very well. The background that you need for this class is very poorly taught and he makes sure we strengthen the fundamentals. A lot of deep level learning.",1
"BEST TEACHER EVER! This is a difficult class that involves TONS of memorization, but he uses notes handouts for study tools and everything comes straight off of the notes. He's funny, easy to get along with, and knows a lot! It's hard, but definitely worth taking!",1
"She's a nice teacher, but does get mad/annoyed when questions are asked or if you don't know the answers during class. She is always available during office hours. She can be very condescending when going over problems in class.",1
"This is the type of professor that will make you question how the hell did this guy get hired. Seriously he is the most laziest incompetent professor I've ever had he can't accomplish the most basic concepts of his job. I caught him copying his tests from online websites instead of making his own, which is a very unfair assessment. Don't take him!",0
"Attendance was not mandatory so I started to skipped class all the time, but I wouldn't recommend doing that. I missed a lot of material and he gives ""labs"" during class that are graded but you won't know about them unless you are in class. Used mymathlab so a lot of the hw in online. very helpful in class and kinda funny, not boring at all",1
"Her tests are difficult because she's very specific, but as long as you study the review questions and read the textbook readings you will be fine.  Class material is on exams, don't skip class. As someone who's not super into feminism, I was actually surprised at how open minded and unbiased she was. She's good at accepting opposing opinions.",1
"I found that Professor Smith was very disorganized. It felt like he didn't have a solid plan for the semester. He's not the best at lecturing, but if you go to him and talk one on one, the feedback and help you'll get is very good. Definitely not a professor I would take again, but he's a very nice guy.",0
stay away!! he is a really nice guy but he doesn't teach AT ALL. Unless you are in his group (there are 3) you get taught by the TA or LA's and they suck. He doesn't give a straight answer so you're basically teaching yourself or learning from the mistakes of other people which only makes everything more confusing.,0
"Mr. Carson was a nice man, however as a professor he would often treat us like freshmen in high school. The first 3 weeks were about MLA. The class became tedious and almost painful to go to. He would provide good feedback on papers, however there were ALOT of them. I liked him just not his class. He said attendance was mandatory but never checks.",0
"If you are going to take BIO 140, find another professor. She may be very knowledgable about Biology, I don't know, but her lectures are pointless because she reads right off the powerpoint without going in depth and relies on PASS sessions for students to actually learn. Only useful thing in this class is the extra credit.",1
"I love Pereira, her energy is great and she tries really hard. Her tests are not hard as long as you come to class, read the book & take notes when she talks. She really wants everyone to understand. Only complaint is her TA CJ, he grades like he has a PhD & talks down to students like we're children. He grades the majority of all work.",1
He is extremely cocky and can make you feel like an idot if you are unprepared for class and ask a question. once you get used to his personality you will do fine as long as you STUDY.. this seems to be true for all lab bio type classes though so as long as you put in the time you will do fine. i recommend his class just dont get on his bad side!,0
"It depends on personality type if you will like this professor. My class is a bunch of introverts, and she expects all of us to be awake and bubbly like her at 9am, and criticizes us every class period for not talking. Also, it didn't matter how long I spend on assignments, the grade is always a B. Make sure to do well on tests if you want an A!",0
"He teaches the material in a very abstract way instead of being straightforward. Tests are 60% of your grade, then only puts 8-10 questions on tests. There's no multiple choice. Puts question marks on tests instead of corrections. Homework is only 10% in total. Lectures are not recorded and does not post notes online. Uses same wording as textbook.",0
"I had her for brit lit I. She is good and very funny. Keeps class interesting with examples and such. She has interest in the subject. At first I didn't like that she made us do study guides but they were actually beneficial!Overall, I would recommend taking this professor if you had an opportunity to!",1
"Professor Willet has a great sense of humor and gets directly to the point in her lectures, which is to your advantage! the tests arent difficult and are directly from her lectures. She doesnt require a textbook, only 3 cheap books! She is a funny, caring, understanding teacher, 10/10",1
HIlariously bad,0
"THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY A. He makes terrible jokes and the class is not interactive. He never explains a specific topic but gives out long random examples that are not really helpful or explanatory. Operations Mgmt is an interesting subject, said everyone but I hate it because of him. You'll need a textbook that he wrote and is available for $90 ",0
"Pretty straight forward class, Prof. Edwards is knowledgeable and tries to make sure everyone understands the material. There's online homework almost every week that can be tough. There's an exam every 3-4 chapters and it's 6-7 problems; they're just like the stuff you do in class so if you pay attention, you should be able to do it no problem.",1
"This teacher in her online class is relatively easy, there is just a TON of work that she gives out every week. Although I took the 8-week course, so maybe that's why it seemed so heavy, but it's easy work, just busy work. All the tests are online and easy to find and the book has all the answers. An easy A for your fine arts credit.",1
"Just horrible. Confusing, goes off on rants, awkward. I wouldn't recommend this professor to anyone. I can't believe there's such a horrible professor at USI.",0
His lectures are really dull and he is very unclear in what he wants on his essays. He asks many difficult strange questions to the class and expects people to know the answer. I would not recommend. ,0
"The course work is just watching a movie weekly and discussion boards. What I don't like is how she has us post everyday in the discussion and have a ""conversation"" with other classmates. It seems ridiculous to do that because it's just about a movie, then we have to also participate in class. There is just a lot of participation involved.",0
"He is a great guy and a super genius, but every time I try to pay attention to him, his English accent catches me and all I do is listen to the accent and I forget to learn!  Whenever he presents lectures, however, most of his slides are irrelevant.  His exams contain a section called ""concept questions"" which are the most difficult part.",1
Prof Moiles is nice but the class itself is quite boing. It is very lecture heavy and just not that exciting.,0
"Weighed way too heavily on the Aleks program. No in-class instruction, aside from answering students' questions one on one, which was not always helpful or clear. Didn't really teach, only intervened when she deemed necessary.",0
"Professor taught nothing, just assigned textbook readings and you have to purchase the outdated textbook. Quizzes are based on some outdated incorrect information. Learned a lot from the course but not because of the professor. Did not answer emails on time, if he answered them at all. Unclear guidelines for assignments. Would never take again.",0
You really will work for your grade more than any other class honestly. Try Not to take her class if you have a lot of other classes as well her class requires a lot of time. Studying is mandatory as well good luck youll need it.,0
"By far the worst professor I have had in my academic career. Avoid this professor at all costs. He even gets on here and makes up his own post saying he's a great teacher. A complete shame to education, he is a professor for the occupation and not a passion for students.",0
I took this prof for a second time because I thought he was so good.  He does seem more committed to the class this time.  It seems like he is getting harder for the specialization HR classes.,1
No homework and attendance isn't mandatory. She does an ok job at teaching the material but the tests have a bunch of weird application material that she never covers. You have to be good at math or have a previous calc background to do well in this class. She takes up time ranting about the american education system and she's hard to understand.,0
"I don't have words to describe how upset I am with McMurry. Just save yourself the unnecessary aggravation and don't take her. Ever. She's having an exam the Thursday before finals week, and then our final's the Tuesday of finals week. And the final is all new material. This is just one out of many crazy things she's done. Do. Not. Take. McMurry.",0
The single hardest and most rewarding thing I've done at KU. I apply dense feminist theory from this class to real life. We had a group project on human trafficking policies that we literally presented to her personal friend at the Department of State. Brilliant professor and person. My friend cried in her office hours and she was nice about it.,1
"I had this professor 11 years ago but she was the most stimulating and dynamic professor I had in undergrad. She got the students to come up with ideas in class which led on to the conclusions she wanted to make, always encouraging creativity on the part of the students.",1
"Her lectures are unfocused and you MUST go to class in order to get the information needed to pass. She is enthusiastic about it, but her voice tends to be monotone/soothing so try not to fall asleep...Good luck....",0
"If you don't like being lectured, then this is a good teacher to take. He lectures for about ten minutes of class and then gives you activities to do with a partner. His tests were a little challenging but fair. He was always willing to meet outside of class. He used a lot of real world applications that were interesting and engaging.",1
All like an amateur writing workshop.  Didn't get much out of it.  She was soometimes nice and helpful and sometimes full of herself.,0
"Dr. Lim was easily one of the best professors I ever had when I went to John Carroll University. I had him for EC 302 in the Spring of 2019 and he taught me so much which I have used since then. He is always available after hours for questions. He sets clear expectations in his grading. If you learn how the topics relate to each other, you will pas",1
She WILL help you become a better speaker and her assignments will challenge you to think outside the box. She doesn't critique too hard but you will have to work for that A. She will straight up tell you that she has no problem dropping and failing people who don't show up or do the work. One midterm and final.,1
"Ball the BEAST! He is an excellent professor and challenges you well. He has actually made me a better communicator and has helped me greatly with interview prep. I love his demeanor, he definitely breaks the mold of your typical Fordham professor. His class is an easy A as long as you do the work and don't cross him.",1
"He was nice in class but the course was very poorly run. Labs were terrible, no one would help you and the TAs had no idea what was going on either. Tests were all written questions some intentionally made more difficult. He also wasn't at his own office hours so...",0
"I have always loved Philosophy so this might make me a bit more biased. I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Vician's class, however, I have to agree that he has a tendency to get off topic...so it seems. I believe the stories he tells has relevance to the different methods of reasoning that we have covered. I loved this class!!!!",1
"To say she's at least 50 or so, she is really hot.. Like shoes too...",1
"If you are in a sorority, fraternity or want to have any other kind of a social life; do not take her. Her class is very test heavy and if you do not have a strong background in chemistry and biology you will not pass. You will be studying for this class every day. If you dont, you fail. Her test questions are tricky. 5 tests including the final.",0
"Dr. SInha is a very nice lady, but her lectures are poorly organized. Not just her, but the prof she co-lectures with. The tests are similar to lecture, but you must read the book and truly study from the BIS labs to do well. She needs to work on organization and making points clearer. I don't recommend taking her class.",0
I took Modern Fiction with him and it was quite possibly the worst English class I've ever taken at SJU. All he does is lecture. People fell asleep in my class more than once. Not to mention his grading is terrible. He would write 'good idea' comments on one person's paper and bad on another even though the ideas were the same. Avoid!,0
"Teacher is fair in grading.  Some homework collected, 3 tests, and a BIG group project.  Her notes aren't very clear even if you listen so the text is a must.",0
Prof. Mohun is a very nice person.  However her class can be pretty boring.  She never takes attendance during lecture so i never went however there is weekly sections that are attendance based.  Overall a pretty easy class.,1
DR. K RULES!! Extremely intelligent guy. I learned a lot. I loved it-of course you gotta read. If you don't like reading I suggest not taking him. In the end it is worth it though. Super relaxed atmosphere. Just do your work and you'll get a good grade. He's the man. One of my favorite teachers.,1
"Lot of writing, most the exams and quizzes are just essays but overall a really easy class. Have to read two books but I just read the sparknotes and got an A.",1
Worst professor to take online! I have never struggled so much in a class.,0
"Gives totaly subjective quests that r impossible 2 find specific answers 2, yet she wants u to somehow manufacture multiple citations frm the text 2 support ur position. Don't think she even reads the Bb responses b/c she repeatedly gives canned responses that ""you need to summarize and give personal examples"" even when they've already been given.",0
There's a ton of homework. Quizzes are pretty easy. You need to put a lot of time into this class if you want to pass. I do that and I'm on the edge of failing still. He makes his tests very hard!! He's a nice guy overall however so I can't hate him. I just wish he would not make his tests impossible to pass.,0
Best Professor Ive taken so far!!! She really caring and she helps her student to succeed not only in the class room but also outside of class.,1
"One of the most frustrating class I have ever took. He is no doubt a tough grader. There is A LOT of reading to this class, along with essays due after it. He takes attendance and MLA format really seriously, so check over your work multiple times to his liking. He comes off as imtimidating at first, but he is caring towards his students.",1
"This class literally sucked the life out of me. It required only 4 tests and 4 papers. However the papers are intense and cover a ton of material- over 200 textbook pages plus multiple videos, lectures, and powerpoints. Each of my papers was over 10 pages and truly required all of the 4 weeks you have to complete the assignment. Take another prof!",0
"I never paid attention in lectures so as long as you do well on the responses/writing assignments, your grade will be fine. No exams but there is also one 5 minute presentation at the end of the semester. She definitely doesn't grade the writing easy but if you are a decent writer and put in effort you can definitely get an A.",0
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! take her if you can! This class as a whole was so interesting and you learn so much about yourself. There's three 2 page papers in the class and only 3 exams. The exams are a little difficult, but the papers are pretty easy, so it weighs out. Make sure you buyrent the textbooks because they're crucial in this course!",1
"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again. The content of the final assignment was entirely around coding in R when the there has been literally no content covering R until that point. An absolute embarrassment.",0
"I don't know why Professor Chen has such a low rating. She is willing to help with anything needed and really shows that she cares if you are willing to go to her office hours! You definitely have to pay attention, read the book, and attend class if you want to pass. She tries to crack jokes during her lectures. There is 3 exams and a group paper",1
He's a great professor! but get ready to be there the whole time with little to no breaks. The work load is super super heavy. You will have huge timed exams. The Essay is super hard and he does not give a clear idea of what you need to write about.,1
Easily one of the worst professors Ive ever had. He was completely inaccessible outside of class & routinely told my class to not ask him questions via email. He never stayed on topic in class & gave tests that were heavy on info he never touched on. My class only had 2 exams & a final project so an A was impossible if you did badly on one thing.,0
"Professor Urbina is a very smart man. I personally like his methods of teaching because he lectures a lot but he lectures only in Spanish. So not only are you picking up more on the language without the worries of grammar, but the subject material is very eye opening and informative. Be ready to read a lot and listen a lot.",1
"The tests are made to take more than the allotted time, he is extremely vague, and does not post grades until the last minute, and he NEVER posted homework or participation grades.",0
"This class consists of 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. The TAs graded the first paper super hard, but were much more lenient on the second. Midterm and final are really easy. Professor Kim is very clear during lecture. I recommend taking notes on your laptop instead of writing them down because he talks really fast!",1
"Scheiniger is honestly a great guy, just make sure you're ready to work. His homework assignments take a long time and he's pretty tough with grading them. That said, Schleiniger is one of the friendliest professors I've had at UD. If you need help, don't be afraid to ask. His scheduled help sessions were great and probably saved my grade.",1
Unorganized and no concept of time management - lost grade book for some of the semester - I never knew how I was doing during the semester.  I spent 1 5 weeks feeling frustrated and confused and bored.,0
"This professor, doesnt teach anything about English. He goes and explains History. Nothing to do with English!",0
"For anyone saying that Professor Fernandes is ""hard"" probably took PSY 100 looking for an easy A, but that's just not how this classroom is run. She actually cares about the material and cares that her students actually leave her class knowing the material. Of all the adjunct professors I've taken in the psych department, she is by far the best.",1
"He's a really good lecturer and is very clear and passionate. He fits a lot of info into an hour so don't miss the lectures! He does have a point of view that is practically immovable so if you disagree, be prepared to have a strong logical and intellectual debate. Take the class if you have a passion for it because you have to work for it",1
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant professor. He is very down to earth, and is willing to help if you come by his office. He's a tough essay grader. However, if you take good notes and participate, an A isn't impossible.",1
"Dr. Galileo is truly passionate about teaching and his research. This class is a lot of material and there is no curve either. However, if you memorize the slides, you should be able to receive an A. He is a really talented professor! Take this class :)",0
Be prepared to have Lab and bookwork ready by test date. She does give twothree chapters in one day. Does not review before test. You have to download labwork grades or email but if emailed sometimes you get a zero. ,0
"I like Alan Fox as a person. He's very cool and lectures are interesting and I feel that I've learned a lot. The material can be difficult to understand and when I have gone to him for clarification he doesn't really clear it up, more questions why I don't get it. The midterm was three essays, kinda hard. Interesting subject, hard class. ",0
"Jo is a GREAT professor! Yes, she expects you to actually read the plays, and yes, she is demanding in her expectations of your writing, but as an English major what do you expect? She is very fair, and I would recommend you turn in early drafts for her comments (always a good idea w/any prof!). I learned a TON in this class, and I loved Dr Miller!",1
"Amazing prof!!! Lots of lectures but very easy to follow (put on 2x speed). He goes really slowly and hes really easy to understand. Gives past exams and answers, practice quizzes and answers, doesnt use lockdown browser for exams. Super nice guy who just wants everyone to succeed. Love this man",1
"Whoever said Maria isn't respectful must be talking about someone else. I've taken her 3 times and she Is SO intelligent. Depending on the class you take, she is so educated  on topic & makes the class fun. Definitely assigns a lot of work but it's relevant... she is willing to compromise with class sometimes if we aren't happy with assignments.",1
"Mr. Tyson is not a very good Political Science teacher. He is not very helpful and will not communicate clearly with his students. His lectures are EXTREMELY boring and there is little chance to get your grade up in this class. I think there are 4 tests including the final, and a few quizzes. DO NOT. DO NOT take him. You can do so much better",0
"He really cares about student success and was very accommodating. He took the time to explain concepts to me whenever I had questions, and this class has been very pleasant. Definitely an amazing professor!",1
his accent is thick and you can't always understand him. 5 mini tests that are near impossible. the first test isn't bad but the second is a slap to the face. final exam is in the absolute last time period. lectures are boring and mandatory,1
"She's a nice and kind woman, but she's very stubborn and not really willing to see other views. If you write exactly what she wants you to (meaning, agreeing with her opinion) you'll do pretty well, but if you try to challenge any of her views, expect to get hit hard. Very unclear grading criterion.",0
the worst professor i've ever had. he's very knowledgable in the subject but he doesn't know how to teach it. he rambles and often tells us that things are going to be on the exams and then they aren't. he comes across as rude and is not accessible to students.,0
She is the worst yet!! She teaches way to fast and expects you to keep up. Mind you if you have been out of a classroom for a few years I recommend you take a few remedial courses as she will assume you know what steps to take and what she is talking about. She grades hard and rushes through the homework and rushing the lecture. The worst by far!!!,0
"He does utilize mymathlab for homework. He offers a ""review"" day before a test. He teaches at a high school level, homework is undergrad level, and tests are masters level. He is helpful when you go to his office to speak with him but I had trouble grasping his lecture methods. Take the time to talk with him and see what you need to do to get the g",0
"Not hard but not helpful.  All you do is read slides all class.  Tests are the only thing counted for grade 20Q multiple choice and he curves. Didn't make us ""present"" our final project either just turn it in. All in All just an ok prof",0
"Great guy, knows what he's talking about and loves what he does. The tests are hard, and he grades hard too, I am usually a high B-A student and this class was tough. I didn't hate it though",1
"i took it over the summer, it was fairly easy and we  learned alot, plus he's a cool guy!  it's a really great class.",1
"very hard to pass this class. took this class on her recommendation and was failed for the semester on the first paper. Her instructions on assignments were hard to understand, very hard to get extra help when needed. overall seemed very disinterested to be teaching this class.  Would not take her again or recommend her as a teacher to take. ",0
His test is hard and never test on anything from homework!,0
"Shaw is an awful teacher. She might know about dogs, but she is a ridiculous and unfair grader, with unclear expectations. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. I love dogs and she made learning about them unbearable.",0
"My favorite professor ever! his class is never boring, he knows his stuff, and he's considerate towards his students. If steve martin was an agronomist this would be him. I can't tell you enough how much I love being around this guy.",1
"Dr. Smith was a wonderful professor for Group Dynamics!  Her course was challenging.  Her lectures were never boring, and she was always open to discussion.  The books were interesting and enjoyable to read.  Group Dynamics is a big help for group projects in other classes.  Take your time on the tests and really think about the questions!",1
He is my only B in college. Ochem2 is a breeze compared to this class. He is literally the worst.,0
"The midterm and final were comprised of exactly the same questions that were on the reviews, so if you study those well, you'll ace the tests. It's a difficult class that requires outside research if you want to make an A.",0
"Very bad. The class is supposed to be aboud culture, but she ends up teaching mostly history. Is unclear, lectures have little to do with exam material. Without discussion sections, the exams would be utterly impossible. Accent sometimes hard to understand (she's Polish) and rambles in lectures on nonrelated material.",0
Very few grades. Lots of reading. Long and boring lectures. Attendance isnt mandatory and he does not have homework but quizzes and test at the end of the semester and mid term. Some lectures are interesting but not all the time. Just boring majority of the time,0
"Literally the most boring professor ever. Everyone falls asleep in class and the absurd amount of homework you have with the most extra essay criteria is really annoying. If you really need the class for Hub, it's good to take because the class is not hard. It's just a lot of work and wanting to cry listening to his lectures.",0
"Prof Dewan is a great example of why people are leaving EMU. He is a professor who has difficulty explaining concepts due to his thick accent and lack of knowing how to reword things. He asked a student if they understood what he was teaching, the student said no and dewan said well theres nothing I can do for you. Very unwilling to help students.",0
he was horrible. he never wanted to help his students. I went to him for extra help saying i sent him an email about it and instead of helping me he made me look up the email i sent. Did not care about you or your grade. i warn you not to take him.,0
Wonderful teacher. Learned so much. Clearly he is passionate about the subject and shares that with the class. A real gem for canadian jazz - hope more people get to benefit from his great knowledge.,1
"He does not communicate no matter how many times you email him. He will also give you points off but not tell you why and tell you your essay was written well. Very unorganized, not clear when things are due.",0
"Horrid, run for your life!  He loves the smart kids, but thinks those who aren't good at chemistry are destined to be stupid.  Insulting in class if you ask a less than brilliant question.  Very hard to talk to outside of class.  Seriously, he's an ass. Take someone else.",0
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
"Missad is by far the best professor I've ever had. Show up to class, participate, listen to instructions, hand in homework in time, and you have an A for this class in the bag. She is very quick at responding to emails, and appreciates a student who is not afraid to ask questions. Warmly recommend this professor. She's very intelligent & caring!",1
"This class was so informational, I learned a lot. We discussed current events and he gives quizzes almost every class which was very easy all you have to do was read.",1
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
"I had over 100 credit hours when I took her class and it was enough to make me consider dropping out. It was the worst college experience I've ever had. You'll pour days of your life into the project and be proud of the result. But regardless, she'll be offended by your efforts and tear every piece you turn in to shreds with no guidance provided.",0
"Worst professor to have... EVER. Labs? Good luck, the instructions given are NOT clear which also follows his unclear feedback which is also NOT accurate. For coding, your program may work but if not his way you'll be lucky with a D",0
Really kind and is open to helping students. Weekly readings and at home 2 question quizzes. Midterm and final are very clear and open note. Definitely a top choice for a teacher.,1
"Really did not enjoy his class. Made me feel dumb at times or would skip me when I needed help. Sometimes he was okay and nice. Has favorites. Wish I took his course with someone else, his teaching style wasnt helpful for me.",0
He was an amazing teacher.  He does not baby anyone in the class but treated us like the adults we are.  Notes are very important but can be found in book too.   his writing is horrible but easy to adjust to.  Overall one of the best in the department.  I will for sure be taking more of his classes.,1
"She is very unclear and doesn't get to the point most of the time when she's talking about topics, she takes forever to grade basically anything, she was absent for every exam so if you had any questions on a test question you were basically SOL. Also she changed the syllabus 5 or 6 times throughout the year so good luck planning out anything.",0
Average professor and average class. Do the homework and you will be fine for 111.,1
Okay honestly not the best. Teaches trig and I've never struggled so hard in a math class than when I took her. Bad at emailing back. Class average for one of the test was a 37%. Don't take her,0
"Respect when others are giving their speech. Have your speech ready and just try your best. I was terrified to take this class, but overall it was a great experience. He truly is a great proffesor.",1
This professor grades as if literature is your major. I took his summer class and his expectations were too high for the time allotted for our assignments. He expects you to know the depth of what has taken him over 5 years to be familiar with. ,1
"Mr. Cage grades subjectively,  doesn't teach the curriculum and is sarcastic. He is unclear and is easily the worst teacher at ccbc.",0
He is the worst professor I have had at GV. He made me feel dumb when I asked questions and did not help me at all. I ended up having to teach myself. He does not teach and gives worksheets on material we don't know and then grades it on accuracy.,0
"Professor Benitt spends more time discussing UFO's and Big Foot, than he does teaching Astronomy.  He is obsessed with neatness and completely irrational.  His teaching style is haphazard and confusing.  He is all over the board, which makes it hard to copy down notes. My notebook looked like a treasure with all of the arrows I had to draw.",0
On tests he chooses the most difficult problems and tries to make his tests as hard as possible when they shouldn't be. His tests are much much harder than the homework and quizzes. He makes his tests as hard as possible.,0
"Wasn't clear with the other instructor on what she wanted in answers. Marks the whole question wrong if you leave out one Sig Fig or don't label something. She isn't easy to talk to, every time I tried to have a conversation with her she put the blame back on me. Wasn't able to do problems the way I was taught in High School without it being wrong.",0
Had her for Voice and Movement last semester before I graduated. She is awesome and funny and she really cares about all her students. I wish I could take her class again,1
"Great teacher, give this man a raise! Luigi Bless!",1
He is the sweetest man! He is so interesting and tells a lot of stories to relate the subject. His test are not super easy but it is not hard to make a good grade in his class. His attendance policy really helps some people..it can either make or break your grade. He is such a nice guy but he is retired so only teaching every now and then...hurry a,1
She is a great teacher!! I am taking more of her classes. Attendance isn't mandatory but it's good to go because the exams are easier to write if you have been going to class.,1
"Wasn't sure at first but honestly this professor really cares and loves his field of study. He has his own sense of humor, loves poetry, vocabulary, writing. Book is used so buy it, papers are easy, JUST DO THEM don't let them pileup. Trust me. He just needs to work on how he connects with the class. It was very boring. He's cool one on one though.",1
"this lady is a nutter, shes ruddy mad. she makes prof snape seem nice and easy. she buts me in one ****er of a mood",0
Shes amazing,1
Didn't learn much. Wasted time about out class topics.,0
"She's horrible, she doesn't even lecture in class, she just shows you pictures from the textbook and explains them.",0
"All I can say is: RUN! She does NOT give out A's, I did all assignments perfectly and still got a B. She literally takes off points for no reason. If English is not your first language, you are screwed because she expects a perfect grammar essay on nutrition EVERY week. She seems to enjoy ruining lives. She is the WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!",0
hard to understand very opinionated and low opinion of united states inconsistant use of book **Check your test answers many of her test answers are wrong** hard to understand did not have high opinion of older students refused to explain questions or give examples  TAKE A DIFFERENT TEACHER IF POSSIBLE,0
She is way too excited--treats her 101 class like high school students. Too much work for an intro-level 101 class. Doesn't know how to discipline a class either.,0
"At first, the lectures are intimidating as you try to keep pace w/ Prof. Raphael's chatter.  Moreover, Prof. Rapheal asks questions that are easy to catch students off guard.  His attempts at humor are awkward but all in good fun.  Not exactly receptive to questions but a nice guy nonetheless. Exam was fair, if not easy and straightforward.",1
"Dr. Newton makes you think and challenges you but this class was very fun. I actually felt myself learning, which is rare. Newton is also my advisor and honestly is an all-around great guy.",1
"This class was a little harder than what I expected. The quizzes are a little difficult and the final is hard, but he gives you chances for extra credit. The workouts are awesome and you really feel like your working out. This professor really knows his stuff and he makes the class very fun, informative and interesting.",1
"Impossible to understand, homework is way too long and his exams are too long as well so it is may be hard to finish. That being said if you can teach yourself, the concepts of the course aren't too difficult so if you are good at math and can teach yourself go ahead and take the class, he's a lenient grader",0
"A very good professor. He cares about the students, he is fair, he presents the material in a clear way. Absolutely recommended!",1
Posts all annotated lectures on Carmen.  Very clear and easy to understand lectures. Very kind and willing to help students. Goes over homework problems in class. He will curve. He definitely prepares you for exams. Posts practice tests. Fair grader. Will provide 1 sheet of notes for you for tests. I would absolutely take a class with him again.,1
Dr. Mark was absolute hell to deal with. This courseload is beyond ridiculous and she is not understanding about you being in another classes that require your time. She does not respond to emails and if she does she is beyond rude to you and does not offer any help. There are major projects due each week. Her husband also attends every class.,0
"I signed up for Spanish Conversation, I got spanish reading comprehension and two minute speech memorization.  Not ONCE did we have a class where we actually practiced conversing in spanish, maybe she forgot to read the title of her course.  She is disrespectful to students and acts as if she is a middle school teacher.",0
"Dr. Arnold was wonderful. She had great passion for the material. Though she wasn't always perfectly clear, she was excellent with clarifying when necessary. She also had a keen interest in students exploring their interests, and so was very flexible with projects. As long as students were eager to learn and willing to work, she was wonderful.",1
Mo is great. He loves jazz band and it definitely shows in his teaching style. All you need to do is attend all concerts and rehearsals and you will get an A. A great guy overall.,1
One of the worst teachers I have ever taken. If you ask what's on the test he'll tell you everything. I used everything under the sun to study and did horrible in class. Lab was okay he was more of a person in lab than in lecture. DO NOT TAKE HIM unless its your only class and you can memorize the book!,0
I took astronomy in high school and attended almost every lecture for the class but it was still extremely challenging. Reading the chapters and taking notes in lecture was a breeze and I felt I understood everything until I would get my tests back! Very nit-picky grader for an introductory class and tests basically make up your entire grade.,0
"Pretty good teacher, if a little dry. Use textbook a lot, buy online version or physical copy, not both. Homework is easy and he drops 2 worst. Tests aren't too bad, mostly multiple choice. Takes attendance quizzes every now and then, free credit as long as you go to class.",1
"Dr. Nochera is not a very good professor. Her online lecture videos were nothing like the exams at all. Her lectures are just her rambling and she is not very good at explaining. There is barely any work to be graded, so if you don't do good on the exams you're basically screwed.",0
He teaches the material well although sometimes he can ramble and it can get a bit confusing. Take notes of what he writes on the board and says!!! there's 3 tests which has some fill in the blank questions so make use of the study guide he provides! tests have a 3 page essay portion. Lots of reading! But you can get a good grade if you work for it,1
"You will have 1 daily oral question to answer. Get ready to get negative points. Questions on the books picture boxes show you what on my subject understanding? You'll have 3 exam with 100 questions. We had more than 10 people to drop the class on 1st exam. Dont bother on extra credit. He is rude, stupidly strict & stubborn. DONT TAKE HIM.",0
AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word. He makes you read the chapter in the book and then you are allowed to revive lecture videos afterwards which I think is ridiculous. This is honestly the worst class Ive taken and I regret doing it online as well.,0
I would not recommending ever taking this professor. his notes are like deciphering code and lectures do not help at all. reads off notes and extremely hard to follow. gives no examples. if he doesn't like you he will fail you. don't show up late. don't leave early. don't fall asleep in class. does not explain any of the material. DO NOT TAKE CLASS,0
"Literally the most I have ever learned in a class. It is a lot of work, lots of readings and quizzes every week, but it pays off. He made me such an effective writer and he just makes you really diligent in your coursework. If you put in the work, you will be able to succeed!",1
"She gives LOTS of extra credit which all goes towards your upcoming test, she's great for that; however, she is not great at answering questions in my opinion. There always seems to be this secrecy around everything. She'll give you a study guide, but she won't give you a key. She tends to be very curt when answering questions in class.",1
"Christina is both a great professor and a great person. She is really passionate about urbanism. For the class, participation is the key to an A. There is a midterm, 4 one-page papers, a map project and a research paper (all with clear expectations and guidelines), readings are important for the midterm and participation, so you'd better read.",1
"His lectures are very interesting. I easily get bored durint long periods of conversations, but not in his class. Especially since everything he says is important, and will likely be on his tests. Many students don't appreciate his hard lectures and exams, but I did because it made it that much more worth it in the end. I learned alot!",1
"Honestly, I really expected more from this Professor given that he has really good reviews but Im really disappointed. His lectures were clear for the most part but the hw/tests werent always representative to the lectures. He throws curve balls. He doesnt really reply to emails either. This class was not really enjoyable whatsoever:(",0
Montero assigns a lengthy amount of reading through out the course. class notes are not  very important in her 101 class but reading is a must and she only uses 2 text books for her course.,1
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
"This was one of the most difficult classes I have ever taken. His lectures are super engaging but he doesn't stop to review/clarify concepts that might have been forgotten. There are so many lecture quizzes and lab quizzes which can be both beneficial and harmful. His tests are super specific and vague, but it taught me where to focus my studying.",0
Hart was the worst prof I've ever had.  The only thing I learned in this class was that she thinks protists are cute and that she loved fungi.  No use attending class because you learn nothing.  Teach yourself the material using the textbook because that is your only hope.,0
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS PEOPLE! Terrible professor, 0 explanations, unclear grading. Your grade basically depends on a 10 page paper that is ridiculously specific! Look for another professor... trust me",0
"she was a really hard grader and often confusing. never clearly explained the assignments and if you asked questions she never gave a clear answer. crazy work load too, my other classes suffered as i tried to keep up and she takes points off your assignments for no reason and no explanation",0
He is a very very tough grader. You need to figure out what he wants. Even if you ask him he will say the same thing over and over again until you basically give up and just do what you understood. Horrible at giving directions on papers. He never gives As. If you get a B+ in some of the papers you are lucky. DO NOT TAKE HIM. KILLS YOUR GPA.,0
"Very good prof, thoughtful lectures, interesting stories. There's a lot of reading and the essay tests are killer, but I think it was worth it.",1
"Let me start by telling you, I'm a student with a 3.82GPA. I have never been disappointed by my professors at St Thom until now. I withdrew from this course because getting a Grade W was much better than failing this class. There is a test every week- 5 mins for 5 questions. The midterm was harsh. 1 Hour for 60 questions. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!",0
Dr. Chew seemed too old to teach properly. All of his diagrams were wrong- students had to correct him. His tests were too hard. Forgets formulas and how to do problems.  DONT TAKE HIS CLASS.HARVEY NEEDS TO RETIRE!!!!!,0
Her exams are hard,0
Compared to the other teachers in the department she is one of the toughest. She goes strictly by the book but also adds a lot of extra grades that aren't needed. I feel like I worked so hard and still don't even have the grade I want.,0
"He is no help at all and is just awful, don't know how he has a teaching license.",0
Really helps out if you go to his lab days where you can just work on the essay. Manley can get a bit repetitive and his lectures might seem boring but just get through it and appreciate that you took Manley. He grades pretty lenient. Do all the work and lowest grade you would get is a B- at worst. Easy class and can be funny at times.,1
Amazing teacher! Explains everything and is very enthusiastic about History. He's so nice and as long as you go to class and take notes you'll be good. You'll do good on the tests as long as you thoroughly describe everything.,1
"One of the sweetest professors ever but also the hardest class I've ever done. I did well in Bio 151 but this class is too hard. FIil-in the blank (with no word bank) quizzes every week, and hard tests. She thinks everyone has a passion for bio and gives wayyyy too much information. My friends are bio-oriented majors and agree that its too hard.",0
"She moves fast in lecture and lectures almost directly from the book. I ended up teaching myself more from the textbook, but that's pretty terrible too. Lots of homework and tests are unpredictable (no practice exams)! If you take this class, be sure to be in a study group from the beginning. You're gonna need it.",0
"Lori was a mess of a professor. Rude, arrogant, and all over the place quite honestly. The class taught themselves each chapter every week and she completely could care less about the stuff being taught. As a matter of fact - she never taught once. Also, twice a week meeting class only met once a week, forcing tighter deadlines.",0
"Dr. Park is a great teacher. He explains all new concepts step-by-step. He might jump a few steps once you have moved beyond a basic understanding of the underlying concept he is teaching, but is always willing to explain all the bits and pieces if you ask. And his method is clear and I love his class! Calc 1...",1
"I have no talent going into this class and so I expected to learn HOW to do things, as it turns out I just paid hundreds of dollars to PRACTICE drawing in class. I understand that practice is important but I could just as easily practice drawing at home and save money.  He was less than clear most of the time and I hardly learned to draw better.",0
RUN! DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! Boris Maizel has to be one of the WORSE teachers Ive ever had. Find ANYONE else but him.,0
Class was fun and easy.  She did waste a lot of rehersal time though.,1
DO NOT TAKE. The only reason why he has so many good ratings is because he spends every living minute looking at this page. I wouldn't be surprised if he uses another laptop and writes these anonymously. He is a very conceded person and an extremely terrible teacher/grader.,0
I love Dr. Grapenthin. She is such a sweetheart and will take the time to help you if you don't understand what is going on. Come to class and you will pass.,1
"Not an easy A, but he's passionate about finance. Very approachable and willing to help any way he can. Pay attention in class. Put in the time and study for each exam and you can get a good grade. Failing one exam means failing the class so don't take exams lightly. 2 Midterms (25% ea), 1 project (10%), Quizzes (10%) and 1 final (30% of grade).",1
"I can actually speak Japanese now. Professor Garrisi emphasizes that students speak in Japanese everyday in class. Be prepared to be called on several timers per class, and reply in Japanese. I loved this. She was amazing and funny!",1
"Yeah, the class material challenging, and you have to be able to write, read and think to do well in the class. Not a thrilling lecturer, but the guy knows his stuff. It really does make you think. This is what you went to college for. Don't be a wimp.",1
Didn't like him. Hated his teaching. Super boring. But he was a lovely man once class was over and very kind in office hours.,0
"He took until grading to have any response back on grading so it was impossible to have an perception on where you stood in the class or improve your performance. It was unclear what he was looking for. Furthermore, the reading list was so extensive that we only had time for class and stayed up to midnight or so reading for the one class. ",0
"Literally the worst teacher I have had at Providence College. Her lectures make no sense whatsoever because she doesn't understand what she is teaching. Her exam questions do not reflect what she has ""taught."" You will receive nothing from lecture and you will have to teach yourself everything. She will kill BIO for you if you take her.",0
STAY AWAY! First english teacher at smc and was the absolute worst. Old school type of grader who only wants his essay done his way only. Zoom meetings are the same every day and doesn't help you with essays because he thinks everyone already knows how. Find another teacher asap.,0
"Her lectures are not as detailed as the book but discussion does help with the material. There were 4 HWS, very manageable and 1 programming assignment. Studying the lecture slides & HWS was sufficient to do well on the final and midterm. Pop quizzes that can only help your grade. Overall, very nice teacher!",1
"Very helpful and intelligent!!!  He makes you work hard, but he only does it because he wants you to succeed.  I hope to have him as a professor again!!",1
He is really helpful and nice but the class itself is kind of challenging. There is a lot of material that you need to know but there are no cumulative tests so that always helps. Labs take a while but you still get out fairly early. Never ever cancels class. ever. I'm a childhood ed major and I had a hard time with this class.,1
"Doug Thiel is one of the worst professors I've ever taken. HIs book, that he forces you to buy, is littered with grammatical mistakes and is written horribly. He is quite literally making up his own material. He is way too tough of a grader for an INTRODUCTORY class. He is unhelpful and vague. STAY AWAY.",0
"Ive taken a few online history courses at emu, and this is by far the easiest one I've ever taken. Exams are open notes, and professor writes up study guides for each exam. Literally easiest A you can get.",1
"Very intriguing man.  Tbh, I didn't learn a single thing through his class, but the four papers we wrote took me no more than an hour apiece. I enjoyed his lectures - very different.  ""Love?"" - Love!  If you're passionate about learning English I wouldn't recommend, but it makes for a good blowoff.  I respect PB a lot!",1
"Really great teacher... his take on electronic music, its composition, and history has definitely opened doors for me in terms of writing & listening to music. His approach to teaching is skillful, plus he's a pretty chill dood.",1
"I loved this class. Velleman is excellent professor, perhaps the best I've had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class, but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he's great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him.",1
"Antonie is an English teacher at heart so his classes revolve around essay writing. He struggles to make the content relatable and interesting. The quizzes were open book but very tricky and concepts from the text were rarely discussed in class. If you need an engaged environment, this class is not for you. If you need dry and boring, hes your guy",0
Professor Luallen teaches Micro the best amongst all the professors because he has great slides and illustrations. Good for a foundation class because you'll understand the models so well that you can apply them nicely on higher level classes.,1
It was all Greek to me. When he teaches he expects you to know everything there is to know about Finance when the class is supposed to be an Introduction to Finance. He made it harder than it had to be.,0
"The most unaccommodating professor I have had; having gone through 3 colleges. If you go to Broward College because you're a working professional, family provider, or anyone who's priorities trump school on occasion, run. If you email her ahead of time you're good. Unforeseen circumstances will end you. She forces you to make her your #1 priority.",1
"The homework assignments are open all semester so you can do them all well in advance and save yourself some time. Every other day you go to the lab and do ""projects"" where you complete task on powerpoint, word or excel super easy. The textbook is not needed so save yourself some bucks however the cengage online program SAM you need for about $90.",1
"handwriting is horrible, require highly intelligence to understand",0
Shahriar(Shawn) is one of the best professors Algonquin has for programming. His egoless teaching style makes him extremely easy to approach and ask questions. He is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about his subject matter. Shawn is always willing to go deeper into topics 1on1 with students when time permits.,1
"Professor Humber isn't very good, though he does try. His tests are difficult, but he grades very easy, though sometimes it's frustrating how arbitrary his qualifications are. Take him if you want a decent grade without too much work (at least, in comparison to other sections), but if you really want a good Calc II professor, try someone else.",0
"Denise is very passive-aggressive. When she doesn't like something, instead of talking to you about it, she gets serious and rude. She gives a lot of criticism but never any praise. She expects you to be perfect at all that you do, and she says she's willing to help if you need it, but she never replies to her emails or texts. Contradictive :-/",0
"Errico is absolutely phenomenal! All her grades are from online. There is only Hw and Quizzes that are due, either every week or every other week. She is super helpful and wants everyone to pass the class. Lectures can be long and tiresome, but pull through them and you will pass the class in no time. Easy A, definitely take her!",1
"By far the best professor I've ever had. Super passionate about what he does, and one of the sweetest teachers you'll ever meet. Easy course load and interesting topics. I would definitely recommend taking him if you get the chance!",1
She's a good professor. Im taking her again whenever I get the chance.,1
easiet course ive ever taken.,0
"Be sure to cite any numbers in the discussion question in your post. Also, if you have a financial calculator, or show your work in algebraic form, forget it. You'll just have to redo everything in excel and then compare it. So you'll just do double the work. Even though no particular way was specified in the first place. Avoid at all costs.",0
Don't take it out on me just because he didn't give you a good grade.,1
"By far, Francine Dagenais is the WORST professor I've come by at UOttawa, and that's saying something. First off, if you miss more than 2 classes, she will prevent you from doing the exam. Second, her exam requires you to memorize 64 separate pieces, while the final essay is only worth 28% of the final grade. Dagenais is evil. She hates students",0
"Her assignments were out of few points, and she graded very harshly. A 6 page paper could be worth 10 points in her eyes, and if you mess something up you are done for. She expects your papers to be one of a graduated psych major, which is not exceptable for a psych 300 course. TAKE A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR.",0
"Taking her Java class online is one of the worst college experiences I have ever persevered. Her tests and their answers are self-typed, so often answers that she allows are not correct per the book, or one of multiple answers that she presents. When asking for help, she had to use Google to answer a simple question. DO NOT take her Java class!",0
"Dr. Oberlin is a very intelligent, knowledgeable,experienced professor.  He provided us with interesting assignments and the guidance and structure I would expect from any professional instructor.  He even produced podcasts! He always sent us individual feedback on every assignment.  Great instructor.  Take his course!",1
"Zhang seems like a good guy, but is not a great teacher. He is good enough, and I would have given him a higher rating, but the amount of work that this guy assigns is nuts. We get two 8-12 page HW assignments a week (doesn't care about exam weeks), plus a bunch of MatLab projects, MatLab labs, and five exams.",1
"Very difficult to understand her teaching style. She isn't really one to answer any questions as her excuse is ""I don't have enough time"" to answer them. Her grading style is very off and seems a little unrealtic to pass the class. I don't recommend taking her if your math skills aren't up to par. She's not one to go into detail about.",0
"Inexperienced, does not give feedback on assignments or quizzes, if there is a technical difficulty it is the students fault, does not have office hours expects communication to be done through emails but does not respond, does not post assignments when she says she will, poorly organized",0
"doesn't post notes so attending is mandatory. tests are straightforward, and does test on stuff from the textbook. marks VERY hard on the assignments. also my friend and I both had mistakes with our final grades and we didn't know it (b/c she doesn't give back grades) until we emailed her for mark breakdowns and figured it out ourselves. >:(",0
"Reads way too fast, expects you to keep up and understand what she is doing.",0
This is the easiest class i have ever taken at KSU. I literally made a 100 in the class. Class is mandatory and the lecture is very long but this is an easy A. Dr. G always extended dates and helped everyone. There are very few asssignments so make sure you do them all. I didnt learn a lot it was basically like a review of math 2008 & 3316. No HW.,1
"I took 3 classes with Dave. He is really the best teacher in the world because he really cares about his students.  I am forever grateful for how much he has changed my college life.  Take his class.  I know it seems like you are going to fail and get an F, but trust me, it will be all right.",1
Lecture does not cover what is tested. Discussion sections are poorly structured. She is by far the worst lecturer I have had in my 4 years at BU,0
"I knew this teacher was going to be horrible after the first day of class. She is very disrespectful to students and does not value students opinions over the subject. I remember watching her yell at a student in class, and the student felt so humiliated she left. If you want a caring, understanding professor, do yourself a favor and dont take her",0
"This class was the only class in entire courses I took at SF STATE that I wish had never ended! Professor Hasheminia is really knowledgeable and makes the most challenging and mathematical concepts easy and fun to understand. Don't get me wrong, you must work hard to get a good grade. Definitely take this clazs if you want to learn Data Mining.",1
Very hard marker.Almost failed everyone in the final.Exam questions were easy but don't know what happens when it comes to grade.Lectures are boring.,0
"This professor is dedicated, works hard to get across students, very engaging face to face lectures. He is very fluid between topic, history, people involved, context, application. He is capable of providing texture to the topic that it's very hard to fall asleep in his class. The time will pass by quickly, that is how engaging he is.",1
"She can talk quite a bit. She has no problem wasting the entire class period without mentioning the material at all. She assigns so much homework, but it is all easy. The study guides are almost exactly the same as the tests. Very easy class as long as you turn stuff in.",1
My whole life history has been my favorite subject. i never wanted to pursue a career in it but i loved it. i have always gotten A's since freshmen year of high school in history. Until her class. SHE DESTROYED MY LOVE FOR HISTORY. SHE DOES NOT TEACH. everything you learn is from the textbooks. and to top it off you have a quiz every single day.,0
This professor is a good professor but he gives a final exam with no information. Meaning after the midterm we did nothing but speeches and he DID NOT review any of the book but then turned around and gave a final exam the final exam was redundant and uncalled for but he would not cancel it. He expected us to read 4 chapters in 2 days long chapters,1
"Had him for online and he was the best! My advice is take good noteshe has live lectures (where he teaches specific info found only on the final) and posts recorded lectures (that only stay up temporarily). The study guides are useful and tests are open notes. Just pay attention, take good notes, and go to live lectures and you'll be fine.",1
"This prof is very knowledgeable; however, the workload is very large and it is extremely easy to loose track as to where things are going. No matter how much of the book you read, the classes and test will contain things that are not covered in class.  If order to obtain a good grade, make sure you have a light course load or have no social life.",0
"Terrible feedback. Tough grader. Choices in reading are okay, but she tries to make you think HER way, not critically. It's only HER interpretation & you have to guess. Makes a class that could be great miserable. Contradicts herself; is all over the place with the syllabus. Take this class with another professor! Not worth the aggravation.",0
Very corny professor but fairly easy course.  Pay attention and take notes and you should have no problem getting a good grade.,1
"I got a C+ with a curve & that is my only non A I have ever received in my college career (Im a senior). The tests and quizzes are over the most minute details from the slides or textbook & when you ask her about it, she is so condescending with her response. I wish i never would have taken this class with her - giant mistake.",0
Dry lectures - reads from slides. Common sense content. Labs are unorganized and chaotic. Labs and midterm marked super easy. No exam.,0
Dave's biggest flaw is that he speaks in monotone and can speak too quietly at times. I have no other complaints. He is the one of the best professors I've ever had in terms of willingness to answer questions and let class digress into relevant discussions. He uses current events and modern examples to help put the class into context.,1
"""learn from the textbook"" type of class- only instead of book its articles. You have to be specific up to her arbitrary standards. does not give clear expectations and feedback is only negative. would not take her again",0
No textbook. Papers and exams were extremely reasonable without being easy. They require some effort and time (as they should) and I was genuinely interested in the content of my projects. The first two exams are all written and can be challenging to finish if you write slowly. 10% final quiz on last day of classes. Excellent!,1
"Professor Elzinga is widely respected, but he did not explained concepts in clear and concise ways. His lectures were long and pretty unnecessary, and the way he sets up his discussion sections and TA's are what I hear the biggest complaints from. Lectures and discussion are both unhelpful. Read the textbook and try learning it on your own.",1
"Her lectures are all power points, but she doesn't really tell you how to code. While you may understand what something does, she doesn't explain the syntax of coding. You're plopped down in the lab with no understanding of how to correctly code a project.",0
"DON""T TAKE IT!!! It's wayyyy too hard! Get out while you can! I hated this class! It had some good points but it was not worth it!!!!",0
he is a great man he really force you to think. from his teaching style every student could understand what he was  trying to teach. he have  a good communication skills between students. he is the best teacher i ever saw. you must choose him  as your professor. i wish i become his student one more time.,1
"he is extremely hard for no reason and when you try your best, he makes you feel like a failure. i do not recommend him at all.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR BENDER. He is a wonderfully smart man but a horrible, horrible professor. The tests are extremely difficult and despite the insane curve he applies, it's almost impossible to get a decent grade. Please, do yourself a favor and avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"I chose this class as an elective to finish my Masters Degree and just dropped it because the required reading was insane. I was sick the first two weeks of the class and got behind in reading and was never able to catch up. I took notes and highlighted and when it came time to take the test,nothing I had read was on there! I do not recommend.",0
"Prof. Morra is wild. He's funny in all his lectures and keeps you entertained. Exams and final are minimum 12 pg papers. You have to start essays WAY before the due date to finish on time cause they're long. Can type them straight from your notes and get an A. Show up, takes notes, pass. Can skip a few times but you'll miss notes. Sports fan too",1
Her lectures are super boring and long. She sits on her desk during lab and will not walk around and help students. She's very lazy and doesn't care about her students. Don't take her if you don't have to.,0
"Dr. Matlack is awesome. He's super charismatic & passionate about what he's talking about. His class was generally super interesting and I highly recommend it!! BEWARE: Most of your grade comes from the Aerial Photo projects -- if you don't do them, you won't do well. Also all of his tests are short answer, but they're all straight from lecture.",1
Definitely the funniest dude on the entire planet. Very condescending but it's so ridiculous it's funny. Dude literally broke the oldest artifact in the world,1
"Murtuza really cares about his students and loves teaching, he is also extremely nice and will help you anyway you need. However he is very very difficult to understand, he possess no organization ability. I do not feel I learned much and always felt the department exams were too difficult for me. From a class perspective there was not much work.",1
"I learned a lot in this class and really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this class as long as you don't mind watching very powerful films that affect you deeply.  Some of the films were very hard to watch.  Other than that, it was a great class",1
"David is awesome, you will love this class",1
"She comes off as mean at first, but then you learn her sense of humor. She is very clear in her teaching. Easy to understand. You have to have the courage to speak up and tell her when you don't understand something, then she will help you and won't make you feel bad for asking. The book is expensive and confusing but she is great. Tests are easy!",1
"Started a lecture on how he does not care if you pass his class. Says he has a class Avg. of a D. Homework is ridiculous and takes 1.5-2 hours to complete just a piece of it, as it is an interactive quiz like set up. Condescending and rude when I asked for help or clarification.",0
He wants to hear everyone's feedback and will tailor the classes to the students. I would definitely take again.,1
"he knows the subject well and teaches you things that you'll need in your career, but he is a little biased when it comes to design.  if your design is not how he thinks it should be, you kind of sense this negative vibe from him.",0
"I took Dr. Buck during the winter 2015 semester. This class was tough! It was only a 4 week course, with 16 weeks of work compacted into such a short time. Be prepared to spend time during the week watching films, reading chapters, and taking tests. He gives out plenty of extra credit opportunities. I got an A with hard work!",1
"Not a good prof at all. His lectures consisted of him just solving problems on the board while not clearly explaining how to solve it. Assigned online homework assignments which did not match content taught in class, leaving you scrambling to try and teach yourself. Does not post grades online.",0
"I won't deny his intelligence. But he could care less about teaching. After whole semester he still does not know anyone's name (class of 20). I've been called 4 different names. If you don't agree with his view, he'll grade harsh on you. Professors like him made thinking illegal.",0
"Dr. Knapp is extremely organized and efficient in his teaching style. His lectures are informative and thorough, and he always makes sure that everything is retained by his students. He wants you to succeed in his class!! His office hours are flexible and he is incredibly helpful to anybody that needs assistance.",1
"Harsh grader. Tamara is vague in her feedback on your papers, and you're only allowed to miss 4 classes, any more after that you fail. The first day of class I contemplated dropping and taking it with a different professor. Tamara will call on you, and if you didn't do the readings assigned, then you don't get points. Try to get on her good side!",0
The best prof in drama - hands down.,1
"Every class was a complete mess. We spent about an hour talking about pure nonsense. She was almost always late. Every paper we did made absolute no sense and her notes were completely illegible, she can't even read it. The only thing I appreciated is the comprehensive steps each paper had, made it easy to write. She's really rude and judgmental.",0
BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!!! TAKE HER ,1
THIS WAS THE WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. Just DONT take this man. Very HARD grader. Find someone else!!!,0
Quizzes have more than one attempts and best grade is kept. Exams are used with lockdown browser. Couple of graded assignments. Fair class.,1
Great Teacher.  Nice Guy,1
Worst professor and grader ever. I barely passed the class and I attribute to her only. When I asked for help she merely told me I could make up points later without telling me what I did wrong. Gives reviews that don't help. Lectures are pointless and barely knows what she's doing. GET OUT,0
"He is a really nice professor! He is passionate about Physics, thus he gets excited over the topic, which is a good thing! He has a good sense of humor as well",1
"Very informative and interactive, provides positive feedback and encouragement and doesnt over complicate the courses.",1
"This class is extremely difficult unless you enter the class with a prior knowledge of scripting. Hoagland is not very helpful and will tell you to look at your book for help. Explains the material as if you know everything already, do not expect an easy A. As a matter of fact, don't expect an easy B. I understood more by going to a tutor.",0
"It was a hybrid class, but I never went to class except when turning something in. Really straight forward and easy, she was really nice.",1
"So unclear about everything. You will be clueless about what youre supposed to do and when assignments are due. Just dont take her, take this class with Deidre and then you will learn something!",0
She is crazy! She is not teaching at all. She is just wasting students time in class and try to arrange extra classes. If you really wanna learn AI avoid her. Try to take from others.Thus I have seen worst TA in my college life.,0
Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class? She doesn't consider if people would get injured on a slippery road when rushing from another classroom far from hers. Tends to give everyone lowmark,0
"Class is extremely boring and she just reads from the slides. Tests are unbelievably hard and everyone fails. No curve. She also will fail you for participation, even if you contribute. DO NOT TAKE",0
"De Vos is a very smart person, and likes to make jokes in class. However, this actual class was completely useless. Called ""Sex & Gender"", he mostly talked about his personal life and told stories. PowerPoints were taken right out of the book. Open note exams, so it wasn't very difficult. Get points by being in class, although they were useless. ",0
"David Austin is one of the best teachers at GVSU. I had for LA 1 and 2. I never thought he liked me, but I always had a great deal of respect for him, because of his skill in both math and teaching. Take a class with him if you can.",1
"His textbook is the reason I'm failing comp math 1. I've never read anything so poorly written. There's not even an alternate text given, since he just wants you to buy the one he wrote.",0
"He might be a very smart person, but in my 15 years in school I have never had a prof that was this bad. He was not helpful, made no effort at all to help students outside class time and NEVER replies to email. He admitted he doesn't check them. To top it off he threatened me when I brought up marking. Worst prof at UBC.(Would punch in the face)",0
"This class is very interesting and I loved it.  I would deinately recommend this professor, she's great.",1
Erin was great - there was a lot of homework for 203 but it is an intensive class. She made the material really accessible and I loved having her as an instructor.,1
"Dr. McClish is an awesome professor and a genuinely nice guy. His courses are challenging, but he truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. I appreciate that he doesn't spoon feed you the material. He is helpful, clear, and approachable. You put in the work and he will make you a better student and a better writer. He's great! :)",1
"Took her online class and had to drop it. She is a tough grader, work is worth two points, wants everything done correctly, very rude, expects a lot in discussion posts, is not clear in what she wants, work is due by 5, no late work, extra credit is impossible to do, and depends on the book for everything with no help if asked for some. DONT TAKE!!",0
This teacher is amazing. Her tests are hard but the material and the way she teaches it makes it all worth it. I would definitely recommend her for abnormal Psych,1
"I made an A in this class simply because the exams were departmental, and they were much easier than the work we did in class. He is a really nice guy who is willing to help, but he is just not a good teacher. He made things so much harder than they had to be in class, and he confused me more than he helped.",0
"Not my favorite professor, but she is very good. Way above average. Knowledgeable without being condescending. Actually knows what she is talking about.",1
"Not understanding of students, awful lectures, and she goes warp speed. So rude and unprofessional.",0
Prof. Ochs runs a fairly simple class. You have a reading assigned for every class and she gives you notes on the reading during class. Actually doing the readings is not all that mandatory. Showing up to class also isn't mandatory but the class becomes a lot harder if you don't because you really need the notes to do all the writing assignments.,1
"Professor Mancini is great at what she does! She loves teaching, and will make the class enjoyable. The assignments she gives are very easy. My class was a hybrid and it was still easy to follow. She gives you credit for showing up to class, so don't skip! Overall I would recommend her!!",1
"Tyler is a very knowledgeable professor. I think he is an efficient professor... he gets things done on time, but is he an effective professor? not really. His grading criteria is clear but his time-consuming requirements like homework and online exercises do not have a lot of weight on your grade. The 4 exams are your best bet so study study study",0
Jesse is a good art teacher. On the first day of class you will be shocked at his behavior but you will get used to him. He is very eager to help you and you will do good in the class as long as you do the work and take his advice on your artwork.,1
"She knows what she is talking about.  I like her as a teacher but as a person.  Called me out in class for going to the bathroom.  If you do the homework and study a little bit, you should pass the class with at least a B.",0
YOU NEVER HAVE HOMEWORK! easy gen ed as long as you study for the tests; there are only 4.  you never use your book just make sure you go to class and take good notes.  he does attendance through one min papers which really give your grade a boost. i would def recommend taking prof ledrick,1
"Mr. Paramsothy Thananjeyan was a great lecturer but not necessarily a great teacher. Personally, I found him rather bland. He's not the worst, but he could be much better.",0
I love Madame Kugler! She's very energetic and cares about her students. Makes class fun. Better than Coulet du Gard,1
"Shes the cutest little old lady youll find! Shes energetic and even when its a dark gloomy morning, her infectious joy will rejuvenate you! Shes super nice and approachable, but dont get her wrong, shes super tough too. Study hard and ask her questions when youre confused. She assigns lots of in class presentations so get ready for that!",1
"This was a great online class! Dr. Foster posts a couple online video lectures each week, and then you do one assignment per week. Most weeks, I would spend about 2-3 hours total to watch the lectures and do the assignment. If you turn the assignment in early, he will give you feedback and you can fix what you missed.",1
"TERRIBLE!!!! If you have the choice, do NOT waste your time or money. It's extremely difficult to be successful in this course and she is not helpful or friendly whatsoever.",0
"she is terrible when it comes to writing notation, does't accept homework once class starts, says an answer is wrong when it is right, basically impossible to do anything correct.",0
Very slow lectures that give you no idea how you're doing in the class until it's too late to change your grade.,0
"Although it is just a GE course, he teaches us like we are all political sci majors. So I really had no idea what he is talking about. Extremely boring lectures. Not worth it even if you're just taking for credit. Terrible overall. Do not take his class. You will regret taking his class. Probably the worst class.",0
"He teaches like a history lecture. There are notecards at the end of each class every day, which is the majority of your grade. There are 2 essays, but they are pretty easy, just select a chapter and follow the guidelines. He does offer extra credit & it is a discussion class for an hour but we usually get out early.",1
"She does not explain how she wants our 2 projects to be well then expects everyone to do it perfectly. She isn't understanding and pretends that the class is so simple even though she doesn't know how to teach. Throughout the class she couldn't figure out how to present her power points, print things out, and didn't know when the final was.",0
She is kind and prays for her students every day. It would be helpful if she actually taught the material. There is a pervasive feeling of frustration in the class and she ends the discussion if there are too many questions. I have an A but feel that I may need to retake the class from someone else so I actually learn the material.,0
Great Professor!! Definitely learned a lot in his class.  He is very philosophical.  He has a lot of ideas on making the world a better place.,1
"Very smart man, great professor, I learned a lot in his class, study hard for the exams though, they are a little hard",1
He had done a great job at providing feedback and was pretty consistent at responding to emails.,1
Avoid him for sure!,0
Dr. Berkson is the best! I learned so much taking many of his classes while a Religion major at Hamline. Take at least one of his classes before you graduate or you are really missing out!,1
"I had him just last semester, if I'm correct, all except one person in the class failed due to him going off topic and being very vague when it comes to explanations.",0
Wouldn't recommend this professor.. Dry boring lectures and exams did not correlate to anything we did. Quizzes were nearly impossible. Do not take this professor unless you are very skilled in acct,0
Class was ok. I wasn't particularly engaged in it. Most of the meeting time was her talking at us not with us. It felt very one sided. Also if you don't do the reading you will regret it. Not a tough grader. You get what you give into the class.,1
"Weekly quizzes. Long (but few) homework assignments. Labs can be hard to finish in time. That said, Peterman helped me a lot in class, always answering my questions well and quickly. She's a very engaging teacher, and tries to get to know the students personally. I learned a ton from lecture and labs. Seems tough at first, but she's a great prof.",1
"Rogers isn't an easy A professor, but she isn't a stressful prof either. The clicker quizzes are every day and make up 1/5th of your grade, and they're usually easy. She does them every day, twice a class, and you only need 30, so you don't have to go every day. Exam Qs straight from lect, but she posts them online. She's an easy B prof.",1
"Isn't clear in directions and blames students when they don't know what to do. I passed this class but worked harder than ever, not because he was tough on me, because he doesn't know what he wants. In my opinion, you should only need to get help from TAs and GAs if you are struggling, it should not be an essential part of passing.",0
She tends to stomp on many students if she does not hear the answer that she wants to hear. She doesn't take in other peoples' opinion and expect everyone to agree with her.,0
"If you're not prepared to go to all of his office hours, you're not going to pass. The man grades depending on his mood and not on accuracy. In fact, when he lectures he'll tell you one thing and then when you give him that answer on the test he will tell you its wrong. During the lecture, he yells, a lot. He's really just a mean old man.",0
"Assignments are given 2x a week based on textbook chapters. You have to come up with and answer your own questions (3). If a film is given there will be a DB. There was a midterm essay, short paper, and final essay. Do not plagiarize you will be penalized. Everything is clear and straightforward. First online class I've ever taken and I liked it.",1
"Professor Benefiel is not a teacher you want. I am an all A student and received a 72 in his class that was originally supposed to be a 69. His lectures are unclear, he doesn't answer questions (rather beats around the bush), his tests are hard with 6-8 questions and he barely helps you. Do NOT get this professor. Good luck if you do. (MCC not OCC)",0
"His exams are tricky. There are only 22 multiple choice questions per exam. You need to study the slides carefully, read the chapters thoroughly and take your own notes to get an A. During your presentation, he will ask you questions out of no where so be prepared and know your companies well. He's not very helpful outside or inside the classroom.",0
"Really enjoyed this class. An old school professor with straight lectures. First half of the class is lecture, take a break, second half watch a video. Two papers on two books that were fairly easy. Didnt like the all essay midterm and final but other than that a really approachable and friendly guy. The smartest guy at the school. Would recommend.",1
Great person and professor. Extremely well learned and knows how to teach it,1
"Pretty good prof. The class is not too hard, but it's a ton of information. He does curve grades if they aren't as high as he thinks they should be. Go to class! Do the HW, it really helps on quizzes and tests. Tests are a little tricky, but he gives partial credit. He does assign HW and gives quizzes and they will either make or break your grade- it's up to you.",1
"Cathy is the best, and by far the best here at JMU. She is rated the best Bus160 professor on outside sources and this is no joke. Her class is always a fun time because she adds hilarious commentary to her job. Easy grader, and provides lots of extra credit opportunities. Read the textbook for exams and your solid.",1
Worst professor for calc 2 DOES NOT TEACH,0
"She is one of the smartest professors I've had at OSU. She is great to learn from.  Her lectures can feel long at times, but the material covered  in lectures are imperative for her tests. In my experience, she is a fair grader as long as you follow her expectations and rubrics. I would highly recommend taking her for WIC course requirement.",1
If you like a lot of pointless busy work then she is your teacher other wise find someone else.,0
"Shes the worst prof I have ever had at bsu. She doesnt care youre a college student, she doesnt care if you have to wait until pay day to buy her mandatory expensive textbook ( which she only wants you to buy bc her weak writing is included. Certainly she did not publish anything decent) shes no willing to help. She always thinks shes right",0
He is the most useless prof. for the chem lab at Kettering. Unwilling to help and does not care about any students what so ever. Do not take this professor is possible. Only reason I got a decent grade was because I knew the material before hand.,0
Professor Neva knott has time and time again has shown her inability to teach by not supporting her student when they excelled in something they previously struggled with. When you ever asked for her help she only responded with not only a rude manner but also more confusing then the prompt she gives. Do not take her class if you ever need help.,0
Professor Ruiz is a good teacher. You will learn in her class. I took Intensive Span for Heritage Learners and get ready to work! She gives a lot of online homework as well as quizzes apart from your tests and group projects. If you do no make time for this class you will not pass. She does have patience and is willing to break it down for you.,1
She is incredibly unorganized. I will not take her again. She grades very strictly but does not teach very detailed. I never know what to study,0
"This is not an easy course. It isn't meant to be. She explains everything well and her PowerPoints are extensive. It's supposed to prepare you for your future communications classes, and I can say that life is much easier after taking her class. I use information from it all the time. The class isn't handed to you, so you'll have to earn your grade",1
If you like to read A LOT and be bored and confused. Take this class... I love Philosophy but she gives us complicated readings and even though she goes over it in class it's confusing and SO boring... Hardly anyone comes to class either. Shes a nice lady though? =/,0
"She needs to find another profession because she sucks at teaching. Does not communicate or grade anything. She will say ""these are tough times we're going through"", and literally assign a 400-500 point essay. She cancels classes frequently so there is no point to the class. She fails at doing her job correctly so trust me do not take her class.",0
"Dr. Gea is very kind and cares about his students, but his teaching style is hard to understand with no background physics knowledge. Taking notes and just going to class will not cut it. A lot of outside work needs to be put in to be successful. He isn't always helpful with questions, but he has a great sense of humor and makes lecture enjoyable.",1
"The class was a little difficult, but Professor Zein is very good at what she teaches. She's usually free for extra help when needed but she's pretty clear in class. Really tough grader, but great class.",1
Dr. Hazell was truly great! I wish that all of my professors were as inspiring as him. This was the first history class I actually enjoyed learning in. Would recommend taking his class x100,1
Warning. I had a horrible experience with this guy and his class was not what I expected. Be aware. ,0
"If you are not a poli-sci major do not take this class unless you have nothing to do but read and write papers every week. Assigns papers as if his class is the only thing I have to worry about, took time away from classes that matter for my major. He's a nice guy and clearly passionate about what he teaches, but this class made me miserable.",0
goes quick for a span 101 class,1
"Great guy with a great sense of humor. I went into this class expecting to toil away for 10 weeks and get out with a passing grade, but November had other plans. he gave multiple chances for extra credit through attending poetry readings. He really wants to see you grow. I went from hating writing to writing poetry outside of class.",1
Kim was by far one of my favorite professors. She can be a hard or tough grader at first but let's you revise your work to get a better grade until the next large paper is due. She's not very tech savvy so she hands you papers in class but she is very timely and efficient. She is extremely funny but also knows how important schoolwork is. Take her!,1
"His class was the strangest I have ever taken.  He has so many personal issues, all of which he shares, that it's amazing this man functions.  He actually showed up to our class over medicated, and we were afraid he would pass out!  Although it's an easy A, the stuff he puts you through is not worth it.  I can't ephasize this enough- AVOID!!!",0
I would suggest that if you have to have a class and the offer another professor then take the class with the other professor. I would find myself emailing him for an assignment due in a couple of days and him not replying for weeks later. You learn absolutely nothing from him!,0
"Prof Conroy has the potential to be an excellent teacher once he figures his stuff out. He seems kind & honest &  is always an email away. His tests are tough and long and are 3-5 chapters deep. He needs to double check handouts, space his tests out, & not assign a project less than a month before Finals while still preparing for our 3rd test.",1
"Ok class, lots of busy work each week, but not hard. No textbook used. 2 papers and 2 tests. Not hard if you show up and do the homework. Papers will take lots of time.",1
Only professor to keep my attention at 8:00 am,1
This is the best class I've taken so far at FSCJ. I looked forward to every class. This guy is a really good teacher. Highly recommended.,1
"Dave Pruis is the guy you want for Calc. He does notes and examples in a sometimes laughable step by step breakdown but if you are struggling with a topic, this will save you. Very good about partial credit. There are 4 tests, 2 projects, daily homework, HW quizzes, trig cheat sheet on every test, ""help"" sheet on the final. Overall superb teacher.",1
Arevalo is a very temperamental individual. She doesn't like to be challenged and doesn't explain anything well. She runs through slides like its sometype of game and doesnt explain anything. She crams in material before exams and excepts you to guess whats on her mind. She is not considerate and not very present. and loves to single people out!,0
"Rebecca Thomas is an absolute godsend. Loved her class. She is very helpful and easy to talk to. She will go out of her way to help you succeed, all you have to do is put in the work.",1
Amazing professor.  Definately one of my favorites. if you get teh chance take a class with him.,1
"You always work in a group, makes things easier. Always need the textbook on you (1), can't take quizzes without it. Really interesting stuff, teaches like no one else I've had. A few papers & homework. Discussion heavy. You have to work for your grade but it's an easy A if you do. No presentations or projects. Taking her again next semester.",1
"Terrible Teacher, doesn't teach, has trouble staying on track.",0
"Dr. Kevin TeBeest has a passion for teaching and his lectures are great. I found them very interesting but many students ended up sitting on their phones the entire time. That being said, the man is the one word, 5 letter, definition of what you would call the feeling of being stuck with a thorn. The concepts are so easy he routinely grades as such",0
Prof. Silvia is really nice yet he can give ALOT of homework which can be overwhelming. I took a hybrid class for him and he will hand out ALOT of in class and lecture packets. Be prepare to get 15-20 assignments online and note packets due by next class. He's very hard on grading if you have a 77% or 79% he won't round it!,0
"I liked the class, but he was a really tough grader.  I thought my final grade was unfair given the amount of effort and time spent inthe photolab, but whatev... I still liked the class.",1
"Am a marketing and entrepreneur major in his finance class, so it was very foreign. Most of my class was investment bankers who he loves, and then talks in their language. However, his class is very interesting and he's always available when you need help. Also, he curves it well so you will get a good grade. Awesome prof.",1
"Excellent class. Phenomenal professor. You read various articles and he will blow your mind connecting the dots. He is fascinating, demanding on the readings, but it is so worth it.",1
The worst class I have ever taken.,0
Liked to go on long oral strolls 10 minutes past when class was supposed to end and would all but threaten you with academic death if you left before he finished. Very short tolerance for the slightest hint of stupidity.,1
"Norris was so distant from his students. He didn't even know the SI's name for this course. Exams were curve balls. Whole grade for the semester was based on TWO EXAMS AND THE FINAL - and some points for the partnered lab section. He made studyguides, but refused to post them or the powerpoints to CC. Wouldn't take him again.",0
Prof Bailey is great she struggled with technology at first but got the hang of it. She is super helpful and I really liked her class! I would take again!,1
"fun, fun, fun",1
"If you want to pass the class expect to work for it. He explains everything thoroughly and clearly, but you have to pay attention! (just like any class you want to do well in). He tests on what he presents in his lectures and uses the textbook problems as test questions. He's there if you need help, just ask & don't be afraid. Work hard! Good guy!",1
"Prof. Hendrick is iconic in that she is so chill, yet a very knowledgeable actor. I took Basic Acting with her because I thought I would be interested in it, but she taught us that it was so much more than that! I loved every single class with her. Very few essays/homework assignments, just come to class ready to BE IN THE MOMENT.",1
"Favorite professor in first semester of college. Easy to talk to, really cool, and great sense of humor. 3 hour class never really went all the way to end. Always given five minute break. Did not always just lecture, gave group work. Reasonable paper grader just do APA format right (Its literally given points) Personally found tests a bit tough",1
"Tavss works at a faster pace than the other professors, but personally, I like  that he does that. It gives me time before the exam to review everything, instead of learning the material during the lecture prior to the exam! He has a great sense of humor, and will help you when you need it. Just pay attention and go to office hours, they help!!",1
"this guy,he thinks he's smart but I am so regreting taking his class.sucks that there is only one Organic Chemistry lecture for BSU...during lecture he talks alot but its useless...Its better off to study through online lectures from other universities. I studied with Yale online lecture and it helped me to pass this class.",0
"I took her class in Winter. She is a very good lecturer. Her note is very clear and easy to understand. I am in a pharmacy school now, and I remember what she taught us! Her class prepares me for pharmacy school!! I cannot thank you her enough. She is one of the best professor in CSULA. MUST TAKE and DO THE WORK and enjoy it!",1
He didn't make his grading criteria clear at all and then scolded the whole class for missing the point of the paper. He will make your life so much harder than it needs to be. Take literally any other professor for this class if you can.,0
"STAY AWAY!!! I have never in my five years of math had a professor this bad. I took this class as my last calc class to transfer. After all, everyone says business calc is the easiest to pass. And it is! except with this professor he makes it nearly impossible to get 100 on anything! he gave -3 on a test ques. because my work didn't show simplified",0
i was scared to approach her in the class ... the course work was very heavy shes a nice professor but that class was not for me,0
"Honestly did not teach me anything in class, had to learn everything from the textbook and from the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube. Three tests all with averages well-below 50%. No homework, really nothing other than tests.",0
"Melissa's lectures were informative but very lengthy. A lot of the time she would spend class giving a tutorial on how to use Adobe Premier but would get upset when we followed along on our computers because we weren't ""paying attention."" I feel like her class was better pre-covid. Overall she was just alright, do the work and you'll pass.",1
"Super arbitrary in terms of grading, I asked him in the middle of the quarter about how I was doing in the class and he said I am in the top of the class but refused to give a letter grade. Then he gave me a B+ even though I was never late nor absent, and participate every class. I am just confused.",0
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
"I took Prof. Smith's FE429 (Futures and Options). That was tough. His lectures were very unclear, explanations were confusing (at best). Well educated, but arrogant and ignorant of his class. This class was an elective.",0
"Exams are around 80-100 questions and are really narrow, you need to really read and take notes on the chapters before class for when he calls on you. You can do well but you really need to devote a lot of time and effort.",0
Tom taught more in PAX than I had ever learned in another class. If you're looking for a good learning experience take this class! If you're not willing to work for the grade it will show.,1
Bone is one of my favorite professors. She is the sweetest woman at Bellarmine and truly loves what she does! Super sweet and fun in lecture! I wish she could every Nursing class.,1
She seems to grade our weekly study guides purely based on how well we cite our sources directly related to her grading rubric that exists only in her head and has no rhyme or reason,0
"Really nice, well-meaning professor, but his English is terrible which makes it really hard.  Unfortunately, he's the only professor that teaches first year college physics.  On the plus side, it's a fairly easy class so getting an A shouldn't be tough.",0
"boring class, only take it if you need to for JMS major! daily clicker questions, and the open note tests take a lot of prep, but they're easy. definitely bring a computer for daily current topics!!",1
"Does not teach, and doesn't have a book. good luck. he doesn't post homework until a couple days before its due, and no final exam review. nice guy though",0
"Would never recommend, professor is really unclear in wording on quiz questions, impossible to get full points on anything. She does not seem to want her students to succeed. Unstructured class.",0
"He speaks above the class and will make it impossible to understand the subject unless you have prior knowledge. He makes mistakes, and won't fix them while doing example problems, often saying ""Oh, that's wrong. Well, you know what I mean."" When you ask him for help he is very cocky and rude.",0
"Easy class and really sweet guy! he honestly wants every1 to do well, very forgiving about things like late assignments or re-dos. not a particularly interesting subject, esp if its not ur major, but he does his best to make it very simple. Very clear instructions on assignments, presentation at the end of the course on whatever topic u want.",1
"Avoid her!!! She changed her style on every course she taught now!(After 2012 summer term)!!It was so hard for quizzes, and paper!! She marked so hard. Although she is a nice prof.Not recommend her at all!!",0
She is an adorable older lady. She requires an assignment where you have to read 32 books and write a report about each one. I would suggest starting right away and start with the chapter books so you don't fall behind.  Her tests were like 50 questions but they were from the notes.  I had the book but never opened it.,1
Shes a nice woman and its a fun class but there was a little too much sharing opinions and stories not enough quality learning for me.,1
Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. She disagrees. There were many times in my class when someone would ask a question and say something wrong and she would laugh. She also cold calls people and doesn't agree with other people's analysis. The final is extremely hard as well.,0
This professor is the most insensitive and unfair professor ive ever had. She never chooses on students with their hands up. She like to ignore students in time of need. she is horrible.,0
Very disorganized. She teaches at the level of the most proficient member of the class and lets the rest fall behind.,1
"this class is easy. I never showed up and almost got an A. there's lots of reading but you can skim through it and understand. I did not enjoy his class AT ALL, how much he talks about himself or off topic conversations in class is ridiculous and the reason why I stopped attending class. Basically taught myself everything I needed.",0
"she is so kind and helpful, her class is easy and no textbook to use. i love her, i will continue take her class ENG107. TKE HER CLASS!!!!!!",1
Matsushima-sensei is my favorite teacher in the japanese department so far. She's very helpful and relaxed although I wouldn't say she's easy. She expects a lot but doesn't make you feel awful if you need help.,1
"Pretty good class when he lectured and super helpful when you ask for more help. Pretty cool guy too, super passionate in general.",1
I didn't think he was as bad as people say he gives worksheets which are helpful and will explain anything you need to over again for sure it's a tough class tho and he is strict but he's pretty good,1
"Overall you could tell he cared about his students, but he was very strict about when we could ask questions, and got in 2 arguments with 2 different people in my class about that. To me kind of comes off as rude. Very tough grader, but there are a lot of opportunities for bonus points on the homework.",0
"her first test you are going to fail it, the rest of the tests are a breeze, i hated her class but now i love it!",1
Best professor ever! Easy class as long as you go and pay attention you see the material a million times and the final is cumulative,1
"Yoon loves the free market, but has done everything possible to avoid working in it.  Analysis are two dimensional and (worse) illogical.  If students were allowed to vote Yoon's free market principals he and his impossible to understand cohort would be out of a job.",0
She is the best! My favorite teacher by far. She gives homework but it's not hard. She is very helpful and wants her students to succeed. TAKE HER!!!!!,1
"Very knowledgeable and helpful, I could immediately tell she was a good professor from her reputation among upperclassmen, her tests only have 20 questions so you will have to do lots of practice problems to do well on them since the homework is usually easier than tests. Definitely recommend ATP for Chem 111.",1
"Dan capper is an awesome, down to earth teacher. His tests are absolutely killer and are the only reason I wouldnt take him again.",1
"She was boring, but the class was easy. I would not recommend her to anyone else, unless they want to pass out.",1
"The worst prof I've ever had. He's a good guy, but not college prof material. Doesn't thoroughly explain any part of his lectures, and if asked questions, doesn't fully answer them. His exams are quite tricky and nothing like study guides he provides. Quiz everyday, exam every 2/3 weeks, 20 page homework once/twice a week. Save your GPA and run!",0
"He's extremely condescending and rude. Makes TA babysit & write you up for everything you do during lectures, which are pointless to attend: he makes his own terminology for everything so it's not relevant in the real world. Entire grade is on 4 difficult exams. Don't email him or he will put you on blast for whatever the TA wrote about you.",0
"class is boring, but if you do the work and study you should get an A",1
Moshe does his best to teach difficult material. Goes through lectures fast. Study a lot for tests. There's a large group paper due at the end of the semester. Tests are fairly difficult but get curved. Assigned readings every lecture (optional but will really help you if you read and understand them before lecture),1
"Overall, a pretty good class. No exams, just short weekly papers where you analyze a case in regards to whatever ethical dilemma you are reading that week. Participation is a big part of the grade so make sure you show up and are ready to discuss. A final presentation on your own choice of a case at the end. Super easy and straightforward.",1
"Impossible to understand, manages to pinpoint the most boring piece/artist possible and talks about it/them for 40 minutes. (not that you can understand her anyway.) She is not a friendly or understanding person and the instructions she gives on assignments are somehow both unreasonably rigid and unclear. avoid if possible.",0
"LaPresto demands a lot of her students, which can seem intimidating to freshmen, but she truly cares about teaching, and will go out of her way to help students learn. A wonderful person!",1
"I don't have a huge issue with the teacher, but mostly the volume or work and the harshness of her grading. You could get all the answers right but still fail if your work isn't perfect. I also don't think she or her TAs realize how condescending they can be, which makes asking questions humiliating. This class and lab makes me miserable every day.",0
"Dr. Rhodes is one of the two best professors I have had at TCU. He will make you think critically . By no means is his class easy, and you have to read the case studies he provides, but if you pay attention and attend class, you will learn a ton. His lectures are very detailed and organized. He is helpful outside of class and full of wisdom.",1
"Dr. Daly's currently writing my recommendation letter, which I'll be submitting to law schools, so that in and of itself should give you a hint as to how helpful he is. Dr. Daly, in my opinion, is the broad tip to UB's English department. Would highly suggest enrolling in at least two classes with Daly if you want to boost your GPA and be educated.",1
"Very easy  class, 4 Essays and 1 group presentations. Lectures are very  boring , don't expect to watch modern movies very often, usually the movies in focus are black and white or from foreign countries. Easy A as long as your essays are good.",0
Very forgiving grader. Also a good storyteller,1
"Intro to Geology - ""ultra-liberal philosophy"" comment from before, not true.  Gives info, then shows info to back it up, allows for questions.  You'll do well in class, and like it!  Great teacher.  Kind of a hippie.. very effective.. 2 thumbs up.",1
"Il parle surtout d'histoires personnelles et de lui durant les cours, n'explique pas très bien et ne fait jamais d'expemples au tableau il fait simplement montrer le corrigé des exercices et commenter rapidement. Bref, je ne recommande pas ce prof!",0
"Very intrerested is seeing your progress throughout the class and wants to help you in a any way possible. Wasnt much to teach, just told us what to draw and thats what you did the whole time but very nice teacher! always happy!",1
I survived it.,0
"Great teacher. But, you shouldn't trust her. Be cautious when approaching.",1
Keating marks you down on EVERY error on a paper. It is impossible to get an A on a paper unless you have 0 errors. Very anal and controlling and wants things his way.,0
"Mrs. Padgett,is a wonderful professor, this is the second class I've taken with her, my first being online in high school. She is a tough grader, but you can always make it up. She is available for extra help at the high school she teaches at and she is willing to help those who do the work. So friendly, and super sweet, I just love her!!",1
Did not seem to show much enthusiasm in teaching her class and gives large amounts of homework with out properly explaining the lessons clearly.,0
"There are weekly essays (which can get kind of tedious/annoying) and group discussion. He doesn't give any feedback but I've managed to get As in every paper & discussion. For honors, the cutoff for an A is a 94, but, if you try & write well, there should be no issue.",1
"The way he teaches can be confusing at times, but otherwise the class is fairly easy. Go to office hours to ask questions, he cares a lot about his student's success. 5 Homework is worth 15% (drops lowest), 3 Exams 60%, and Final exam 25%. Use his workbook, it has questions that will help you study.",1
"What an icon! She is known as the ""theatre mom figure"" around campus for a reason. She is the definition of caring, compassionate, and laid-back but passionate about what she does. You'll learn a LOT of valuable information, just be prepared to do a lot of homework.",1
"Lots of homework, lots of class participation. YOU NEED TO SHOW UP FOR CLASS",1
"You will learn more about colonization from reading Bartolome de las Casas' ""Brief Account of the Devastation of the Indies,"" than you will from this entire class. He spends about 90% of the time justifying the European colonizers and how it wasn't that bad. Only refers to native/aboriginal/indigenous people as ""Indians."" Calls slaves ""workers.""",0
Professor Nobiletti is very passionate about American history. He brings in current events and films into the class. He has a lot of energy and is very inspiring. This is not the boring history class you took in high school. Be prepared to see the past in a new an interesting way. You will learn about cultural history.,1
"I'll start off by syaing that she is a very nice person, but a terrible teacher. She does know Social Work, but is very very unorganized. She also takes forever to get around to grading. The class is easy but she seems to not really have a game plan going into it.",0
Grades are due in 5 days... she hasn't graded anything in over 3 months. You'll be expected to write huge summaries on topics that are barely a paragraph long (usually 3 huge summaries per chapter). She doesn't answer her emails either. She allows rewrites if you want a better grade... too bad she hasn't graded the original paper yet. 4/10,0
Great prof!,1
"She is so bad. Doesn't teach you anything, if you don't know how to do makeup or sew youre on your own. You learn mostly through videos that are 15 + years old, and if you do something wrong its always your fault because you didn't pay attention. She treats her students like crap. If she continues to work here, the students will suffer even more.",0
"Deep down, I think Marmarelli means well, but his JRN205 class was so boring. He loves to lecture and go on tangents for hours on end. The class was easy, and I ended with an A but I almost fell asleep everyday.",0
"I had to take Hon's class at 8:05am, which i wasn't looking forward too. Hon is such a good professor thought hat within 10 minutes of our 2 hours block (twice a week i might add) i was awake alert and participating. Hes great, his essays are short, and he is really helpful and smart. He is definitely the professor to take for 220!!!",1
"Basically tests you on specific little things he says in class; syllabus is not clear at all and does not correspond with the textbook. The tests and quizzes are SO hard, despite the fact that he tells you what each question is about. Be prepared to study a lot",0
Worst teacher ever. Somebody needs to fire her! She needs to mind her own business!,0
"I had Jill for my clinical instructor. She is amazing! She is extremely knowledgeable, she goes out of her way to make sure you are learning, not just going through the motions. She is always quizzing you to make sure you are getting it. And she's cute :) I grew a lot as a nurse because of her.",1
"My favorite professor I've ever had! This class was so interesting and educational. You DO have to show up because you won't pass the exams if you don't have good notes, but honestly I was *excited* to go to his class. There is a reason Jorgen is rated good; he is passionate, honest, and inspiring.",1
"He could speak louder and clearer, we barely could hear him from the back. But overall, he's a good a teacher and not a tough grader.",1
"Nice man, bad teacher. His exams hardly matched his slides or lectures.",0
Dr. Kennedy is a chemistry nerd more so than a teacher. He sometimes expects you to understand things as easily as he does or thinks you should. He is a really nice guy and fair grader.,1
Best teacher at the LAC. Makes every class interesting. Knows his material well. Definetly take him if you get a chance!,1
"Definite GPA booster for me, can get 100% on online labs (MC Q's) if you compare answers with ppl. 3% survey bonus marks. Lots of recommended readings, but I barely did any of it (~5-6 pages altogether) and got 95%. Focus on online notes, learning obj, and video questions. Use textbook for reference, or when smthing is explicitly mentioned to know.",1
"Awesome guy, really cares about the subject matter.",1
He doesnt have a good online class system.,1
Best professor ever,1
"I loved Kate! She was very supportive and professional, as well as very realistic about what it's like to be a professional actor. She really helps you to grow and have a deeper understanding of what you're doing and how to improve. As long as you show up and participate you're going to do well. Would 100% recommend this class!",1
"Great professor, but grades slightly harshly. Gives really good feedback. Also a very sweet person.",1
"Pops was great. He is clear and gives plenty of good examples. If you still don't understand the material, he will walk you through it during his office hours. If you show up and do the work, you will get the learning experience you paid for. He is also one of the funniest instructors I have met.",1
"Dr. Guttmann is an amazing professor, hes tough but fair and is intensely passionate about economics and makes the sometimes dismal science truly fascinating He inspired me to pursue my masters in Econ.i learned more in a semester from this man than I did my entire 4 years at hof. Highly recommend, as tough as it may be you will learn a lot.",1
"Worst teacher I've had in my 5 years of college, 3 years at UCD and my 2 years at FRCC. Really regret not looking the teacher up first considering all these horrible (and accurate) reviews.",0
Excellent professor!! Passionate about his teachings and willing to help any student :),1
Do NOT take this Professor!!! He is passionless and does NOT teach well. You will sit for literally 2 hours in a ZOOM class and listen to the MOST boring lectures... on top of that he does NOT follow logic and is a VERY tough grader... he approaches religious teaching in a bizarre scientific or philosophical way and not how it actually is...,0
"Dr. Sheridan is awesome! I'm not even a history major, but showed up to every class because I liked it that much. He's super knowledgeable. If you are a history major, I'd definitely recommend. If you're just looking for a easy class - Sheridan will definitely make you work, but it's doable. Just show up and do what he asks.",1
Gives really good lectures but the test will hurt you.,0
"Dr. Huss was my academic advisor. While I never had the privilege of taking one of his classes, I did attend some of his supplemental lectures and must say he is hilarious, informative, and really has a great way of connecting with the student!",1
"do not take this class I repeat do not take this if he is the instructor , really horrible grader , doesn't try to help, talks around the point and can never be straight forward.",0
"One of the greatest teachers I've ever had. She is inspiring, extremely knowledgeable, and caring. She sees students who have potential and pushes them further. She is available almost always and willing to answer questions. Dr. Murphy is extremely humble, smart, and gives you the right tools to succeed.",1
"First time it calc 3 for econ was offered at Northeastern. Prof. Gaffney really means well, however the way he teaches the course will ruin you if you are not a genius. He dives into anything he wants to and takes examples straight out of textbook. No fluidity in what he teaches. He is helpful with office hours. 15 kids started, 7 finished course",0
"The only way I passed this class was by getting a tutor and that is saying something because I've never needed a math tutor before.  He goes off-topic constantly and students at least once per lecture have to correct his math mistakes.  He is very lenient with giving partial credit, even so many people fail due to his confusing explanations.",0
"Dr. Zant's SOC100 class was the most dull class I've ever had to attend. Mr. Zant had no lecture slides and instead just talked freely from the book, because of this, the tests are difficult to say the least. If you have to take his section, use it as a study hall. Don't ditch, you get 6 points of extra credit if you go to every class.",0
"Rodd never failed to make the course harder than it should be. Good luck ever reaching out for help because 100% of the time your question is answered back with a question, or a simple ""there is something wrong with your code."" Rodd is a poor excuse for a professor and was reported to higher ups multiple times this semester alone for his laziness.",0
Avoid. You will lose interest in the course on the first day. Cannot present information effectively and always gives off the impression that he does not have a clue about what he is talking about. Does not belong teaching an upper level course. Attendance is mandatory with a sign in sheet. Tests are fill in the blank with word banks. Avoid.,0
"Dr. Bricker is the worse professor I've ever encountered. She has no respect for students, makes them feel dumb, and actually called our class of 120+ students ""stupid"" multiple times. She was the only teacher for this course, but if you can, DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE",0
okay,1
Very cool professor- very liberal. Knows a LOT about the subject matter. Studies affirmative action. He just needs to speak louder in class- he has a lullaby type voice. But he is good. You will learn a lot in any of his classes. Definitely recommend him. Brings other perspectives into the class and holds time for valuable discussion.,1
He is a very hard teacher. His notes are a very dumbed down version of his tests.  The tests are all 2 or 3 questions.  I never used the textbook because he gave us all his notes and we were allowed to use them on tests.  Do not think that the notes will help and make sure you study to pass. HUGE curves on tests and quizzes.,1
"Best math teacher at LC! He is very in-depth (sometimes too much and you'll zone one a bit) but he is funny, young and relatable. Kept an A in his class all semester.",1
"Offered upwards of 6% Ex Cr. 7 Homeworks 23%. 4 Exams (65%) Most curved. Easy class as far as getting the points, he gives you huge study guides for the tests. The bad part is even if you're interested in Astronomy he's so monotone and non-interactive with the class that most people are falling asleep. Really unfortunate if you like this stuff.",1
All over the place. Never really talks about assignments in class. Confusing. Goes off track and on rants. Gets irritated when no one participates but makes no effort to engage anyone that doesnt have an interest in the niche material.,0
Bill knows what he is doing. He's a much more laid-back Life drawing professor than a drawing I or II prof. Sometimes he gets too into talking with people that he doesn't get to everyone person. Overall he is very willing to help and talk to you about your drawing.,1
"Avoid if possible. Hard to understand, contradicts herself/book/PowerPoint. Quiz questions not always clear and/or answer contradicts book. Only reason to attend class is extra credit and find out what is happening the next day. Otherwise, no need to attend because you won't learn anything from her. Just read book and PP online.",0
It's really easy to get an A in his class and the exams are not difficult.,0
"He is a pretty good prof. He's funny and breaks the content down well. I've taken two accounting courses so far, and he was my prof for the first one. My second prof was horrible and really made me appreciate how well Haroon taught. The midterm was fair, not too hard. But the final was really difficult. Would still recommend him though.",1
Dr. Vohs is a great teacher. He does his best to explain concepts and make chem easy to understand. His tests are reasonable. He is definately the chem teacher to take,1
"He rambles a lot and tries to be funny, but doesn't really succeed. Not the worst prof in the world, but i found his class boring.",0
"Bobs class was a lot of fun! He teaches above and beyond the basic tools of acting. He is very enlightening and enthusiastic about his work. He does choose favorites but as long as you are not a worthless slacker and attend class and are polite and considerate, you will probably be one of them.",1
"By far the sweetest woman I've met here, absolutely love her class",1
"Easy course but she's picky. Her t/f questions, it's like she tries to throw u off on purpose. She'll say one thing and say another...blah...go every other day but no need to go all the time...",0
"This professor is awful. Her lectures vs. her homeworks/worksheets vs. her textbooks are completely off. She teaches you like she expects you to know what is already going on, and she can't be bothered with questions. The only good thing about this class is that it's a ""free class"" meaning you don't have to buy a textbook.",0
"Extremely boring lectures. He would just read his slides, make some sound effects, and attempt to joke. He's a terrible grader, as even correct answers, with the same info from his slides, is marked wrong. Never replied to emails, hard to reach in general. Told us to study notes during the quarantine and then disappeared. Not worth paying $2k+ for.",0
"Dr. Keeling is obviously knowledgable about toys and games.. but she changed the topic of the class after registration from a topic I was interested into toys so I went from being really interested into the class to not. She is an okay grader for papers, but a lot of the class is busy work. Participate lots bc its part of your grade.",0
Jennifer is rude to her students for no apparent reason. It makes learning very difficult.,0
Awesome prof.  Has a plethora of real world knowledge that she incorporates into her lectures. Keeps lectures to the point and offers real world examples.,1
"A substantial amount of effort is required to pass this class. The problem is that the resources available do not match up. Online homework (ExpertTA) is complete garbage. Practice, Homework and Quizzes do not match each other, nor do they match the lecture. ExpertTA tells me ""wrong answer."" Ok. Why? Give me something for Christ's sake.",0
"Only problem I had with her is that she locks the door the minute class begins, but if she teaches that same class at another time, she'll let you sit in. The answers to her assignments are right in her lectures and the videos she puts on, and her projects are relatively easy as well. Plain and simple, just get to class on time.",1
"Worst course I've ever taken. The midterm focused on minute details and heavy points for each essay question. Average was a D. She seemed ok with it though..but it's not ok. With the final, similar deal, except minute details were on the multiple choice. Avoid if possible, don't take this class.. Boring and difficult and it just didn't need to be.",0
"Great facilitator... makes you think.  Very fair.  Entertaining, funny, witty, and knowledgeable",1
"I didn't love her. With COVID especially she didn't have grace for students, was pretty unmoving, hard to get a hold of. She's nice. She's very intelligent and knowledgeable. She focused on weird subjects that didn't really get covered by other course content from GCU. She was fine in person, but I didn't enjoy her with blended learning.",0
"I learned so much in this class, be prepared to spend a good 2 hours per day on this class if you want a good grade. I worked full time while taking this class and it was a nightmare. READ THE CHAPTER BEFORE YOU COME TO LECTURE, it won't seem like she's going as fast and her ideas will be much clearer.",1
"Never attended lecture, she put all of her notes on Gauchospace. She posted both a practice final and midterm which were pretty difficult, but were excellent in preparing you for her tests. If you know those practice tests you'll definitely have success in this class",1
I would not recommend taking this guy. He has a ton of homework which is by no means easy for a basic level class. His labs have absolutely nothing to do with what your doing in the homework and test. There was a ton a work to get done and not enough time to do anything. I wouldnt recommend anyone taking this guy for anything ever.,0
"Awesome professor!! Would take her again if I could. She explains everything you need to know for the exams very well. Makes you work for your grade and will not give you a ""A-,"" even if you had an A the whole semester. I ended up with a B+, though I believed I should have gotten an A. Awesome teacher overall!!",1
Ben has a knack for his subject and a great way of teaching it. He'll always make time to help you as well. Absolutely recommend!,1
"Shes a nice lady but not a good teacher. I felt time was wasted going to class because the chance of learning something that I can apply towards the exams were 50%. If you do the study guide early and study, the exams are easy. I never did one hw assignment and did poor on tests and got a C. If I actually tried, getting an A would have been easy.",1
"Great Professor, and very helpful. Will take time to slow things down so everyone can understand it. Also believes in collaborative learning, so he allows you to work with a partner even on some test.",1
"Súper unorganized!! He says everything is online yet not even he can find his stuff on the folders he adds online. This class is NOT for people who are bad at math. He teaches as if everyone knew what he is talking about. He says homework is not mandatory but he will take it as extra credit. He won't. Also, he's never in his office or replies email",0
"While a nice enough guy, Professor Bullock makes it extremely difficult to get any grade above a B. That being said, I was able to write all of my papers early in the term and because of that did not have any homework for the second half of the term. He genuinely cares about his students, but be prepared to sit through extremely boring lectures.",1
Not many points in the class but the assignments are meant to pad your grade. She is very sweet and will accommodate you when needed. Will answer any questions and appreciates opinions and on-topic discussions in class- will even take time to talk about hot topics on GVSU and current events. Go to class bc she has 6 in-class writing assignments.,1
"She is really nice and really cares. Her lectures were pretty good, but there weren't many of them. I hate public speaking so this class was really hard from me, but there was also a ton of homework. The homework was a lot of work and seemed unnecessary.",1
The comments are a bit distressing becaus he doesn't really know what he is talking about.,0
"She's patient and is straightforward with the class. If you need help you can find her. ME classes are never easy so of course it's not an easy A. And of course she's VERY!!! attractive, not that effects learning, but hey it makes classy way easier to get through on tough days",1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, with an unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. 1/10 from me",0
"Course wasn't that difficult, but it was really demanding. 5 projects, which are easy, but instructions are kind of indirect. There's rubrics, but they don't help much. Quite a talker, too. By week 3 I was really irritated with the aggressive lecture method. Extremely nice woman, just a bit excessive at times. Course does help in the real world.",1
"Dr. Watts is a very kind, passionate professor who wants students to develop and advance their writing skills. It was a joy to take her class. She introduced interesting lecture topics and encouraged classroom discussions.",1
"Asks you to show up to class everyday but his power points were word-for-word from the text book. I ended up just finishing up the course from home and still managed to get an A, but he does reward points for showing up.",0
"I have taken both Pre-Calc and Linear Algebra with Shea and he is a great professor. He is a fair grader and a clear teacher. You will probably have trouble if you are not math-minded though, as he does not speak down to the students in class; however, he is very open to helping students of every level in his office hours.",1
"Fun class. You'll learn a lot about the constitution, and class sessions are fairly engaging. Attendance is worth 5% to your grade, so it's definitely worth it to go. Not too much writing, but enough to keep you busy.",1
"I'm very surprised to see so many low ratings.  I had Rachana for Shakespeare, and man was it fun!  (As a business major who hates Shakespeare, that says a lot.)  She was not a particularly hard grader, the skits/presentations were fun, and the field trip to D.C. was a blast.  Nothing funnier than Sachdev getting a little tipsy at dinner.",1
"Most unclear prof ever, lectures are interesting but they have nothing to do with the course. make sure you read the text book and have a good group for the project",0
"The workload is intensive, but I got a lot out of this class. The lectures are really intriguing but there is a lot packed into each one, so don't hesitate to stop by his office hours to flesh out ideas. The reading and lecture material was engrossing, and Professor Saler himself is very personable and talkative. Highly recommend.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ANYTHING! YOU CAN NOT, I REPEAT, CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HIM, AND HE IS USELESS WITH COMMUNICATION. HORRIBLE GRADING, HORRIBLE SPEECH, HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE...OH YEAH....HORRIBLE.",0
Prof. Cutler had done nothing to help her class. half the people dropped out after the first exam and lies about what will be on quizzes. She does an awful job at explain questions that students have. It seems as though she is setting her students up for failure. I would NOT take this ever again with her.,0
"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test. A doctors note from the ER was not enough for him to allow me to retake this exam. I spoke with the dean on this matter and applied for a grade appeal. I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",0
"I LOVE HISTORY. Prof Homzy makes you work very hard for an A, but as I said, I love history and didn't mind working very hard for mine. It could have been easier regarding moodle, etc, when we didn't get info early enough to study for our weekly exam. I was happy that there was no pressure at the end of the semestre. All in all, a great teacher!",1
"Professor Celli is one of the nicest teachers I have had at UD. She makes the class interesting and as fun as possible and you can tell she really wants people to do well. If you come to class, participate and do the work the class is very manageable.",1
"only took it because I was required to. He tries to be funny and wastes 15+ minutes talking about Ester. It was very religious-based, almost everything was tied to God in some way, even though sociology is not religious.",0
"I love this professor! I took her summer nutrition class and it was a breeze. The course had a normal amount of homework, nothing that takes to long to do. Just do the work and you will do great! She is very quick to respond to emails and cares a lot about her students. I would definitely take her again!",1
"Go to class. Her exam content is split up fairly amongst lecture notes, textbook readings and custom reading package. There's no other way around her exams. You have to know all the information from all three areas or you will severely lose marks. One question can be up to 6 marks, and there are many of those in her exams.",0
"Worst teacher I've had at JMU so far. Super uptight about a gen ed, has strict rules on her syllabus, test is 75% of your grade, boring lectures, only handwrites few words/notes so you have to pay attention in class, and it took her 6 days to reply to an email. also doesn't let you see your overall grade on canvas. AVOID HER AT ALL COST.",0
"Lower level (100-200) then she is a good prof-easy grader. BUT, if you are looking to take her for any upper level courses DON""T AVOID IF POSSIBLE!!!! Upper level course work seems to be above her teaching level and grading and expectations become unrealistic. Assignment expectations unclear and grading is very SUBJECTIVE.",0
"Absolutely awful. All he talks about is how academia and the legal profession is left of center. This constant refrain only makes him look insecure and weak. Frankly, if he'd focus on the facts, the truth would be clear. Stop telling us how great you are, its unbecoming.",0
Professor Smith is an exceptional instructor. I really enjoyed his class completing the communication assignments.,1
"Professor Reifler is a nice guy, but he gives way too much work. A bunch of people in my class dropped it because of the workload. Get ready for hundreds of pages of reading at a time because he puts all material on the tests. Very picky when grading essays too.",0
"She was by far the worst professor I have ever had. She never answered my emails, never answered student questions, and her lectures were so incredibly boring. I had to drop the class halfway through because how terrible it was and how horrible of a professor she was. I would HIGHLY recommend changing sections ASAP!",0
"The whole class is based off of keynotes and he doesn't put them online. His tests are impossible and gives study guides but a lot of the material isn't even on the exam. The notes you take from the keynotes in class aren't on the exam most of the time either. Nice guy, but his class is ridiculous.",0
"I like that Dr. Byerwalter posts her lectures on the online course. It makes learning the material easier. (And worth it.) Discussion boards for online classes are pretty simple, just one post a week (as long as it fits her criteria) will get you an A. (Make sure it's a good post though.)",1
Grade was comprised mostly of quizzes and lab reports. Liu did a good job explaining the material in class and also gave a bunch of hints as to what to study for the quizzes,1
PLEASE TAKE THIS TEACHER FOR LECTURE!! Her review sheets are exactly like the actually test and lets you know what is exactly on the test. Straight forward & explains everything to simple terms.,1
"I really enjoyed Dr. McCullough's class. Some of her rules may seem a little strict, but she's nice. Everything was well organized and straightforward. Assignments were fairly easy and quick. You're allowed an index card for a cheat sheet for each exam.",1
"Worst teacher I've ever had. If he asks you a question and you don't know the answer, he doesn't help to explain the answer. Quizzes every Tuesday that are difficult and quizzes are 50% of the grade.",0
"- first few classes emphasizes on the historical background of finance.  - need to write 2 long essays and several reflections - very late with handing back quizzes and essays. - lecture is very unorganized - lecture is hard to follow. lots of digression.  - final is hard, midterm is substituted with several mini quizzes.   DO NOT TAKE THIS",0
she is unclear and always expect you do things at last minute notice like it is impossible for someone to make a good grade in her class,0
"DO NOT TAKE!! If you expect to be taught the fundamentals in this intro course then do not take this class with this professor. He doesn't teach. 3/4 of my class dropped him including myself. Knowledgeable and nice person, but he is a terrible teacher.",0
"You will have to buy 9 books for this class, and she might add more if she feels like it. Very unclear about most things she says. Syllabus has been rewritten 3 times and NONE of them have any grading criteria on it. Some papers are 7-8pgs for an INTRO class. SHE DOES NOT USE CANVAS. You won't know ur grade and she probably doesn't know it either",0
"Great professor. Cares about his students and never got frustrated with students who were confused. The class was hard, but that wasn't on him. Lectures were incredibly clear and helpful. He was also very organized. Would definitely recommend.",1
"Never explains his notes, reply to your email with at most 20 words, arrogant and funny(in a bad way), I think this is the worst prof I have ever seen.",0
"I'm really unsure why people gave him such good reviews. He's a great guy, horrible professor. He only puts up 4 or 5 grades a semester and 4 of them are tests. He teaches his 101 class like a 300 class and goes way too deep into geography. He doesn't teach what Geography 101 warrants. He's also incredibly monotone and difficult to listen to.",0
"morgan is a great professor, his tests are based off what he goes over in class. he outlines everything important on the board, so be ready to take good notes and study them. very possible to get an A. he is also very helpful if you have any questions. definitely would recommend him!",1
"One of the worst professors/teachers I've ever had. Sarcastic, rude, and condescending. Tough grader but also takes a long time to post grades so it's hard to know how well you're doing. Do not take her class unless you have to.",0
Great teacher. Makes math not so boring. Sound just like the guy on King of the Hill. Tons of homework but that is what made me get a good grade. Very willing to help. Does not talk down to you like some teachers and will help till you understand. Taking him again.,1
"He's a good professor. Gives a lot of extra credit for students who are struggling in class. The exams can be tough so the extra credit really helps out. He is a cool professor, really makes the class interesting. His lectures are long and can be boring but he tries to make them as interesting as possible. ",1
She continuously ridiculed us calling us stupid.  She even mentioned that she can't teach math when most of the problems involve some kind of math and she said that she should probably be able to do the chemistry problems.  She is the worst prof. I have ever had and I would not recommend her.,0
"EASIEST CLASS EVER!! Take her, she is an easy grader and very supportive. As long as you do the work she is asking from you (which is never a lot) you will definitely pass.",1
I thought this class was very difficult in terms of exam preparation and quizzes. Its a lot of notes and nothing but power point lectures. Dr. Moore was nice but I thought her teaching style was not great. In my opinion they didnt seem to care if you passed the class and there wasnt great exam averages.,0
One of my favorite professor at Cal Poly Pomona. Really enjoyed his lectures. Gives out weekly homework and gives alot of extra credit opportunity to boost grades up. 3 test. 1 project. I reccomend taking his class,1
Bus 101 has a free online textbook. Somewhat strict grader.,1
"The guy is totally opinionated, unfair, and looks at you like you are unworthy to be in his presence. Went to him for help frequently and I didn't get much out of it. 2 tests, 2 papers, and participation. After the first 40%, i was only at a C and he told me that was pretty much my grade for the semester. Meyer respelled is MISTAKE. Don't take him!",0
Basic writing class. Five essays. Flexible,1
"I took 206 and 201 with Al and I've never felt so lost during a class. I took the Ferris equivalencies of these classes and learned more in one class period than I did in an entire semester with Al. His tests don't line up with the test materials because his book is older than the one he assigns for the class, so you're set up to fail.",0
"One thing you have to understand before you take paul's class- especially CPS- he gives you freedom to figure out your own path. He gives unspecific critiques because he doesn't want to pigeon-hole people into his way of thinking. If you pay attention in class, and like to be stretched at to think for yourself, he is amazing.",1
"Quite simply, best English professor I've had at UD. There's a lot of group work so you get to know your classmates and the lectures are AMAZING. He certainly sparked my creativity. Reading selections are good and I would recommend getting involved in the class discussions. Not an easy grader, but not overly tough either. Truly great professor.",1
"Awful teacher, gives way too vague prompts for essays and doesn't hand back graded ones until way after the next one is due, It could be months past the first essay and you still will not have it back, also assigns homeowork late at night due he next day in the morning",0
"Patty definitely does love the subject she teaches, and is a very nice person.  However, her classes are very dull and boring, and usually cover material that never appears on tests.  Her marking is also really hard! I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs!",0
Homework has barely anything to do with lecture and it takes forever. His lectures will put you to sleep. Tests come from his lectures. The tests are group tests and still very difficult.,0
"I had Miller fall 2020, everything was online. The lectures were long and manageable. He also assigns documentaries and a LOT of news articles. I had to read 50+ news articles for the final and 80% of the questions on the final were about those. DONT DISREGARD THE ARTICLES",1
The lecture was good. Just don't miss the class.,0
"Another great instructor for the AJ program, I agree with others, he should teach more. Gangs class is very easy if you attend class and do the term paper and oral, which is easy!! Adds LBPD experience and even guest speakers. Classes are fun and usually go by pretty fast with the mix of power-point, videos and speakers.",1
"too much work, and assignments are not as inspiring as she believes",0
I've taken Krutz in the past and always enjoyed his classes so nothing against him. Learned essentially nothing in this class though.,1
"Orgo is awful to begin with. You never use the book and theres occasionally a quiz on a friday. Almost all points come from exams, which are crazy hard. Get ready to dedicate your life to orgo. Somewhat helpful in office hours.",0
"Go to class and you will be fine for the test, most of everyone gets a B. He drops your lowest test score and doesn't make chapter quizzes due until the last week of school.",1
"There is a fair amount of reading.Show up,be attentive, read,study,and think!  He is an awesome teacher and you're going to learn a lot.  If you're interested in IB-ing this is an essential starter class;it set's the stage for understanding the intricacies of the field.",1
"Walsh is a funny guy and he makes the information suck less. His test are easy and the class is relaxed. I would take him again because he's a good elective class to have. His homework assignments do suck though, they are due at odd times and they can be tedious.",0
Excellent class I tried to take his following class but it was full.,1
"Honestly, the only thing that really killed me was the final. There was so much information to study it was unrealistic. The teacher seemed really nice, though It was an online class so it's hard to really tell. But yeah, there's a lot of reading and a lot of information. Don't think I would recommend it.",0
"Prof Billett is awesome!! If you have to take this class, I highly recommend him! Even though he takes attendance every class, he keeps it interesting and is funny. Plus the class is super easy!",1
"knowledgable on the subject of econ, but is a terrible teacher. She is extremely disconnected from the class. She is open about using trick questions in her tests. Online assignments are hardly ever assigned, but worth 20% of your grade. I missed 2 on the first day of class and my grade has suffered 18% (86%-68%). Mid semester and still recovering.",0
"Nina is nice, but she cancels class a lot, barely teaches you anything about writing, very disorganized, and still expects good writings from you. I just feel frustrated about this class because there's no helpful feedback from Nina to improve my writing. I haven't gotten any feedback from my first writing draft YET. And it's May already.",0
"AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS. I took this class after taking advanced math all throughout high school hoping it would just be a refresher and now I'm failing. Welling does not give notes, doesn't give real assignments, and expects you to know everything for tests despite not teaching. Impossible grader. Only online quizzes and homework.",0
"His lectures will put you to sleep within five minutes. Coursework is easy but time-consuming because he's so nit picky. Disorganized and looks for ways to cut points. Penalizes heavily for insignificant mistakes, and claims that's how the real world works. Seems to think students are stupid. Overly critical and just downright awkward. AVOID.",0
Class discussions were good. Deadlines are not flexible unless you ask ahead.,1
She gives a lot of homework. Doesn't open the homework at the end of the  Semester. Grades that's worth no percentage drops your grades the most.,0
"Worst professor I have ever taken. You are expected to read a 2000 page book 3 times through. He does not teach, he only goes over homework problems in class and then tells you how dumb you are if you get it wrong instead of helping understand. He slams everyone with the exams, after not having taught anything to us. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
Steve makes it clear he doesnt like Trump but his lectures are still fact based. He is very condescending and does not like running start students. He is a VERY hard grader on the mid term and final which are both essay style answers. Theres is only one discussion post a week which are a little difficult but graded on completion.,0
"Amazing professor! This was the easiest class of my life. An easy A for sure and you really learn a lot from this professor who is amazing. We had two short presentations and a final paper and that was it! Make sure to go to class, but you don't have to read any of the books or anything. Just show up and thats enough!",1
"Steve's awesome.  Very clear on what he wants, more than willing to help out.  Wish I could take him for all my ACC classes.  High recommendation",1
Nordling is a very hard professor. His tests are unpassable. He only gives three grades if you mess up one your done. He doesn't tell students what to study or even give hints he just says study the entire first six weeks. If at all possible do not take him.,0
He has a very funny humor but class is ridiculously hard. Is test are almost impossible to pass if you don't already have a clue about history and your grade is straight test. maybe 1 extra assignment. Also takes forever to reply back to you. I looked at his ratings and noticed they were high so that's why I took him and regret it,0
A genuinely great teacher. Has the best sense of humor any mathematician has ever had. Makes retardedly hard math bearable. I wish I'd taken more classes with him. Nice guy to boot.,1
Only have 4 in class essays to do and 10 optional experience points. Attendance is mandatory you can not miss one day or your marked down. Also a very hard grader! the average grades are C+ on papers and thats even when you write a thesis with 3 examples and a conclusion with a so what.,0
This class was not what I expected. this teacher is all about journalism and he should stick with that only. MCOM 63 was about new media and all we did were videos. very disappointing class. He's helpful when one on one but very rude if its in front of the class. take a different teacher for MCOM 63,0
He was late to class often and did not apologize.,0
Dr.Rumenik is a very nice woman. She creates an outline for each lecture that you can access and print off from blackboard. She grades tests VERY quickly. EXTREMELY helpful during tests if you have questions. Fairly easy tests if you study. I had her for sociology and psychology.,1
Try to be helpful but can always brought in the same note from his previous semesters.,0
"Online Class While I've had harder classes, I've never had a more useless teacher. He does nothing to contribute to the class and gives zero feedback on the assignments. If you state your opinion in the discussion board, you get an F for that week. If you feel like self teaching, go for it. Otherwise avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"She is so disorganized that she can only really function on a very surface level; she is constantly late to class, she changes lecture subjects willy-nilly in the middle of classes, she's a scatter-brained, disorganized grader, and she writes her assignments incredibly vaguely. She can barely plan 10 minutes ahead, let alone a whole class.",0
"Rodgers was off topic almost 100% of the time. When it came to tests/quizzes you were never fully prepared. He never explained anything well, and when you asked him a question he would answer it with another question. I would not suggest you take his class.",0
He was a very nice professor always ready to help his students. He genuinely cared about the well being of the students during this hard time and he always tried his best to simplify things down for students. Office hours are very helpful attend them.,1
"Dr. Mueller employs a workgroup, experience based, workbook method in Ochem. It does not work. He doesn't teach. The class is absurd. I am getting an A in the class but only because I study the book and other professors notes. You do not learn much in class. He also comes over quite arrogant.",0
He's the best instructor I've ever come across. He is very passionate about what he does and cares about each person. He's entertaining and is more than willing to help any time you need it. He's extremely knowledgeable when it comes to music. A great guy.,1
"Trombley is the worst teacher I have experienced. I was having a major surgery on the day a test was given. I asked if I could redo the test, but she informed me that he doesn't give redo's. I told her my situation, and all she said was you should have scheduled it another day. I scheduled this months before signing up for this class. Unforgiving.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. His method of ""teaching"" was awful, as he expected us to know how to do everything and didn't really teach. Upon emailing him and asking him about my grade in the class because the grades were not posted to canvas, he insisted i consult his website which was an external site from canvas. Would not tell me midterm grad",0
"He knows the materials and he knows them well. I don't know if he's helpful in his office or not, but the lecture comes right of his head. Makes small mistakes at times. READ the book at least once before or after the lecture. DO the homework and sample quizzes and tests and you should be fine.",1
"This is an easy class, and you don't really need the book.  Online tests are simple and you can take them like 8 times, so you're guaranteed to pass.  It's moderately interesting, but sometimes Nelson can be spacey.  He's sometimes entertaining though.  All in all, it's a class worth taking, but bring something to do.",1
"She doesn't assign a lot of work, but she's     picky about grading.",0
"Fair enough, he's a nice guy but the contents of the course are BS. This class disguises religion as philosophy, and you need to treat myths like credible facts. There's a ton of reading and it's very difficult. he's a very tough grader on the in class writing, and the exam is brutal because i felt completely underprepared for it. not recommended!",0
he's got a great sense of humor but he doesn't need to explain as much as he did.,1
